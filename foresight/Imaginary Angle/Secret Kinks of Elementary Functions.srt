00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
When I was in school, I wondered, like many others, what happens in between the different

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,040
forms of graphs of elementary functions. How does this become this, become this, or become this?

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,760
And what's the deal with the Pac-Man-like behavior around division by zero?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,960
It made no sense to me that these wildly different shapes and features have nothing to do with each

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,960
other. There had to be some hidden metamorphosis between the integer powers. And there was,

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,760
extending the domain and range of these functions to complex numbers does give us a much deeper

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,560
insight, but we no longer have the luxury of graphing two values against each other in two

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,480
dimensions. We're stuck with either abstract algebraic answers, or slices of the story akin

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,920
to taking x-ray images of a cocoon caterpillar turning into a butterfly. I was never quite

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,040
satisfied with that, so today's video will be taking a somewhat unorthodox approach

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,560
to indulge the intuition of my younger self. We'll introduce complex arithmetic as it's needed,

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,360
and draw almost everything in glorious uncomplicated duty. The goal is to watch the wings of the

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:17,600
butterfly form and grow. I hope you enjoy. Let's first just see what happens if we start with

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,520
f of x equals x, the simplest possible linear graph, make the first power of x explicit,

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,840
and vary that power up to two in discrete steps. The negative side seems to be jumping up and down

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,640
and disappearing in between. Let's look at a few specific examples. For x to the power of one and

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,120
a half, we only get a graph in the first quadrant, where both x and f of x are positive. Both the

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,120
domain and range of this function are real numbers greater than or equal to zero. This is because

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,440
x to the power of one and a half is actually x to three halves, which is a square root of x cubed.

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,760
For negative values of x, x cubed will be negative, and when that negative ends up under a square

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,720
root, there won't be any real value dancers. So right off the bat, half of our shape is missing.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,360
In this case, we can still recover it because it's just the other square root, there are always two.

23
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,480
We can get both by treating our expression as an equation instead of as a function.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,240
We'll write y equals square root of x cubed, and then square both sides. That gives us y squared

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,560
equals x cubed, and the graph looks like this. It's just the piece we've already had reflected

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,400
about the x-axis. Let's just take that as it is and move on. What about x to 1.4? Again, we make

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,480
sense of this by turning the exponent into a fraction, in this case 14 over 10, that simplifies

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,760
to seven over five, which makes f of x the fifth root of x to the seventh power. The power under

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,680
the root is odd, so it can yield a negative, but that's okay since the degree of root is also odd,

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,320
and we just get negative results out. We also don't have to deal with multiple roots since

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,160
there is only one odd degree root of a number in the reels. This shape does look like a slightly

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,920
bent line, an intermediary step on the way to a parabola, but the left side doesn't look like it

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:26,320
has any intention of bending upwards. Let's keep exploring. What happens at x to 1.6? That's 16 over

34
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,440
10 or 8 over 5. So same story with the odd degree root, negatives are allowed, but this time it doesn't

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,600
really matter since under the root we are raising all numbers to an even power, 8, making them always

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,800
positive. That gives us a shape similar to a parabola, but it came out of the blue without

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,240
following any pattern from the shapes we've seen before. So there isn't really a smooth transition

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,720
between the first and the second power. The negative arm of the graph jumps erratically

39
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
between the three remaining quadrants. And we didn't even try to plug in an irrational power,

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
that's a whole other can of worms we won't be opening today.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,760
Why is this so messy? And why is all the mess happening when x takes on negative values?

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,200
It turns out that negativeness is a part of a much bigger story where numbers can shoot off

43
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,800
not just away from each other relative to zero, but in all other directions too. I have a whole

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,600
video about that, a link should pop up in the top right corner, and it's also available in the

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,280
description. Raising negative numbers to non-integer powers can have the effect of breaking down

46
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,280
negativeness and taking numbers away from the real line altogether. Let's do a quick rundown of what

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,840
these so-called complex numbers are and how they work. All the real numbers can be arranged in an

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,840
order on a line relative to zero. We get complex numbers when we define another direction for

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,600
numbers orthogonal to the reals. This forms a two-dimensional plane and specific complex

50
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,440
numbers are points on this plane. All the reals are of course included, but there's also all

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,240
these other numbers above and below the real line. Numbers that lie specifically on this new vertical

52
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,760
line are called imaginary, and they are the same as reals in every way except for the direction

53
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,560
in which they are spanning. Just like negatives are equivalent to the positive except for the

54
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,560
direction. And just like a unit of movement for positive reals is one and for negatives minus

55
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,640
one, imaginary numbers also have their own version of the number one, called i, that happens to point

56
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,800
at a right angle away from the real line. So any number on the complex plane can be expressed as

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,800
a combination of real and imaginary, like x and y coordinates of a point on a regular coordinate

58
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,280
system. And we express this combination by adding them together. An example of a complex number would

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,760
be two plus three i, and you can think of it as walking away from zero, first by two in the positive

60
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,160
direction and then by three more in the imaginary direction. This also works as you would expect

61
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,360
in the other quadrants. What can we do with this? Within the regular reals we have this concept of

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,400
absolute value, which gives us the magnitude of a number independent from its direction.

63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,400
The same thing exists for complex numbers, but this time we have a whole circle of infinitely

64
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,000
many complex numbers that are the same distance away from zero, and therefore all share the same

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,160
absolute value or magnitude. And this is what we'll need for our journey today. Instead of

66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,280
considering just positive and negative numbers, we'll be plugging in the entire range of directions

67
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,040
for each magnitude and tracking what happens to them as we vary the power we raise x2 in our

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,720
expression. By doing that we are extending the domain and range of our functions to complex

69
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,440
numbers. Two coordinates go in, two coordinates come out. This is not as simple as drawing a line,

70
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
basically all the points on the plane map to some other points also on a plane,

71
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,160
and we can't plot them against each other because we can't draw in four dimensions.

72
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,000
This is where the unorthodox part comes in. We're going to compress the behavior of the

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,160
complex valued function onto a single complex plane. Let me walk you through it. We'll start by

74
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,440
taking the function f of x equals x squared and importing it into the complex plane. We do this by

75
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,760
redefining it as all complex numbers z of the form z equals x plus f of x i, so actually x

76
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:39,440
plus x squared i, and for now we'll just use real inputs for x. This keeps the shape exactly the same.

77
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,000
Only now we have the advantage that we can also plug a complex number in for x and see where the

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,680
value of z we get ends up. Let's first see what this looks like and then we can talk about what's

79
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,920
going on behind the scene. First we'll take all complex numbers of magnitude one. We'll start

80
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,320
taking them from the real value of minus one here, going around through the negative imaginary half of

81
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,240
the circle to positive one, and then back to minus one around through the positive imaginary half.

82
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,480
All right now we draw the z values in the same order. Watch the bigger complex plane on the right.

83
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,320
The curve we get starts at the regular point of the parabola for x equals minus one,

84
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,360
travels to the regular point for positive one, and comes back to x equals minus one another way.

85
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,520
Let's do the same for x of magnitude one half.

86
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,840
And now we zoom in a bit and fill in magnitudes between zero and one.

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,760
You'll notice that for magnitudes of one and one half, which were drawn twice,

88
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,840
the curves appear a bit brighter than the rest. In this visualization, curves drawn over each

89
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,480
other enhance brightness. Let me remove them and dim the axes so we can observe where else this is

90
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,880
happening. We have a bright spot right here, and it appears exactly where the curve for

91
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,120
magnitude one half formed the kink. This is the focus of the parabola. We'll mark it with a white

92
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,360
dot. Now remember, we're getting this by plugging the function into our expression for z shown on

93
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,640
the left and graphing the values of z on the complex plane for chosen ranges of x. The main

94
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,080
thicker shape that coincides with the graph of the parabola we got from real values of x,

95
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,920
and the colored curves from plugging in a series of complex values of the same magnitude, ranging

96
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,080
from zero to one. With this established, we can play around with the function. I'm going to extend

97
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,560
it to a general second degree polynomial. By changing the b and c terms, we can move the parabola.

98
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,920
So let's vary them just slightly to see what happens. Don't worry about specific values we're

99
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,680
using for b and c. This doesn't really matter. All right, the shape formed by the colored curves

100
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
is starting to turn, but the bright spot we found still follows the focus.

101
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,080
Flipping the parabola by changing the sign of the a parameter also doesn't disturb that property.

102
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,160
This gives us an opportunity to vary the a parameter gradually back from minus one

103
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,640
up to one, and watch the parabola transform between downward and upward facing. In between,

104
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,920
it will hit zero, making the function linear, so we'll get our first chance to observe a parabola

105
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,800
transforming into a line and vice versa. Let's take the whole screen for that.

106
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Okay, the focus gets launched out, the curves reform into concentric circles,

107
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,120
and then the focus reappears from the other side, reassembling into a mirrored image of the whole

108
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,520
setup. It may appear as if the focus detaches from the bright spot phenomenon formed by the curves,

109
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,600
but this only happens because we've drawn the curves for a very short range.

110
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
If we increase the range, like this, they will follow along longer.

111
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,600
If we were to extend them to infinity, they would keep following along. The focus travels along

112
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,560
this straight line, aligned with this feature that looks like a ray, formed where the curves

113
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,240
intersect themselves. We're seeing a hidden layer of the behavior of the parabola pop out.

114
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,080
And now that we're a bit more familiar with this way of graphing and how it behaves,

115
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,760
we're ready to go back to the experiment we started at the beginning of the video,

116
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,720
varying the power we raise a single instance of X to. We'll start with a simple f of X equals X,

117
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,160
and for this regular line, the curves formed from complex values of X would just be concentric

118
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,000
circles like we've seen before. Let's remove them and take the power up a notch to 1.1.

119
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:02,240
Now we have two lines on the negative side. What's going on here? Let's draw in just one

120
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,800
curve for X of magnitude one, again starting at minus one and going all the way back around to minus

121
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,080
one. We started with minus one and ended with minus one, but somehow our curve didn't connect

122
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,640
back to itself. How is this possible? I'm sure you've heard of the famous Euler's identity,

123
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,640
the one that states that e to the i pi equals minus one. This is actually a special case of

124
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,880
representing a complex number in terms of magnitude and an angle. The full form would look like this.

125
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,840
So a complex number z given by this expression would be m distance away from the origin at a

126
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,840
theta angle in respect to the real axis, which means its real and imaginary parts could be obtained

127
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:54,400
trigonometrically like this. The famous special form of Euler's identity is just a complex number

128
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,360
of magnitude one and an angle of pi radians halfway around the circle. And here's a catch,

129
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,440
we can hit that same spot where the number minus one lies with an angle of pi, but also with an

130
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,360
angle of three pi or any odd number of increments of pi. And we can go the other way around too.

131
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,360
Remember, I've shown you that when we pick the complex values of x we put into our function,

132
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,320
we start at minus one and travel this way around to get back to minus one again.

133
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,840
The way these values are generated behind the scene is that we're ranging the angle from minus pi

134
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,320
to pi. The round bracket on the left just means that we're only including values strictly larger

135
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,200
than minus pi, because this ensures that every point is represented only once.

136
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,600
Why this range in particular? It follows certain conventions in complex arithmetic,

137
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,880
but long story short, you could say it's the range that gives us the nearest of the infinitely many

138
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,200
representations of a complex number we can get in this form. We reach all angles with an overall

139
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,520
minimum amount of travel from the angle of zero. Now let's look at raising a complex number in

140
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,440
this form to a power. The exponent is going to distribute, it's going to affect the magnitude

141
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,400
normally like it would any real number, and it's going to multiply the angle. Now we can finally

142
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,600
examine the case of our function. We were raising minus one to the 1.1 power. We'll do it first

143
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,240
as the angle of negative pi. Okay, the magnitude we can get rid of because one to the power of

144
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,480
anything is just one, and we'll bring the 1.1 next to pi so the angle is easier to comprehend.

145
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,280
Now we do the same for the angle of positive pi. These two expressions end up in different places

146
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,360
on the complex plane and escape our initial constrained range. One overshoots a bit into the

147
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,680
positive imaginary side, and one into the negative. Neither of those two numbers are real, they are

148
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,680
both detached from the real line. If we were drawing the graph of the function in an ordinary way,

149
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,720
these values and generally all the values for negative inputs of x would simply not be shown.

150
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,600
But we're not drawing the graph of the function. We are instead, remember,

151
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,400
showing numbers of the form z equals x plus f of x i on the complex plane. And these numbers

152
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,360
exist for any input of x we can think of at least for functions we've considered so far.

153
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,360
In the specific case of our function, this results in lines on the negative side slightly

154
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,960
deflected from each other. Alright, enough background. Let's fill in some more curves

155
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,000
and slowly crank the power the rest of the way up to two.

156
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay, let's look at that again, rolling back to one, and again to two. We can see the results for

157
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,800
negative x values rejoin each other as we reach the next integer power. And in doing so, wrapping

158
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,320
the span between the negative and positive sides over itself to form the focal point.

159
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,640
Let's push this model a bit further. How does x squared become x cubed?

160
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,280
Looks like the focus that already existed survives, and another one forms through the

161
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,760
same wrapping back onto itself motion. But there's a problem. There is no such thing as a focus for

162
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,560
the graph of x cubed, let alone two such points. This is where the geometric definition of a focus

163
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,880
and the behavior of our system go their separate ways. But never mind, it looks interesting, so

164
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,520
why don't we crank the power up some more? Let's go to x to the fourth power,

165
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:52,080
and then to fifth. Right, it's making less and less sense to think of these points as foci.

166
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,080
We get them in areas where the graph of the function bends, but also elsewhere seemingly

167
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,600
unrelated to what the graph is doing. But if we add lower power terms to the polynomial,

168
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,800
so that we express all the possible extrema, the points will travel to align with them.

169
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,840
I increased the range and density of the curves so you can better see these features.

170
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,560
Pause here if you'd like to take a closer look.

171
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,520
This phenomenon of curves splitting between integer powers and joining at them has to do

172
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,360
with roots. Any non-integer power is really a combination of a root and raising to a power,

173
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,440
like we've seen earlier. Let's write real numbers a bit more explicitly using Euler's identity.

174
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,600
Positive real numbers can be represented by any angle that is an even multiple of pi,

175
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,160
because all of those are on the real line on the positive side of zero. Two pi is one full revolution.

176
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,080
Likewise, negative real numbers can have any angle that is an odd multiple of pi.

177
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,800
Multiplying those angles by a specific integer always yields one definitive location on the

178
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:07,680
circle, no matter what choice of k we make. If we multiply an odd number by 3, it will always be odd,

179
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,440
no matter which odd number we chose. And if we multiply an even number by any integer at all,

180
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,280
it will stay even, reflecting the fact that positive numbers stay positive under any integer power.

181
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
We have multiple representations of the same numbers, but we get the same result under

182
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,120
exponentiation with integers. However, if we multiply those different angle representations

183
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,560
by a fraction, we get different results, the most familiar which is the case of one half,

184
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,120
the square root. The one half will make the period cycle just one pi, which means it will

185
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,400
sometimes be even and positive, and sometimes odd and negative. We get the two roots of one,

186
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,760
and the same happens for any positive number. There's quite a lot of nuance here and we'll

187
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,320
explore it by driving our graphing method further down below the first power. Let's again first

188
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,760
just go down a notch to 0.9. Here we see a similar separation happening like before,

189
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,880
but this time the lines are not crossing over each other, they are instead opening up a gap

190
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:24,160
between them. Let's follow this down to 0.5. One half, the square root. That gives us half

191
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,840
of a parabola turned on its side. The lines for negative values of x got compressed onto the

192
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,720
negative side of the real axis with a bit sticking out on the positive side. And that bit is exactly

193
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,000
touching the focus of this half-drawn sideways parabola. The proper focus is back.

194
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:48,640
How about we add the negated version of this function in as well and complete the picture?

195
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,200
Right, the parabola is now fully reconstructed along with the same shape of curves we got for

196
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,120
x squared. And we also got this extra bit that looks like the handle of a pitchfork. Of course,

197
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,160
this is not the actual graph of the function you see on the screen, we're doing this z-value

198
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,040
shenanigans and cherry picking which parts of it to show. I'm gonna leave it up to you to ponder

199
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,800
on why we get the pitchfork handle here. Meanwhile, we continue our descent down the powers and things

200
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,360
get even more interesting at our next stop. One third, or the cube root. Just doing what we've

201
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,920
done before, we get to this picture. But there's something off here. This function does actually

202
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,080
have real outputs for negative values of x. If we drew it the regular way, it would look like this,

203
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,880
a perfect and complete inverse of x cubed. That's because within the reels there is only one cube

204
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,120
root of a number and it's always the same sign as the number itself. So why do we get this other

205
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,680
picture instead? We have to look at complex exponentiation again to find that out. To keep

206
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,720
it simple, we'll again just consider the general positive and negative cases for the number one

207
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,120
expressed using Euler's identity. It works the same for other magnitudes.

208
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:13,440
First, we have the positive case e to the power of 2k pi. We raise that to the one-third power,

209
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,760
which gives us two-thirds k pi. As we iterate k, we get the following angles and then they repeat.

210
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,000
Only one of them, this one, is a real number and it's positive. For the negative case,

211
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,800
we'll get two-thirds k plus one-third all times pi. As we iterate k, that will give us these three

212
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:42,400
angles of which again only one is real, this time negative. The way we draw our graph, the positive

213
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,040
side gets represented by an angle of zero that stays zero, so we get positive outputs for positive

214
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,560
inputs and everything just looks normal. But on the negative side, we're coming in with angles of

215
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,520
minus pi and pi, which give us the positive and negative one-third pi angles, the two complex ones.

216
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,200
That hints at there being two more versions of the graph we could draw to complete the picture,

217
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
just like we had an extra one to complete the square root sideways parabola.

218
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,440
We can get these missing two by multiplying the function where the unit turned one-third of the

219
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:26,480
way around the circle, like this, and then one more time, like this. So let's draw them, one by one

220
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,840
separately at first. This is the one we already saw, and then we get this one, which completes the

221
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,400
real valued graph and gives us the continuation of the two negative sides. But notice how the curves

222
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,040
for complex values just end up in a vacuum, not connecting to any of the thicker lines.

223
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,800
Their new home has been defined by the previous stage. Here's both of them together.

224
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,440
Finally, we get this one that for some reason just contains the funny separated lines without

225
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,960
any part of the real graph. These are in fact the solutions we've already seen for complex

226
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,360
values of f of x, they just all appear in the opposite order. And here's all three together.

227
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,920
I know this looks messy, there's too much going on in this picture. But there's an amazing elegance

228
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,760
hiding behind it. First, let's just notice that we've again fully reconstructed the shape of the

229
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,000
colored curves for x cubed. And now let's just focus on the thicker lines depicting results

230
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,640
for the real valued inputs. What we're actually looking at are three copies of the x cubed shape

231
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,720
pressed onto the complex plane in a manner similar to what flowers look like when they're

232
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,000
physically pressed onto a page of a book. To show you what I mean by that, we'll briefly change

233
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
perspective. Let me hide the graphs and we'll go back to the familiar coordinate system where

234
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,160
the horizontal axis represents x and the vertical f of x. Now we slightly upgrade it. We'll declare

235
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,400
the vertical axis to be just the real component of f of x and add another axis going directly

236
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,680
towards you for the imaginary component of f of x. We can get away with using three dimensions here

237
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,080
because we're only considering real valued inputs for x, so it's a mapping of one dimension to two.

238
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
And now we draw our three graphs again.

239
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:34,240
This is what they look like in the space we've created. We can look at the whole resulting shape

240
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
as three cubic curves.

241
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:52,080
Turning the coordinate system around to face straight down the x axis, we reveal the three

242
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,560
planes these curves occupy. We see that these planes are offset from each other by a third

243
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,320
of the way around the circle. Note that we are measuring the angles going from the positive

244
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,400
side of one curve to the positive side of another. Now when we look at our simplified model again,

245
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,840
we have a better idea what the shapes we're seeing actually represent.

246
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,920
We've just compressed these rotations into a visual deformation, a sort of fake perspective

247
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,200
in two dimensions. We're not seeing the true picture but there's an amazing amount of symmetry

248
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,160
preserved. These three curves, when inverted, represent graphs of three regular cubic functions

249
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,840
and all three of these functions, when run through the same z expression we've used this whole time,

250
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,800
yield the exact same shape with the quasi focus points appearing in the same places.

251
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,360
So we've made a long pit stop at the third route but it's time to move on.

252
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,240
We're going to put multi-valuedness behind us again to have a simpler image to look at

253
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
and make our way towards the next interesting power, zero.

254
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,360
Of course, that's just a straight line through one. Let's look at the journey between the power of

255
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,160
one and zero again. Two simple straight lines separated by the thick woods of multi-valued

256
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,840
routes in between them. And as we approach the power of zero, we can see a discontinuity form,

257
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,520
the dreaded zero to the power of zero. Going even just the tiniest bit under zero of power

258
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,440
results in values approaching the vertical axis exploding to infinity.

259
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,840
So we have this situation right over the power of zero and this right under it.

260
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,720
There is something remarkable happening at the singularity when both values are exactly zero

261
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
and to understand it we'll consider the limits as we approach it from different directions.

262
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,120
The most commonly considered ones are x to the power of zero, our function itself,

263
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,200
as x goes to zero from the positive and negative sides, which both work out unsurprisingly to one.

264
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,800
The same happens if we simultaneously approach zero in both base and exponent.

265
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,080
The negative side limit only exists if we allow approaching from complex numbers, but it's there.

266
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,680
If we fix the base to zero and approach the zero power from the positive side,

267
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,040
we also unsurprisingly get zero. But if we plug any negative number in the exponent,

268
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,000
forget the limit, we get this peculiar mathematical object called complex infinity.

269
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,040
Its formally used symbol is just the regular infinity we're used to,

270
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,280
but I find this confusing because it can easily be mistaken for positive infinity.

271
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,840
Wolfram Alpha uses a notation with a tilde over it to make it more distinct and I will adopt that.

272
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,640
So what is this beast? To understand it we need to consider how zero works in the complex world.

273
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,840
In the reals, zero is the only number that isn't either positive or negative,

274
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,680
and in the complex world, since there are infinitely many directions,

275
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,080
this ambiguity encompasses all of them.

276
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,920
Zero is basically a circle of radius zero in the complex plane, its direction is undetermined,

277
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,920
which in some sense means we need to consider them all when operating on it.

278
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
Raising this number to any negative power turns it into division by zero,

279
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,800
which is commonly left undefined, but within a special set called the extended complex numbers,

280
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,880
that is complex numbers with this omnidirectional infinity added to it.

281
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,680
This operation is actually allowed since it yields a single definitive answer.

282
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,240
That means that our singularity goes through a kind of big bang.

283
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,320
The infinitely small circle of zero instantly becomes an infinitely large circle,

284
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,720
a place where all complex numbers, regardless of the direction they were headed out in,

285
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,840
will meet. Keep that in mind as we travel down to the negative one power.

286
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,240
At the end of this journey we get a familiar function x to the negative one power,

287
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,640
better known as one over x, which has this property of looping back from infinity around the x value of zero.

288
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,120
Well, now you know where Pac-Man went and where he's coming back from.

289
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,560
Along the way we're passing multi-valued routes, just like we did on the positive side,

290
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,080
and finally we form the two foci of the hyperbola,

291
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,520
in a similar way like the single focus showed up for the parabola.

292
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,480
There's a lot more to say about these phenomena, but I'm going to leave that for another time.

293
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,000
This inverted version of the behavior we've seen on the positive side

294
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
continues on down to the lower powers, like this.

295
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,360
I suspect all this stopping and restarting we've done might have felt a bit frustrating,

296
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,680
so what I want to do now is to just let the animation run from minus four,

297
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,280
where we currently stand, back up to five, so you can see the whole story come together.

298
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,680
And since we're done explaining, we'll crank up the range and resolution to make it more pretty.

299
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,280
Here we go.

300
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,960
I hope you liked this journey. If you'd like to play around with this model,

301
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,800
I've included links to Desmos graphs where you can fiddle around with the parameters

302
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,480
to get a feeling for how this model behaves. Links in the description.

303
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,680
As a bonus, let me show you some other notable examples visualized this way.

304
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
The exponential function.

305
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,400
X to its own power.

306
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,000
And back over a constant one to my favorite Gaussian function, the normal distribution.

307
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,000
And let's enhance it a bit.

308
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,160
And then we go back over the exponential function and we draw e to the ix,

309
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,200
which we remember to be cosine x plus i sine x. So if we just stake out the i sine,

310
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,680
we get the cosine on its own.

311
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed and learned something new.

312
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm curious to know what you think of the approach taken here, what questions it inspires,

313
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,080
so please leave a comment and let me know. Here are some other videos of mine,

314
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,960
