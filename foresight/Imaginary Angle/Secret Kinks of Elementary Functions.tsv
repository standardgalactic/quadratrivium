0	4160	When I was in school, I wondered, like many others, what happens in between the different
4160	11040	forms of graphs of elementary functions. How does this become this, become this, or become this?
11760	15760	And what's the deal with the Pac-Man-like behavior around division by zero?
16400	20960	It made no sense to me that these wildly different shapes and features have nothing to do with each
20960	26960	other. There had to be some hidden metamorphosis between the integer powers. And there was,
27040	31760	extending the domain and range of these functions to complex numbers does give us a much deeper
31760	36560	insight, but we no longer have the luxury of graphing two values against each other in two
36560	42480	dimensions. We're stuck with either abstract algebraic answers, or slices of the story akin
42480	47920	to taking x-ray images of a cocoon caterpillar turning into a butterfly. I was never quite
47920	53040	satisfied with that, so today's video will be taking a somewhat unorthodox approach
53040	58560	to indulge the intuition of my younger self. We'll introduce complex arithmetic as it's needed,
58560	65360	and draw almost everything in glorious uncomplicated duty. The goal is to watch the wings of the
65360	77600	butterfly form and grow. I hope you enjoy. Let's first just see what happens if we start with
77600	83520	f of x equals x, the simplest possible linear graph, make the first power of x explicit,
83520	89840	and vary that power up to two in discrete steps. The negative side seems to be jumping up and down
89840	96640	and disappearing in between. Let's look at a few specific examples. For x to the power of one and
96640	103120	a half, we only get a graph in the first quadrant, where both x and f of x are positive. Both the
103120	109120	domain and range of this function are real numbers greater than or equal to zero. This is because
109120	115440	x to the power of one and a half is actually x to three halves, which is a square root of x cubed.
116320	121760	For negative values of x, x cubed will be negative, and when that negative ends up under a square
121760	128720	root, there won't be any real value dancers. So right off the bat, half of our shape is missing.
128720	133360	In this case, we can still recover it because it's just the other square root, there are always two.
133920	138480	We can get both by treating our expression as an equation instead of as a function.
139200	146240	We'll write y equals square root of x cubed, and then square both sides. That gives us y squared
146240	152560	equals x cubed, and the graph looks like this. It's just the piece we've already had reflected
152560	160400	about the x-axis. Let's just take that as it is and move on. What about x to 1.4? Again, we make
160400	166480	sense of this by turning the exponent into a fraction, in this case 14 over 10, that simplifies
166480	173760	to seven over five, which makes f of x the fifth root of x to the seventh power. The power under
173760	179680	the root is odd, so it can yield a negative, but that's okay since the degree of root is also odd,
180240	186320	and we just get negative results out. We also don't have to deal with multiple roots since
186320	192160	there is only one odd degree root of a number in the reels. This shape does look like a slightly
192160	197920	bent line, an intermediary step on the way to a parabola, but the left side doesn't look like it
197920	206320	has any intention of bending upwards. Let's keep exploring. What happens at x to 1.6? That's 16 over
206320	213440	10 or 8 over 5. So same story with the odd degree root, negatives are allowed, but this time it doesn't
213440	219600	really matter since under the root we are raising all numbers to an even power, 8, making them always
219600	224800	positive. That gives us a shape similar to a parabola, but it came out of the blue without
224800	230240	following any pattern from the shapes we've seen before. So there isn't really a smooth transition
230240	234720	between the first and the second power. The negative arm of the graph jumps erratically
234720	240560	between the three remaining quadrants. And we didn't even try to plug in an irrational power,
240560	243680	that's a whole other can of worms we won't be opening today.
244560	249760	Why is this so messy? And why is all the mess happening when x takes on negative values?
250320	255200	It turns out that negativeness is a part of a much bigger story where numbers can shoot off
255200	260800	not just away from each other relative to zero, but in all other directions too. I have a whole
260800	265600	video about that, a link should pop up in the top right corner, and it's also available in the
265600	271280	description. Raising negative numbers to non-integer powers can have the effect of breaking down
271280	277280	negativeness and taking numbers away from the real line altogether. Let's do a quick rundown of what
277280	283840	these so-called complex numbers are and how they work. All the real numbers can be arranged in an
283840	289840	order on a line relative to zero. We get complex numbers when we define another direction for
289840	295600	numbers orthogonal to the reals. This forms a two-dimensional plane and specific complex
295600	301440	numbers are points on this plane. All the reals are of course included, but there's also all
301440	308240	these other numbers above and below the real line. Numbers that lie specifically on this new vertical
308240	313760	line are called imaginary, and they are the same as reals in every way except for the direction
313760	318560	in which they are spanning. Just like negatives are equivalent to the positive except for the
318560	324560	direction. And just like a unit of movement for positive reals is one and for negatives minus
324560	330640	one, imaginary numbers also have their own version of the number one, called i, that happens to point
330640	336800	at a right angle away from the real line. So any number on the complex plane can be expressed as
336800	342800	a combination of real and imaginary, like x and y coordinates of a point on a regular coordinate
342800	349280	system. And we express this combination by adding them together. An example of a complex number would
349280	355760	be two plus three i, and you can think of it as walking away from zero, first by two in the positive
355760	362160	direction and then by three more in the imaginary direction. This also works as you would expect
362160	369360	in the other quadrants. What can we do with this? Within the regular reals we have this concept of
369360	374400	absolute value, which gives us the magnitude of a number independent from its direction.
375040	380400	The same thing exists for complex numbers, but this time we have a whole circle of infinitely
380400	386000	many complex numbers that are the same distance away from zero, and therefore all share the same
386000	392160	absolute value or magnitude. And this is what we'll need for our journey today. Instead of
392160	397280	considering just positive and negative numbers, we'll be plugging in the entire range of directions
397280	403040	for each magnitude and tracking what happens to them as we vary the power we raise x2 in our
403040	408720	expression. By doing that we are extending the domain and range of our functions to complex
408720	415440	numbers. Two coordinates go in, two coordinates come out. This is not as simple as drawing a line,
415440	420080	basically all the points on the plane map to some other points also on a plane,
420080	424160	and we can't plot them against each other because we can't draw in four dimensions.
424960	430000	This is where the unorthodox part comes in. We're going to compress the behavior of the
430000	436160	complex valued function onto a single complex plane. Let me walk you through it. We'll start by
436160	443440	taking the function f of x equals x squared and importing it into the complex plane. We do this by
443440	451760	redefining it as all complex numbers z of the form z equals x plus f of x i, so actually x
451760	459440	plus x squared i, and for now we'll just use real inputs for x. This keeps the shape exactly the same.
460080	466000	Only now we have the advantage that we can also plug a complex number in for x and see where the
466000	471680	value of z we get ends up. Let's first see what this looks like and then we can talk about what's
471680	477920	going on behind the scene. First we'll take all complex numbers of magnitude one. We'll start
477920	484320	taking them from the real value of minus one here, going around through the negative imaginary half of
484320	490240	the circle to positive one, and then back to minus one around through the positive imaginary half.
491040	496480	All right now we draw the z values in the same order. Watch the bigger complex plane on the right.
499360	504320	The curve we get starts at the regular point of the parabola for x equals minus one,
504880	511360	travels to the regular point for positive one, and comes back to x equals minus one another way.
512560	515520	Let's do the same for x of magnitude one half.
519440	523840	And now we zoom in a bit and fill in magnitudes between zero and one.
527360	531760	You'll notice that for magnitudes of one and one half, which were drawn twice,
531840	537840	the curves appear a bit brighter than the rest. In this visualization, curves drawn over each
537840	544480	other enhance brightness. Let me remove them and dim the axes so we can observe where else this is
544480	550880	happening. We have a bright spot right here, and it appears exactly where the curve for
550880	557120	magnitude one half formed the kink. This is the focus of the parabola. We'll mark it with a white
557120	563360	dot. Now remember, we're getting this by plugging the function into our expression for z shown on
563360	570640	the left and graphing the values of z on the complex plane for chosen ranges of x. The main
570640	576080	thicker shape that coincides with the graph of the parabola we got from real values of x,
576080	581920	and the colored curves from plugging in a series of complex values of the same magnitude, ranging
581920	588080	from zero to one. With this established, we can play around with the function. I'm going to extend
588080	594560	it to a general second degree polynomial. By changing the b and c terms, we can move the parabola.
594560	599920	So let's vary them just slightly to see what happens. Don't worry about specific values we're
599920	607680	using for b and c. This doesn't really matter. All right, the shape formed by the colored curves
607680	611920	is starting to turn, but the bright spot we found still follows the focus.
612880	618080	Flipping the parabola by changing the sign of the a parameter also doesn't disturb that property.
619120	624160	This gives us an opportunity to vary the a parameter gradually back from minus one
624160	630640	up to one, and watch the parabola transform between downward and upward facing. In between,
630640	635920	it will hit zero, making the function linear, so we'll get our first chance to observe a parabola
635920	640800	transforming into a line and vice versa. Let's take the whole screen for that.
645360	650080	Okay, the focus gets launched out, the curves reform into concentric circles,
650080	655120	and then the focus reappears from the other side, reassembling into a mirrored image of the whole
655120	661520	setup. It may appear as if the focus detaches from the bright spot phenomenon formed by the curves,
661520	665600	but this only happens because we've drawn the curves for a very short range.
665600	669360	If we increase the range, like this, they will follow along longer.
670240	675600	If we were to extend them to infinity, they would keep following along. The focus travels along
675600	680560	this straight line, aligned with this feature that looks like a ray, formed where the curves
680560	686240	intersect themselves. We're seeing a hidden layer of the behavior of the parabola pop out.
687440	692080	And now that we're a bit more familiar with this way of graphing and how it behaves,
692080	695760	we're ready to go back to the experiment we started at the beginning of the video,
696320	702720	varying the power we raise a single instance of X to. We'll start with a simple f of X equals X,
702720	708160	and for this regular line, the curves formed from complex values of X would just be concentric
708160	714000	circles like we've seen before. Let's remove them and take the power up a notch to 1.1.
714400	722240	Now we have two lines on the negative side. What's going on here? Let's draw in just one
722240	728800	curve for X of magnitude one, again starting at minus one and going all the way back around to minus
728800	736080	one. We started with minus one and ended with minus one, but somehow our curve didn't connect
736080	742640	back to itself. How is this possible? I'm sure you've heard of the famous Euler's identity,
742640	748640	the one that states that e to the i pi equals minus one. This is actually a special case of
748640	754880	representing a complex number in terms of magnitude and an angle. The full form would look like this.
755920	761840	So a complex number z given by this expression would be m distance away from the origin at a
761840	767840	theta angle in respect to the real axis, which means its real and imaginary parts could be obtained
767840	774400	trigonometrically like this. The famous special form of Euler's identity is just a complex number
774400	781360	of magnitude one and an angle of pi radians halfway around the circle. And here's a catch,
781360	787440	we can hit that same spot where the number minus one lies with an angle of pi, but also with an
787440	793360	angle of three pi or any odd number of increments of pi. And we can go the other way around too.
794240	799360	Remember, I've shown you that when we pick the complex values of x we put into our function,
799360	804320	we start at minus one and travel this way around to get back to minus one again.
805760	811840	The way these values are generated behind the scene is that we're ranging the angle from minus pi
811840	818320	to pi. The round bracket on the left just means that we're only including values strictly larger
818320	823200	than minus pi, because this ensures that every point is represented only once.
824400	829600	Why this range in particular? It follows certain conventions in complex arithmetic,
829600	834880	but long story short, you could say it's the range that gives us the nearest of the infinitely many
834880	841200	representations of a complex number we can get in this form. We reach all angles with an overall
841200	847520	minimum amount of travel from the angle of zero. Now let's look at raising a complex number in
847520	853440	this form to a power. The exponent is going to distribute, it's going to affect the magnitude
853440	860400	normally like it would any real number, and it's going to multiply the angle. Now we can finally
860400	867600	examine the case of our function. We were raising minus one to the 1.1 power. We'll do it first
867600	874240	as the angle of negative pi. Okay, the magnitude we can get rid of because one to the power of
874240	880480	anything is just one, and we'll bring the 1.1 next to pi so the angle is easier to comprehend.
881360	887280	Now we do the same for the angle of positive pi. These two expressions end up in different places
887280	893360	on the complex plane and escape our initial constrained range. One overshoots a bit into the
893360	899680	positive imaginary side, and one into the negative. Neither of those two numbers are real, they are
899760	905680	both detached from the real line. If we were drawing the graph of the function in an ordinary way,
905680	910720	these values and generally all the values for negative inputs of x would simply not be shown.
911680	915600	But we're not drawing the graph of the function. We are instead, remember,
915600	922400	showing numbers of the form z equals x plus f of x i on the complex plane. And these numbers
922400	927360	exist for any input of x we can think of at least for functions we've considered so far.
928080	933360	In the specific case of our function, this results in lines on the negative side slightly
933360	938960	deflected from each other. Alright, enough background. Let's fill in some more curves
938960	942000	and slowly crank the power the rest of the way up to two.
946240	954480	Okay, let's look at that again, rolling back to one, and again to two. We can see the results for
954480	960800	negative x values rejoin each other as we reach the next integer power. And in doing so, wrapping
960800	966320	the span between the negative and positive sides over itself to form the focal point.
967440	972640	Let's push this model a bit further. How does x squared become x cubed?
974640	979280	Looks like the focus that already existed survives, and another one forms through the
979280	985760	same wrapping back onto itself motion. But there's a problem. There is no such thing as a focus for
985760	992560	the graph of x cubed, let alone two such points. This is where the geometric definition of a focus
992560	998880	and the behavior of our system go their separate ways. But never mind, it looks interesting, so
998880	1003520	why don't we crank the power up some more? Let's go to x to the fourth power,
1004320	1012080	and then to fifth. Right, it's making less and less sense to think of these points as foci.
1012720	1018080	We get them in areas where the graph of the function bends, but also elsewhere seemingly
1018080	1023600	unrelated to what the graph is doing. But if we add lower power terms to the polynomial,
1023600	1028800	so that we express all the possible extrema, the points will travel to align with them.
1028800	1033840	I increased the range and density of the curves so you can better see these features.
1034480	1036560	Pause here if you'd like to take a closer look.
1038560	1043520	This phenomenon of curves splitting between integer powers and joining at them has to do
1043520	1049360	with roots. Any non-integer power is really a combination of a root and raising to a power,
1049360	1055440	like we've seen earlier. Let's write real numbers a bit more explicitly using Euler's identity.
1056160	1061600	Positive real numbers can be represented by any angle that is an even multiple of pi,
1061600	1068160	because all of those are on the real line on the positive side of zero. Two pi is one full revolution.
1068960	1074080	Likewise, negative real numbers can have any angle that is an odd multiple of pi.
1075600	1080800	Multiplying those angles by a specific integer always yields one definitive location on the
1080800	1087680	circle, no matter what choice of k we make. If we multiply an odd number by 3, it will always be odd,
1087680	1093440	no matter which odd number we chose. And if we multiply an even number by any integer at all,
1093440	1099280	it will stay even, reflecting the fact that positive numbers stay positive under any integer power.
1100240	1105200	We have multiple representations of the same numbers, but we get the same result under
1105200	1111120	exponentiation with integers. However, if we multiply those different angle representations
1111120	1116560	by a fraction, we get different results, the most familiar which is the case of one half,
1116560	1123120	the square root. The one half will make the period cycle just one pi, which means it will
1123120	1130400	sometimes be even and positive, and sometimes odd and negative. We get the two roots of one,
1130400	1135760	and the same happens for any positive number. There's quite a lot of nuance here and we'll
1135760	1142320	explore it by driving our graphing method further down below the first power. Let's again first
1142320	1149760	just go down a notch to 0.9. Here we see a similar separation happening like before,
1149760	1154880	but this time the lines are not crossing over each other, they are instead opening up a gap
1154880	1164160	between them. Let's follow this down to 0.5. One half, the square root. That gives us half
1164160	1169840	of a parabola turned on its side. The lines for negative values of x got compressed onto the
1169840	1176720	negative side of the real axis with a bit sticking out on the positive side. And that bit is exactly
1176720	1182000	touching the focus of this half-drawn sideways parabola. The proper focus is back.
1182560	1188640	How about we add the negated version of this function in as well and complete the picture?
1189840	1195200	Right, the parabola is now fully reconstructed along with the same shape of curves we got for
1195200	1201120	x squared. And we also got this extra bit that looks like the handle of a pitchfork. Of course,
1201120	1206160	this is not the actual graph of the function you see on the screen, we're doing this z-value
1206160	1211040	shenanigans and cherry picking which parts of it to show. I'm gonna leave it up to you to ponder
1211040	1216800	on why we get the pitchfork handle here. Meanwhile, we continue our descent down the powers and things
1216800	1223360	get even more interesting at our next stop. One third, or the cube root. Just doing what we've
1223360	1229920	done before, we get to this picture. But there's something off here. This function does actually
1229920	1236080	have real outputs for negative values of x. If we drew it the regular way, it would look like this,
1236080	1242880	a perfect and complete inverse of x cubed. That's because within the reels there is only one cube
1242880	1249120	root of a number and it's always the same sign as the number itself. So why do we get this other
1249120	1255680	picture instead? We have to look at complex exponentiation again to find that out. To keep
1255680	1260720	it simple, we'll again just consider the general positive and negative cases for the number one
1260720	1265120	expressed using Euler's identity. It works the same for other magnitudes.
1265920	1273440	First, we have the positive case e to the power of 2k pi. We raise that to the one-third power,
1273440	1281760	which gives us two-thirds k pi. As we iterate k, we get the following angles and then they repeat.
1282320	1288000	Only one of them, this one, is a real number and it's positive. For the negative case,
1288000	1294800	we'll get two-thirds k plus one-third all times pi. As we iterate k, that will give us these three
1294800	1302400	angles of which again only one is real, this time negative. The way we draw our graph, the positive
1302400	1309040	side gets represented by an angle of zero that stays zero, so we get positive outputs for positive
1309040	1314560	inputs and everything just looks normal. But on the negative side, we're coming in with angles of
1314560	1321520	minus pi and pi, which give us the positive and negative one-third pi angles, the two complex ones.
1322480	1327200	That hints at there being two more versions of the graph we could draw to complete the picture,
1327200	1331200	just like we had an extra one to complete the square root sideways parabola.
1332160	1337440	We can get these missing two by multiplying the function where the unit turned one-third of the
1337440	1346480	way around the circle, like this, and then one more time, like this. So let's draw them, one by one
1346480	1353840	separately at first. This is the one we already saw, and then we get this one, which completes the
1353840	1360400	real valued graph and gives us the continuation of the two negative sides. But notice how the curves
1360400	1365040	for complex values just end up in a vacuum, not connecting to any of the thicker lines.
1365920	1370800	Their new home has been defined by the previous stage. Here's both of them together.
1372080	1377440	Finally, we get this one that for some reason just contains the funny separated lines without
1377440	1382960	any part of the real graph. These are in fact the solutions we've already seen for complex
1382960	1389360	values of f of x, they just all appear in the opposite order. And here's all three together.
1390320	1395920	I know this looks messy, there's too much going on in this picture. But there's an amazing elegance
1395920	1401760	hiding behind it. First, let's just notice that we've again fully reconstructed the shape of the
1401760	1408000	colored curves for x cubed. And now let's just focus on the thicker lines depicting results
1408000	1414640	for the real valued inputs. What we're actually looking at are three copies of the x cubed shape
1414880	1420720	pressed onto the complex plane in a manner similar to what flowers look like when they're
1420720	1426000	physically pressed onto a page of a book. To show you what I mean by that, we'll briefly change
1426000	1432000	perspective. Let me hide the graphs and we'll go back to the familiar coordinate system where
1432000	1440160	the horizontal axis represents x and the vertical f of x. Now we slightly upgrade it. We'll declare
1440160	1446400	the vertical axis to be just the real component of f of x and add another axis going directly
1446400	1453680	towards you for the imaginary component of f of x. We can get away with using three dimensions here
1453680	1460080	because we're only considering real valued inputs for x, so it's a mapping of one dimension to two.
1461120	1463440	And now we draw our three graphs again.
1464240	1474240	This is what they look like in the space we've created. We can look at the whole resulting shape
1474240	1476240	as three cubic curves.
1476240	1492080	Turning the coordinate system around to face straight down the x axis, we reveal the three
1492080	1498560	planes these curves occupy. We see that these planes are offset from each other by a third
1498560	1504320	of the way around the circle. Note that we are measuring the angles going from the positive
1504320	1510400	side of one curve to the positive side of another. Now when we look at our simplified model again,
1510400	1513840	we have a better idea what the shapes we're seeing actually represent.
1514480	1519920	We've just compressed these rotations into a visual deformation, a sort of fake perspective
1519920	1525200	in two dimensions. We're not seeing the true picture but there's an amazing amount of symmetry
1525200	1532160	preserved. These three curves, when inverted, represent graphs of three regular cubic functions
1532160	1537840	and all three of these functions, when run through the same z expression we've used this whole time,
1537840	1542800	yield the exact same shape with the quasi focus points appearing in the same places.
1544960	1549360	So we've made a long pit stop at the third route but it's time to move on.
1549360	1554240	We're going to put multi-valuedness behind us again to have a simpler image to look at
1554240	1557440	and make our way towards the next interesting power, zero.
1558320	1563360	Of course, that's just a straight line through one. Let's look at the journey between the power of
1563360	1570160	one and zero again. Two simple straight lines separated by the thick woods of multi-valued
1570160	1575840	routes in between them. And as we approach the power of zero, we can see a discontinuity form,
1575840	1581520	the dreaded zero to the power of zero. Going even just the tiniest bit under zero of power
1581520	1585440	results in values approaching the vertical axis exploding to infinity.
1586320	1591840	So we have this situation right over the power of zero and this right under it.
1593440	1598720	There is something remarkable happening at the singularity when both values are exactly zero
1598720	1603120	and to understand it we'll consider the limits as we approach it from different directions.
1604320	1609120	The most commonly considered ones are x to the power of zero, our function itself,
1609120	1615200	as x goes to zero from the positive and negative sides, which both work out unsurprisingly to one.
1616080	1620800	The same happens if we simultaneously approach zero in both base and exponent.
1621360	1626080	The negative side limit only exists if we allow approaching from complex numbers, but it's there.
1626800	1631680	If we fix the base to zero and approach the zero power from the positive side,
1631680	1637040	we also unsurprisingly get zero. But if we plug any negative number in the exponent,
1637040	1642000	forget the limit, we get this peculiar mathematical object called complex infinity.
1642800	1647040	Its formally used symbol is just the regular infinity we're used to,
1647040	1651280	but I find this confusing because it can easily be mistaken for positive infinity.
1652160	1657840	Wolfram Alpha uses a notation with a tilde over it to make it more distinct and I will adopt that.
1658800	1664640	So what is this beast? To understand it we need to consider how zero works in the complex world.
1665280	1669840	In the reals, zero is the only number that isn't either positive or negative,
1669840	1673680	and in the complex world, since there are infinitely many directions,
1673680	1676080	this ambiguity encompasses all of them.
1677360	1683920	Zero is basically a circle of radius zero in the complex plane, its direction is undetermined,
1683920	1687920	which in some sense means we need to consider them all when operating on it.
1688880	1692960	Raising this number to any negative power turns it into division by zero,
1692960	1698800	which is commonly left undefined, but within a special set called the extended complex numbers,
1698800	1702880	that is complex numbers with this omnidirectional infinity added to it.
1703440	1707680	This operation is actually allowed since it yields a single definitive answer.
1708800	1712240	That means that our singularity goes through a kind of big bang.
1712800	1718320	The infinitely small circle of zero instantly becomes an infinitely large circle,
1718320	1722720	a place where all complex numbers, regardless of the direction they were headed out in,
1722960	1727840	will meet. Keep that in mind as we travel down to the negative one power.
1729680	1734240	At the end of this journey we get a familiar function x to the negative one power,
1734240	1740640	better known as one over x, which has this property of looping back from infinity around the x value of zero.
1741680	1745120	Well, now you know where Pac-Man went and where he's coming back from.
1746080	1750560	Along the way we're passing multi-valued routes, just like we did on the positive side,
1750560	1754080	and finally we form the two foci of the hyperbola,
1754080	1757520	in a similar way like the single focus showed up for the parabola.
1758320	1762480	There's a lot more to say about these phenomena, but I'm going to leave that for another time.
1764080	1768000	This inverted version of the behavior we've seen on the positive side
1768000	1770960	continues on down to the lower powers, like this.
1774400	1779360	I suspect all this stopping and restarting we've done might have felt a bit frustrating,
1779360	1783680	so what I want to do now is to just let the animation run from minus four,
1783680	1789280	where we currently stand, back up to five, so you can see the whole story come together.
1789280	1793680	And since we're done explaining, we'll crank up the range and resolution to make it more pretty.
1794240	1795280	Here we go.
1840080	1844960	I hope you liked this journey. If you'd like to play around with this model,
1844960	1848800	I've included links to Desmos graphs where you can fiddle around with the parameters
1848800	1852480	to get a feeling for how this model behaves. Links in the description.
1853440	1857680	As a bonus, let me show you some other notable examples visualized this way.
1858720	1860320	The exponential function.
1864960	1866400	X to its own power.
1870320	1876000	And back over a constant one to my favorite Gaussian function, the normal distribution.
1878560	1880000	And let's enhance it a bit.
1882720	1888160	And then we go back over the exponential function and we draw e to the ix,
1891600	1897200	which we remember to be cosine x plus i sine x. So if we just stake out the i sine,
1898160	1899680	we get the cosine on its own.
1903840	1907680	Thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed and learned something new.
1908880	1913520	I'm curious to know what you think of the approach taken here, what questions it inspires,
