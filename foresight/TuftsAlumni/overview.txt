Checking TuftsAlumni/What Matters to Me and Why： Mike Levin on Unconventional and Synthetic Intelligence.txt
1. Mike Roco discussed emergent phenomena, using traffic jams as an example where the issue isn't with any single car but with the collective behavior of many cars together. He emphasized that complex systems can exhibit behaviors that are not predictable from the properties of individual components.

2. Regarding genetic inheritance, Mike explained that DNA provides a set of instructions for creating a biological organism, which by default produces an organism resembling the parents. However, the organism has potential to perform beyond its default behavior, given the right stimuli or conditions.

3. Mike recommended several science fiction authors and books, including Stanisław Lem, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, and Octavia Butler, acknowledging that these classics influenced him when he was younger and had more time to read for pleasure.

4. The event organizers thanked Mike Roco for his participation and encouraged attendees to check out the programming for reunions, where Mike has agreed to appear virtually on June 4th, particularly for those who are part of the relevant cohort.

5. A reminder was given for the next What Matters To Me In Why event featuring Sarah Lewis discussing fireflies, scheduled for April 19th at 5:30 p.m.

6. The organizers expressed gratitude to all attendees for joining the session and hoped that they would join future programs.
