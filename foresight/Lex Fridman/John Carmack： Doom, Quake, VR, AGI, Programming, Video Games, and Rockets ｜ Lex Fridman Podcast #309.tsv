0	6960	I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters and he was slowly moving around and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.
6960	14760	It was all still keyboard. We didn't even have mice set up at that time, but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.
14760	20440	The wall disappears in a little animation and there's a monster like right there and he practically fell out of his chair.
20440	24440	It was just like, ah, and games just didn't do that.
24600	32040	You know, the games were, the gods eye view, you were a little invested in your little guy, you can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,
32040	34840	but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.
34840	36240	You weren't inside the game.
36240	42240	Something in the back of your brain, some reptile brain thing is just going, oh shit, something just happened.
42240	47040	And that was one of those early points where it's like, yeah, this is going to make a difference.
47040	50040	This is going to be powerful and it's going to matter.
51040	59040	The following is a conversation with John Carmack, widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers ever.
59040	69040	He was the co-founder of id Software and the lead programmer on several games that revolutionized the technology, the experience and the role of gaming in our society,
69040	75040	including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake.
75040	87040	He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR, helping to create portals into virtual worlds and to define the technological path to the metaverse and meta.
87040	94040	And now he has been shifting some of his attention to the problem of artificial general intelligence.
94040	99040	This was the longest conversation on this podcast at over five hours.
100040	106040	And still, I could talk to John many, many more times and we hope to do just that.
106040	108040	This is the Lexington podcast.
108040	112040	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
112040	117040	And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.
117040	120040	What was the first program you've ever written?
120040	121040	Do you remember?
121040	122040	Yeah, I do.
122040	132040	So I remember being in a Radio Shack going up to the TRS-80 computers and learning just enough to be able to do 10-print John Carmack.
132040	143040	And it's kind of interesting how, of course, I've, you know, Carnegie and Enrichie kind of standardized Hello World is the first thing that you do in every computer programming language and every computer,
143040	150040	but not having any interaction with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things, it was just like, well, what am I going to say?
150040	151040	My name.
151040	155040	And then you learn how to do go to 10 and have it scroll all off the screen.
155040	159040	And that was definitely the first thing that I wound up doing on a computer.
159040	161040	Can I ask you a programming advice?
161040	164040	I was always told in the beginning that you're not allowed to use go-to statements.
164040	165040	That's really bad programming.
165040	166040	Is this correct or not?
166040	168040	Jumping around code.
168040	176040	Can we look at the philosophy and the technical aspects of the go-to statement that seems so convenient, but it's supposed to be programming?
176040	180040	Certainly back in the day, in basic programming languages, you didn't have proper loops.
180040	182040	You didn't have four-wiles-and-repeats.
182040	187040	You know, that was the land of Pascal for people that kind of generally had access to it back then.
187040	190040	So you had no choice but to use go-tos.
190040	196040	And as you made what were big programs back then, which were a thousand line basic program, is a really big program.
196040	199040	They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.
199040	203040	You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.
203040	211040	So you would wind up fixing things in one place, add a little patch, and there's reasons why structured programming generally helps understanding.
211040	213040	But go-tos aren't poisonous.
213040	215040	Sometimes they're the right thing to do.
215040	230040	Usually it's because there's a language feature missing like nested breaks or something where it can sometimes be better to do a go-to cleanup or go-to error rather than having multiple flags, multiple if statements littered throughout things.
230040	231040	But it is rare.
231040	238040	I mean, if you grep through all of my code right now, I don't think any of my current code bases would actually have a go-to.
238040	246040	But deep within sort of the technical underpinnings of a major game engine, you're going to have some go-tos in a couple places probably.
246040	255040	Yeah, the infrastructure on top of like the closer you get to machine code, the more go-tos you're going to see, the more of these like hacks you're going to see.
255040	262040	Because the set of features available to you in low-level programming languages is limited.
262040	271040	So print John Carmack, when is the first time, if we could talk about love, that you fell in love with programming?
271040	274040	You said like this is really something special.
274040	282040	It really was something that was one of those love at first sight things where just really from the time that I understood what a computer was.
282040	290040	I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes with the real-to-real tape decks.
290040	305040	And for people nowadays, it can be a little hard to understand what the world was like then from information gathering where I would go to the libraries and there would be a couple books on the shelf about computers and they would be very out of date even at that point.
305040	310040	Just not a lot of information, but I would grab everything that I could find and, you know, devour everything.
310040	317040	Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers, I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.
317040	324040	It just, it felt like this magical thing to me, this idea that the computer would just do exactly what you told it to.
324040	331040	I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw sort of issues there where you'd better be really, really careful with what you're telling it to do.
331040	333040	But it wasn't going to back talk you.
333040	335040	It wasn't going to have a different point of view.
335040	337040	It was going to carry out what you told it to do.
337040	343040	And if you had the right commands, you could make it do these pretty magical things.
343040	346040	And so what kind of programs did you write at first?
346040	348040	So beyond the print John Carmack.
348040	356040	So I can remember as going through the learning process where you find at the start you're just learning how to do the most basic possible things.
356040	362040	And I can remember stuff like Superman comic that Radio Shack commissioned to have.
362040	372040	It's like Superman had lost some of his super brain and kids had to use Radio Shack TRS-80 computers to do calculations for it to help him kind of complete his heroics.
372040	380040	And I'd find little things like that and then get a few basic books to be able to kind of work my way up.
380040	382040	And again, it was so precious back then.
382040	386040	I had a couple books that would teach me important things about it.
386040	390040	I had one book that I could start to learn a little bit of assembly language from.
390040	394040	And I'd have a few books on basic and some things that I could get from the libraries.
394040	400040	But my goals in the early days was almost always making games of various kinds.
400040	405040	I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games.
405040	411040	And being able to do some of those things myself on the computers was very much what I aspired to.
411040	416040	And it was a whole journey where if you learn normal basic, you can't do any kind of an action game.
416040	417040	You can write an adventure game.
417040	420040	You can write things where you say, what do you do here?
420040	423040	I get sword, attack troll, that type of thing.
423040	429040	And that can be done in the context of basic, but to do things that had moving graphics.
429040	432040	There were only the most limited things you could possibly do.
432040	436040	You could maybe do breakout or pong or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.
436040	445040	And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers.
445040	451040	They had a mode called low resolution graphics where of course all graphics were low resolution back then.
451040	457040	But regular low resolution graphics, it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally.
457040	459040	But they could have 16 different colors.
459040	465040	And I wanted to make a game kind of like the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.
465040	467040	And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up.
467040	469040	And I could move a little ship around.
469040	473040	You could manage to do that in basic, but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.
473040	482040	And I remember at the time just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled,
482040	486040	where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen were basically the same thing.
486040	490040	And all those computers could scroll their text screen reasonably.
490040	492040	You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.
492040	499040	And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode.
499040	504040	And I could draw graphics and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.
504040	510040	And then the system would scroll it all up using an assembly language routine that I didn't know how to write back then.
510040	517040	So that was like this first great hack that sort of had analogs later on in my career for a lot of different things.
517040	519040	So I found out that I could draw a screen.
519040	521040	I could do a line feed at the bottom.
521040	522040	We would scroll it up once.
522040	524040	I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.
524040	533040	And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen, which was interesting in that that played a big part later on in the idSoftware days as well.
533040	544040	So do efficient drawing where you don't have to draw the whole screen, but you draw from the bottom using the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.
544040	545040	Yeah.
545040	553040	Where so much of, until recently, game design was limited by what you could actually get the computer to do.
553040	556040	Where it's easy to say, like, OK, I want to scroll the screen.
556040	559040	You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.
559040	561040	And nowadays, that works just fine.
561040	564040	Computers are ludicrously fast.
564040	570040	But up until a decade ago or so, there were all these things everybody wanted to do.
570040	582040	But if they knew enough programming to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow to be a good experience, either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.
582040	591040	So so much of kind of the first couple of decades of the programming work that I did was largely figuring out how to do something that everybody knows how they want it to happen.
591040	598040	It just has to happen two to ten times faster than sort of the straightforward way of doing things would make it happen.
598040	606040	And it's different now because at this point, lots of things you can just do in the most naive possible way and it still works out.
606040	612040	You don't have nearly the creative limitations or the incentives for optimizing on that level.
612040	614040	And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.
614040	623040	But I do generally, I'm not going to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit where back in my day, programmers had to do real programming.
623040	627040	It's amazing that you can just kind of pick an idea and go do it right now.
627040	635040	And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out how to make your wishes happen.
635040	638040	Well, there's still, see, that's true.
638040	649040	But let me put on my old man with a fist hat and say that probably the thing that will define the future still requires you to operate at the limits of the current system.
649040	651040	So we'll probably talk about this.
651040	663040	But if you talk about building the metaverse and building a VR experience that's compelling, it probably requires you to not to go to assembly or maybe not literally,
663040	668040	but sort of spiritually to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.
668040	675040	And that really was why virtual reality was specifically interesting to me where it had all the ties to.
675040	684040	You could say that even back in the early days, I have some old magazine articles that's talking about DOOM as a virtual reality experience back when just seeing anything in 3D.
684040	689040	So you could say that we've been trying to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning.
689040	701040	And in the modern era of virtual reality, especially on the mobile side of things, when it's standalone, you're basically using a cell phone chip to be able to produce these very immersive experiences.
701040	703040	It does require work.
703040	713040	It's not at the level of what an old school console game programmer would have operated at where you're looking at hardware registers and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses.
713040	721040	But it is still definitely a different level than what a web developer or even a PC steam game developer usually has to work at.
721040	722040	And again, it's great.
722040	729040	There's opportunities for people that want to operate it either into that spectrum there and still provide a lot of value to the world.
729040	735040	Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.
735040	739040	What would you say is the best programming language?
739040	742040	Your favorite, but also the best.
742040	749040	You've seen throughout your career, you're considered by many to be the greatest programmer ever.
749040	752040	I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone.
752040	754040	But if you put it on anyone, it's you.
754040	758040	So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions of what's the best band of all time.
758040	761040	But in your case, what's the best programming language?
761040	763040	Everything has all the caveats about it.
764040	771040	Nowadays, I do program a reasonable amount of Python for AIML sorts of work.
771040	774040	I'm not a native Python programmer.
774040	776040	It's something I came to very late in my career.
776040	778040	I understand what it's good for.
778040	780040	But you don't dream in Python.
780040	781040	I do not.
781040	790040	And it has some of those things where there's some amazing stats when you say if you just start, if you make a loop, a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,
790040	797040	you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower than a proper GPU tensor operation.
797040	799040	And these are staggering numbers.
799040	806040	You know, you can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.
806040	810040	So your intuition is about inefficiencies within the Python sort of?
810040	814040	It keeps hitting me upside the face where it just, it's gotten to the point now I understand.
814040	818040	It's like, OK, you just can't do a loop if you care about performance in Python.
818040	827040	You have to figure out how you can reformat this into some big vector operation or something that's going to be done completely within a C++ library.
827040	830040	But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient.
830040	835040	And you just see stuff that people are able to cobble together by just import a few different things.
835040	839040	And you can do stuff that nobody on Earth could do 10 years ago.
839040	842040	And you can do it in a little cookbook thing that you copy pasted out of a website.
842040	844040	So that is really great.
844040	850040	When I'm sitting down to do what I consider kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.
850040	858040	And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that where I'm not big into the modern template metaprogramming sorts of things.
858040	863040	I see a lot of train wrecks coming from some of that over abstraction.
863040	873040	I spent a few years really going kind of deep into the kind of historical Lisp work and Haskell and some of the functional programming sides of things.
873040	878040	And there is a lot of value there in the way you think about things.
878040	890040	And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code based on what I learned about the value that comes out of not having this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of.
890040	898040	Because something that many people don't really appreciate till they've been at it for a long time is that it's not the writing of the program initially.
898040	900040	It's the whole lifespan of the program.
900040	909040	And that's when it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates, but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change.
909040	924040	And then the thing that I've really been learning in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is it's also how well it hands off between a continuous kind of revolving door of programmers taking over maintenance and different things and how you get people up to speed in different areas.
924040	927040	And there's all these other different aspects of it.
927040	932040	C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.
932040	934040	Probably not the best.
934040	953040	And there's some really interesting aspects to this where in some cases languages that are not generally thought well of for many reasons like C is derided pretty broadly that, yes, obviously all of these security flaws that happen with the memory and unsafeness and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there.
953040	968040	But there is this underappreciated aspect to the language is so simple, anyone can go and if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace and not have to learn what paradigms they're using because there just aren't that many available.
968040	972040	I think there's some really, really well written C code.
972040	981040	I find it great that if I'm messing around with something an open BSD say, I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.
981040	989040	It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do to make whatever change that I need to.
989040	997040	While you can have more significant languages, like it's a downside of Lisp where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.
997040	1002040	I think that it did help my thinking about programming in some ways.
1002040	1017040	But the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is that if you write a huge Lisp program, you've basically invented your own kind of language and structure because it's not the primitives of the language you're using very much.
1017040	1019040	It's all of the things you've built on top of that.
1019040	1027040	And then a language like Racket, kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions, it's essentially touted as a language for building other languages.
1027040	1047040	And I understand the value of that for a tiny little project, but the idea of that for one of these long term supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me where all of those abstractions that you're like, OK, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself on all of these things that we've built on top of that.
1047040	1055040	And it was interesting to see how when Google made go, a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like, wow, this is not a state of the art language.
1055040	1058040	This language is just so simple and almost crude.
1058040	1062040	And you could see the programming language people just looking down at it.
1062040	1069040	But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying this is the good things about C. Everybody can just jump right in and use it.
1069040	1074040	You don't need to restructure your brain to write good code in it.
1074040	1079040	So I wish that I had more opportunity for doing some work in go.
1079040	1084040	Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about that I'm not fit past judgment on.
1084040	1087040	I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.
1087040	1091040	I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust just as an exercise.
1091040	1095040	But that was a few years ago and I haven't really used it since.
1095040	1099040	The best programming language is the one that works generally that you're currently using.
1099040	1106040	Because that's another trap is in almost every case I've seen when people mixed languages on a project, that's a mistake.
1106040	1112040	I would rather stay just in one language so that everybody can work across the entire thing.
1112040	1116040	And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects that use kind of React framework.
1116040	1121040	So you've got JavaScript here and then you have C++ for real work.
1121040	1125040	And then you may have Java interfacing with some other part of the Android system.
1125040	1127040	And those are all kind of horrible things.
1127040	1134040	And that was one thing that I remember talking with Boz at Facebook about it where like,
1134040	1138040	man, I wish we could have just said we're only hiring C++ programmers.
1138040	1148040	And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective, well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough with the thousands of programmers they've got there.
1148040	1155040	It is not necessarily a dying breed, but you can sure find a lot more Java or JavaScript programmers.
1155040	1161040	And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.
1161040	1168040	It's like, well, you just, you go out and you find those programmers and you don't hire the other programmers that don't do the languages that you want to use.
1168040	1177040	But right now, I guess, yeah, they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work for the UI side of things when you go find UI programmers, they're JavaScript programmers.
1177040	1187040	I wonder if that's because there's a lot of JavaScript programmers, because I do think that great programmers are rare, that it's not, you know,
1187040	1196040	if you just look at statistics of how many people are using different programming languages, that doesn't tell you the story of what the great programmers are using.
1196040	1201040	And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to, which is the fundamentals of a language.
1201040	1202040	What does it encourage you?
1202040	1206040	How does it encourage you to think what kind of systems does it encourage you to build?
1206040	1215040	There's something about C++ that has elements of creativity, but forces you to be an adult about your programming.
1215040	1217040	Well, it expects you to be an adult.
1217040	1219040	It does not force you to.
1219040	1229040	So it brings out people that are willing to be creative in terms of building large systems and coming up with interesting solutions,
1229040	1239040	but at the same time have the sort of the good software engineering practices that amend themselves to real-world systems.
1239040	1243040	Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.
1243040	1250040	So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years and humans are long gone,
1250040	1255040	something tells me that most of the systems they find will be running JavaScript.
1255040	1261040	I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation, it's written in JavaScript.
1261040	1268040	You know, for the longest time, even still, JavaScript didn't get any respect,
1268040	1272040	and yet it runs so much of the world and an increasing number of the world.
1272040	1276040	Is it possible that everything will be written in JavaScript one day?
1276040	1281040	So the engineering under JavaScript is really pretty phenomenal.
1281040	1289040	The systems that make JavaScript run as fast as it does right now are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways.
1289040	1296040	It does feel like it is not an optimal language for all the things that it's being used for
1296040	1305040	or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps in something like this without type systems and so on.
1305040	1310040	But I think for a lot of people, it does reasonably the necessary things.
1310040	1312040	It's still a C-flavored language.
1312040	1315040	It's still a braces and semicolon language.
1315040	1322040	It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript and then understand the roots of where it came from.
1322040	1328040	I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing for most programs to be written in.
1328040	1335040	It's funny that I still, just this morning, I was on, I was seeing a Twitter thread of a bunch of really senior game dev people
1335040	1338040	arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.
1338040	1342040	You will run into some people that are top-notch programmers that just say,
1342040	1344040	no, this is literally not a good thing.
1344040	1346040	Oh, because it makes you lazy?
1346040	1348040	Yes, that it makes you not think about things.
1348040	1349040	And I do disagree.
1349040	1357040	I think that there is so much objective data on the vulnerabilities that have happened in C and C++ programs,
1357040	1360040	sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.
1360040	1364040	It's like nobody is good enough to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.
1364040	1367040	You write enough C code, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.
1367040	1371040	And garbage collection is a very great thing for the vast majority of programs.
1371040	1376040	It's only when you get into the tightest of real-time things that you start saying it's like,
1376040	1380040	no, the garbage collection has more costs than it has benefits for me there,
1380040	1384040	but that's not 99 plus percent of all the software in the world.
1384040	1389040	So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.
1389040	1394040	And so much of programming is not the language itself.
1394040	1397040	It's the infrastructure around everyone that surrounds it,
1397040	1402040	all the libraries that you can get and the different ways you can deploy it,
1402040	1404040	the portability that it gives you.
1404040	1407040	And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things,
1407040	1411040	where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,
1411040	1416040	the web stack about everything that has to go when you do something really trivial in JavaScript
1416040	1420040	and it shows up on a web browser to kind of x-ray through that
1420040	1424040	and see everything that has to happen for your one little JavaScript statement
1424040	1428040	to turn into something visible in your web browser.
1428040	1433040	It's very, very disquieting, just the depth of that stack
1433040	1439040	and the fact that so few people can even comprehend all of the levels that are going on there.
1439040	1445040	But it's again, I have to caution myself to not be the in the good old days old man about it
1445040	1448040	because clearly there's enormous value here.
1448040	1453040	The world does run on JavaScript to a pretty good approximation there
1453040	1455040	and it's not falling apart.
1455040	1458040	There's a bunch of scary stuff where you look at console logs
1458040	1461040	and you just see all of these bad things that are happening,
1461040	1464040	but it's still kind of limping along and nobody really notices.
1464040	1470040	But so much of my systems design and systems analysis goes around.
1470040	1473040	You should understand what the speed of light is,
1473040	1476040	like what would be the best you could possibly do here.
1476040	1479040	And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,
1479040	1484040	you can be a thousand times off your speed of light velocity for something
1484040	1486040	and it's still be okay.
1486040	1491040	And in fact, it can even sometimes still be the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint
1491040	1496040	where there's a lot of things that you don't want to have to parachute in someone like me
1496040	1501040	to go in and say, make this web page run a thousand times faster.
1501040	1508040	Make this web app into a hardcore native application that starts up in 37 milliseconds
1508040	1511040	and everything responds in less than one frame latency.
1511040	1513040	That's just not necessary.
1513040	1517040	And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars to do software like that
1517040	1521040	when they can take somebody right out of a boot camp and say, spin up an application for this,
1521040	1527040	often being efficient is not really the best metric.
1527040	1531040	It's like that applies in a lot of areas where it's kind of interesting
1531040	1536040	how a lot of our appliances and everything are all built around energy efficiency,
1536040	1541040	sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways or higher costs in other ways
1541040	1547040	where there's interesting things where energy or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world
1547040	1550040	and that could change our engineering trade-offs for the way we build certain things
1550040	1556040	where you could throw away efficiency and actually get more benefits that actually matter.
1556040	1562040	That's one of the directions I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy
1562040	1564040	when I was kind of like, what do I want to do next?
1564040	1570040	It was either going to be cost-effective nuclear fission or artificial general intelligence.
1570040	1578040	And one of my pet ideas there is like, people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is
1578040	1584040	and there would be ways that you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less,
1584040	1591040	but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper, that could be a radical innovation and something like that.
1591040	1597040	So there's some of these thoughts around direct fission energy conversion, fission fragment conversion
1597040	1601040	that maybe you build something that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything
1601040	1603040	even if it winds up being less efficient.
1603040	1609040	So that applies a lot in programming where it's always good to know what you could do
1609040	1614040	if you really sat down and took it far because sometimes there's discontinuities
1614040	1616040	around user reaction times.
1616040	1622040	There are some points where the difference between operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,
1622040	1624040	not that huge.
1624040	1628040	You'll see it in web page statistics, but most of the usability stuff, not that great.
1628040	1633040	But if you get down to 50 milliseconds, then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.
1633040	1637040	It's just like doing your bidding instantly rather than you're giving it a command,
1637040	1640040	twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.
1640040	1645040	So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard to get over some threshold,
1645040	1650040	but there are broad basins in the value metric for lots of work
1650040	1653040	where it just doesn't pay to even go that extra mile.
1653040	1658040	And they're craftsmen that just don't want to buy that and more power to them.
1658040	1663040	If somebody just wants to say, no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work.
1663040	1666040	I'm never going to do something that's not as good as I could possibly make it.
1666040	1670040	I respect that and sometimes I am that person,
1670040	1675040	but I try to focus more on the larger value picture and you do pick your battles
1675040	1680040	and you deploy your resources into play that's going to give you sort of the best user value in the end.
1680040	1689040	Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth as a kind of programming effort,
1689040	1695040	it seems like efficiency isn't the thing that's being optimized for.
1695040	1700040	Like natural selection is very inefficient, but it kind of adapts
1700040	1704040	and through the process of adaptations, building more and more complex systems
1704040	1708040	that are more and more intelligent, the final result is kind of pretty interesting.
1708040	1711040	And so I think of JavaScript the same way.
1711040	1716040	It's like this giant mess that things naturally die off if they don't work
1716040	1721040	and if they become useful to people, they kind of naturally live
1721040	1726040	and you build this community, large community of people that are generating code
1726040	1731040	and some code is sticky, some is not and nobody knows the inefficiencies
1731040	1735040	or the efficiencies or the breaking points like how reliable this code is
1735040	1740040	and you kind of just run it, assume it works and then get unpleasantly surprised
1740040	1743040	and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.
1743040	1747040	So that's a really good analogy and we can go a lot of places with that
1747040	1751040	where in the earliest days of programming when you had finite,
1751040	1753040	you could count the bytes that you had to work on this,
1753040	1757040	you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf to be one less instruction
1757040	1760040	than the other person's multiply routine to kind of get through
1760040	1763040	and it was so perfectly crafted.
1763040	1766040	It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program
1766040	1771040	because there just were not that many, you couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways
1771040	1775040	and in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work
1775040	1779040	where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,
1779040	1783040	well, we're going to do billions and billions of programmable weights here,
1783040	1788040	you have to turn it down into something that is symbolic and crafted like that
1788040	1795040	but that's definitely not the way DNA and life and biological evolution and things work.
1795040	1801040	On the one hand, it's almost humbling how little programming code is in our bodies.
1801040	1803040	We've got a couple billion base pairs
1803040	1806040	and it all fits on a thumb drive for years now
1806040	1809040	and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.
1809040	1813040	You've got maybe 50 megabytes and this is not like Shannon Limit
1813040	1818040	perfectly information dense conveyances here.
1818040	1820040	It's like these are messy codes.
1820040	1822040	They're broken up into amino acids.
1822040	1827040	A lot of them don't do important things or they do things in very awkward ways
1827040	1831040	but it is this process of just accumulation on top of things
1831040	1837040	and you need scale, both you need scale for the population for that to work out
1837040	1840040	and in the early days in the 50s and 60s,
1840040	1844040	the ancient era of computers where you could count
1844040	1846040	when they say like when the internet started even in the 70s,
1846040	1848040	there were 18 hosts or something on it.
1848040	1850040	It was this small finite number
1850040	1854040	and you were still optimizing everything to be as good as you possibly could be
1854040	1859040	but now it's billions and billions of devices and everything going on
1859040	1863040	and you can have this very much natural evolution going on
1863040	1867040	where lots of things are tried, lots of things are blowing up,
1867040	1871040	venture capitalists lose their money when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack
1871040	1874040	and things completely failed or failed to scale
1874040	1877040	but good things do come out of it
1877040	1882040	and it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution of the way different things happen
1882040	1884040	like mentioning Hello World at the beginning.
1884040	1886040	It's funny how some little thing like that
1886040	1889040	where everybody, every programmer knows Hello World now
1889040	1892040	and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision
1892040	1895040	that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C
1895040	1898040	and early examples of things like that.
1898040	1902040	So millions of experiments are going on all the time
1902040	1906040	but some things do kind of rise to the top and win the fitness war
1906040	1910040	for whether it's mind space or programming techniques or anything.
1910040	1914040	Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called Code Golf
1914040	1919040	where people compete to write the shortest possible program for a particular task
1919040	1921040	in all the different kinds of languages
1921040	1927040	and it's really interesting to see folks kind of
1927040	1933040	that are masters of their craft really play with the limits of programming languages.
1933040	1937040	It's really beautiful to see and across all the different programming languages
1937040	1940040	you get to see some of these weird programming languages
1940040	1942040	and mainstream ones,
1942040	1945040	the difference between Python 2 and 3,
1945040	1948040	you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java
1948040	1950040	and you get to see JavaScript, all of that.
1950040	1959040	And it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth of possibility
1959040	1964040	there is within programming languages that Code Golf kind of tasks reveal.
1964040	1967040	Most of us if you do any kind of programming
1967040	1971040	with the boring kind of very vanilla type of code,
1971040	1973040	that's the way to build large systems
1973040	1976040	but it's nice to see that the possibility of creative genius
1976040	1980040	is still within those languages, it's laden within those languages.
1980040	1986040	So given that you are once again one of the greatest programmers ever,
1986040	1988040	what do you think makes a good programmer?
1988040	1991040	Maybe a good modern programmer.
1991040	1997040	So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta to the TPM organization
1997040	2002040	and my biggest point was everything that we're doing
2002040	2006040	really should flow from user value, all the good things that we're doing.
2006040	2008040	It's like we're not technical people,
2008040	2012040	it's like you shouldn't be taking pride just in the specific thing
2012040	2015040	like Code Golf is the sort of thing, it's a fun puzzle game
2015040	2018040	but that really should not be a major motivator for you.
2018040	2020040	It's like we're solving problems for people
2020040	2022040	or we're providing entertainment to people,
2022040	2024040	we're doing something of value to people
2024040	2026040	that's displacing something else in their life.
2026040	2031040	So we want to be providing a net value over what they could be doing
2031040	2033040	but instead they're choosing to use our products.
2033040	2036040	And that's where, I mean it sounds triter corny
2036040	2040040	but I fundamentally do think that's how you make the world a better place.
2040040	2045040	If you have given more value to people than it took you and your team to create
2045040	2047040	then the world's a better place.
2047040	2050040	People have gone from something of lesser value
2050040	2053040	chosen to use your product and their life feels better for that
2053040	2058040	and if you've produced that economically, that's a really good thing.
2058040	2062040	On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money
2062040	2065040	you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into a woodchipper there
2065040	2069040	and you should maybe not feel so good about what you're doing.
2069040	2073040	So being proud about like a specific architecture
2073040	2077040	or specific technology or a specific code sequence that you've done
2077040	2081040	it's great to get a little smile like a tiny little dopamine hit for that
2081040	2085040	but the top level metric should be that you're building things of value.
2085040	2089040	Now you can get into the argument about how you, you know, what is user value
2089040	2091040	how do you actually quantify that
2091040	2093040	and there can be big arguments about that
2093040	2095040	but it's easy to be able to say,
2095040	2099040	okay this pissed off user there is not getting value from what you're doing.
2099040	2101040	This user over there with the big smile on their face
2101040	2104040	the moment of delight when something happened
2104040	2106040	there's a value that's happened there.
2106040	2110040	I mean, you have to at least accept that there is a concept of user value
2110040	2113040	even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it
2113040	2116040	you can usually make relative arguments about it.
2116040	2119040	Well, this was better than this, we've improved things.
2119040	2125040	So, you know, being a servant to the user is your job when you're a developer
2125040	2130040	you want to be producing something that other people are going to find valuable
2130040	2136040	and if you are technically inclined then finding the right levers to be able to pull
2136040	2140040	to be able to make a design that's going to produce the most value
2140040	2142040	for the least amount of effort
2142040	2146040	and it always has to be kind of divide, there's a ratio there where you
2146040	2148040	it's a problem at the big tech companies
2148040	2152040	you know, whether it's, you know, MetaGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon
2152040	2155040	companies that have almost infinite money
2155040	2159040	I mean, I know their CFO will complain that it's not infinite money
2159040	2163040	but from most developer standpoints it really does feel like it
2163040	2168040	and it's almost counterintuitive that if you're working hard as a developer on something
2168040	2171040	there's always this thought, if only I had more resources
2171040	2176040	more people, more RAM, more megahertz, then my product will be better
2176040	2180040	and that sense that at certain points it's certainly true
2180040	2182040	that if you are really hamstrung by this
2182040	2187040	removing an obstacle will make a better product, make more value
2187040	2190040	but if you're not making your core design decisions
2190040	2194040	in this fiercely competitive way where you're saying
2194040	2198040	feature A or feature B, you can't just say let's do both
2198040	2201040	because then you're not making a value judgment about them
2201040	2203040	you're just saying well they both seem good
2203040	2206040	I don't want to necessarily have to pick out which one is better
2206040	2209040	or how much better and tell team B that
2209040	2213040	sorry we're not going to do this because A is more important
2213040	2217040	but that notion of always having to really critically value
2217040	2220040	what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend
2220040	2223040	even the opportunity cost of doing something else
2223040	2225040	that's super important
2225040	2228040	Well let me ask you about the big debates that you're mentioning
2228040	2232040	of how to measure value
2232040	2239040	is it possible to measure it kind of numerically
2239040	2243040	or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route
2243040	2248040	of imagining sort of somebody using a thing
2248040	2250040	and imagining a smile on their face
2250040	2254040	imagining the experience of love and joy that you have
2254040	2256040	when you use the thing
2256040	2257040	that's from a design perspective
2257040	2260040	or if you're building more like a lower level thing
2260040	2264040	for like Linux you imagine a developer that might come across this
2264040	2270040	and use it and become happy and better off because of it
2270040	2272040	so where do you land on those things
2272040	2277040	is it measurable, so I imagine like Meta and Google
2277040	2279040	will probably try to measure the thing
2279040	2282040	they'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement or something
2282040	2283040	let's measure engagement
2283040	2286040	and then I think there is a kind of
2286040	2289040	I mean I admire the designer ethic of like
2289040	2293040	think of a future that's immeasurable
2293040	2295040	and you try to make somebody in that future
2295040	2297040	that's different from today happy
2297040	2300040	so I do usually favor
2300040	2303040	if you can get any kind of a metric that's good
2303040	2305040	by all means listen to the data
2305040	2307040	but you can go too far there
2307040	2309040	where we've had problems where it's like
2309040	2310040	hey we had a performance regression
2310040	2313040	because our fancy new telemetry system
2313040	2315040	is doing a bazillion file rights
2315040	2317040	to kind of archive this stuff
2317040	2319040	because we needed to collect information to determine
2319040	2322040	if we were doing, you know, if our plans were good
2322040	2325040	so when information is available
2325040	2327040	you should never ignore it
2327040	2329040	for actual users using the thing
2329040	2331040	human beings using the thing
2331040	2333040	large number of human beings
2333040	2335040	and you get to see sort of at large numbers
2335040	2337040	so there's zero to one problem of when you're doing something really new
2337040	2339040	you do kind of have to make a guess
2339040	2342040	but one of the points that I've been making at Meta
2342040	2345040	is we have more than enough users now
2345040	2348040	that anything somebody wants to try in VR
2348040	2351040	we have users that will be interested in that
2351040	2355040	who do not get to make a completely green field blue sky pitch
2355040	2357040	and say I'm going to do this
2357040	2359040	because I think it might be interesting
2359040	2360040	I challenge everyone
2360040	2362040	there are going to be people
2362040	2365040	whether it's, you know, working in VR on your
2365040	2367040	like on your desktop replacement
2367040	2370040	or communicating with people in different ways
2370040	2372040	or playing the games
2372040	2375040	there are going to be probably millions of people
2375040	2377040	or at least if you pick some tiny niche
2377040	2379040	that we're not in right now
2379040	2381040	there are still going to be thousands of people out there
2381040	2382040	that have the headsets
2382040	2384040	that would be your target market
2384040	2385040	and I tell people
2385040	2386040	pay attention to them
2386040	2388040	don't invent fictional users
2388040	2390040	don't, you know, make an Alice Bob Charlie
2390040	2394040	that fits whatever matrix of tendencies
2394040	2396040	that you want to break the market down to
2396040	2398040	because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users
2398040	2400040	when you've got real users
2400040	2402040	that you could be working with
2402040	2404040	but, you know, on the other hand
2404040	2407040	there is value to having a kind of wholeness
2407040	2409040	of vision for a product
2409040	2413040	and companies like Meta have, you know
2413040	2415040	they understand the trade-offs
2415040	2417040	where you can have a company like SpaceX
2417040	2420040	or, you know, Apple and the Steve Jobs era
2420040	2423040	where you have a very powerful leading personality
2423040	2425040	that I, you know, that can micromanage
2425040	2427040	at a very low level and can say
2427040	2429040	it's like, no, that handle needs to be different
2429040	2432040	or that icon needs to change the tint there
2432040	2435040	and they clearly get a lot of value out of it
2435040	2437040	they also burn through a lot of employees
2437040	2439040	that have horror stories to tell about
2439040	2441040	working there afterwards
2441040	2443040	my position is that
2443040	2446040	you're at your best when you've got a leader
2446040	2449040	that is at their limit of what they can kind of comprehend
2449040	2451040	of everything below them
2451040	2453040	and they can have an informed opinion
2453040	2455040	about everything that's going on
2455040	2457040	and you take somebody, you've got to believe
2457040	2460040	that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience
2460040	2462040	you would hope that they've got wisdom
2462040	2465040	that just out of boot camp person
2465040	2467040	contributing doesn't have
2467040	2469040	and that if they're like, well, that's wrong there
2469040	2471040	you probably shouldn't do it that way
2471040	2473040	or even just don't do it that way
2473040	2474040	do it another way
2474040	2476040	so there's value there
2476040	2478040	but it can't go beyond a certain level
2478040	2480040	I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him
2480040	2482040	saying things that are just wrong
2482040	2484040	right in front of me about technical things
2484040	2487040	because he was not operating at that level
2487040	2489040	but when it does work
2489040	2492040	and you do get that kind of passionate leader
2492040	2494040	that's thinking about the entire product
2494040	2496040	and just really deeply cares about
2496040	2498040	not letting anything slip through the cracks
2498040	2500040	I think that's got a lot of value
2500040	2502040	but the other side of that is the people saying
2502040	2504040	that, well, we want to have these independent teams
2504040	2506040	that are bubbling up the ideas
2506040	2508040	because it's almost
2508040	2510040	it's anti-capitalist or anti-free market
2510040	2513040	to say it's like I want my great leader
2513040	2515040	to go ahead and dictate all these points there
2515040	2517040	where clearly free markets bring up things
2517040	2519040	that you don't expect
2519040	2521040	like in VR we saw a bunch of things
2521040	2523040	like it didn't turn out at all the way
2523040	2526040	the early people thought were going to be the key applications
2526040	2528040	and things that would not have been approved
2528040	2531040	by the dark cabal
2531040	2534040	making the decisions about what gets into the store
2534040	2537040	turn out to in some cases be extremely successful
2537040	2540040	so I definitely kind of wanted to be
2540040	2542040	there's a point where I did make a pitch
2542040	2544040	it's like, hey, make me VR dictator
2544040	2546040	and I'll go and get shit done
2546040	2549040	and that's just, it's not in the culture at Metta
2549040	2551040	and they understand the trade-offs
2551040	2553040	and that's just not the way
2553040	2555040	that's not the company that they want
2555040	2557040	the team that they want to do
2557040	2559040	It's fascinating because VR
2559040	2561040	and we'll talk about it more
2561040	2564040	it's still unclear to me
2564040	2567040	in what way VR will change the world
2567040	2569040	because it does seem clear that VR will
2569040	2571040	somehow fundamentally transform this world
2571040	2574040	and it's unclear to me how
2574040	2577040	let me know when you want to get into that
2577040	2580040	hold on a second
2580040	2583040	stick to the you being the best programmer ever
2583040	2586040	in the early days when you didn't have
2586040	2588040	adult responsibilities of leading teams
2588040	2590040	and all that kind of stuff
2590040	2593040	and you can focus on just being a programmer
2593040	2595040	what did the productive day
2595040	2598040	in the life of John Carmack look like
2598040	2601040	how many hours of the keyboard, how much sleep
2601040	2604040	how much source of calories that fueled the brain
2604040	2607040	what was it like, what time did you wake up
2607040	2610040	so I was able to be remarkably consistent
2610040	2613040	about what was good working conditions for me
2613040	2615040	for a very long time
2615040	2617040	I was never one of the programmers
2617040	2620040	that would do all-nighters going through
2620040	2622040	work for 20 hours straight
2622040	2624040	it's like my brain generally starts turning to mush
2624040	2627040	after 12 hours or so
2627040	2630040	but the hard work is really important
2630040	2632040	and I would work for decades
2632040	2634040	I would work 60 hours a week
2634040	2636040	I would work a 10 hour day, 6 days a week
2636040	2639040	and try to be productive at that
2639040	2641040	now my schedule shifted around a fair amount
2641040	2643040	when I was young without any kids
2643040	2645040	any other responsibilities
2645040	2647040	I was on one of those cycling schedules
2647040	2649040	where I'd kind of get in an hour later
2649040	2652040	each day and roll around through the entire time
2652040	2654040	and I'd wind up kind of pulling in
2654040	2656040	at 2 or 3 in the afternoon sometimes
2656040	2658040	and then working again past midnight
2658040	2660040	or 2 in the morning
2660040	2663040	and that was when it was just me
2663040	2665040	trying to make things happen
2665040	2668040	and I was usually isolated off in my office
2668040	2670040	people generally didn't bother me much
2670040	2673040	and I could get a lot of programming work done
2673040	2675040	that way
2675040	2677040	I did settle into a more normal schedule
2677040	2679040	when I was taking kids to school
2679040	2680040	and things like that
2680040	2682040	So kids were the forcing function
2682040	2684040	that got you to wake up at the same time
2684040	2686040	It's not clear to me that there was
2686040	2688040	much of a difference in the productivity
2688040	2689040	with that
2689040	2691040	where I kind of feel
2691040	2693040	if I just get up when I feel like it
2693040	2695040	it's usually a little later each day
2695040	2697040	but I just recently made
2697040	2699040	the focusing decision to try to push my schedule
2699040	2701040	back a little bit earlier to
2701040	2703040	getting up at 8 in the morning
2703040	2705040	and trying to shift things around
2705040	2707040	I'm often doing experiments
2707040	2709040	with myself about what should I be doing
2709040	2711040	to be more productive
2711040	2713040	and one of the things that I did realize
2713040	2715040	was happening in recent months
2715040	2718040	where I would go for
2718040	2719040	a walk or a run
2719040	2721040	I cover like four miles a day
2721040	2723040	and I would usually do that
2723040	2725040	just as the sun's going down
2725040	2726040	here in Texas now
2726040	2728040	and it's still really damn hot
2728040	2730040	but I'd go out at 8.30 or something
2730040	2732040	and cover the time there
2732040	2733040	and then the showering
2733040	2735040	and it was putting a hole in my day
2735040	2737040	where I would have still a couple hours
2737040	2738040	after that
2738040	2740040	and sometimes my best hours were at night
2740040	2741040	when nobody else is around
2741040	2742040	nobody's bothering me
2742040	2744040	but that hole in the day was a problem
2744040	2746040	so just a couple weeks ago
2746040	2748040	I made the change to go ahead
2748040	2750040	and say alright I'm going to get up a little earlier
2750040	2752040	I'm going to do a walk or get out there first
2752040	2754040	so I can have more uninterrupted time
2754040	2756040	so I'm still playing with factors like this
2756040	2760040	as I kind of optimize my work efforts
2760040	2762040	but it's always been
2762040	2764040	it was 60 hours a week
2764040	2765040	for a very long time
2765040	2767040	to some degree I had a little thing
2767040	2769040	in the back of my head where I was almost jealous
2769040	2770040	of some of the programmers
2770040	2772040	that would do these marathon sessions
2772040	2773040	and I had like Dave Taylor
2773040	2774040	one of the guys that he had
2774040	2775040	he would be one of those people
2775040	2777040	that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes
2777040	2779040	and all the kind of classic hacker tropes
2779040	2780040	about things
2780040	2782040	and a part of me was like
2782040	2784040	always a little bothered that that wasn't me
2784040	2786040	that I wouldn't go program
2786040	2787040	20 hours straight
2787040	2789040	because I'm falling apart
2789040	2792040	and not being very effective after 12 hours
2792040	2793040	I mean yeah 12 hour programming
2793040	2795040	that's fine when you're doing that
2795040	2798040	but you're not doing smart work
2798040	2799040	much after
2799040	2800040	at least I'm not
2800040	2801040	but there's a range of people
2801040	2802040	I mean that's something that a lot of people
2802040	2804040	don't really get in their gut
2804040	2805040	where there are people
2805040	2807040	that work on four hours of sleep
2807040	2808040	and are smart
2808040	2809040	and can continue to do good work
2809040	2810040	but then there's a lot of people
2810040	2812040	that just fall apart
2812040	2814040	so I do tell people that
2814040	2816040	I always try to get eight hours of sleep
2816040	2817040	it's not this
2817040	2819040	you know push yourself harder
2819040	2820040	get up earlier
2820040	2821040	I just do worse work
2821040	2823040	where I know there's
2823040	2824040	you can work a hundred hours a week
2824040	2826040	and still get eight hours of sleep
2826040	2828040	if you just kind of prioritize things correctly
2828040	2830040	but I do believe in working hard
2830040	2832040	working a lot
2832040	2834040	there was a comment that
2834040	2836040	Game Dev made that
2836040	2838040	that I know there's a backlash
2838040	2839040	against really hard work
2839040	2840040	in a lot of cases
2840040	2842040	and I get into online arguments
2842040	2843040	about this all the time
2843040	2845040	but it was basically saying
2845040	2846040	yeah 40 hours a week
2846040	2847040	that's kind of a part-time job
2847040	2849040	and if you were really in it
2849040	2851040	you're doing what you think is important
2851040	2853040	what you're passionate about
2853040	2855040	working more gets more done
2855040	2858040	and it's just really not
2858040	2859040	possible to argue with that
2859040	2861040	if you've been around the people
2861040	2863040	that work with that level of intensity
2863040	2864040	and just say
2864040	2865040	it's like no
2865040	2866040	they should just stop
2866040	2867040	and we had
2867040	2869040	I kind of came back around to that
2869040	2870040	a couple years ago
2870040	2873040	where I was using the fictional example of
2873040	2874040	alright
2874040	2875040	some people say
2875040	2877040	they'll say with a straight face
2877040	2878040	they think no
2878040	2879040	you are less productive
2879040	2881040	if you work more than 40 hours a week
2881040	2883040	and they're generally misinterpreting things
2883040	2885040	where your marginal productivity
2885040	2887040	for an hour after eight hours
2887040	2889040	is less than in one of your peak hours
2889040	2891040	but you're not literally getting less done
2891040	2893040	there is a point where you start breaking things
2893040	2894040	and getting worse
2894040	2896040	worse behavior and everything out of it
2896040	2898040	where you're literally going backwards
2898040	2901040	but it's not at eight or ten or twelve hours
2901040	2903040	and the fictional example I would use was
2903040	2905040	imagine there's an asteroid
2905040	2907040	coming to impact
2907040	2908040	to crash into earth
2908040	2910040	destroy all of human life
2910040	2912040	do you want
2912040	2913040	Elon Musk
2913040	2914040	or the people working at SpaceX
2914040	2916040	that are building the interceptor
2916040	2918040	that's going to deflect the asteroid
2918040	2920040	do you want them to clock out at five
2920040	2921040	because damn it
2921040	2923040	they're just going to do worse work
2923040	2925040	if they work another couple hours
2925040	2927040	and you know it seems absurd
2927040	2929040	and that's a hypothetical though
2929040	2930040	and everyone can dismiss that
2930040	2932040	but then when coronavirus was hitting
2932040	2934040	and you have all of these medical personnel
2934040	2936040	that are clearly pushing themselves
2936040	2938040	really really hard
2938040	2939040	and I'd say it's like
2939040	2940040	okay
2940040	2942040	do you want all of these scientists
2942040	2944040	working on treatments and vaccines
2944040	2945040	and caring for all of these people
2945040	2947040	are they really screwing everything up
2947040	2949040	by working more than eight hours a day
2949040	2951040	and of course people say
2951040	2953040	I'm just an asshole to say something like that
2953040	2955040	but it's the truth
2955040	2957040	working longer gets more done
2957040	2959040	so that's kind of
2959040	2961040	the layer one
2961040	2963040	but I'd like to also say that
2963040	2965040	at least I believe
2965040	2967040	depending on the person, depending on the task
2967040	2969040	working more
2969040	2971040	and harder
2971040	2973040	will make
2973040	2975040	you better for the next week
2975040	2977040	in those peak hours
2977040	2979040	so there's something about
2979040	2981040	a deep dedication to a thing
2981040	2983040	that
2983040	2985040	kind of gets deep in you
2985040	2987040	so the hard work isn't just about
2987040	2989040	the raw hours of productivity
2989040	2991040	it's the
2991040	2993040	it's the thing it does to you
2993040	2995040	in the weeks
2995040	2997040	and months after too
2997040	2999040	you're tempering yourself in some ways
2999040	3001040	and I think you know it's like
3001040	3003040	you know dreams of sushi
3003040	3005040	if you really dedicate yourself completely
3005040	3007040	to making the sushi
3007040	3009040	to really putting in the long hours
3009040	3011040	day after day after day
3011040	3013040	you become a true craftsman
3013040	3015040	of the thing you're doing
3015040	3017040	now there's of course discussions about
3017040	3019040	are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships
3019040	3021040	are you sacrificing a lot of other possible
3021040	3023040	things you could do with that time
3023040	3025040	but if you're talking about purely
3025040	3027040	being
3027040	3029040	a master
3029040	3031040	of your art
3031040	3033040	that more hours isn't just about
3033040	3035040	doing more
3035040	3037040	it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing
3037040	3039040	and I don't gain say anybody that
3039040	3041040	wants to work the minimum amount
3041040	3043040	they've got other priorities in their life
3043040	3045040	my only argument that I'm making
3045040	3047040	it's not that everybody should work hard
3047040	3049040	it's that if you want to accomplish something
3049040	3051040	working longer and harder
3051040	3053040	is the path to getting it accomplished
3053040	3055040	well let me ask you about this then
3055040	3057040	why the mythical
3057040	3059040	work-life balance
3061040	3063040	for an engineer it seems like
3063040	3065040	that's one of the professions
3065040	3067040	for a programmer
3067040	3069040	where
3069040	3071040	working hard does lead to
3071040	3073040	greater productivity in it
3073040	3075040	but it also raises the question
3075040	3077040	of
3077040	3079040	personal relationships
3079040	3081040	and all that kind of stuff family
3081040	3083040	how are you able to
3083040	3085040	find work-life balance
3085040	3087040	you can give maybe even outside yourself
3087040	3089040	have you been able to arrive
3089040	3091040	at any wisdom on this
3091040	3093040	part in your years of life
3093040	3095040	I do think that there's a wide range of people
3095040	3097040	where different people have different needs
3097040	3099040	it's not a one size fits all
3099040	3101040	certainly what works for me
3101040	3103040	I can tell enough
3103040	3105040	that I'm
3105040	3107040	different than a typical average person
3107040	3109040	in the way things impact me
3109040	3111040	the things that I want to do
3111040	3113040	my goals are different
3113040	3115040	my endeavors to impact things
3115040	3117040	are different where
3117040	3119040	I have literally never
3119040	3121040	felt burnout and I know
3121040	3123040	there's lots of brilliant smart people
3123040	3125040	that do world-leading work
3125040	3127040	that get burned out and
3127040	3129040	it's never hit me
3129040	3131040	I've never been at a point where
3131040	3133040	I'm like
3133040	3135040	I just don't care about this
3135040	3137040	I don't want to do this anymore
3137040	3139040	but I've always had the flexibility
3139040	3141040	to work on lots of interesting things
3141040	3143040	and have a great time working on that
3143040	3145040	and so much of that
3145040	3147040	so much of the ability to actually work hard
3147040	3149040	is the ability to have multiple things
3149040	3151040	to choose from and to use
3151040	3153040	your time on the most appropriate thing
3153040	3155040	there are time periods
3155040	3157040	where it's the best time
3157040	3159040	for me to read a new research paper
3159040	3161040	that I need to really be thinking hard about it
3161040	3163040	then there's a time that maybe I should just
3163040	3165040	scan and organize my old notes
3165040	3167040	because I'm just not on top of things
3167040	3169040	then there's the time that
3169040	3171040	let's go bang out a few hundred lines
3171040	3173040	of code for something
3173040	3175040	so switching between them
3175040	3177040	has been real valuable
3177040	3179040	so you always have kind of joined
3179040	3181040	your heart for all the things you're doing
3181040	3183040	and that is the kind of work-life
3183040	3185040	balance as a first step
3185040	3187040	so you're always happy
3187040	3189040	well happy
3189040	3191040	a lot of people would say that often
3191040	3193040	I look like kind of a grim person
3193040	3195040	with just sitting there with a neutral expression
3195040	3197040	or even like knitted brows and a frown
3197040	3199040	on my face as I'm staring at something
3199040	3201040	that's what happiness looks like for you
3201040	3203040	yeah it's kind of true
3203040	3205040	where that's like okay I'm pushing
3205040	3207040	through this I'm making progress here
3207040	3209040	I am you know
3209040	3211040	I know that doesn't work for everyone
3211040	3213040	I know it doesn't work for most people
3213040	3215040	but what I am always trying to do
3215040	3217040	in those cases is I don't want to let
3217040	3219040	somebody that might be a person like that
3219040	3221040	be told by someone else that
3221040	3223040	no don't try it don't even try
3223040	3225040	that out as an option where
3225040	3227040	I you know work-life balance
3227040	3229040	versus kind of your life's work
3229040	3231040	where there's a small subset
3231040	3233040	of the people that can be very happy
3233040	3235040	being obsessive about things
3235040	3237040	and you know obsession
3237040	3239040	can often get things done
3239040	3241040	that just practical, prudent
3241040	3243040	pedestrian work won't
3243040	3245040	or at least won't for a very long time
3245040	3247040	there's legends of
3247040	3249040	your nutritional intake
3249040	3251040	in the early days
3251040	3253040	what can you say about
3253040	3255040	being a program
3255040	3257040	as a kind of athlete
3257040	3259040	so what
3259040	3261040	what was the nutrition that fueled
3261040	3263040	I have never been that great
3263040	3265040	on really
3265040	3267040	paying attention to it where
3267040	3269040	I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot
3269040	3271040	you know I've never been like a big heavy guy
3271040	3273040	but it was
3273040	3275040	interesting where one of the things that I can remember
3275040	3277040	being an unhappy teenager not having
3277040	3279040	enough money and like one of the things
3279040	3281040	that bothered me about not having enough money
3281040	3283040	is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to
3283040	3285040	so I got rich and then
3285040	3287040	I bought a whole lot of pizza
3287040	3289040	that was the defining like that's what being rich felt like
3289040	3291040	there was a lot of little things
3291040	3293040	like I could buy all the pizza and comic books
3293040	3295040	and video games that I wanted to
3295040	3297040	and it really
3297040	3299040	didn't take that much
3299040	3301040	but the pizza was one of those things
3301040	3303040	and it's absolutely true that for a long time
3303040	3305040	it did software I had a pizza
3305040	3307040	delivered every single day you know the delivery guy
3307040	3309040	knew me my name
3309040	3311040	and I didn't find out until years later
3311040	3313040	that apparently I was such a good
3313040	3315040	customer that they just never raised
3315040	3317040	the price on me and I was using this
3317040	3319040	six year old price for the pizzas that they
3319040	3321040	were still kind of sending my way every day
3321040	3323040	so you were doing
3323040	3325040	eating once a day
3325040	3327040	or were you... it would be spread out
3327040	3329040	you know you have a few pieces of pizza you have some more later on
3329040	3331040	and I'd maybe have something at home
3331040	3333040	it was one of the nice things
3333040	3335040	that Facebook meta is
3335040	3337040	they do they feed you quite well you get
3337040	3339040	a different
3339040	3341040	I guess now it's doordash sorts of things delivered
3341040	3343040	but they take care of making sure that everybody
3343040	3345040	does get well fed
3345040	3347040	and I probably had better food those
3347040	3349040	six years that I was working in the meta office
3349040	3351040	there than I used to before
3351040	3353040	but I
3353040	3355040	it's worked out okay for me my health has always been good
3355040	3357040	I get a pretty good amount of exercise
3357040	3359040	and I don't
3359040	3361040	eat to excess and I avoid a lot of other
3361040	3363040	kind of not so good for you
3363040	3365040	things so I'm still doing quite well
3365040	3367040	did you have
3367040	3369040	a kind of
3369040	3371040	I don't know
3371040	3373040	spiritual experience with food
3373040	3375040	or coffee or any of that kind of stuff
3375040	3377040	I mean
3377040	3379040	the programming experience with music
3379040	3381040	or
3381040	3383040	like I listen to brown noise on a program
3383040	3385040	or like creating an environment
3385040	3387040	and the things you take into your body
3387040	3389040	just everything you construct
3389040	3391040	can become a kind of ritual that
3391040	3393040	empowers the whole process the program
3393040	3395040	relationship with pizza or
3395040	3397040	it would really be with Diet Coke
3397040	3399040	there still is that sense of
3399040	3401040	drop the can down crack open the can
3401040	3403040	of Diet Coke alright now I mean business
3403040	3405040	we're getting to work here
3405040	3407040	still to this day
3407040	3409040	is Diet Coke a still partner
3409040	3411040	yeah probably 8 or 9 a day
3411040	3413040	nice okay
3413040	3415040	what about your setup
3415040	3417040	how many screens
3417040	3419040	what kind of keyboard is there something interesting
3419040	3421040	what kind of IDE
3421040	3423040	Linux what operating system
3423040	3425040	laptop or any interesting
3425040	3427040	thing that brings you joy
3427040	3429040	so I kind of migrated cultures
3429040	3431040	where early on through all of game dev
3431040	3433040	there was sort of one culture there
3433040	3435040	which was really quite distinct from the more
3435040	3437040	the Silicon Valley venture
3437040	3439040	you know culture for things
3439040	3441040	it's their different groups and they have
3441040	3443040	pretty different mores and the way they think about things
3443040	3445040	where and I still do
3445040	3447040	think a lot of the big companies can learn
3447040	3449040	can learn things from
3449040	3451040	the hardcore game development side of things
3451040	3453040	where it still boggles my mind
3453040	3455040	how hostile
3455040	3457040	to debuggers and IDEs
3457040	3459040	that so much of them
3459040	3461040	the kind of big money get billions of dollars
3461040	3463040	Silicon Valley venture backed
3463040	3465040	funds are
3465040	3467040	sorry so you're saying like
3467040	3469040	big companies like Google and Meta are hostile
3469040	3471040	to they are not big on
3471040	3473040	debuggers and IDEs like
3473040	3475040	so much of it is like emacs BIM
3475040	3477040	for things and we just assume
3477040	3479040	that debuggers don't work
3479040	3481040	most of the time for the systems
3481040	3483040	and a lot of this comes from a sort of
3483040	3485040	Linux bias on a lot of things
3485040	3487040	where I did come up through
3487040	3489040	the personal computers and then the DOS
3489040	3491040	and then I am windows
3491040	3493040	and it was
3493040	3495040	Borland tools and then visual studio
3495040	3497040	and
3497040	3499040	you appreciate the buggers
3499040	3501040	very much so I mean a debugger is how you
3501040	3503040	get a view into a system that's too complicated
3503040	3505040	to understand I mean anybody that thinks
3505040	3507040	just read the code and think about it
3507040	3509040	that's an insane statement in the
3509040	3511040	you can't even read all the code on a big system
3511040	3513040	you have to do experiments
3513040	3515040	on the system and doing that
3515040	3517040	by adding log statements
3517040	3519040	recompiling and rerunning it
3519040	3521040	is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it
3521040	3523040	I mean yes you can always
3523040	3525040	get things done even if you're working with stone
3525040	3527040	knives and bear skins that's
3527040	3529040	that is the mark of a good programmer is
3529040	3531040	that given any tools you will figure
3531040	3533040	out a way to get it done but
3533040	3535040	it's amazing what you can do with
3535040	3537040	sometimes much much better tools
3537040	3539040	where instead of just going through this
3539040	3541040	iterative compile run
3541040	3543040	debug cycle and you have the
3543040	3545040	you have the old Lisp direction of like
3545040	3547040	you've got a REPL and you're working interactively
3547040	3549040	and doing amazing things there but
3549040	3551040	in many cases a debugger as a very powerful
3551040	3553040	user interface that can
3553040	3555040	stop examine all the different things in your
3555040	3557040	program set all these different breakpoints
3557040	3559040	and of course you can do that with GDB
3559040	3561040	or whatever there but
3561040	3563040	this is one of the user interface fundamental
3563040	3565040	principles where when something is
3565040	3567040	complicated to do you won't
3567040	3569040	use it very often there's people
3569040	3571040	that will break out GDB when they're at
3571040	3573040	their wits end and they just have beat
3573040	3575040	their head against a problem for so long
3575040	3577040	but for somebody that kind of grew
3577040	3579040	up in game dev it's like they were running into
3579040	3581040	the debugger anyways before they even knew
3581040	3583040	there was a problem and you would just
3583040	3585040	stop and see you know what was happening
3585040	3587040	and sometimes you could fix things even before
3587040	3589040	you you know even
3589040	3591040	before you did one compile cycle you could
3591040	3593040	be in the debugger and you'd say well I'm just
3593040	3595040	going to change this right here and yep
3595040	3597040	that did the job and fix it and go on
3597040	3599040	and for people that don't know GDB is
3599040	3601040	sort of popular I guess Linux
3601040	3603040	debugger
3603040	3605040	primarily for C++
3605040	3607040	they handle most of the languages but
3607040	3609040	it's you know it's based on C as the
3609040	3611040	original kind of Unix heritage
3611040	3613040	and it's kind of like command line it's not user friendly
3613040	3615040	it's not it doesn't allow for clean
3615040	3617040	visualizations and you're exactly right
3617040	3619040	so that you're using this kind of debugger
3619040	3621040	usually when you're at what's end
3621040	3623040	and there's a problem that you can't figure out
3623040	3625040	why by just looking at the codes if to
3625040	3627040	find it that's how I guess
3627040	3629040	normal programmers use it but you're
3629040	3631040	saying there should be tools that kind of
3631040	3633040	visualize and help you as
3633040	3635040	part of the programming process
3635040	3637040	just the normal programming process
3637040	3639040	to understand the
3639040	3641040	code deeper. Yeah when I'm working on
3641040	3643040	like my CC++ code
3643040	3645040	I'm always running it from the debugger
3645040	3647040	you know just I type in the code
3647040	3649040	I run it many times the first thing I
3649040	3651040	do after writing code is
3651040	3653040	set a breakpoint and step through the function
3653040	3655040	now other people will say it's like oh I do that in my head
3655040	3657040	well your head is a faulty
3657040	3659040	interpreter of all those things there
3659040	3661040	and I've written brand new code
3661040	3663040	I want to step in there and I'm going to single
3663040	3665040	step through that examine lots of things
3665040	3667040	and see if it's actually doing what I expected
3667040	3669040	it to. It is
3669040	3671040	a kind of companion
3671040	3673040	the debugger like
3673040	3675040	you're now coding in an interactive way with another
3675040	3677040	being
3677040	3679040	the debugger is a kind of dumb
3679040	3681040	being but it's a reliable being
3681040	3683040	that is an interesting question of what role
3683040	3685040	does AI play in that kind of
3685040	3687040	with codex and these kind of
3687040	3689040	ability to generate
3689040	3691040	code might be you might
3691040	3693040	start having tools that
3693040	3695040	understand the code in interesting
3695040	3697040	deep ways that can work with you.
3697040	3699040	I mean there's a whole spectrum there
3699040	3701040	from static code analyzers
3701040	3703040	and various kind of dynamic tools
3703040	3705040	they're up to AI that can
3705040	3707040	conceivably grok these programs that
3707040	3709040	literally no human can understand
3709040	3711040	they're too big, too intertwined, too
3711040	3713040	interconnected but it's not beyond
3713040	3715040	the possibility of understanding
3715040	3717040	it's just beyond what we can hold
3717040	3719040	in our heads as kind of mutable state
3719040	3721040	while we're working on things
3721040	3723040	and I'm a big proponent
3723040	3725040	again of things like static analyzers
3725040	3727040	and some of that stuff where
3727040	3729040	you'll find some people that don't like
3729040	3731040	being scolded by a program
3731040	3733040	for how they've written something where
3733040	3735040	it's like oh I know better and sometimes
3735040	3737040	you do but that was something that
3737040	3739040	I was it was very
3739040	3741040	very valuable for me when
3741040	3743040	not too many people get an opportunity
3743040	3745040	like this to have this is almost one of those
3745040	3747040	spiritual experiences as a programmer and
3747040	3749040	awakening to
3749040	3751040	the id software code bases were a couple
3751040	3753040	million lines of code and
3753040	3755040	at one point I had used a few of the
3755040	3757040	different analysis tools but
3757040	3759040	I made a point to really
3759040	3761040	go through and scrub the code base
3761040	3763040	using every tool that I could find
3763040	3765040	and it was eye-opening where we had
3765040	3767040	a reputation for having some of the
3767040	3769040	most robust strongest code
3769040	3771040	where there were some great things
3771040	3773040	that I remember hearing from
3773040	3775040	Microsoft telling us about crashes on XBox
3775040	3777040	and we had this tiny number that they said
3777040	3779040	were probably literally hardware
3779040	3781040	errors and then you have other
3781040	3783040	significant titles that just have
3783040	3785040	millions of faults that are getting recorded
3785040	3787040	so I was proud of our code on a lot
3787040	3789040	of levels but when I took this
3789040	3791040	code analysis squeegee through
3791040	3793040	everything it was
3793040	3795040	it was shocking how many
3795040	3797040	errors there were in there things
3797040	3799040	that you can say okay this was this was
3799040	3801040	a copy paste not changing something right
3801040	3803040	here lots of things that were
3803040	3805040	the most the most common problem
3805040	3807040	was something in a printf
3807040	3809040	format string that was the wrong data type
3809040	3811040	that could cause crashes there and
3811040	3813040	you really want the warnings for things like
3813040	3815040	that then the next most common was
3815040	3817040	missing a check for null that could actually
3817040	3819040	happen that could blow things up and
3819040	3821040	those are obviously like top CC
3821040	3823040	plus plus things everybody has those problems
3823040	3825040	but the long tail of all
3825040	3827040	of the different little things that could go wrong
3827040	3829040	there and we had good programmers
3829040	3831040	and my own code so that I'd be looking at
3831040	3833040	it's like oh I wrote that code that's definitely
3833040	3835040	wrong we've been using this for
3835040	3837040	a year and
3837040	3839040	it's this somewhere you know this
3839040	3841040	mine sitting there waiting for us to step on
3841040	3843040	and
3843040	3845040	it was humbling it was and I
3845040	3847040	reached the conclusion that
3847040	3849040	anything that can be syntactically
3849040	3851040	allowed in your language
3851040	3853040	if I'm it's going to show up
3853040	3855040	eventually in a large enough code base
3855040	3857040	I you're not going to good intentions
3857040	3859040	aren't going to keep it from happening
3859040	3861040	you need automated tools and guard
3861040	3863040	rails for things and those start with
3863040	3865040	things like static types and or even
3865040	3867040	type hints in the more dynamic languages
3867040	3869040	but the people that
3869040	3871040	rebel against that that basically
3871040	3873040	say that slows me down
3873040	3875040	doing that there's something to that I get
3875040	3877040	that I've written you know I cobbled things
3877040	3879040	together in a notebook I
3879040	3881040	like wow this is great that it just happened
3881040	3883040	but yeah that's kind of sketchy but it's working
3883040	3885040	fine I don't care it does come back to
3885040	3887040	that that value analysis
3887040	3889040	where sometimes it's right to not care
3889040	3891040	but when you do care
3891040	3893040	if it's going to be something that's going to
3893040	3895040	live for years and it's going to have other people
3895040	3897040	working on it I and it's going to be
3897040	3899040	deployed to millions of people
3899040	3901040	then you want to use all of these tools
3901040	3903040	you want to be told it's like no you
3903040	3905040	screwed up here here and here and that does
3905040	3907040	require kind of an ego check about
3907040	3909040	things where you have
3909040	3911040	to to be open to the fact
3911040	3913040	that everything that you're doing is just littered
3913040	3915040	with flaws it's not that oh you
3915040	3917040	occasionally have a bad day it's just
3917040	3919040	whatever stream of code you output
3919040	3921040	there's going to be a statistical regularity
3921040	3923040	of things that you just make mistakes
3923040	3925040	on and I
3925040	3927040	and I do think there's the whole
3927040	3929040	argument about test-driven design
3929040	3931040	and unit testing versus kind
3931040	3933040	of analysis and different things
3933040	3935040	I am more in favor of the analysis
3935040	3937040	and the stuff that just like you can't run
3937040	3939040	your program until you fix this rather
3939040	3941040	than you can run it and hopefully
3941040	3943040	a unit test will catch it in some way
3943040	3945040	yeah in my private code
3945040	3947040	I have asserts everywhere
3947040	3949040	just there's something
3949040	3951040	pleasant to me
3951040	3953040	pleasurable to me about sort of the
3953040	3955040	dictatorial rule of like
3955040	3957040	this should be true at this point
3957040	3959040	in too many
3959040	3961040	times
3961040	3963040	I've made mistakes
3963040	3965040	that shouldn't have been made
3965040	3967040	and I would assume
3967040	3969040	I wouldn't be the kind of person that would make that mistake
3969040	3971040	but I keep making that mistake therefore
3971040	3973040	an assert really catches me
3973040	3975040	really helps all the time
3975040	3977040	so my code I would say like
3977040	3979040	10 to 20 percent of my private code
3979040	3981040	just for personal use is probably
3981040	3983040	and there are active comments
3983040	3985040	one of those things that in theory
3985040	3987040	they don't make any difference to the program
3987040	3989040	and if it was all operating the way
3989040	3991040	you expected it would be then
3991040	3993040	they will never fire
3993040	3995040	but even if you have it right
3995040	3997040	and you wrote the code right initially
3997040	3999040	then circumstances change
3999040	4001040	the world outside your program changes
4001040	4003040	and in fact that's one of the things where
4003040	4005040	I'm kind of fond
4005040	4007040	in a lot of cases of static array size
4007040	4009040	declarations where I went through this
4009040	4011040	period where it's like okay now we have general
4011040	4013040	collection classes we should just make everything
4013040	4015040	variable because
4015040	4017040	I had this history of in the early days
4017040	4019040	you get doom which had
4019040	4021040	some fixed limits on it then everybody started
4021040	4023040	making crazier and crazier things and they kept bumping
4023040	4025040	up the different limits this many lines
4025040	4027040	this many sectors
4027040	4029040	and it seemed like a good idea
4029040	4031040	well we should just make this completely generic
4031040	4033040	it can go kind of go up to whatever
4033040	4035040	and
4035040	4037040	there's cases where that's the right thing to do
4037040	4039040	but it also the other
4039040	4041040	aspect of the world changing around you
4041040	4043040	is it's good to be informed
4043040	4045040	when the world has changed more than you thought
4045040	4047040	it would and if you've got a continuously
4047040	4049040	growing collection you're never going to
4049040	4051040	find out you might have this quadratic
4051040	4053040	slowdown on something where you thought
4053040	4055040	oh I'm only ever going to have a handful
4055040	4057040	of these but something changes
4057040	4059040	and there's a new design style and all of a sudden
4059040	4061040	you've got 10,000 of them
4061040	4063040	so I kind of like in many cases
4063040	4065040	picking a number
4065040	4067040	of some nice brown power of 2 number
4067040	4069040	and setting it up in there
4069040	4071040	and having an assert saying it's like hey
4071040	4073040	you hit this limit
4073040	4075040	you should probably think are the choices that you've
4075040	4077040	made around all of this still relevant
4077040	4079040	if somebody's using 10 times
4079040	4081040	more than you thought they would
4081040	4083040	yeah this code was originally written
4083040	4085040	with this kind of world view
4085040	4087040	with this kind of set of constraints
4087040	4089040	you were thinking of the world in this way
4089040	4091040	if something breaks
4091040	4093040	that means you got to rethink the initial stuff
4093040	4095040	and it's nice for it to
4095040	4097040	for it to do that
4097040	4099040	is there any stuff like keyboard
4099040	4101040	or monitors
4101040	4103040	I'm fairly pedestrian on
4103040	4105040	a lot of that where I did move
4105040	4107040	to triple monitors like in the last several
4107040	4109040	years though I had been dual monitor
4109040	4111040	for a very long time and
4111040	4113040	and it was one of those things where
4113040	4115040	probably years later than
4115040	4117040	I should have I'm just like well the video cards now
4117040	4119040	generally have three output ports
4119040	4121040	I should just put the third monitor up there
4121040	4123040	that's been a pure win I've been very happy with that
4123040	4125040	but no
4125040	4127040	I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse
4127040	4129040	or anything
4129040	4131040	the key things is an IDE that has
4131040	4133040	helpful debuggers has helpful tools
4133040	4135040	so it's not the emacs
4135040	4137040	vim route and then die coke
4137040	4139040	yeah so I did spend you know I
4139040	4141040	spent one of my week long retreats
4141040	4143040	where I'm like okay I'm going to make myself
4143040	4145040	use it was actually
4145040	4147040	classic vi which I know people will say you should never
4147040	4149040	have done that you should have just used vim
4149040	4151040	but you know I gave it the good try
4151040	4153040	it's like okay I'm being in
4153040	4155040	kind of classic Unix developer mode
4155040	4157040	here and I worked
4157040	4159040	for a week on it I used
4159040	4161040	Anki to like teach myself the
4161040	4163040	the different little key combinations for
4163040	4165040	things like that and in the end it was just like
4165040	4167040	alright this was kind of like my
4167040	4169040	Civil War reenactment phase you know it's
4169040	4171040	like I'm going out there doing it like they used to
4171040	4173040	in the old days and it was kind of fun
4173040	4175040	in that regard so many people right now
4175040	4177040	screaming
4177040	4179040	as they're listening to this so again the
4179040	4181040	out is that this was not modern vim
4181040	4183040	but still I yes
4183040	4185040	I was very happy to get back to
4185040	4187040	my visual studio at the end
4187040	4189040	yeah I'm actually I struggle with this a lot
4189040	4191040	because
4191040	4193040	so use a kinesis keyboard and
4193040	4195040	I use emacs primarily
4195040	4197040	and I feel like
4197040	4199040	I can exactly as you said
4199040	4201040	I can understand the code I can navigate the
4201040	4203040	code there's a lot of stuff you could build
4203040	4205040	within emacs with using lisp
4205040	4207040	you can customize a lot of things for yourself
4207040	4209040	to help you
4209040	4211040	introspect the code like to help
4211040	4213040	you understand the code and visualize different
4213040	4215040	aspects of the code you can even run the buggers
4215040	4217040	but it's work
4217040	4219040	and the world moves past you
4219040	4221040	and the better and better ideas that constantly
4221040	4223040	being built and that
4223040	4225040	puts a kind of
4225040	4227040	I need to take the same kind of
4227040	4229040	retreat as you're talking about but now
4229040	4231040	I'm still fighting the Civil War
4231040	4233040	I need to kind of move into the 21st century
4233040	4235040	and it does seem like the world is
4235040	4237040	or a large chunk of the world is moving
4237040	4239040	towards visual studio code which is
4239040	4241040	kind of interesting to me against the javascript
4241040	4243040	ecosystem on the one hand
4243040	4245040	and IDs are one of those
4245040	4247040	things that you want to be infinitely
4247040	4249040	fast you want them to just kind of
4249040	4251040	immediately respond
4251040	4253040	and like I mean heck I've got there's someone
4253040	4255040	I know I'm an old school game dev guy
4255040	4257040	that still uses visual studio 6
4257040	4259040	and on a modern computer
4259040	4261040	everything is just absolutely
4261040	4263040	instant on something like that
4263040	4265040	because it was made to work on a computer that's
4265040	4267040	10,000 or 100,000
4267040	4269040	times slower so just everything happens
4269040	4271040	immediately and all the
4271040	4273040	modern systems just feel
4273040	4275040	you know they feel so crufty when
4275040	4277040	it's like oh why is this refreshing the screen
4277040	4279040	and moving around and updating over here
4279040	4281040	and something blinks down there and you should
4281040	4283040	update this and there's
4283040	4285040	you know there are things that
4285040	4287040	we've lost with that incredible flexibility
4287040	4289040	but
4289040	4291040	lots of people get tons of value from it
4291040	4293040	and I am super happy that that seems
4293040	4295040	to be winning over even a lot of the old
4295040	4297040	Vim and Emacs people that they're kind of like
4297040	4299040	hey visual studio codes maybe you know
4299040	4301040	not so bad I am
4301040	4303040	that may be the final peacekeeping solution
4303040	4305040	where everybody is reasonably
4305040	4307040	happy with something like
4307040	4309040	that. So can you explain
4309040	4311040	what a .plan file is and
4311040	4313040	what role that played in your life
4313040	4315040	does it still continue to play a role?
4315040	4317040	Back in the early early days of
4317040	4319040	grid software one of
4319040	4321040	our big things that was unique with what we
4321040	4323040	did is I had adopted
4323040	4325040	next stations or kind of next
4325040	4327040	step systems from Steve Jobs's
4327040	4329040	out in the
4329040	4331040	out in the woods away from Apple company
4331040	4333040	and
4333040	4335040	they were basically it was kind of
4335040	4337040	interesting because I did not really have a background
4337040	4339040	with the Unix system so many of the people
4339040	4341040	they get immersed in that
4341040	4343040	in college and
4343040	4345040	you know and that's you know that
4345040	4347040	a lot of cultural expectations for them
4347040	4349040	and I didn't have any of that
4349040	4351040	but I knew that
4351040	4353040	my background was I was a huge Apple 2
4353040	4355040	fanboy I was always
4355040	4357040	a little suspicious of the Mac I was
4357040	4359040	not really what I what kind of I wanted
4359040	4361040	to go with
4361040	4363040	but when Steve Jobs left Apple
4363040	4365040	and started next this computer
4365040	4367040	did just seem like one of those amazing things
4367040	4369040	from the future where it had all of this cool
4369040	4371040	stuff in it and we were still
4371040	4373040	back in those days working on DOS
4373040	4375040	everything blew up you had reset buttons
4375040	4377040	because your computer would just freeze
4377040	4379040	if you're doing development work literally
4379040	4381040	dozens of times a day your computer was just
4381040	4383040	rebooting constantly and so this idea
4383040	4385040	of yes any of the
4385040	4387040	the Unix workstations would have given a
4387040	4389040	stable development platform where
4389040	4391040	you don't crash and reboot all the time
4391040	4393040	but next also had
4393040	4395040	this really amazing graphical
4395040	4397040	interface and it was great for building
4397040	4399040	tools and it used
4399040	4401040	Objective-C as the kind of an interesting
4401040	4403040	oh wow
4403040	4405040	the next was Unix based
4405040	4407040	it's that Objective-C so it has a lot of the
4407040	4409040	elements that became Mac
4409040	4411040	I mean the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple
4411040	4413040	by next where that took over
4413040	4415040	and became what the modern Mac
4415040	4417040	system is and defined some of the developer
4417040	4419040	like
4419040	4421040	the tools and the whole community
4421040	4423040	yeah you've still got if you're programming
4423040	4425040	on Apple stuff now there's still all these NS
4425040	4427040	somethings which was originally next
4427040	4429040	step objects of different kinds of things
4429040	4431040	but one of the aspects
4431040	4433040	of those Unix systems
4433040	4435040	was they had this notion of
4435040	4437040	a dot plan file where
4437040	4439040	a dot file is an invisible
4439040	4441040	file usually in your home
4441040	4443040	directory or something and there was a trivial
4443040	4445040	server running on most Unix systems
4445040	4447040	at the time that
4447040	4449040	when somebody ran a trivial
4449040	4451040	little command called finger
4451040	4453040	you could do finger and then somebody's
4453040	4455040	address it could be anywhere on the internet
4455040	4457040	if you were connected correctly
4457040	4459040	and all that server would do was
4459040	4461040	read the dot plan file
4461040	4463040	in that user's home directory
4463040	4465040	and then just spit it out to you
4465040	4467040	and originally the idea was that could be
4467040	4469040	whether you're on vacation what your current
4469040	4471040	project was it's supposed to be like
4471040	4473040	the plan of what you're doing
4473040	4475040	and people would use it for
4475040	4477040	various purposes but all it did
4477040	4479040	was dump that file
4479040	4481040	to the terminal of whoever issued
4481040	4483040	the finger command
4483040	4485040	and at one point
4485040	4487040	I started just keeping a list
4487040	4489040	of what I was doing in there
4489040	4491040	which would be what I was working on in the day
4491040	4493040	and I would have this little
4493040	4495040	syntax I kind of got to myself about
4495040	4497040	here's something that I'm working on
4497040	4499040	I put a star when I finish it
4499040	4501040	I could have a few other little bits of punctuation
4501040	4503040	and at the time it was
4503040	4505040	it started off as being just like my to-do list
4505040	4507040	and it would be these
4507040	4509040	trivial obscure little things like
4509040	4511040	I fixed something
4511040	4513040	with collision detection code
4513040	4515040	and the fireball do something different
4515040	4517040	and just little one-liners
4517040	4519040	that people that were following the games
4519040	4521040	could kind of decipher
4521040	4523040	but I did wind up
4523040	4525040	starting to write much more in-depth things
4525040	4527040	I would have little notes
4527040	4529040	of thoughts and insights
4529040	4531040	and then I would eventually start having little essays
4531040	4533040	I would sometimes dump into the .plan files
4533040	4535040	interspersed with the work logs
4535040	4537040	of things that I was doing
4537040	4539040	so in some ways it was like a super early
4539040	4541040	protoblog where
4541040	4543040	I was kind of dumping out what I was working on
4543040	4545040	but it was interesting enough that
4545040	4547040	there were a lot of people
4547040	4549040	that were interested in this
4549040	4551040	so most of the people didn't have Unix workstation
4551040	4553040	so there were the websites
4553040	4555040	back in the day that would follow the doom and quake development
4555040	4557040	that would
4557040	4559040	basically make a little service that would go grab
4559040	4561040	all the changes and then people could just get it
4561040	4563040	with a web browser and there was a period
4563040	4565040	where like all of the little
4565040	4567040	kind of Dallas gaming diaspora
4567040	4569040	of people that were at all in that orbit
4569040	4571040	there were a couple dozen
4571040	4573040	.plan files going on which was
4573040	4575040	and this was some years before
4575040	4577040	blogging really became kind of a thing
4577040	4579040	and it was kind of a
4579040	4581040	a premonition of
4581040	4583040	sort of the way things would go and there was
4583040	4585040	it's all been collected
4585040	4587040	it's available online in different places
4587040	4589040	and it's kind of fun to go back and look through
4589040	4591040	what I was thinking
4591040	4593040	what I was doing in the different areas
4593040	4595040	Have you had a chance to look back? Is there some interesting
4595040	4597040	very low level specific
4597040	4599040	to do items
4599040	4601040	maybe things you've never completed
4601040	4603040	all that kind of stuff and high level
4603040	4605040	philosophical essay type of stuff
4605040	4607040	there's some good stuff
4607040	4609040	on both where
4609040	4611040	a lot of it was low level nitpicky
4611040	4613040	details about game dev
4613040	4615040	and I've learned
4615040	4617040	enough things where there's no project
4617040	4619040	that I worked on that I couldn't go back
4619040	4621040	and do a better job on now
4621040	4623040	I mean you just you learn things hopefully
4623040	4625040	if you're doing it right you learn things as you get older
4625040	4627040	and you should be able to do a better job
4627040	4629040	at all of the early things
4629040	4631040	and there's stuff in
4631040	4633040	Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like oh clearly
4633040	4635040	I could go back and do a better job
4635040	4637040	at this whether it's something in the rendering
4637040	4639040	engine side or how I implemented
4639040	4641040	the monster behaviors
4641040	4643040	or managed resources or anything like that
4643040	4645040	Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?
4645040	4647040	Yeah I do
4647040	4649040	I mean sometimes I'll get the
4649040	4651040	I'll look at it and say yeah I had a pretty clear
4651040	4653040	view of I was doing good work there
4653040	4655040	and I haven't really
4655040	4657040	hit the point where
4657040	4659040	there was another programmer, Graham Divine
4659040	4661040	he had worked at id and
4661040	4663040	7th guest and he made some
4663040	4665040	comment one time where he said he looked back at some of his
4665040	4667040	old notes and he was like wow I was
4667040	4669040	really smart back then
4669040	4671040	and I don't hit
4671040	4673040	that so much where I mean I look at it
4673040	4675040	and I always know that yeah
4675040	4677040	there's all the you know with aging you get
4677040	4679040	certain changes in how you're
4679040	4681040	able to work problems but all of the
4681040	4683040	problems that I've worked I
4683040	4685040	you know I'm sure that I could do a better
4685040	4687040	job on all of them. Oh wow
4687040	4689040	so you can still step right in if you could travel
4689040	4691040	back in time and talk to that guy
4691040	4693040	you would teach him a few things. Yeah absolutely
4693040	4695040	that's awesome
4695040	4697040	What about the high level philosophical stuff?
4697040	4699040	Is there some insights that
4699040	4701040	stand out that you remember?
4701040	4703040	There's things that
4703040	4705040	I was understanding about
4705040	4707040	development and I
4707040	4709040	in the industry and so on that were
4709040	4711040	in a more primitive
4711040	4713040	stage where
4713040	4715040	I definitely learned a lot
4715040	4717040	more in the later years about
4717040	4719040	business and organization
4719040	4721040	and team structure
4721040	4723040	there were
4723040	4725040	I mean there were definitely things that I was
4725040	4727040	not the best person
4727040	4729040	or even a very good person about managing
4729040	4731040	like how a team should
4731040	4733040	operate internally, how people should work together
4733040	4735040	I was just
4735040	4737040	you know just get out
4737040	4739040	of my way and let me work on the code
4739040	4741040	and do this and more and more
4741040	4743040	I've learned how
4743040	4745040	in the larger scheme of things
4745040	4747040	how sometimes relatively
4747040	4749040	unimportant some of those things are where it is
4749040	4751040	this user value generation
4751040	4753040	that's the overarching
4753040	4755040	importance for all of that and I
4755040	4757040	didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball
4757040	4759040	correctly through a lot of my
4759040	4761040	you know my earlier years
4761040	4763040	and there's things that
4763040	4765040	you know I could have gotten more
4765040	4767040	out of people handling things in different ways
4767040	4769040	I am you know I could have made
4769040	4771040	you know in some ways more
4771040	4773040	successful products by following things
4773040	4775040	in different ways there's mistakes that we
4775040	4777040	made that we couldn't really have
4777040	4779040	known how things would have worked out but
4779040	4781040	it was interesting to see in later years companies
4781040	4783040	like Activision showing that hey you really
4783040	4785040	can just do the same game
4785040	4787040	make it better every year and you can
4787040	4789040	look at that from a negative standpoint and say
4789040	4791040	it's like oh that's just being derivative and all that
4791040	4793040	but if you step back again
4793040	4795040	and say it's like no are the people buying it
4795040	4797040	still enjoying it are they enjoying it more
4797040	4799040	than what they might have bought otherwise
4799040	4801040	and you can say no that's
4801040	4803040	that's actually a great value creation
4803040	4805040	engine to do that if you're in a position
4805040	4807040	where you can
4807040	4809040	you know don't be forced into reinventing
4809040	4811040	everything just because you think that you need
4811040	4813040	to
4813040	4815040	you know lots of things about
4815040	4817040	business and team stuff that could be done
4817040	4819040	better but the technical work
4819040	4821040	the kind of technical visionary type stuff
4821040	4823040	that I laid out I still feel pretty good
4823040	4825040	about there are some classic old
4825040	4827040	ones about my defending of OpenGL
4827040	4829040	versus D3D
4829040	4831040	which turned out
4831040	4833040	to be one of the more probably important
4833040	4835040	momentous things there where
4835040	4837040	it never it was always
4837040	4839040	a rearguard action on Windows where
4839040	4841040	Microsoft was just not going to let
4841040	4843040	that win but when I look back
4843040	4845040	on it now that fight
4845040	4847040	to keep OpenGL relevant for
4847040	4849040	a number of years there meant
4849040	4851040	that OpenGL was there when
4851040	4853040	mobile started happening and
4853040	4855040	OpenGL ES was the thing that
4855040	4857040	drove all of the acceleration
4857040	4859040	of the mobile industry and it's
4859040	4861040	really only in the last few years
4861040	4863040	as apples moved to metal and some of
4863040	4865040	the other companies have moved to Vulcan
4865040	4867040	that that's moved away but
4867040	4869040	really stepping back and
4869040	4871040	looking at it's like yeah I sold tens
4871040	4873040	of millions of games for different things
4873040	4875040	but billions
4875040	4877040	and billions of devices wound up
4877040	4879040	with an appropriate
4879040	4881040	capable graphics API
4881040	4883040	do in no small part
4883040	4885040	to me thinking that that was really important
4885040	4887040	that we not just
4887040	4889040	give up and use Microsoft's
4889040	4891040	at that time
4891040	4893040	really terrible API.
4893040	4895040	The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay
4895040	4897040	terrible. They were terrible at the start
4897040	4899040	but a few versions on
4899040	4901040	they were actually quite good and there was a completely
4901040	4903040	fair argument to be made that
4903040	4905040	by the time DX9 was out
4905040	4907040	it was probably a better programming environment
4907040	4909040	than OpenGL but it was still
4909040	4911040	a wonderful good thing
4911040	4913040	that we had an open standard that could
4913040	4915040	show up on Linux and Android
4915040	4917040	and iOS and eventually WebGL
4917040	4919040	still to this day so
4919040	4921040	that was one
4921040	4923040	that would be on my greatest hits list of things
4923040	4925040	that I kind of pushed with. The impact it had
4925040	4927040	on billions of devices yes
4927040	4929040	so let's talk about it
4929040	4931040	can you tell the origin story of idsoftware?
4931040	4933040	Again
4933040	4935040	one of the greatest game developer companies
4935040	4937040	ever it created
4937040	4939040	Wolfenstein 3D
4939040	4941040	games that define
4941040	4943040	my life also in many ways
4943040	4945040	as a thing that made me realize what computers are capable
4945040	4947040	of in terms of graphics
4947040	4949040	in terms of performance
4949040	4951040	it just unlocked something deep
4951040	4953040	in me in understanding
4953040	4955040	what these machines are all about as games can do that
4955040	4957040	so Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake
4957040	4959040	and just all the
4959040	4961040	incredible engineering innovation that went into
4961040	4963040	that. So how did it all
4963040	4965040	start?
4965040	4967040	So I'll caveat up front that I usually
4967040	4969040	don't consider myself the
4969040	4971040	historian of the software side of
4971040	4973040	things. I usually do
4973040	4975040	kind of point people at John Romero
4975040	4977040	for stories about the early days
4977040	4979040	where
4979040	4981040	I've never been like I've commented that
4981040	4983040	I'm a remarkably unsentimental person
4983040	4985040	in some ways where I don't really
4985040	4987040	spend a lot of time unless I'm explicitly
4987040	4989040	prodded to go back and think about the
4989040	4991040	early days of things and
4991040	4993040	I didn't
4993040	4995040	necessarily make the effort to
4995040	4997040	archive everything exactly in my brain
4997040	4999040	and the more that I work on machine learning
4999040	5001040	and AI and the aspects of memory
5001040	5003040	and how when you go back and polish certain
5003040	5005040	things it's not necessarily exactly
5005040	5007040	the way it happened but
5007040	5009040	having said all of that from
5009040	5011040	my view the way everything happened
5011040	5013040	that led up to that was
5013040	5015040	after I was
5015040	5017040	an adult and kind of taking
5017040	5019040	a few college classes deciding to drop
5019040	5021040	out I was doing
5021040	5023040	hardscrabble contract
5023040	5025040	programming work really struggling to
5025040	5027040	kind of keep groceries and pay my rent
5027040	5029040	and things and the company
5029040	5031040	that I was doing the most work for was
5031040	5033040	a company called Softdisk Publishing
5033040	5035040	which had the
5035040	5037040	Sounds Bizarre Now business model
5037040	5039040	of monthly subscription software.
5039040	5041040	Before there was an internet
5041040	5043040	that people could connect to and get software
5043040	5045040	you would pay
5045040	5047040	a certain amount and every month they would send
5047040	5049040	you a disk that had some random software
5049040	5051040	on it and people that were into
5051040	5053040	computers thought this was kind of cool
5053040	5055040	and they had different ones for the Apple 2
5055040	5057040	the 2GS, the PC, the Mac,
5057040	5059040	the Amiga
5059040	5061040	lots of different things here so quirky little
5061040	5063040	business but I was doing a lot
5063040	5065040	of contract programming for them where
5065040	5067040	I'd write tiny little games and
5067040	5069040	sell them for $300, $500
5069040	5071040	and one of the things
5071040	5073040	that I was doing again
5073040	5075040	to keep my head above water here was
5075040	5077040	I decided that I could make
5077040	5079040	one program and I could
5079040	5081040	port it to multiple systems
5081040	5083040	so I would write a game like
5083040	5085040	Dark Designs or Catacombs
5085040	5087040	and I would develop it on the Apple 2
5087040	5089040	the 2GS and the IBM PC
5089040	5091040	which apparently
5091040	5093040	was the thing that really kind of
5093040	5095040	piqued the attention of the
5095040	5097040	people working down there like Jay Wilbur
5097040	5099040	was my primary editor and Tom Hall
5099040	5101040	was a secondary editor
5101040	5103040	and they kept asking me it's like hey
5103040	5105040	you should come down and work for us here
5105040	5107040	and I
5107040	5109040	pushed it off a couple times because I was
5109040	5111040	really enjoying my freedom of kind of being
5111040	5113040	off on my own even if I was barely
5113040	5115040	getting by I loved it I was
5115040	5117040	doing nothing but programming all day
5117040	5119040	but I did have enough
5119040	5121040	close scrapes with like damn I'm just
5121040	5123040	really out of money that maybe I should
5123040	5125040	get an actual job
5125040	5127040	rather than contracting these kind of one at
5127040	5129040	a time things and Jay Wilbur
5129040	5131040	was great he was like fed exing me the checks
5131040	5133040	when I would need them to kind of
5133040	5135040	get over whatever hump I was at
5135040	5137040	so I took the
5137040	5139040	I finally took them up on their offer to come
5139040	5141040	down to Shreveport Louisiana
5141040	5143040	I was in Kansas City at the time
5143040	5145040	drove down
5145040	5147040	to through the Ozarks and everything
5147040	5149040	down to Louisiana
5149040	5151040	and saw the soft disk
5151040	5153040	offices went through talked to a bunch of
5153040	5155040	people met the people I had been working
5155040	5157040	with remotely at that time
5157040	5159040	but the most important thing for me was
5159040	5161040	I met two programmers
5161040	5163040	there John Romero and Lane Roth
5163040	5165040	that for the first time ever I had met
5165040	5167040	programmers that knew more
5167040	5169040	cool stuff than I did where
5169040	5171040	the world was just different back then I
5171040	5173040	was in Kansas City it was one of those
5173040	5175040	smartest kid in the school does all the
5175040	5177040	computer stuff the teachers don't have anything
5177040	5179040	to teach him but all I had to learn from
5179040	5181040	was these few books at the library
5181040	5183040	it was not much at all
5183040	5185040	and there were some aspects of programming
5185040	5187040	that were kind of black magic to me
5187040	5189040	like it's like oh he knows how to format
5189040	5191040	a track on I am you know on a
5191040	5193040	low-level drive programming
5193040	5195040	interface and this was
5195040	5197040	I was still not at all
5197040	5199040	sure I was going to take the job but I met
5199040	5201040	these awesome programmers that
5201040	5203040	were doing cool stuff and my Romero had
5203040	5205040	worked at Origin Systems and he had done
5205040	5207040	like you know so many different games
5207040	5209040	ahead of time
5209040	5211040	that I did kind of quickly decide like yeah
5211040	5213040	I'll go take the job down there
5213040	5215040	and I
5215040	5217040	settled down there moved in
5217040	5219040	and started working on more little projects
5219040	5221040	and the first kind of
5221040	5223040	big change that happened down there
5223040	5225040	was the company wanted to make a gaming
5225040	5227040	focused a PC gaming focused
5227040	5229040	subscription just like all their other
5229040	5231040	was the same formula that they used for
5231040	5233040	everything pay a monthly fee
5233040	5235040	and you'll get a disc with
5235040	5237040	one or two games just every month
5237040	5239040	and no choice in what you get but we think
5239040	5241040	it'll be fun and that was the model they
5241040	5243040	were comfortable with and said all right
5243040	5245040	we're going to start this gamers edge department
5245040	5247040	and all of us that were
5247040	5249040	interested in that like me Romero
5249040	5251040	I Tom Hall was kind of helping
5251040	5253040	us from from his side of things
5253040	5255040	Jay would peak in and we had a few other
5255040	5257040	programmers
5257040	5259040	working with us at the time and we were going
5259040	5261040	to to just start making games
5261040	5263040	just the same model
5263040	5265040	and we dived in and it was
5265040	5267040	fantastic you know you have to make new games
5267040	5269040	every month every month
5269040	5271040	yeah and this
5271040	5273040	in retrospect looking back at it
5273040	5275040	that sense that I had done all this contract
5275040	5277040	programming and John Romero had done
5277040	5279040	like far more of this where he had done
5279040	5281040	one of his teaching himself efforts
5281040	5283040	was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet
5283040	5285040	that sense of like I'm just going to go make
5285040	5287040	26 different games give him a different
5287040	5289040	theme and you learn
5289040	5291040	so much when you go through and you
5291040	5293040	crank these things out like on a
5293040	5295040	bi-weekly monthly basis something like that
5295040	5297040	start to finish it's not like an
5297040	5299040	idea it's not just
5299040	5301040	from the very beginning to the very end
5301040	5303040	it's done
5303040	5305040	it has to be done there's no delaying
5305040	5307040	it's done and you've got deadlines
5307040	5309040	and that kind of
5309040	5311040	rapid iteration pressure cooker
5311040	5313040	environment was super important
5313040	5315040	for all of us developing the skills
5315040	5317040	that I you know that brought us
5317040	5319040	to where we eventually went to I mean
5319040	5321040	people would say like in the history of the Beatles
5321040	5323040	like it wasn't them being the Beatles
5323040	5325040	it was them playing all of these other
5325040	5327040	you know early works that that opportunity
5327040	5329040	to craft all of their skills before they were
5329040	5331040	famous that was very
5331040	5333040	critical to their later successes
5333040	5335040	and I think there's a lot of that here
5335040	5337040	where we did these games that
5337040	5339040	nobody remembers lots
5339040	5341040	of little things that contributed
5341040	5343040	to building up the skill set for the things that
5343040	5345040	eventually did make us famous
5345040	5347040	and just to ask you wrote the
5347040	5349040	gambler I had to
5349040	5351040	write it in a month just
5351040	5353040	make money and nobody
5353040	5355040	remembers that probably because he had to
5355040	5357040	figure out because it's literally
5357040	5359040	he didn't have enough
5359040	5361040	time to write it fast enough
5361040	5363040	to come up with hacks
5363040	5365040	literally
5365040	5367040	pressure and limitation of resources
5367040	5369040	is surprisingly
5369040	5371040	important and it's
5371040	5373040	counterintuitive in a lot of ways where you just think
5373040	5375040	that if you've got all the time in the world
5375040	5377040	and you've got all the resources in the world
5377040	5379040	of course you're going to get something better
5379040	5381040	but sometimes it really does work out that
5381040	5383040	you know innovations
5383040	5385040	and other necessity and you know where you can
5385040	5387040	resource constraints and you have to do
5387040	5389040	things when you don't have a choice
5389040	5391040	it's surprising what you can do.
5391040	5393040	Is there any good games written in that time
5393040	5395040	would you say? Some of them are still fun to go back
5395040	5397040	and play where you get the
5397040	5399040	they were
5399040	5401040	all about kind of the more modern term is
5401040	5403040	game feel about how just the exact
5403040	5405040	feel that things it's not the grand
5405040	5407040	strategy of the design but how
5407040	5409040	running and jumping and shooting
5409040	5411040	those things I feel in the
5411040	5413040	in the moment and some of those are still
5413040	5415040	if you sat down on them you kind of go
5415040	5417040	it's a little bit different it doesn't have the same
5417040	5419040	movement feel but you move over and you're like
5419040	5421040	bang jump bang it's like
5421040	5423040	hey that's kind of cool still
5423040	5425040	so you can get lost in the rhythm of the game
5425040	5427040	like is that what you mean by feel
5427040	5429040	just like
5429040	5431040	there's something about it that pulls you in
5431040	5433040	nowadays again people talk about
5433040	5435040	compulsion loops and things where it's that
5435040	5437040	that sense of exactly
5437040	5439040	what you're doing what your fingers are doing on
5439040	5441040	the keyboard what your eyes are seeing
5441040	5443040	and they're going to be the sequences of things
5443040	5445040	grab the loot shoot the monster jump
5445040	5447040	over the obstacle get to the end of the level
5447040	5449040	these are eternal aspects of game design
5449040	5451040	in a lot of ways but
5451040	5453040	there are better and worse ways to do all of
5453040	5455040	them and we did so many of these
5455040	5457040	games that it was I we got
5457040	5459040	a lot of practice with it
5459040	5461040	so one of the kind of weird things
5461040	5463040	that was happening at this time is John
5463040	5465040	Romero was getting some
5465040	5467040	some strange fan mail and back
5467040	5469040	in the days this was before email
5469040	5471040	so we literally got letters sometimes
5471040	5473040	and telling him it's like oh I want
5473040	5475040	to talk to you about your games I want to
5475040	5477040	reach out different things
5477040	5479040	and I eventually
5479040	5481040	turned out that these were all coming from
5481040	5483040	Scott Miller at Apigee Software
5483040	5485040	and he was
5485040	5487040	reaching out through he didn't think he could
5487040	5489040	contact John directly that he would get
5489040	5491040	intercepted so he was trying to get him to
5491040	5493040	contact him through like back channel
5493040	5495040	fan mail because he basically was
5495040	5497040	saying hey I'm making all this money
5497040	5499040	on shareware games I want
5499040	5501040	you to make shareware games because
5501040	5503040	he had seen some of the games that Romero
5503040	5505040	had done and
5505040	5507040	you know we looked at Scott Miller's
5507040	5509040	games and we didn't think they were
5509040	5511040	very good I am we're like
5511040	5513040	that can't be making the kind of money
5513040	5515040	that he's saying he's making ten grand or something
5515040	5517040	I am off of this game
5517040	5519040	and we really thought that he was full of
5519040	5521040	shit that it was a lie trying to get
5521040	5523040	I had to get him into this
5523040	5525040	but so that was kind of going on at
5525040	5527040	I am you know at one level
5527040	5529040	he was and it was funny the moment
5529040	5531040	when Romero realized that he had some of
5531040	5533040	these letters pinned up on his wall like all of his
5533040	5535040	fans and then we noticed that they all had the same
5535040	5537040	return address with different names on them
5537040	5539040	which was a little bit of a two-edged sword
5539040	5541040	there trying to
5541040	5543040	figure out the puzzle laid out before
5543040	5545040	him yeah what happened after I kind
5545040	5547040	of coincident with that was
5547040	5549040	I was working on a lot of the new technologies
5549040	5551040	where
5551040	5553040	I was now full on the IBM PC
5553040	5555040	for the first time where I was really
5555040	5557040	a long hold out on Apple II forever
5557040	5559040	and I you know I loved my Apple II
5559040	5561040	it was the computer I was wished I had when I was
5561040	5563040	growing up and when I finally did have one
5563040	5565040	I was I was kind of clinging on
5565040	5567040	to that well-passed it's sort of good use
5567040	5569040	by the best computer ever made you would you say
5569040	5571040	I wouldn't
5571040	5573040	make judgments like that about it
5573040	5575040	but it was positioned in such a way especially
5575040	5577040	in the school systems that it impacted
5577040	5579040	a whole lot of American
5579040	5581040	programmers at least where
5581040	5583040	there was programs that the Apple II's got
5583040	5585040	into the schools and they had enough
5585040	5587040	capability that lots of interesting things
5587040	5589040	happened with them you know in Europe
5589040	5591040	it was different you had your Amiga's and
5591040	5593040	Atari's and you know I'm
5593040	5595040	acorns in the UK and things that
5595040	5597040	that had different things but in the United States
5597040	5599040	it was probably the Apple II made the most
5599040	5601040	impact for a lot
5601040	5603040	of programmers of my generation
5603040	5605040	but so I was really digging into
5605040	5607040	the IBM and this was
5607040	5609040	even more so with the total focus
5609040	5611040	because I had moved to another city where I
5611040	5613040	didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with
5613040	5615040	I had a little apartment
5615040	5617040	and then at Softisk again the things
5617040	5619040	that that drew me to it I had
5619040	5621040	a couple programmers that knew more than I
5621040	5623040	did and they had a library
5623040	5625040	they had a set of books and
5625040	5627040	a set of magazines they had a couple years of
5627040	5629040	magazines the old Dr. Dobbs Journal
5629040	5631040	and all of these magazines that had
5631040	5633040	information about things
5633040	5635040	and so I was just
5635040	5637040	in total immersion mode it was
5637040	5639040	eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming
5639040	5641040	particularly the IBM for
5641040	5643040	everything that I was doing
5643040	5645040	and I was digging into a lot of these
5645040	5647040	low-level hardware details that people
5647040	5649040	weren't usually paying attention to
5649040	5651040	the way the IBM EGA
5651040	5653040	cards worked
5653040	5655040	which was fun for me I hadn't had experience
5655040	5657040	with things at that level
5657040	5659040	and back then you could get
5659040	5661040	hardware documentation just down at the register
5661040	5663040	levels this is where the CRTC
5663040	5665040	register is this is how the color
5665040	5667040	registers work and how the different things
5667040	5669040	are applied and they were designed for
5669040	5671040	a certain reason they were designed
5671040	5673040	for an application they were had an intended
5673040	5675040	use in mind but I was
5675040	5677040	starting to look at other ways
5677040	5679040	that they could perhaps be exploited that they weren't
5679040	5681040	initially intended for.
5681040	5683040	Could you comment on like first of all
5683040	5685040	what operating system was there what what
5685040	5687040	instructions that was like what
5687040	5689040	what are the what are we talking about?
5689040	5691040	DOS and x86 so 16-bit
5691040	5693040	8086 the two
5693040	5695040	86's were there and three 86's
5695040	5697040	existed they were rare
5697040	5699040	we had a couple for our development systems
5699040	5701040	but we were still targeting
5701040	5703040	the more broad I
5703040	5705040	it was all DOS 16-bit
5705040	5707040	none of this was kind of DOS extenders
5707040	5709040	and things. How different is it from the systems
5709040	5711040	of today's it's kind of the precursor
5711040	5713040	that's similar? Very little
5713040	5715040	if you open up command.exe
5715040	5717040	on or com on
5717040	5719040	windows you see some of the remnants
5719040	5721040	of all of that but it was a different world
5721040	5723040	it was the 640k is enough
5723040	5725040	world and nothing was protected
5725040	5727040	it crashed all the time you had
5727040	5729040	TSR's or terminate and stay
5729040	5731040	resident hacks on top of things
5731040	5733040	that would cause configuration problems
5733040	5735040	all the hardware was manually
5735040	5737040	configured in your auto-exec
5737040	5739040	so it was a very different world
5739040	5741040	but the code is still the same similar
5741040	5743040	you would still write it my earliest
5743040	5745040	code there was written in Pascal that was
5745040	5747040	what I had learned
5747040	5749040	between basic
5749040	5751040	and C++ there was Pascal
5751040	5753040	when basic assembly language
5753040	5755040	some of my intermediate
5755040	5757040	stuff was well you had to for performance
5757040	5759040	basic was just too slow
5759040	5761040	most of the work that I was doing as a contract
5761040	5763040	programmer in my teenage years
5763040	5765040	was assembly language
5765040	5767040	you wrote games in assembly?
5767040	5769040	yeah complete games
5769040	5771040	in assembly language
5771040	5773040	and it's thousands and thousands of lines
5773040	5775040	every letter acronyms for the
5775040	5777040	instructions
5777040	5779040	you don't earn the once again
5779040	5781040	greatest programmer ever labeled
5781040	5783040	without being able to write a game in assembly
5783040	5785040	but that's again everybody wrote there
5785040	5787040	everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language
5787040	5789040	it was kind of a
5789040	5791040	everybody serious
5791040	5793040	it was an outlier to use Pascal
5793040	5795040	a little bit where there was one famous
5795040	5797040	program called wizardry
5797040	5799040	it was one of the great early role playing games
5799040	5801040	that was written in Pascal
5801040	5803040	but it was almost nothing
5803040	5805040	used Pascal there but I did learn Pascal
5805040	5807040	and I remember doing all of my
5807040	5809040	like to this day I sketch in data structures
5809040	5811040	when I'm thinking about something
5811040	5813040	I'll open up a file
5813040	5815040	and I'll start writing struct definitions
5815040	5817040	for how data is going to be laid out
5817040	5819040	and Pascal was kind of formative to that
5819040	5821040	because I remember designing my RPGs
5821040	5823040	in Pascal record structures
5823040	5825040	and things like that
5825040	5827040	and so I had gotten a Pascal compiler
5827040	5829040	for the Apple 2GS that I could work on
5829040	5831040	the first IBM game that I developed
5831040	5833040	I did in Pascal
5833040	5835040	and that's actually kind of an interesting story
5835040	5837040	again talking about the constraints
5837040	5839040	and resources where
5839040	5841040	I had an Apple 2GS I didn't have an IBM PC
5841040	5843040	I wanted to port my
5843040	5845040	applications to IBM
5845040	5847040	because I thought I could make more money on it
5847040	5849040	so what I wound up doing
5849040	5851040	is I rented a PC for a week
5851040	5853040	and bought a copy of
5853040	5855040	Turbo Pascal and so I had
5855040	5857040	a hard one week and this was cutting into
5857040	5859040	a minimal profit margin I had there
5859040	5861040	but I had this computer for a week
5861040	5863040	I had to get my program ported
5863040	5865040	before I had to return the PC
5865040	5867040	and that was kind of the first thing
5867040	5869040	that I had done on the IBM PC
5869040	5871040	and what led me to taking the job at Softisk
5871040	5873040	and Turbo Pascal
5873040	5875040	how's that different from regular Pascal
5875040	5877040	is it different compiler or something like that
5877040	5879040	so it was a product of Borland
5879040	5881040	which before Microsoft kind of killed them
5881040	5883040	they were the hot stuff
5883040	5885040	developer tools company
5885040	5887040	Turbo Pascal and Turbo C
5887040	5889040	and Turbo Prologue I mean all the different things
5889040	5891040	but what they did was
5891040	5893040	they took a supremely pragmatic approach
5893040	5895040	of making something useful it was
5895040	5897040	one of these great examples where
5897040	5899040	Pascal was an academic language
5899040	5901040	and you had things like the UCSDP
5901040	5903040	system that Wizardry was actually
5903040	5905040	written in that they did
5905040	5907040	they did manage to make a game with that
5907040	5909040	but it was
5909040	5911040	not a super practical system
5911040	5913040	while Turbo Pascal was
5913040	5915040	called Turbo because it was blazingly fast
5915040	5917040	to compile I mean really
5917040	5919040	ridiculously 10 to 20 times
5919040	5921040	faster than most other compilers at the
5921040	5923040	time but it also had very
5923040	5925040	pragmatic access to look you can just
5925040	5927040	poke at the hardware in these different ways
5927040	5929040	and we have libraries that let you do things
5929040	5931040	and it was a pretty good
5931040	5933040	it was a perfectly good way to write games
5933040	5935040	and this is one of those things where people have talked
5935040	5937040	about different paths that computer
5937040	5939040	development could have taken
5939040	5941040	where C took over the world
5941040	5943040	reasons that came out of UNIX
5943040	5945040	and eventually Linux
5945040	5947040	and that was not a foregone conclusion at all
5947040	5949040	and people can make
5949040	5951040	real reasoned rational arguments
5951040	5953040	that the world might have been better
5953040	5955040	if it had gone a Pascal route
5955040	5957040	I'm somewhat agnostic on that
5957040	5959040	where I do know from experience
5959040	5961040	it was perfectly good enough to do
5961040	5963040	that and it had some fundamental
5963040	5965040	improvements like it had range checked
5965040	5967040	arrays as an option there which could
5967040	5969040	avoid many of C's
5969040	5971040	as well as some kind of
5971040	5973040	experimental hazards that happened in a security
5973040	5975040	space but C1
5975040	5977040	they were basically operating at about the same
5977040	5979040	level of abstraction it was
5979040	5981040	a systems programming language
5981040	5983040	but you said Pascal had more
5983040	5985040	emphasis on data structures
5985040	5987040	actually
5987040	5989040	in the tree of languages did Pascal
5989040	5991040	come before C
5991040	5993040	they were pretty contemporaneous
5993040	5995040	so Pascal's lineage went to
5995040	5997040	Modula 2 and eventually Oberon
5997040	5999040	of experimental language
5999040	6001040	but they were all good enough at that level
6001040	6003040	now some of the classic
6003040	6005040	academic oriented Pascal's were just missing
6005040	6007040	fundamental things like oh you can't access
6007040	6009040	this core system thing because we're just using
6009040	6011040	it to teach students but
6011040	6013040	Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes
6013040	6015040	to it really did make it
6015040	6017040	a completely capable language
6017040	6019040	and it had some reasons why
6019040	6021040	you could implement it as a single pass compiler
6021040	6023040	so it could be way way faster although
6023040	6025040	less scope for optimizations if you do it
6025040	6027040	that way and it did have
6027040	6029040	some range checking options it had a little bit
6029040	6031040	better typing capability
6031040	6033040	properly typed enum sorts of things
6033040	6035040	and other stuff that C lacked
6035040	6037040	but you know C was also clearly
6037040	6039040	good enough and it wound up with a huge
6039040	6041040	inertia from the Unix ecosystem
6041040	6043040	and Pascal didn't have garbage collection
6043040	6045040	no it was not garbage
6045040	6047040	collected the same kind of thing the same manual
6047040	6049040	so you could still have your use after freeze
6049040	6051040	and all those other problems but
6051040	6053040	just getting rid of array overruns
6053040	6055040	at least if you were compiled with that
6055040	6057040	debugging option certainly would have avoided
6057040	6059040	a lot of problems and could have a lot
6059040	6061040	of benefits but so anyways that was the next
6061040	6063040	thing I had to learn C because C
6063040	6065040	was where it seemed like most
6065040	6067040	of the things were going
6067040	6069040	so I abandoned Pascal and I started working
6069040	6071040	in C I started hacking on these hardware
6071040	6073040	things dealing with
6073040	6075040	the graphics controllers and the EGA
6075040	6077040	systems and what we
6077040	6079040	most wanted to do so at that time
6079040	6081040	we had
6081040	6083040	sitting in our darkened office playing
6083040	6085040	all the different console video games
6085040	6087040	we were figuring out what do we want to
6087040	6089040	what games do we want to make for our
6089040	6091040	gamers edge product there
6091040	6093040	and so we had one of the first
6093040	6095040	Super Nintendo's sitting there and we had
6095040	6097040	an older Nintendo looking at all those
6097040	6099040	games and the core thing that those
6099040	6101040	consoles did that you just didn't get on
6101040	6103040	the PC games was this ability
6103040	6105040	to have a massive scrolling world
6105040	6107040	where most of the games that you would make
6107040	6109040	on the PC and earlier
6109040	6111040	personal computers would be a static
6111040	6113040	screen you move little things around on
6113040	6115040	it and you interact like that maybe
6115040	6117040	you go to additional screens as
6117040	6119040	you move but arcade
6119040	6121040	games and consoles had this
6121040	6123040	wonderful ability to just have a big
6123040	6125040	world that you're slowly moving your
6125040	6127040	window through and that was
6127040	6129040	for those types of games the kind of
6129040	6131040	action exploration adventure games that
6131040	6133040	was a super super important thing
6133040	6135040	and PC games just didn't do
6135040	6137040	that and what I
6137040	6139040	had come across was a couple different
6139040	6141040	techniques for implementing
6141040	6143040	that on the PC and they're not
6143040	6145040	hard complicated things
6145040	6147040	when I explain them now they're
6147040	6149040	they're pretty straightforward but just nobody was doing
6149040	6151040	you sound like Einstein describing his
6151040	6153040	five papers is pretty straightforward
6153040	6155040	I understand but they're
6155040	6157040	nevertheless revolutions so side-scrolling
6157040	6159040	is a game-changer
6159040	6161040	it's a genius invention
6161040	6163040	and some of the consoles had different
6163040	6165040	limitations about you could do one but not the
6165040	6167040	other and I and there were similar things
6167040	6169040	going on as advancements even in the console
6169040	6171040	space where you'd have like the original
6171040	6173040	Mario game was
6173040	6175040	like just horizontal scrolling and then later
6175040	6177040	Mario games added vertical aspects to
6177040	6179040	it different things that
6179040	6181040	you were doing to explore
6181040	6183040	you know kind of expand the capabilities there
6183040	6185040	and so much of the early game design for
6185040	6187040	decades was removing limitations
6187040	6189040	letting you do things that you envisioned
6189040	6191040	as a designer you wanted the player to
6191040	6193040	experience but the hardware just
6193040	6195040	couldn't really or you didn't know how
6195040	6197040	to make it happen it felt
6197040	6199040	impossible you can imagine
6199040	6201040	that you want to create like this
6201040	6203040	big world through which you can
6203040	6205040	side-scroll like through which you can
6205040	6207040	walk and then
6207040	6209040	you ask yourself a question how do I
6209040	6211040	actually build that in a way that's
6211040	6213040	like the the latency
6213040	6215040	is low enough the
6215040	6217040	hardware can actually deliver that
6217040	6219040	in such a way there's a compelling
6219040	6221040	yeah and we knew what we wanted to do because
6221040	6223040	we were playing all of these console games playing
6223040	6225040	all these Nintendo games and arcade games
6225040	6227040	clearly there is a whole world of awesome
6227040	6229040	things there that we just couldn't do on the
6229040	6231040	PC at least initially
6231040	6233040	because every programmer can tell it's
6233040	6235040	like if you want to scroll you can just redraw the whole
6235040	6237040	screen but then it turns out well you're going
6237040	6239040	five frames per second I view that's
6239040	6241040	not an interactive fun experience
6241040	6243040	you want to be going 30 or 60
6243040	6245040	frames per second or something and
6245040	6247040	it just didn't feel like that was possible it
6247040	6249040	felt like the PCs had to get five
6249040	6251040	times faster for you to make a playable
6251040	6253040	game there and
6253040	6255040	interestingly I wound up with two
6255040	6257040	completely different solutions
6257040	6259040	for the scrolling problem
6259040	6261040	and this is
6261040	6263040	this is a theme that runs through everything
6263040	6265040	where all of these big technical advancements
6265040	6267040	it turns out there's always a couple different
6267040	6269040	ways of doing them and it's not
6269040	6271040	like you found the one true way
6271040	6273040	of doing it and we'll see this as we
6273040	6275040	go into 3d games and things later
6275040	6277040	but so the scrolling
6277040	6279040	the first set of scrolling tricks that I got
6279040	6281040	was
6281040	6283040	the hardware had this ability
6283040	6285040	to you could shift
6285040	6287040	like inside the window of memory
6287040	6289040	so the EGA cards at the time
6289040	6291040	had 256 kilobytes
6291040	6293040	of memory and it was
6293040	6295040	awkwardly set up in this planer
6295040	6297040	format where instead of
6297040	6299040	having 256 or
6299040	6301040	24 million colors
6301040	6303040	you had 16 colors which is 4 bits
6303040	6305040	so you had 4 bit planes
6305040	6307040	64k a piece of course
6307040	6309040	64k is a nice round number
6309040	6311040	for 16 bit addressing
6311040	6313040	so your graphics card had
6313040	6315040	a 16 bit window that you could
6315040	6317040	look at and you could tell it to start
6317040	6319040	the video scan out anywhere inside there
6319040	6321040	so there were a couple games
6321040	6323040	that had taken this approach if you could make
6323040	6325040	a 2x2 screen or a 1x4 screen
6325040	6327040	and you could do scrolling really
6327040	6329040	easily like that you could just lay it
6329040	6331040	all out and just pan around there
6331040	6333040	but you just couldn't make it any bigger
6333040	6335040	because that's all the memory that was there
6335040	6337040	the first insight to the scrolling
6337040	6339040	that I had was well
6339040	6341040	if we make a screen that's just
6341040	6343040	one tile larger you know
6343040	6345040	we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels
6345040	6347040	by 16 pixels the little classic
6347040	6349040	Mario block that you run into
6349040	6351040	lots of art gets drawn that way
6351040	6353040	and your screen is a certain number of tiles
6353040	6355040	but if you had one little buffer region
6355040	6357040	outside of that
6357040	6359040	you could easily pan around inside that
6359040	6361040	16 pixel region that could be perfectly
6361040	6363040	smooth but then what happens
6363040	6365040	if you get to the edge and you want to keep going
6365040	6367040	the first way we did
6367040	6369040	scrolling was what I called
6369040	6371040	adaptive tile refresh
6371040	6373040	which was really just a matter of
6373040	6375040	you get to the edge and then
6375040	6377040	you go back to the original point and then
6377040	6379040	only change the tiles that have actually
6379040	6381040	that are different between where it
6381040	6383040	was in most of the games at the time
6383040	6385040	if you think about sort of your
6385040	6387040	classic Super Mario Brothers game
6387040	6389040	you've got big fields of blue sky
6389040	6391040	long rows of
6391040	6393040	the same brick texture
6393040	6395040	and there's a lot of commonality
6395040	6397040	it's kind of like a data compression thing
6397040	6399040	if you take the screen and you set it down
6399040	6401040	on top of each other in general
6401040	6403040	only about 10% of the tiles
6403040	6405040	were actually different there
6405040	6407040	so this was a way to
6407040	6409040	go ahead and say well I'm going to move it back
6409040	6411040	and then I'm only going to change those
6411040	6413040	10, 20 whatever percent
6413040	6415040	tiles there and that meant
6415040	6417040	that it was essentially five times
6417040	6419040	faster than if you were redrawing all of the
6419040	6421040	tiles and that worked well enough
6421040	6423040	for us to do a bunch of these games
6423040	6425040	for Gamers Edge
6425040	6427040	we had a lot of these scrolling games like
6427040	6429040	Slurnax and Shadow Knights and things like
6429040	6431040	that that we were cranking out at this high
6431040	6433040	rate that had this scrolling effect on it
6433040	6435040	and it worked well enough there were
6435040	6437040	design challenges there where
6437040	6439040	if you made the worst case, if you made a
6439040	6441040	checkerboard over the entire screen
6441040	6443040	you scroll over one and every single tile
6443040	6445040	changes and your frame rates now five frames
6445040	6447040	and because it had to redraw everything
6447040	6449040	so the designers had a little bit that they
6449040	6451040	had to worry about they had to make these
6451040	6453040	relatively plain looking levels
6453040	6455040	but it was still pretty magical
6455040	6457040	it was something that we hadn't seen before
6457040	6459040	and
6459040	6461040	the first thing that we wound up doing
6461040	6463040	with that was I had just gotten this
6463040	6465040	working and Tom Hall was
6465040	6467040	sitting there with me and
6467040	6469040	we were looking over at our Super Nintendo
6469040	6471040	on the side there with Super Mario 3
6471040	6473040	running and we had
6473040	6475040	the technology, we had the tools
6475040	6477040	set up there and we stayed up
6477040	6479040	all night and we basically cloned
6479040	6481040	the first level of Super Mario Brothers
6481040	6483040	Performance wise as well? Yeah
6483040	6485040	and so it and we had our little character running
6485040	6487040	and jumping in there it wasn't
6487040	6489040	it was close to pixel accurate as far as
6489040	6491040	all the backgrounds and everything
6491040	6493040	but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled
6493040	6495040	together from previous games that I had
6495040	6497040	written I just kind of like really kit bash
6497040	6499040	the whole thing together to make this demo
6499040	6501040	and that was one of the rare cases
6501040	6503040	when I said I don't usually do these
6503040	6505040	all night programming things
6505040	6507040	there's probably only two memorable ones
6507040	6509040	that I can think about you know one was
6509040	6511040	the all nighter to go ahead and get
6511040	6513040	to get our dangerous Dave
6513040	6515040	in copyright infringement is how we titled it
6515040	6517040	because we had a game called dangerous Dave
6517040	6519040	was you know running around with the shotgun shooting
6519040	6521040	things and we were
6521040	6523040	just taking our most beloved game at the time
6523040	6525040	there the Super Mario 3
6525040	6527040	and sort of sticking Dave inside that with
6527040	6529040	this new scrolling technology that was
6529040	6531040	going perfectly smooth for
6531040	6533040	I am you know for them
6533040	6535040	as it ran and Tom
6535040	6537040	and I just kind of blurrily the next morning
6537040	6539040	you know kind of left and we left a disc
6539040	6541040	on I you know on the desk
6541040	6543040	for John Romero and J Wilbur
6543040	6545040	to see and just said run this
6545040	6547040	and we eventually made it back in
6547040	6549040	later in the day and it
6549040	6551040	was you know like they grabbed us
6551040	6553040	and pulled us in you know pulled us into the room
6553040	6555040	and that was the point where they were
6555040	6557040	like we got to do something with this
6557040	6559040	you know we're going to make a company
6559040	6561040	we're going to go make our own games
6561040	6563040	where this was something that
6563040	6565040	we were able to just kind of hit them
6565040	6567040	with a hammer of an experience like wow
6567040	6569040	this is just like so much cooler than
6569040	6571040	what we thought was possible there
6571040	6573040	and initially we tried to
6573040	6575040	get Nintendo to let us make
6575040	6577040	Super Mario 3 on the PC
6577040	6579040	that's really what we wanted to do we're like hey
6579040	6581040	we can finish this it's line of sight
6581040	6583040	for this will be great and
6583040	6585040	we sent something to Nintendo
6585040	6587040	and we heard that it did get looked at
6587040	6589040	in Japan and they just
6589040	6591040	weren't interested in that
6591040	6593040	but that's another one of those life could have gone
6593040	6595040	a very different way where we could have been
6595040	6597040	like Nintendo's house PC team
6597040	6599040	you know at that point
6599040	6601040	and to find the direction of
6601040	6603040	you know
6603040	6605040	Wolfenstein and
6605040	6607040	Doom and Quake
6607040	6609040	could have been a Nintendo creation
6609040	6611040	yeah so at the same time
6611040	6613040	that we were just doing our first scrolling
6613040	6615040	demos
6615040	6617040	we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee
6617040	6619040	and said it's like hey we do want to
6619040	6621040	make some games you know these things that you
6621040	6623040	think you want those are those are nothing
6623040	6625040	what do you see what we can actually do now
6625040	6627040	this is going to be amazing and
6627040	6629040	he just like popped right up and sent a check
6629040	6631040	to us where we at that point
6631040	6633040	we still thought he might be a fraud that
6633040	6635040	he was just lying about all of this but he
6635040	6637040	was totally correct on how much money
6637040	6639040	he was making with his shareware titles
6639040	6641040	and this was his
6641040	6643040	kind of real brainstorm about this
6643040	6645040	where shareware was this idea that
6645040	6647040	software doesn't have a fixed price
6647040	6649040	if you use it you send out of the goodness
6649040	6651040	of your heart some money to the creator
6651040	6653040	and there were a couple utilities
6653040	6655040	that did make some significant success
6655040	6657040	like that but for the most part
6657040	6659040	it didn't really work you know there wasn't
6659040	6661040	much software in a pure shareware
6661040	6663040	model that that was successful
6663040	6665040	the Apogee innovation
6665040	6667040	was to
6667040	6669040	take something call it shareware split
6669040	6671040	it into three pieces you always made a
6671040	6673040	trilogy and you would put
6673040	6675040	the first piece out but then you buy
6675040	6677040	the whole trilogy for some
6677040	6679040	shareware amount which in reality
6679040	6681040	it meant that the first part was a demo
6681040	6683040	where you kind of like the demo went
6683040	6685040	everywhere for free and you paid money to
6685040	6687040	to get the whole set but
6687040	6689040	it was still played as shareware and we were
6689040	6691040	happy to have the first one go everywhere
6691040	6693040	and it wasn't a crippled demo where the
6693040	6695040	first episode of all these trilogies it
6695040	6697040	was a real complete game and probably
6697040	6699040	20 times as many people played
6699040	6701040	that part of it thought they had a great game
6701040	6703040	had found memories of
6703040	6705040	it but never paid us a dime
6705040	6707040	but enough people were
6707040	6709040	happy with that where
6709040	6711040	it was really quite successful at these
6711040	6713040	early games that we didn't think very much
6713040	6715040	of compared to commercial quality
6715040	6717040	games but they were doing really good
6717040	6719040	business some fairly crude things
6719040	6721040	and people it was good
6721040	6723040	business people enjoyed it and
6723040	6725040	it wasn't like you were taking a crap shoot on what
6725040	6727040	you were getting you just played a third of the
6727040	6729040	experience and you loved it enough
6729040	6731040	to hand write out a check
6731040	6733040	and put it in an envelope and address it
6733040	6735040	and send it out to Apigee
6735040	6737040	to get the rest of them so
6737040	6739040	it was a really pretty feel good
6739040	6741040	business prospect there because
6741040	6743040	everybody was happy
6743040	6745040	they knew what they were getting
6745040	6747040	when they send it in and they would send in fan mail
6747040	6749040	if you're going to the trouble of addressing
6749040	6751040	a letter and I am filling out
6751040	6753040	an envelope you write something in it and
6753040	6755040	there were just the literal bags of fan mail
6755040	6757040	for the shareware
6757040	6759040	games so people loved them
6759040	6761040	I should mention that for you
6761040	6763040	the definition of wealth is being
6763040	6765040	able to have
6765040	6767040	pizza whenever you want
6767040	6769040	for me there was a dream
6769040	6771040	because I would play shareware games over
6771040	6773040	and over the part that's free
6773040	6775040	over and over and it was very
6775040	6777040	deeply fulfilling experience but
6777040	6779040	I dreamed of a time when I
6779040	6781040	could actually afford
6781040	6783040	the full experience and this is kind of this
6783040	6785040	dream land beyond
6785040	6787040	the horizon
6787040	6789040	you could find out what else is there
6789040	6791040	in some sense
6791040	6793040	even just playing the shareware
6793040	6795040	was
6795040	6797040	the limitation of that
6797040	6799040	you know life is
6799040	6801040	limited eventually we all
6801040	6803040	die in that way shareware was like
6805040	6807040	somehow really fulfilling
6807040	6809040	to have this kind of mysterious thing
6809040	6811040	beyond what's free
6811040	6813040	always there it's kind of
6813040	6815040	I don't know that maybe
6815040	6817040	it's because a part of my childhood is playing
6817040	6819040	shareware games that was a really fulfilling
6819040	6821040	experience it's so interesting how that model
6821040	6823040	still brought joy
6823040	6825040	to so many people the 20x
6825040	6827040	people that played it I felt very good about
6827040	6829040	that I would run into people
6829040	6831040	that would say oh I loved that game
6831040	6833040	that you had early on Commander Keen
6833040	6835040	whatever and
6835040	6837040	they meant just the first episode
6837040	6839040	that they got to see everywhere
6839040	6841040	the crap out of Commander Keen
6841040	6843040	and that was all good
6843040	6845040	but so we were
6845040	6847040	in this position where Scott Miller was
6847040	6849040	just fronting us cash and saying yeah make
6849040	6851040	you know make a game but
6851040	6853040	we did not properly
6853040	6855040	pull the trigger and say alright we're going to
6855040	6857040	we're quitting our jobs we were like we're gonna
6857040	6859040	do both we're gonna keep working
6859040	6861040	at soft disk working on this
6861040	6863040	and then we're going to go ahead
6863040	6865040	and make a new game for
6865040	6867040	Apogee at the same time
6867040	6869040	and this eventually did lead to some legal
6869040	6871040	problems and we had trouble
6871040	6873040	it all got worked out in the end
6873040	6875040	but it was not a good call at the time
6875040	6877040	there and your legal mind at the time
6877040	6879040	was not stellar
6879040	6881040	you were not thinking
6881040	6883040	in terms of the illegal term no
6883040	6885040	I definitely wasn't none of us were
6885040	6887040	and in hindsight
6887040	6889040	yeah it's like how did we think we were going to get away
6889040	6891040	with like even using our work computers
6891040	6893040	to write software for
6893040	6895040	you know our breakaway
6895040	6897040	new company
6897040	6899040	it was not a good plan
6899040	6901040	how did Commander Keane come to be
6901040	6903040	so the design process
6903040	6905040	we would start from we had some idea
6905040	6907040	what we wanted to do we wanted to do a
6907040	6909040	Mario like game it was going to be a
6909040	6911040	side scroller it was going to use the
6911040	6913040	technology we had some
6913040	6915040	sense of what it would have to look like because of the limitations
6915040	6917040	of this adaptive tile refresh
6917040	6919040	technology it had to have
6919040	6921040	fields of relatively constant tiles
6921040	6923040	you couldn't just paint up a background
6923040	6925040	and then move that around
6925040	6927040	the early design
6927040	6929040	or all the design for Commander Keane really came
6929040	6931040	from Tom Hall where
6931040	6933040	he was
6933040	6935040	kind of the main creative mind
6935040	6937040	for the early in software stuff
6937040	6939040	where we had an interesting division of things
6939040	6941040	where Tom was
6941040	6943040	all creative in design I was
6943040	6945040	all programming John Romero was an interesting bridge
6945040	6947040	where he was both a very good
6947040	6949040	programmer and also a very good designer
6949040	6951040	and artist and kind of straddled
6951040	6953040	between the areas but Commander
6953040	6955040	Keane was very much Tom Hall's baby
6955040	6957040	and he came up
6957040	6959040	with all the design and backstory
6959040	6961040	for the different things of kind of a
6961040	6963040	mad scientist little kid with
6963040	6965040	I am you know
6965040	6967040	building a rocket ship and a zap gun
6967040	6969040	and visiting alien worlds
6969040	6971040	and doing all this that the background
6971040	6973040	that we lay the game inside of
6973040	6975040	and there's not a whole lot
6975040	6977040	to any of these things you know design
6977040	6979040	for us was always just what we needed
6979040	6981040	to do to make the game that was going
6981040	6983040	to be so much fun to play
6983040	6985040	and we made our we laid out
6985040	6987040	our first trilogy of games you know the
6987040	6989040	shareware formula it's going to be three
6989040	6991040	pieces we make Commander Keane one two
6991040	6993040	and three and we just really
6993040	6995040	started
6995040	6997040	busting on all that work and it went together
6997040	6999040	really quickly it was like three months or
6999040	7001040	something that while we were still making
7001040	7003040	games every month for
7003040	7005040	for Gamers Edge we were sharing technology
7005040	7007040	between that I'd write a bunch of code for this
7007040	7009040	and we just kind of use it for both
7009040	7011040	again not a particularly good idea there
7011040	7013040	that had consequences for us
7013040	7015040	but in three months
7015040	7017040	we got our first our first game
7017040	7019040	out and all of a sudden it was
7019040	7021040	three times as successful as
7021040	7023040	the most successful thing Apogee had had before
7023040	7025040	and we were making like thirty thousand dollars
7025040	7027040	a month immediately
7027040	7029040	from the Commander Keane stuff
7029040	7031040	and that was again
7031040	7033040	a surprise to us it was more than we thought
7033040	7035040	that was going to that was going to make
7035040	7037040	and we said well we're going to
7037040	7039040	certainly roll into another set of titles
7039040	7041040	from this and in that three months
7041040	7043040	I had come up with a much better way
7043040	7045040	of doing the scrolling technology that
7045040	7047040	was not the adaptive tile refresh
7047040	7049040	which in some ways was even simpler
7049040	7051040	and these things
7051040	7053040	so many of the great ideas of technology
7053040	7055040	are things that are back at the envelope
7055040	7057040	designs I make this comment
7057040	7059040	about modern machine learning where
7059040	7061040	all the things that are really important practically
7061040	7063040	in the last decade are each of them
7063040	7065040	fits on the back of an envelope there are these
7065040	7067040	simple little things they're not
7067040	7069040	super dense hard to understand
7069040	7071040	technologies
7071040	7073040	and so the the second scrolling
7073040	7075040	trick was just a matter of like
7075040	7077040	okay we know we've got this 64k
7077040	7079040	window and
7079040	7081040	the question was always like well you could make
7081040	7083040	a two by two but you can't go
7083040	7085040	off the edge
7085040	7087040	but I finally asked well what actually
7087040	7089040	happens if you just go off the
7089040	7091040	edge if you take your start
7091040	7093040	and you say it's like okay
7093040	7095040	I can move over I'm scrolling I can move over
7095040	7097040	I can move down I'm scrolling
7097040	7099040	I get to what should be the bottom of the memory
7099040	7101040	window like well what if I just
7101040	7103040	keep going and I say I'm going to start
7103040	7105040	at you know what happens if I start
7105040	7107040	at FFFE at the very
7107040	7109040	end of the 64k block
7109040	7111040	and it turns out it just
7111040	7113040	wraps back around to the top of the block
7113040	7115040	and I'm like oh well this makes
7115040	7117040	everything easy you can just scroll the
7117040	7119040	screen everywhere and all you have to draw is just
7119040	7121040	one new line of tiles which everything
7121040	7123040	you expose it might be
7123040	7125040	unaligned off various parts of
7125040	7127040	the of the screen memory
7127040	7129040	but it just works that no longer had
7129040	7131040	the problem of you had to have fields of
7131040	7133040	the similar colors because
7133040	7135040	it doesn't matter what you're doing you could be having
7135040	7137040	a completely unique world
7137040	7139040	and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes
7139040	7141040	on but it might be like you said
7141040	7143040	unaligned so it can be all over
7143040	7145040	the place and it turns out it doesn't matter
7145040	7147040	I would have two page flipped screens as long
7147040	7149040	as they didn't overlap they moved in series
7149040	7151040	through this two-dimensional
7151040	7153040	window of graphics
7153040	7155040	and that was one of those like well this is
7155040	7157040	so simple this just
7157040	7159040	this just works it's faster
7159040	7161040	there it seemed like there was no downside
7161040	7163040	funny thing was
7163040	7165040	it turned out after we shipped
7165040	7167040	titles with this there were
7167040	7169040	what they called super VGA
7169040	7171040	cards the cards that would allow higher
7171040	7173040	resolutions and
7173040	7175040	different features that the standard ones didn't
7175040	7177040	and on some of those
7177040	7179040	cards this was a weird
7179040	7181040	compatibility quirk again because nobody
7181040	7183040	thought this was not what it was designed to do
7183040	7185040	and some of those cards had more
7185040	7187040	memory they had more than just
7187040	7189040	256k in four planes they
7189040	7191040	had 512k or a megabyte
7191040	7193040	and on some of those cards
7193040	7195040	I scroll my window
7195040	7197040	down and then it goes into uninitialized
7197040	7199040	memory that actually exists there
7199040	7201040	rather than wrapping back around at the top
7201040	7203040	and
7203040	7205040	then I was in the tough position of do I have to track
7205040	7207040	every single one of these and it was a mad
7207040	7209040	house back then with there were
7209040	7211040	20 different video card vendors
7211040	7213040	with all slightly different implementations
7213040	7215040	of their non-standard functionality
7215040	7217040	so either I needed to natively
7217040	7219040	program all of the
7219040	7221040	the VGA cards there to
7221040	7223040	map in that memory and keep
7223040	7225040	scrolling down through all of that
7225040	7227040	or I kind of punted and took the easy
7227040	7229040	solution of when you finally did run
7229040	7231040	the edge of the screen I accepted
7231040	7233040	a hitch and just copied the whole screen up
7233040	7235040	there so on some of those
7235040	7237040	those cards it was
7237040	7239040	a compatibility mode in the normal
7239040	7241040	ones when it all worked fine everything was just
7241040	7243040	beautifully smooth but if you had one of those
7243040	7245040	cards where it did not wrap
7245040	7247040	the way I wanted it to you'd be
7247040	7249040	scrolling around scrolling around and
7249040	7251040	then eventually you'd have a little hitch where
7251040	7253040	200 milliseconds or something
7253040	7255040	that was not super smooth as it
7255040	7257040	froze a little bit and this was the binary
7257040	7259040	thing is it one of the standard
7259040	7261040	screens or is it one of the weird ones
7261040	7263040	the super VGA ones yeah okay
7263040	7265040	and so we would default to and I think
7265040	7267040	that was one of those that changed over
7267040	7269040	the kind of course of deployment
7269040	7271040	where early on we would have a normal mode
7271040	7273040	and then you would have you would enable the compatibility
7273040	7275040	flag if your screen did this crazy
7275040	7277040	flickery thing when you got to a certain
7277040	7279040	point in the game and then
7279040	7281040	later I think it probably got enabled by
7281040	7283040	default as just more and more of the cards
7283040	7285040	I kind of did not do exactly
7285040	7287040	the right thing and that's the two-edged
7287040	7289040	sword of doing unconventional
7289040	7291040	things with technology where
7291040	7293040	you can find something that nobody thought about
7293040	7295040	doing that kind of scrolling trick when they set
7295040	7297040	up those cards but the
7297040	7299040	fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason
7299040	7301040	when I was relying on that then
7301040	7303040	I wound up being broken on some of the later
7303040	7305040	cards let me take a bit
7305040	7307040	of a tangent but
7307040	7309040	ask about the hacker
7309040	7311040	ethic because you mentioned share
7311040	7313040	where it says it's an interesting world
7313040	7315040	the world of
7315040	7317040	people that make money
7317040	7319040	business and the people
7319040	7321040	that build systems the engineers
7321040	7323040	and
7323040	7325040	what is the
7325040	7327040	hacker ethic you've been a man
7327040	7329040	of the people and you've
7329040	7331040	embodied at least the part of that
7331040	7333040	ethic what does it mean
7333040	7335040	what did it mean to you at the time what does it mean
7335040	7337040	to you today so Stephen Levy's
7337040	7339040	book Hackers was a really
7339040	7341040	formative book for me as a teenager
7341040	7343040	I mean I read it several times
7343040	7345040	and there was all
7345040	7347040	of the great lore of the early
7347040	7349040	MIT era of hackers
7349040	7351040	ending up at the end with
7351040	7353040	it kind of went through the early
7353040	7355040	MIT hackers and the Silicon Valley
7355040	7357040	hardware hackers and then
7357040	7359040	the game hackers in part 3
7359040	7361040	and at that time as a teenager
7361040	7363040	I really
7363040	7365040	was kind of bitter in some ways like I
7365040	7367040	thought I was born too late I thought I missed
7367040	7369040	the window there
7369040	7371040	and I really thought I belonged
7371040	7373040	in that third section of that book with the
7373040	7375040	game hackers and they were talking about
7375040	7377040	the Williams at Sierra
7377040	7379040	and Origin Systems with Richard Garriott
7379040	7381040	and it's like I
7381040	7383040	really wanted to be there and
7383040	7385040	I knew that was now a few years
7385040	7387040	in the past it was
7387040	7389040	it was not to be
7389040	7391040	but the early days especially
7391040	7393040	the early MIT hacker days talking
7393040	7395040	a lot about this sense of
7395040	7397040	the hacker ethic that there was this sense
7397040	7399040	that it was about
7399040	7401040	sharing information being good
7401040	7403040	not keeping it to yourself
7403040	7405040	and that it's not a zero sum game
7405040	7407040	that you can share something
7407040	7409040	with another programmer and it doesn't
7409040	7411040	take it away from you
7411040	7413040	you then have somebody else doing something
7413040	7415040	and I also think that there's
7415040	7417040	an aspect of it where it's this
7417040	7419040	ability to take
7419040	7421040	joy in other people's accomplishments
7421040	7423040	where it's not the cutthroat bit of
7423040	7425040	I have to be first I have to be
7425040	7427040	recognized as the one that did
7427040	7429040	this in some way but
7429040	7431040	being able to see somebody else
7431040	7433040	do something and say holy shit that's amazing
7433040	7435040	you know and just taking joy
7435040	7437040	in the ability of something amazing
7437040	7439040	that somebody else does
7439040	7441040	and the
7441040	7443040	big thing that I was able to do
7443040	7445040	through in software was
7445040	7447040	this ability to eventually release the source code
7447040	7449040	for most of our like all of our
7449040	7451040	really seminal game titles
7451040	7453040	and that was a stepping stone
7453040	7455040	process where we were kind
7455040	7457040	of surprised early on where
7457040	7459040	people were able to
7459040	7461040	hack the existing games and of course I had
7461040	7463040	experience with that I remember hacking my copies
7463040	7465040	of Ultima so I give myself
7465040	7467040	9999 gold and raise my levels
7467040	7469040	and you know break out the sector editor
7469040	7471040	and so I was familiar with all of that
7471040	7473040	so it was just it was with a smile
7473040	7475040	when I started to see people doing that to our
7475040	7477040	games I am you know making
7477040	7479040	level editors for Commander Keen
7479040	7481040	or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D
7481040	7483040	but I made the pitch
7483040	7485040	internally that
7485040	7487040	we should actually release our own
7487040	7489040	tools for like what we did
7489040	7491040	what we used to create the games
7491040	7493040	and that was you know that was
7493040	7495040	a little bit debatable about
7495040	7497040	well you know we'll this let other
7497040	7499040	we'll give people a leg up it's always like
7499040	7501040	what's that going to mean for the competition
7501040	7503040	but the really hard
7503040	7505040	pitch was to actually release
7505040	7507040	the full source code for the games
7507040	7509040	and it was a balancing act with
7509040	7511040	the other people inside the company
7511040	7513040	where it's interesting
7513040	7515040	how the programmers
7515040	7517040	generally did get
7517040	7519040	certainly I am the people
7519040	7521040	that I worked closely with they did kind
7521040	7523040	of get that hacker ethic bit where
7523040	7525040	you wanted to share your code you were
7525040	7527040	you were proud of it you wanted other people to take it
7527040	7529040	do cool things with it
7529040	7531040	but interestingly
7531040	7533040	the broader game
7533040	7535040	industry is a little more
7535040	7537040	hesitant to embrace that than
7537040	7539040	like the group of people that we happen to have
7539040	7541040	at id software where it was
7541040	7543040	always a little interesting to me seeing how
7543040	7545040	a lot of people in the game modding
7545040	7547040	community were very possessive
7547040	7549040	of their code they did not want to share their
7549040	7551040	code they wanted it to be theirs it was
7551040	7553040	their you know claim to fame and
7553040	7555040	that was much more like what we
7555040	7557040	tended to see with artists where
7557040	7559040	you know the artists understand something about
7559040	7561040	credit and I you know wanting it to be
7561040	7563040	known as their work and a lot of
7563040	7565040	the game programmers
7565040	7567040	felt a little bit more like artists
7567040	7569040	than like hacker programmers in that
7569040	7571040	it was about building something
7571040	7573040	that maybe felt more like art to them
7573040	7575040	than the more tool based
7575040	7577040	and exploration based kind
7577040	7579040	of hacking culture side of things
7579040	7581040	yes so it's so interesting that this
7581040	7583040	kind of
7583040	7585040	fear that credit will not
7585040	7587040	be sufficiently attributed to you
7587040	7589040	and that's one of the things that I
7589040	7591040	do bump into a lot because
7591040	7593040	I try not
7593040	7595040	to go clean I mean it's easy for me
7595040	7597040	to say because so much credit is heaped on
7597040	7599040	me for the the software side of
7599040	7601040	things but when people come up and
7601040	7603040	they want to pick a fight and say no it's
7603040	7605040	like that wasn't where first person gaming
7605040	7607040	came from and you can point to
7607040	7609040	you know you can point to some of like things
7609040	7611040	on obscure titles that I was never aware
7611040	7613040	of or like the old play-doh systems
7613040	7615040	or you know each personal computer
7615040	7617040	had something that was 3d-ish
7617040	7619040	and moving around and I'm
7619040	7621040	you know and I'm happy to say it's like no
7621040	7623040	I mean I saw battle zone and star wars
7623040	7625040	in the arcades I had seen 3D graphics
7625040	7627040	I had seen all these things there
7627040	7629040	standing on the shoulders of lots of other people
7629040	7631040	but sometimes these examples they pull out
7631040	7633040	like I didn't know that existed I mean
7633040	7635040	there I had never heard of that before
7635040	7637040	then that didn't contribute to
7637040	7639040	what I made but there's plenty of stuff
7639040	7641040	that did and you know I
7641040	7643040	I think there's good cases to be made
7643040	7645040	that obviously doom
7645040	7647040	and quake and Wolfenstein were formative
7647040	7649040	examples for what
7649040	7651040	everything that came after
7651040	7653040	that but I don't
7653040	7655040	feel the need to go fight and say
7655040	7657040	claim primacy or initial
7657040	7659040	invention of anything like that
7659040	7661040	but a lot of people do want to
7661040	7663040	I think when you fight for the credit in that way
7663040	7665040	and it does go against the hacker ethic
7665040	7667040	you destroy
7667040	7669040	something fundamental about the culture
7669040	7671040	about the community that builds cool stuff
7671040	7673040	I think credit ultimately
7675040	7677040	so I had this
7677040	7679040	sort of
7679040	7681040	there's a famous wrestler and freestyle
7681040	7683040	wrestler called
7683040	7685040	and he always
7685040	7687040	preached that you should just
7687040	7689040	focus on the art of the wrestling
7689040	7691040	and let people
7691040	7693040	write your
7693040	7695040	story however they want
7695040	7697040	the
7697040	7699040	the highest form of the art is just
7699040	7701040	focusing on the art and that's something
7701040	7703040	that is something about the
7703040	7705040	hacker ethic is just
7705040	7707040	on building cool stuff
7707040	7709040	sharing it with other cool people
7709040	7711040	and credit will get
7711040	7713040	assigned correctly
7715040	7717040	in the long arc of history
7717040	7719040	and I generally think that's true
7719040	7721040	and you've got
7721040	7723040	there's some things
7723040	7725040	there's a graphics technique that got labeled
7725040	7727040	car max reverse
7727040	7729040	literally named it and it turned out
7729040	7731040	that I wasn't the first person to
7731040	7733040	figure that out like most scientific
7733040	7735040	things or mathematical things you wind up like
7735040	7737040	oh this other person had actually done that
7737040	7739040	somewhat before and then
7739040	7741040	there's things that get attributed to me like the inverse
7741040	7743040	square root hack that I actually didn't
7743040	7745040	do I flat out that wasn't me and it's
7745040	7747040	like it's weird how the memetic power
7747040	7749040	of the internet I cannot
7749040	7751040	you're like the marked point of programming
7751040	7753040	yes it's just everything just gets attributed
7753040	7755040	to you now even though you've never
7755040	7757040	sought that the credit of things
7757040	7759040	I mean but
7759040	7761040	part of the fact that the humility behind
7761040	7763040	that is what attracts the
7763040	7765040	attributions
7765040	7767040	let's talk about a game
7767040	7769040	you mean one of the greatest games
7769040	7771040	ever made I know you could talk about doing quake
7771040	7773040	and so on but to me Wolfenstein 3D
7773040	7775040	was like wow
7775040	7777040	it blew my mind
7777040	7779040	that a world like this could exist so
7779040	7781040	how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be
7781040	7783040	in terms of the programming
7783040	7785040	in terms of the design in terms of some
7785040	7787040	of the memorable technical challenges
7787040	7789040	and also
7789040	7791040	actually just something you haven't mentioned
7791040	7793040	you know
7793040	7795040	how did these ideas
7795040	7797040	come to be
7797040	7799040	inside your mind the adaptive
7799040	7801040	side-scrolling
7801040	7803040	the solutions to these technical challenges
7803040	7805040	so I usually can
7805040	7807040	introspectively pull back
7807040	7809040	pretty detailed
7809040	7811040	accounts of how technology
7811040	7813040	solutions and design choices on my
7813040	7815040	part came to be where
7815040	7817040	technically we had done two games
7817040	7819040	3D games like that before
7819040	7821040	where hover tank was the first one which
7821040	7823040	had flat shaded walls
7823040	7825040	but did have the scaled enemies inside it
7825040	7827040	and then catacombs 3D
7827040	7829040	which had textured walls
7829040	7831040	scaled enemies and
7831040	7833040	some more
7833040	7835040	some more functionality like the disappearing
7835040	7837040	walls and some other stuff
7837040	7839040	but what's really interesting from a game
7839040	7841040	development standpoint is
7841040	7843040	those games catacombs 3D
7843040	7845040	hover tank and Wolfenstein
7845040	7847040	they literally used
7847040	7849040	the same code for
7849040	7851040	a lot of the character behavior that a 2D
7851040	7853040	game that I had made earlier called catacombs
7853040	7855040	did where
7855040	7857040	it was an overhead view game kind of like gauntlet
7857040	7859040	you're running around and you can open up doors
7859040	7861040	pick up items basic game stuff
7861040	7863040	and the thought was that
7863040	7865040	this exact same
7865040	7867040	game experience just
7867040	7869040	presented in a different perspective
7869040	7871040	it could be literally the same game
7871040	7873040	just with a different view into it
7873040	7875040	would have a dramatically different impact
7875040	7877040	on the players
7877040	7879040	so it wasn't
7879040	7881040	a true 3D you're saying that
7881040	7883040	you can kind of fake it you can
7883040	7885040	scale enemies meaning things that are
7885040	7887040	farther away you can make them smaller
7887040	7889040	so from the game was
7889040	7891040	a 2D map like all of our games
7891040	7893040	use the same tool for creation
7893040	7895040	we use the same map editor for creating
7895040	7897040	Keen as Wolfenstein and
7897040	7899040	Hevertank and catacombs and all this stuff
7899040	7901040	so the game was a 2D grid
7901040	7903040	made out of blocks and you could say
7903040	7905040	well these are walls these are where the enemies
7905040	7907040	start then they start moving around
7907040	7909040	and these early games like catacombs
7909040	7911040	you played it strictly in a 2D view
7911040	7913040	it was a scrolling 2D view
7913040	7915040	and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh
7915040	7917040	at the time to be able to do something like
7917040	7919040	that and then
7919040	7921040	the thought that these early games
7921040	7923040	all it did was take the same
7923040	7925040	basic enemy logic but instead of
7925040	7927040	seeing it from the god's eye view on top
7927040	7929040	you were inside it and turning
7929040	7931040	from side to side yawing your view
7931040	7933040	and moving forwards and backwards and side to
7933040	7935040	side and
7935040	7937040	it's a striking thing where you always talk
7937040	7939040	about wanting to isolate and factor changes
7939040	7941040	in values and this was one of those
7941040	7943040	most pure cases there where
7943040	7945040	the rest of the game changed very little
7945040	7947040	it was our normal kind of change the colors
7947040	7949040	on something and draw a different picture for
7949040	7951040	it but it's kind of the same thing
7951040	7953040	but the perspective changed in a really
7953040	7955040	fundamental way and it was
7955040	7957040	dramatically different I can remember
7957040	7959040	the reactions where
7959040	7961040	the artist Adrian that had been
7961040	7963040	drawing the pictures for it we had a cool
7963040	7965040	big troll thing in Catacombs 3D
7965040	7967040	and we had these walls that
7967040	7969040	you could get a key and you could make the blocks
7969040	7971040	disappear and really simple stuff
7971040	7973040	blocks could either be there or not there
7973040	7975040	so our idea of a door was being able to
7975040	7977040	make a set of blocks just disappear
7977040	7979040	and I remember the reaction where he
7979040	7981040	had drawn these characters and he was slowly
7981040	7983040	moving around and like people had no
7983040	7985040	experience with 3D navigation it was all still
7985040	7987040	keyboard we didn't even have mice
7987040	7989040	set up at that time but
7989040	7991040	slowly moving going up picked up a
7991040	7993040	key go to a wall the wall disappears
7993040	7995040	in a little animation and there's a monster
7995040	7997040	like right there and he practically
7997040	7999040	fell out of his chair it was just like
7999040	8001040	and games just
8001040	8003040	didn't do that you know the games were
8003040	8005040	the gods eye view you were a little invested
8005040	8007040	in your little guy you can be like
8007040	8009040	you know happy or sad when things
8009040	8011040	happen but you just did not get that kind
8011040	8013040	of startle reaction you weren't inside
8013040	8015040	your face something in the back of your
8015040	8017040	brain some reptile brain thing is just
8017040	8019040	going oh shit something just happened
8019040	8021040	and that was one of those
8021040	8023040	early points where it's like yeah this
8023040	8025040	is going to make a difference this is
8025040	8027040	going to be powerful and it's going to matter
8027040	8029040	were you able to imagine that in the
8029040	8031040	idea stage or no so
8031040	8033040	not that exact
8033040	8035040	thing so again we had cases
8035040	8037040	like the arcade games battle zone
8037040	8039040	and star wars that you could kind of see
8039040	8041040	a 3D world and things coming at you
8041040	8043040	and you get some sense of it
8043040	8045040	but nothing had done the kind
8045040	8047040	of worlds that we were doing and the sort
8047040	8049040	of action based things 3D
8049040	8051040	at the time was really
8051040	8053040	largely about the simulation
8053040	8055040	thoughts and this is something
8055040	8057040	that really might have
8057040	8059040	trended differently if not for
8059040	8061040	the software approach in the games where
8061040	8063040	there were flight simulators
8063040	8065040	there were driving simulators you had
8065040	8067040	like hard drive in and
8067040	8069040	Microsoft flight simulator and these were
8069040	8071040	doing 3D and general purpose
8071040	8073040	3D and ways that were
8073040	8075040	more flexible than what we were doing with
8075040	8077040	our games but they were looked at
8077040	8079040	as simulations they weren't trying
8079040	8081040	to necessarily be fast or responsive
8081040	8083040	or letting you do
8083040	8085040	kind of exciting maneuvers
8085040	8087040	because they were trying to simulate reality
8087040	8089040	and they were taking their cues from the big
8089040	8091040	systems the Evans in Sutherland and the silicon
8091040	8093040	graphics that were doing things
8093040	8095040	but we were taking our cues from
8095040	8097040	the console and arcade games you know we
8097040	8099040	had things that were
8099040	8101040	sort of quarter eaters that were doing
8101040	8103040	fast paced things that you could smack
8103040	8105040	you around rather than just smoothly
8105040	8107040	gliding you from place to place
8107040	8109040	so quarter
8109040	8111040	yeah and you know a funny thing is
8111040	8113040	so much that that built into us that
8113040	8115040	Wolfenstein still had
8115040	8117040	lives and you had like one of the biggest
8117040	8119040	power-ups in all these games like was an
8119040	8121040	extra life because you started off with
8121040	8123040	three lives and you lose your lives and
8123040	8125040	then it's game over and there weren't
8125040	8127040	any other games in most of this stuff
8127040	8129040	it was and it sounds almost crazy
8129040	8131040	to say this but it was an innovation
8131040	8133040	in doom to not have lives
8133040	8135040	you know you could just play doom as long as you wanted
8135040	8137040	you just restart at the start of the level
8137040	8139040	and why not this is like
8139040	8141040	we aren't trying to take people's quarters
8141040	8143040	they've already paid for the entire game
8143040	8145040	we want them to have a good time
8145040	8147040	and you would have some
8147040	8149040	you know some old-timer purists that might think
8149040	8151040	that there's something to the epic journey
8151040	8153040	of making it to the end having to restart
8153040	8155040	tries but now more fun is had
8155040	8157040	when you just let people kind of keep trying
8157040	8159040	when they're stuck rather than having to go
8159040	8161040	all the way back and and learn different
8161040	8163040	things so you recommended the
8163040	8165040	game engine black book Wolfenstein 3D
8165040	8167040	for technical exploration
8167040	8169040	of the game so looking back
8169040	8171040	30 years what are some
8171040	8173040	memorable technical innovations
8173040	8175040	that made this perspective
8175040	8177040	shift into this world that's
8177040	8179040	so immersive that scares you when a monster appears
8179040	8181040	or some things you have to solve
8181040	8183040	so one of the interesting things
8183040	8185040	that come back to the theme of
8185040	8187040	deadlines and resource constraints
8187040	8189040	the game catacombs 3D
8189040	8191040	we shipped
8191040	8193040	we were supposed to be shipping this for gamers edge
8193040	8195040	on a monthly cadence and
8195040	8197040	I had slipped I was actually
8197040	8199040	late it slipped like six weeks because
8199040	8201040	this was texture mapped walls
8201040	8203040	doing stuff that I hadn't done before
8203040	8205040	and
8205040	8207040	at the six-week point it was still
8207040	8209040	kind of glitchy and buggy there were things
8209040	8211040	that I knew that if you had
8211040	8213040	a wall that was like almost edge on
8213040	8215040	you could slide over to it you could see
8215040	8217040	some things freak out or vanish or not
8217040	8219040	work and I hated that
8219040	8221040	I but I was up against
8221040	8223040	the wall we had to ship the game
8223040	8225040	it was still a lot of fun to play it was novel
8225040	8227040	nobody had seen it it gave you that startle
8227040	8229040	reflex I reaction so
8229040	8231040	it was worth shipping
8231040	8233040	but it had these things that I knew
8233040	8235040	were kind of flaky and janky and not
8235040	8237040	not what I was really proud of
8237040	8239040	so one of the
8239040	8241040	things that I did very differently in Wolfenstein
8241040	8243040	I was
8243040	8245040	I went catacombs used
8245040	8247040	almost a conventional
8247040	8249040	thing where you had segments that were
8249040	8251040	one-dimensional polygons basically that were
8251040	8253040	clipped and back faced
8253040	8255040	and done kind of like a very crude
8255040	8257040	3D engine from the professionals
8257040	8259040	but I wasn't getting it done
8259040	8261040	right I was not doing a good
8261040	8263040	enough job I didn't really have line of sight
8263040	8265040	to fix it
8265040	8267040	right there's stuff that of course I look back
8267040	8269040	it's like oh it's obvious how to do this
8269040	8271040	do the math right do your clipping right
8271040	8273040	check all of this how you handle the precision
8273040	8275040	but I did not know how to do that
8275040	8277040	at that time the first 3D
8277040	8279040	engine you wrote catacombs 3D
8279040	8281040	you know hover tank had been a little bit before that
8281040	8283040	but that had the flat shaded walls so
8283040	8285040	the texture mapping on the walls was what
8285040	8287040	was bringing in some of these challenges
8287040	8289040	that was hard for me
8289040	8291040	and I couldn't solve it right at the time
8291040	8293040	can you describe what flat shading is in texture mapping
8293040	8295040	so in the the walls were
8295040	8297040	solid color one of 16 colors
8297040	8299040	I am in hover tank
8299040	8301040	so that's easy it's fast you just
8301040	8303040	draw the solid color for everything
8303040	8305040	texture mapping is what we all see today
8305040	8307040	where you have an image that is stretched
8307040	8309040	and distorted onto the walls
8309040	8311040	or the surfaces that you're working with
8311040	8313040	and it was
8313040	8315040	you know it was a long time for me to just figure out
8315040	8317040	how to do that without it
8317040	8319040	distorting in the wrong ways and
8319040	8321040	and I did not get it all
8321040	8323040	exactly right in catacombs and I had
8323040	8325040	these flaws
8325040	8327040	so that was important enough to me
8327040	8329040	that rather than continuing to bang my head
8329040	8331040	on that when I wasn't positive I was
8331040	8333040	going to get it I went with a completely
8333040	8335040	different approach for drawing for
8335040	8337040	figuring out where the walls were which was
8337040	8339040	a ray casting approach
8339040	8341040	which I had done in catacombs 3D
8341040	8343040	I had a bunch of C code
8343040	8345040	trying to make this work right and it wasn't
8345040	8347040	working right in Wolfenstein
8347040	8349040	I wound up going to a very
8349040	8351040	small amount of assembly code
8351040	8353040	so in some ways they should be a slower
8353040	8355040	way of doing it but by
8355040	8357040	making it a smaller amount of work that I could
8357040	8359040	more tightly optimize it worked
8359040	8361040	out and Wolfenstein 3D was just
8361040	8363040	absolutely rock solid you know it was
8363040	8365040	you know nothing glitched
8365040	8367040	in there the game just was pretty much
8367040	8369040	flawless through all of that and I was super
8369040	8371040	proud of that
8371040	8373040	but eventually like in the later games
8373040	8375040	I went back to the more span
8375040	8377040	based things where I could get more total efficiency
8377040	8379040	once I really did figure out how
8379040	8381040	to do it so there were two
8381040	8383040	sort of key technical things to Wolfenstein
8383040	8385040	one was this ray casting
8385040	8387040	approach which you still to this
8387040	8389040	day you see people go and say let's
8389040	8391040	write a ray casting engine because
8391040	8393040	it's an understandable way of doing things
8393040	8395040	that let you make games very much
8395040	8397040	like that so you see raycasters in
8397040	8399040	javascript raycasters in python people
8399040	8401040	that are are basically going and
8401040	8403040	re-implementing that that approach
8403040	8405040	to taking a tiled world
8405040	8407040	and casting out into it it works
8407040	8409040	pretty well but it's not the fastest way
8409040	8411040	of doing it can you describe what ray casting is
8411040	8413040	so you start off and you got
8413040	8415040	your screen which is 320 pixels
8415040	8417040	across at the time if you haven't sized down
8417040	8419040	in the window for for greater
8419040	8421040	speed and at every pixel
8421040	8423040	there's going to be an angle from you got
8423040	8425040	your position in the world and you're going
8425040	8427040	to just run along that angle
8427040	8429040	and keep going until you hit a block
8429040	8431040	so up to 320
8431040	8433040	times across there it's going to throw
8433040	8435040	cast array out into the world
8435040	8437040	from wherever your origin is
8437040	8439040	until it runs into a wall and then it
8439040	8441040	can figure out exactly where on the wall
8441040	8443040	it hits the performance challenge
8443040	8445040	of that is as it's going out
8445040	8447040	every block it's crossing it checks
8447040	8449040	is this a solid wall
8449040	8451040	so that means that in like
8451040	8453040	the early Wolfenstein levels you're in a
8453040	8455040	small jail cell going out into a small
8455040	8457040	hallway it's super efficient for that
8457040	8459040	because you're only stepping across three
8459040	8461040	or four blocks but then if somebody
8461040	8463040	makes a room that covers our maps
8463040	8465040	we're limited to 64 by 64 blocks
8465040	8467040	if you made one room
8467040	8469040	that was nothing but walls at the far
8469040	8471040	space it would go pretty slow
8471040	8473040	because it would be stepping across
8473040	8475040	80 tile tests or something
8475040	8477040	along the way by the way the physics of our
8477040	8479040	universe seems to be computing this very thing
8479040	8481040	so this maps nicely to the
8481040	8483040	actual physics of our world
8483040	8485040	yeah you get like I follow a little bit
8485040	8487040	of something like Stephen Wolfram's work on
8487040	8489040	you know interconnected network
8489040	8491040	information states of that and
8491040	8493040	that's it's beyond what I can
8493040	8495040	have an informed opinion on
8495040	8497040	but it's interesting that people are
8497040	8499040	considering things like that and have
8499040	8501040	and have things that can back
8501040	8503040	it up yeah that's yeah
8503040	8505040	there's whole different sets of interesting stuff
8505040	8507040	there so Wolfenstein 3D
8507040	8509040	had ray casting so the ray casting
8509040	8511040	and then the other kind of key aspect
8511040	8513040	was what I called compiled
8513040	8515040	scalers where the idea of
8515040	8517040	you saw this in the
8517040	8519040	earlier classic arcade games
8519040	8521040	like space harrier and stuff where
8521040	8523040	you would take a picture which is
8523040	8525040	normally drawn directly on the screen
8525040	8527040	and then if you have the ability to make it
8527040	8529040	bigger or smaller big chunky pixels
8529040	8531040	or physically small drop sampled pixels
8531040	8533040	that's the fundamental
8533040	8535040	aspect of what our characters were doing
8535040	8537040	in these 3D games you would have
8537040	8539040	it's just like you might have drawn a tiny little character
8539040	8541040	but now we can make them really big
8541040	8543040	and make them really small move it around
8543040	8545040	that was the limited kind of 3D
8545040	8547040	that we had for characters to make them turn
8547040	8549040	there were literally eight different views
8549040	8551040	of them you didn't actually have a 3D model
8551040	8553040	that would rotate you just had these cardboard
8553040	8555040	cutouts but that was good enough for that
8555040	8557040	startle fight reaction and
8557040	8559040	it was kind of what we had to deal
8559040	8561040	with there so a straight
8561040	8563040	forward approach to do that you could just
8563040	8565040	write out your doubly nested loop of
8565040	8567040	you've got your stretch factor
8567040	8569040	and it's like you've got a point you stretch by a little
8569040	8571040	bit it might be on the same pixel it might
8571040	8573040	have skipped a pixel
8573040	8575040	you can write that out but it's not
8575040	8577040	going to be fast enough where especially
8577040	8579040	you get a character for that right in your
8579040	8581040	face monster covering almost the entire
8581040	8583040	screen doing that with a general
8583040	8585040	purpose scaling routine would have just
8585040	8587040	been much too slow it would have worked
8587040	8589040	when they're small characters but then it would get
8589040	8591040	slower and slower as they got closer to you
8591040	8593040	until right at the time when you most care
8593040	8595040	about having a fast reaction time
8595040	8597040	the game would be chunking down
8597040	8599040	so the fastest possible way
8599040	8601040	to draw pixels
8601040	8603040	at that time was
8603040	8605040	to I am
8605040	8607040	instead of saying I've got a general
8607040	8609040	purpose I am
8609040	8611040	version that can handle any scale
8611040	8613040	I made I used
8613040	8615040	a program to make essentially
8615040	8617040	a hundred or more separate little
8617040	8619040	programs that was optimized for
8619040	8621040	I will take an image and I will draw it
8621040	8623040	12 pixels tall I'll take an image
8623040	8625040	I'll draw it 14 pixels tall up
8625040	8627040	by every two pixels even
8627040	8629040	for that so you would have the most
8629040	8631040	optimized code so that
8631040	8633040	in the normal case where
8633040	8635040	most of the world is fairly large
8635040	8637040	I like the pixels are big
8637040	8639040	we did not have a lot of memory
8639040	8641040	so in most cases that meant that you would
8641040	8643040	load a pixel color
8643040	8645040	and then you would store it multiple times
8645040	8647040	so that was faster
8647040	8649040	than even copying an image
8649040	8651040	in a normal conventional case
8651040	8653040	because most of the time the image is expanded
8653040	8655040	so instead of doing one read one
8655040	8657040	write for a simple copy you might
8657040	8659040	be doing one read and three or four writes
8659040	8661040	as it got really big and that
8661040	8663040	had the beneficial aspect of just when you
8663040	8665040	needed the performance most when things are
8665040	8667040	covering the screen it was giving you the most
8667040	8669040	acceleration for that by the way
8669040	8671040	were you able to
8671040	8673040	understand this through
8673040	8675040	thinking about it or were you testing
8675040	8677040	like the right speed and like this again
8677040	8679040	comes back to I can
8679040	8681040	find the antecedents for things like this
8681040	8683040	so in I am
8683040	8685040	back in the Apple two days
8685040	8687040	the graphics were
8687040	8689040	essentially single bits at a time
8689040	8691040	and if you wanted to make your little
8691040	8693040	spaceship if you wanted to make it
8693040	8695040	smoothly go across the world
8695040	8697040	if you just took the image and you drew it out at the next
8697040	8699040	location you would move by seven pixels
8699040	8701040	at a time so it would go chunk chunk chunk
8701040	8703040	if you wanted to make it move smoothly
8703040	8705040	you actually had to make seven versions
8705040	8707040	of the ship that were pre-shifted
8707040	8709040	you could write a program that would shift it
8709040	8711040	dynamically but on a one megahertz
8711040	8713040	processor that's not going anywhere fast
8713040	8715040	so if you wanted to do a smooth
8715040	8717040	moving fast action game
8717040	8719040	you made separate versions of each of these
8719040	8721040	sprites now there were
8721040	8723040	a few more tricks you could pull that if it
8723040	8725040	still wasn't fast enough you could make
8725040	8727040	a compiled shape
8727040	8729040	where instead of
8729040	8731040	this program that normally copies
8731040	8733040	an image and it says like get this byte
8733040	8735040	from here stored here get this byte store this
8735040	8737040	byte if you've got the memory
8737040	8739040	space you could say I'm going
8739040	8741040	to write the program that does nothing but draw
8741040	8743040	this shape it's going to be like
8743040	8745040	I'm going to load the immediate value
8745040	8747040	25 you know which is
8747040	8749040	some bit pattern and then I'm going to store
8749040	8751040	that at this location
8751040	8753040	rather than loading something from memory
8753040	8755040	that involved indexing registers
8755040	8757040	and this other slow stuff
8757040	8759040	you could go ahead and say no I'm going to hard
8759040	8761040	code the exact values of all of the image
8761040	8763040	right into the program and this was always
8763040	8765040	a horrible trade off there but you didn't have much
8765040	8767040	memory and you didn't have much speed
8767040	8769040	but if you had something that you wanted to go really
8769040	8771040	fast you could turn it into a program
8771040	8773040	and that was
8773040	8775040	you know knowing about that technique is what
8775040	8777040	made me think about some of these unwinding
8777040	8779040	it for the PC where people
8779040	8781040	that didn't come from that background were less
8781040	8783040	likely to think about that
8783040	8785040	I mean there's some deep parallels
8785040	8787040	probably to human cognition as well
8787040	8789040	there's something about
8791040	8793040	optimizing and compressing
8793040	8795040	the processing
8795040	8797040	of a new information that requires
8797040	8799040	you to predict the possible
8799040	8801040	ways in which
8801040	8803040	the game or the world
8803040	8805040	might unroll and you have
8805040	8807040	something like compiled scalars always
8807040	8809040	there so you have like
8809040	8811040	optimum like you have a
8811040	8813040	prediction of how the world will unroll and you have
8813040	8815040	some kind of optimized
8815040	8817040	data structure
8817040	8819040	for that prediction and then you can modify
8819040	8821040	if the world turns out to be different
8821040	8823040	you can modify in a slight way
8823040	8825040	and as far as building out techniques
8825040	8827040	so much of the brain is about the associative context
8827040	8829040	you know there just when you learn
8829040	8831040	something it's in the context of something else
8831040	8833040	and you can have faint tiny little
8833040	8835040	hints of things and I do think
8835040	8837040	there are some deep things around
8837040	8839040	like sparse distributed memories and boosting
8839040	8841040	that's like if you can just be slightly above
8841040	8843040	the noise floor of having some hint
8843040	8845040	of something you can have things refined
8845040	8847040	into pulling the memory back up so
8847040	8849040	having a being a programmer
8849040	8851040	a tool box of like all of these things
8851040	8853040	that things that I did in all of these
8853040	8855040	previous lives of programming tasks
8855040	8857040	that still matters to me about how
8857040	8859040	I'm able to pull up some of these things
8859040	8861040	like in that case it was something I did on the
8861040	8863040	Apple too then being relevant for the PC
8863040	8865040	and I have still cases
8865040	8867040	when I would when I would work on
8867040	8869040	mobile development then be like okay
8869040	8871040	I did something like this back in the
8871040	8873040	doom days but now it's a different
8873040	8875040	environment but I still had that tie
8875040	8877040	I can bring it in and I can transform it
8877040	8879040	into what the world needs right now
8879040	8881040	and I do think that's actually one of the
8881040	8883040	very core things with human
8883040	8885040	cognition and brain like
8885040	8887040	you know brain like functioning is
8887040	8889040	finding these ways about you've got
8889040	8891040	your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once
8891040	8893040	you know it's it is just a set of all of
8893040	8895040	this stuff that is just fetched back by
8895040	8897040	these queries that go into it
8897040	8899040	and they can just be slightly above the noise
8899040	8901040	floor with random noise in your neurons
8901040	8903040	and synapses that are affecting exactly
8903040	8905040	what gets pulled up. So you're saying
8905040	8907040	there's very specific solutions for different
8907040	8909040	games you find
8909040	8911040	that there's a kernel of
8911040	8913040	a deep idea that's generalizable to
8913040	8915040	other to other things. Yeah you
8915040	8917040	can't predict what it's going to be but
8917040	8919040	that idea of like I called out that compiled
8919040	8921040	shaders in the forward that I wrote
8921040	8923040	for that the game engine black book
8923040	8925040	as you know this is
8925040	8927040	it's kind of an endpoint of unrolling
8927040	8929040	code but that's one of those
8929040	8931040	things that thinking about that and having that
8931040	8933040	in your mind and I'm sure there are some programmers
8933040	8935040	that you know hear about that think about
8935040	8937040	it a little bit it's kind of the mind blown moment
8937040	8939040	it's like oh you can just turn all of that
8939040	8941040	data into code and
8941040	8943040	nowadays you know you have instruction cache
8943040	8945040	issues and that's not necessarily the best idea
8945040	8947040	but there are different
8947040	8949040	it's an idea that has power
8949040	8951040	and has probably relevance in some other
8951040	8953040	areas maybe it's in a hardware point of view
8953040	8955040	that there's a way you approach building hardware
8955040	8957040	that has that same you don't
8957040	8959040	even have to think about iterating you just bake
8959040	8961040	everything all the way into it in one
8961040	8963040	place what is the story
8963040	8965040	of how you came to program doom
8965040	8967040	what is some memorable technical
8967040	8969040	challenges or innovations within that game
8969040	8971040	so the path that we went
8971040	8973040	after after Wolfenstein
8973040	8975040	got out and we were on this crazy
8975040	8977040	arc where keen one through three
8977040	8979040	more success than we thought keen
8979040	8981040	four through six even more success
8981040	8983040	Wolfenstein even more success so we were
8983040	8985040	on this this crazy trajectory
8985040	8987040	for things so actually our first
8987040	8989040	box commercial project was a commander keen
8989040	8991040	I am game but then
8991040	8993040	Wolfenstein was going to have a game called
8993040	8995040	spear of destiny which was
8995040	8997040	a commercial version 60 new levels
8997040	8999040	so the rest of the team took the game
8999040	9001040	engine pretty much as it was
9001040	9003040	and started working on that we got
9003040	9005040	new monsters but it's
9005040	9007040	basically reskins of the things
9007040	9009040	there there's a really interesting aspect
9009040	9011040	about that that I didn't appreciate until much
9011040	9013040	much later about how
9013040	9015040	Wolfenstein clearly did
9015040	9017040	tap out its limit about what
9017040	9019040	you want to play and all
9019040	9021040	the levels and a couple of our license things
9021040	9023040	there was a hard
9023040	9025040	creative wall that you did not really
9025040	9027040	benefit much by continuing to beat on it
9027040	9029040	but a game like
9029040	9031040	doom and other more modern
9031040	9033040	games like minecraft or something
9033040	9035040	there's kind of a turing completeness level
9035040	9037040	of design freedom that you get in games
9037040	9039040	that Wolfenstein really sat on one
9039040	9041040	side of you know all the creative
9041040	9043040	people in the world could not go and do
9043040	9045040	a masterpiece just with the technology
9045040	9047040	that Wolfenstein had Wolfenstein
9047040	9049040	could do Wolfenstein but you really couldn't do
9049040	9051040	something crazy and different but it
9051040	9053040	didn't take that much more capability
9053040	9055040	to get to Wolfenstein with
9055040	9057040	the freeform lines and a little
9057040	9059040	bit more artistic freedom to get to the
9059040	9061040	point where people still announced
9061040	9063040	new doom levels today all these years
9063040	9065040	after without having completely
9065040	9067040	tapped out the creativity how did you
9067040	9069040	put it turing complete
9069040	9071040	design space design space like
9071040	9073040	you know we have the kind of computational
9073040	9075040	universality
9075040	9077040	on a lot of things but for creativity
9077040	9079040	but yeah there's things where
9079040	9081040	a box can be too small
9081040	9083040	but above a certain point
9083040	9085040	you kind of are at the point where
9085040	9087040	you really have almost
9087040	9089040	unbounded creative ability there and doom
9089040	9091040	was the first time you crossed that
9091040	9093040	line yeah where there were
9093040	9095040	thousands of doom levels created
9095040	9097040	and some of them still have something new
9097040	9099040	and interesting to say to the world about it
9099040	9101040	is that line
9101040	9103040	do you introspect what that line was
9103040	9105040	is in the design space
9105040	9107040	is it something about the programming
9107040	9109040	capabilities that you were able
9109040	9111040	to add to the game
9111040	9113040	so the graphics fidelity
9113040	9115040	was a necessary part because the block
9115040	9117040	limitations in Wolfenstein
9117040	9119040	what we had right there
9119040	9121040	was not enough
9121040	9123040	the full scale blocks although
9123040	9125040	Minecraft I really did show
9125040	9127040	that perhaps blocks stacked
9127040	9129040	in 3D and at one quarter
9129040	9131040	scale of that one eighth in volume
9131040	9133040	is then sufficient to have all of that
9133040	9135040	but the wall
9135040	9137040	sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein
9137040	9139040	was too much of a creative limitation
9139040	9141040	we licensed the technology to a few other teams
9141040	9143040	none of them made
9143040	9145040	too much of a dent with that
9145040	9147040	it just wasn't enough creative ability
9147040	9149040	but a little bit more whether it was
9149040	9151040	the variable floors and ceilings
9151040	9153040	and arbitrary angles in doom
9153040	9155040	or the smaller
9155040	9157040	box blocks in Minecraft
9157040	9159040	is then enough to open it up to
9159040	9161040	just worlds and worlds of new capabilities
9161040	9163040	what is binary
9163040	9165040	space partitioning
9165040	9167040	which is one of the technologies
9167040	9169040	jump around a little bit
9169040	9171040	on the story path there
9171040	9173040	so while the team was working on Spirit Destiny
9173040	9175040	for Wolfenstein
9175040	9177040	we had met another development team
9177040	9179040	Raven Software while we were in Wisconsin
9179040	9181040	and
9181040	9183040	they had RPG background
9183040	9185040	and I still kind of love that
9185040	9187040	they offered to do a game engine
9187040	9189040	for them to let them do a
9189040	9191040	3D rendered RPG
9191040	9193040	instead of the like most RPG games
9193040	9195040	were kind of hand drawn they made it look
9195040	9197040	kind of 3D but it was done just all with
9197040	9199040	artist work rather than a real engine
9199040	9201040	and
9201040	9203040	after Wolfenstein this was still a tile
9203040	9205040	based world but I added floors and ceilings
9205040	9207040	and some lighting and the ability to have
9207040	9209040	some sloped floors in different areas
9209040	9211040	and that was my intermediate step for a game called
9211040	9213040	Shadowcaster
9213040	9215040	it had slowed down enough it was not
9215040	9217040	fast enough to do our type of action
9217040	9219040	things so that they had the screen
9219040	9221040	cropped down a little bit so you couldn't
9221040	9223040	go the full screen width like we would try to
9223040	9225040	do in Wolfenstein
9225040	9227040	but I learned a lot I got the floors
9227040	9229040	and ceilings and lightings and it looked great
9229040	9231040	they were great artists up there and it was
9231040	9233040	it was an inspiration for us to look at some
9233040	9235040	of that stuff
9235040	9237040	but I had learned enough from that
9237040	9239040	that I had the plan for I knew
9239040	9241040	faster ways to do the the lighting
9241040	9243040	shadowing and I wanted to do this free form
9243040	9245040	geometry I wanted to break out of this tile
9245040	9247040	based 90 degree
9247040	9249040	world limitations
9249040	9251040	so we had that was when
9251040	9253040	we got our next stations and we were working
9253040	9255040	with these higher powered systems
9255040	9257040	and we built
9257040	9259040	an editor that let us draw kind of arbitrary
9259040	9261040	line segments and I was working
9261040	9263040	hard to try to make something that could
9263040	9265040	render this fast enough
9265040	9267040	I was pushing myself
9267040	9269040	pretty hard and
9269040	9271040	we were we were at a point where
9271040	9273040	we could see some things that looked amazingly
9273040	9275040	cool but it wasn't really fast enough
9275040	9277040	for the way I was doing it
9277040	9279040	I for this flexibility it was no longer
9279040	9281040	I couldn't just ray cast into it
9281040	9283040	and I had these very complex sets of lines
9283040	9285040	and simple little worlds were okay
9285040	9287040	but the cool things that we wanted to do
9287040	9289040	just weren't quite fast enough
9289040	9291040	and I wound up taking
9291040	9293040	a break at that point and I
9293040	9295040	did the the port I did two
9295040	9297040	ports of our games
9297040	9299040	I Wolfenstein to
9299040	9301040	the I to the Super Nintendo
9301040	9303040	it was I it was a crazy
9303040	9305040	difficult thing to do which was an even
9305040	9307040	slower processors like 2
9307040	9309040	I a couple megahertz
9309040	9311040	processor and it had
9311040	9313040	been this whole thing where we had farmed out
9313040	9315040	the I
9315040	9317040	the work and it wasn't it wasn't going
9317040	9319040	well and I took it back over
9319040	9321040	and trying to make it go
9321040	9323040	fast on there where it really
9323040	9325040	did not have much processing power
9325040	9327040	the pixels were stretched up hugely and it's
9327040	9329040	you know it's pretty ugly when you looked at it
9329040	9331040	but in the end it did come out fast enough
9331040	9333040	to play and still be kind of fun from that
9333040	9335040	but that was where I started
9335040	9337040	using BSP trees or binary
9337040	9339040	space partitioning trees it was one of those
9339040	9341040	things I had to make it faster there
9341040	9343040	it was a stepping stone where
9343040	9345040	it was reasonably easy to understand
9345040	9347040	in the grid world of Wolfenstein where
9347040	9349040	it was all still 90 degree angles
9349040	9351040	I'm BSP trees were
9351040	9353040	I eased myself into it
9353040	9355040	with that and it was a big success
9355040	9357040	I am then when I came
9357040	9359040	back to working on doom I had
9359040	9361040	this new tool in my toolbox it was going
9361040	9363040	to be a lot harder with the arbitrary
9363040	9365040	angles of doom this was where
9365040	9367040	I really started grappling with epsilon
9367040	9369040	problems and just you know up
9369040	9371040	until that point I hadn't really had to deal with
9371040	9373040	the fact that I am so
9373040	9375040	many numeric things this almost felt like a betrayal
9375040	9377040	to me where people had told me that I had
9377040	9379040	mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal
9379040	9381040	where I was people
9381040	9383040	think I'm a math wizard and I'm not I really
9383040	9385040	everything that I did
9385040	9387040	was really done with a solid
9387040	9389040	high school math understanding
9389040	9391040	you know algebra 2 trigonometry
9391040	9393040	and I am that was
9393040	9395040	what got me all the way through doom and quake
9395040	9397040	and all of that of just understanding
9397040	9399040	basics of matrices and
9399040	9401040	knowing it well enough to do something with it
9401040	9403040	what's the epsilon problems you ran into
9403040	9405040	so I when you wind up taking
9405040	9407040	a like a sloped line
9407040	9409040	and you say I'm going to intersect it with another
9409040	9411040	sloped line I am
9411040	9413040	then you wind up with something that's not going
9413040	9415040	to be on these nice grid boundaries
9415040	9417040	with the Wolfenstein tile maps
9417040	9419040	where all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines
9419040	9421040	looking at it from above and if you cut
9421040	9423040	one of them it's just obvious the other one gets
9423040	9425040	cut exactly at that point
9425040	9427040	but when you have angled lines you're doing
9427040	9429040	a kind of a slope intercept problem
9429040	9431040	and you wind up with rational numbers there
9431040	9433040	where things that are not going
9433040	9435040	to evenly land on an integer
9435040	9437040	or even on any fixed point value that you've got
9437040	9439040	so everything winds up having
9439040	9441040	to snap to some fixed point value
9441040	9443040	so the lines slightly change their
9443040	9445040	angle you wind up if you cut something
9445040	9447040	here this one's going to bend a little this way
9447040	9449040	and it's not going to be completely straight
9449040	9451040	and then you come down to all these questions of
9451040	9453040	well this one is
9453040	9455040	is a point on an angled line
9455040	9457040	you can't answer that in finite precision
9457040	9459040	unless you're doing something
9459040	9461040	with actual rational numbers
9461040	9463040	and later on I did waste far too much time
9463040	9465040	chasing things like that how do you do
9465040	9467040	base arithmetic with rational numbers
9467040	9469040	and it always blows up eventually
9469040	9471040	exponentially as you do an update
9471040	9473040	so these kind of things aren't possible with computers
9473040	9475040	so they're possible
9475040	9477040	again there are paths to do
9477040	9479040	doing it but you can't fit them conveniently
9479040	9481040	and any of the numbers you need to start using
9481040	9483040	big nums and different
9483040	9485040	factor trackings and different things
9485040	9487040	so you have to if you have any
9487040	9489040	elements of OCD and you want to do something
9489040	9491040	perfectly you're screwed if you're working
9491040	9493040	with floating point
9493040	9495040	so you had to deal with this for the first time
9495040	9497040	and there were lots of challenges
9497040	9499040	there about okay
9499040	9501040	they build this cool thing and the way the BSP
9501040	9503040	trees work is it basically
9503040	9505040	takes the walls and it carves other
9505040	9507040	walls by those walls in this
9507040	9509040	clever way that you can then take
9509040	9511040	all of these fragments and then you can
9511040	9513040	for sure from any given point
9513040	9515040	get an ordering of everything in the world
9515040	9517040	and you can say this goes in front of this
9517040	9519040	goes in front of this all the way back to
9519040	9521040	the last thing and that's super
9521040	9523040	valuable for graphics where
9523040	9525040	kind of a classic graphics algorithm
9525040	9527040	would be painter's algorithm
9527040	9529040	you paint the furthest thing first and then the next thing
9529040	9531040	and then the next thing and then it comes up
9531040	9533040	and it's all perfect for you that's
9533040	9535040	slow because you don't want to have to have drawn
9535040	9537040	everything like that but you can also flip
9537040	9539040	it around and draw the closest thing to
9539040	9541040	you and then if you're clever
9541040	9543040	about it you can figure out what you need to
9543040	9545040	draw that's visible beyond
9545040	9547040	that and that's what BSP trees allow you to do
9547040	9549040	yeah so it's combined with
9549040	9551040	a bunch of other things but it gives
9551040	9553040	you that ordering it's a clever way
9553040	9555040	of doing things and I remember
9555040	9557040	I had learned this from one of
9557040	9559040	my graphics bible at the time
9559040	9561040	a book called folian van dam
9561040	9563040	it was a different world back there
9563040	9565040	there was a small integer number of books
9565040	9567040	and this book
9567040	9569040	this book that was a big fat college
9569040	9571040	textbook that I had read
9571040	9573040	through many times I didn't
9573040	9575040	understand everything in it some of it wasn't
9575040	9577040	useful to me but they had the little
9577040	9579040	thing about
9579040	9581040	finite orderings of you draw a little
9581040	9583040	t-shaped thing and you can say you
9583040	9585040	can make a fixed ahead of time order from
9585040	9587040	this and you can generalize this with
9587040	9589040	the BSP trees and
9589040	9591040	I got a little bit more information about that
9591040	9593040	and it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake
9593040	9595040	I got to meet Bruce Naylor
9595040	9597040	who was one of the original researchers that
9597040	9599040	developed those technologies
9599040	9601040	for academic literature
9601040	9603040	and that was kind of fun but I was very much
9603040	9605040	just finding a tool that can help me solve
9605040	9607040	what I was doing and I was using it in this very
9607040	9609040	crude way in a two-dimensional fashion
9609040	9611040	rather than the general 3d the epsilon
9611040	9613040	problems got much worse in quake in
9613040	9615040	three-dimensionals when things angle in every
9615040	9617040	way but eventually I did sort
9617040	9619040	out the sort out how to do it reliably
9619040	9621040	on doom there were still a few
9621040	9623040	edge cases in doom that were not
9623040	9625040	absolutely perfect where
9625040	9627040	they even got terminologies in the
9627040	9629040	communities like when you got to something where it was
9629040	9631040	messed up it was a hall of mirrors effect
9631040	9633040	because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw
9633040	9635040	something there and you would just wind up with
9635040	9637040	the leftover remnants as you flipped between
9637040	9639040	the the two pages
9639040	9641040	but BSP trees were important
9641040	9643040	for it but it's again worth noting
9643040	9645040	that after we did
9645040	9647040	doom our major competition
9647040	9649040	came from Ken Silverman
9649040	9651040	in his build engine which was used for Duke
9651040	9653040	Nukem 3d and some of the other games for
9653040	9655040	3d realms and he used a completely
9655040	9657040	different technology nothing to do with
9657040	9659040	I'm with BSP
9659040	9661040	trees so there's not just a one
9661040	9663040	true way of doing things
9663040	9665040	I'm there were critical things
9665040	9667040	about to make any of those games fast
9667040	9669040	you had to you had to separate your
9669040	9671040	drawing into you drew vertical lines
9671040	9673040	and you drew horizontal lines just kind
9673040	9675040	of changing exactly what you would
9675040	9677040	draw with them that was critical for the
9677040	9679040	technologies at that time
9679040	9681040	and like all the games that were kind
9681040	9683040	of like that wound up doing something similar
9683040	9685040	but there were still a bunch of other
9685040	9687040	decisions that could be made
9687040	9689040	and we made good enough decisions
9689040	9691040	on everything on doom we
9691040	9693040	we brought in multiplayer
9693040	9695040	significantly and it was our first game that was
9695040	9697040	designed to be modified by the user
9697040	9699040	community where we had this whole
9699040	9701040	setup of our wad files and pwads
9701040	9703040	and things that people could could build
9703040	9705040	with tools that we released to them and they
9705040	9707040	eventually rewrote to be better than what we
9707040	9709040	released but they could build things
9709040	9711040	and you could add it to your game without
9711040	9713040	destructively modifying it which is what you
9713040	9715040	had to do in all the early games you literally
9715040	9717040	hacked the data files
9717040	9719040	executable before while doom was
9719040	9721040	set up in this flexible way so that
9721040	9723040	you could just say run the normal
9723040	9725040	game with this added on on top
9725040	9727040	and it would overlay just the things that
9727040	9729040	you wanted to there
9729040	9731040	would you say that doom was kind of the first
9731040	9733040	true 3d game
9733040	9735040	that you created so no it's still
9735040	9737040	doom would usually be called a 2
9737040	9739040	and a half d game where it had
9739040	9741040	three-dimensional points on it and this is
9741040	9743040	another one of these kind of pedantic things that people
9743040	9745040	love to argue about about what was the first
9745040	9747040	3d game I still like
9747040	9749040	like every month probably I hear from
9749040	9751040	somebody about well was doom really a
9751040	9753040	3d game or something
9753040	9755040	and you know I give the
9755040	9757040	the point where characters
9757040	9759040	had three coordinates so you had
9759040	9761040	like an x y and z the cacodammon
9761040	9763040	could be coming in very high and come
9763040	9765040	you know and come down towards you
9765040	9767040	the walls had three coordinates
9767040	9769040	on them so on some sense
9769040	9771040	it's a 3d game engine but it was
9771040	9773040	not a fully general 3d game engine
9773040	9775040	you could not
9775040	9777040	build a pyramid in doom because you
9777040	9779040	couldn't make a sloped wall
9779040	9781040	which was slightly different where in that
9781040	9783040	previous shadow caster game I couldn't
9783040	9785040	have vertexes and have a sloped floor there
9785040	9787040	but the changes that I made for doom
9787040	9789040	to get higher speed and a different
9789040	9791040	set of flexibility traded away that ability
9791040	9793040	but you literally couldn't make that
9793040	9795040	you could not
9795040	9797040	make different heights of
9797040	9799040	passages but you could not make a bridge
9799040	9801040	over another area you could not go over
9801040	9803040	and above it so it still had
9803040	9805040	some 2d limitations to it
9805040	9807040	that's more about the building versus the actual experience
9807040	9809040	because the experience is
9809040	9811040	it felt like things would come at you but again
9811040	9813040	you couldn't look up either
9813040	9815040	you could only pitch
9815040	9817040	it was 4 degrees of freedom rather than
9817040	9819040	6 degrees of freedom you did not
9819040	9821040	have the ability to tilt your head this way
9821040	9823040	or pitch up and down
9823040	9825040	so that takes us to quake
9825040	9827040	what was the leap there
9827040	9829040	what was some fascinating
9829040	9831040	technical challenges and there were a lot
9831040	9833040	or not challenges but innovations
9833040	9835040	that you've come up with so quake
9835040	9837040	was kind of the first thing where
9837040	9839040	I did have to kind of come face
9839040	9841040	to face with my limitations
9841040	9843040	where it was the first thing where
9843040	9845040	I really did kind of
9845040	9847040	give it my all and still come up
9847040	9849040	you know come up a little bit short in terms
9849040	9851040	of what and when I wanted to
9851040	9853040	to get it done and
9853040	9855040	the company brand had some serious stresses
9855040	9857040	through the whole project
9857040	9859040	and we bit off a lot
9859040	9861040	so the things that we set out
9861040	9863040	to do was it was going to be
9863040	9865040	really a true 3D engine
9865040	9867040	where it could do 6 degree of freedom
9867040	9869040	you could have all the viewpoints
9869040	9871040	you could model anything
9871040	9873040	it had
9873040	9875040	a really remarkable new lighting model
9875040	9877040	with the surface cashing and things
9877040	9879040	that was one of those where it was starting to
9879040	9881040	do some things that they weren't doing
9881040	9883040	even on the very high end systems
9883040	9885040	and it was going to be
9885040	9887040	completely programmable
9887040	9889040	in the modding standpoint where
9889040	9891040	the thing that you couldn't do and do
9891040	9893040	you could replace almost all of the media
9893040	9895040	but you couldn't really change the game
9895040	9897040	there were still some people
9897040	9899040	that were doing the hex setting of the executable
9899040	9901040	the de-hacked things where you could change
9901040	9903040	a few things about rules and people made
9903040	9905040	some early capture the flag type things
9905040	9907040	by hacking the executable but
9907040	9909040	it wasn't really set out to do that
9909040	9911040	quake was going to have its own
9911040	9913040	programming language that the game was going to be implemented
9913040	9915040	and that would be able to be overwritten
9915040	9917040	just like any of the media
9917040	9919040	code was going to be data for that
9919040	9921040	and you would be able to have expansion
9921040	9923040	packs that changed fundamental things
9923040	9925040	and mods and so on
9925040	9927040	and the multiplayer
9927040	9929040	was going to be playable over the internet
9929040	9931040	it was going to support a client
9931040	9933040	server rather than peer to peer
9933040	9935040	so we had the possibility of supporting
9935040	9937040	larger numbers of players in disparate locations
9937040	9939040	with this full flexibility
9939040	9941040	of the programming overrides
9941040	9943040	with full six-degree of freedom
9943040	9945040	modeling and viewing
9945040	9947040	and with this fancy new light
9947040	9949040	mapped kind of surface caching
9949040	9951040	side it was a lot
9951040	9953040	and this was one of those things that
9953040	9955040	if I could go back and tell
9955040	9957040	younger me to do something differently
9957040	9959040	it would have been to split those
9959040	9961040	innovations up into two phases
9961040	9963040	in two separate games
9963040	9965040	so it probably would have been taking
9965040	9967040	the doom rendering engine
9967040	9969040	and bringing in the TCPIP
9969040	9971040	client server
9971040	9973040	focusing on the multiplayer
9973040	9975040	and the Quake C
9975040	9977040	or would have been Doom C programming language
9977040	9979040	there so I would have split that into
9979040	9981040	programming language and networking
9981040	9983040	with the same doom engine
9983040	9985040	rather than forcing everybody to go towards
9985040	9987040	the Quake engine which really
9987040	9989040	meant getting a Pentium
9989040	9991040	while it ran on a 486 it was not a great
9991040	9993040	experience there we could have made more
9993040	9995040	people happier and gotten two games done
9995040	9997040	in 50% more time
9997040	9999040	so speaking of people happier
9999040	10001040	or
10001040	10003040	mutual friend Joe Rogan
10003040	10005040	it seems like the most
10005040	10007040	important moment of his life
10007040	10009040	is centered around Quake
10009040	10011040	so it was a definitive
10011040	10013040	part of his life
10013040	10015040	so would he agree with
10015040	10017040	your thinking that
10017040	10019040	they should split
10019040	10021040	so he is a person who loves Quake
10021040	10023040	and played Quake a lot
10023040	10025040	would he agree that you should have done
10025040	10027040	the doom engine
10027040	10029040	and focus on the multiplayer for phase one
10029040	10031040	or
10031040	10033040	in your looking back
10033040	10035040	is the 3D world that
10035040	10037040	Quake created was also
10037040	10039040	fundamental to the
10039040	10041040	the enriched experience I would say that
10041040	10043040	what would have happened is
10043040	10045040	you would have had a
10045040	10047040	a doom looking but Quake feeling
10047040	10049040	game
10049040	10051040	8 months earlier and then maybe
10051040	10053040	6 months after Quake actually
10053040	10055040	then there would have been the full running on a pentium
10055040	10057040	6 degree of freedom
10057040	10059040	graphics engine type things there so it's not
10059040	10061040	that it wouldn't have
10061040	10063040	been there it would have been
10063040	10065040	something amazingly cool earlier
10065040	10067040	and then something even cooler somewhat later
10067040	10069040	where I would much
10069040	10071040	rather have gone and done
10071040	10073040	two one year development efforts
10073040	10075040	I've cycled them through
10075040	10077040	I've been a little more pragmatic about that
10077040	10079040	rather than killing us
10079040	10081040	ourselves on the whole Quake development
10081040	10083040	but I would say it's obviously
10083040	10085040	things worked out well in the end
10085040	10087040	but looking back and saying how would I
10087040	10089040	optimize and do things differently
10089040	10091040	that did seem to be a clear case where
10091040	10093040	I
10093040	10095040	going ahead and we had enormous momentum
10095040	10097040	on doom you know we did doom too as
10097040	10099040	the kind of commercial boxed version
10099040	10101040	after our shareware success
10101040	10103040	with the original but we could have
10103040	10105040	just made another doom game
10105040	10107040	adding those new features
10107040	10109040	in it would have been huge we would
10109040	10111040	have learned all the same lessons but faster
10111040	10113040	and it would have given
10113040	10115040	6 degree of freedom and pentium
10115040	10117040	class systems a little bit more time
10117040	10119040	to get mainstream because we did
10119040	10121040	cut out a lot of people with the hardware
10121040	10123040	requirements for Quake
10123040	10125040	was there any dark moments for you personally
10125040	10127040	psychologically in having
10127040	10129040	in
10129040	10131040	having such harsh deadlines
10131040	10133040	and having this also made
10133040	10135040	difficult technical challenges
10135040	10137040	so I've never really
10137040	10139040	had
10139040	10141040	really dark black places
10141040	10143040	I can't necessarily put myself in
10143040	10145040	anyone else's shoes but I understand
10145040	10147040	a lot of people
10147040	10149040	have significant
10149040	10151040	challenges with their
10151040	10153040	mental health and well-being
10153040	10155040	and I've been super stressed
10155040	10157040	I've been unhappy as a teenager
10157040	10159040	in various ways
10159040	10161040	but I've never really
10161040	10163040	gone to a very dark
10163040	10165040	place I just seem to be
10165040	10167040	largely
10167040	10169040	immune to what really
10169040	10171040	wrecks people I mean I've had plenty of time
10171040	10173040	when I'm very unhappy and miserable about
10173040	10175040	something but it's never
10175040	10177040	hit me like I believe
10177040	10179040	it winds up hitting some other people
10179040	10181040	I've borne up well under whatever
10181040	10183040	stresses have
10183040	10185040	kind of fallen on me and I've always
10185040	10187040	coped best on that
10187040	10189040	when all I need to do is
10189040	10191040	usually just kind of bear down on my work
10191040	10193040	I pull myself out of
10193040	10195040	whatever hole I might be slipping into
10195040	10197040	by actually making progress
10197040	10199040	I mean maybe if I was in a
10199040	10201040	position where I was never able to make
10201040	10203040	that progress I could have slid down further
10203040	10205040	but I've always been in a
10205040	10207040	place where okay a little bit
10207040	10209040	more work maybe I'm in a tough spot here
10209040	10211040	but I always know
10211040	10213040	if I just keep pushing eventually
10213040	10215040	I break through and I make progress
10215040	10217040	I feel good about what I'm doing
10217040	10219040	and that's been enough for me
10219040	10221040	so far in my life
10221040	10223040	I've seen in the distance
10223040	10225040	like
10225040	10227040	ideas of depression
10227040	10229040	or contemplating suicide
10229040	10231040	have you seen those things far?
10231040	10233040	So it was interesting when I was a teenager
10233040	10235040	I was
10235040	10237040	probably at some level a troubled youth
10237040	10239040	I was unhappy most of my teenage
10239040	10241040	years
10241040	10243040	I wanted to be on my own
10243040	10245040	doing programming all the time
10245040	10247040	as soon as I was 18, 19
10247040	10249040	even though I was poor I was doing exactly
10249040	10251040	what I wanted and I was very happy
10251040	10253040	but high school was not a great time for me
10253040	10255040	and
10255040	10257040	I had a conversation with like the school counselor
10257040	10259040	and they're kind of running their script
10259040	10261040	it's like okay it's kind of a weird kid here
10261040	10263040	let's carefully probe around
10263040	10265040	it's like do you ever think about
10265040	10267040	ending it all? I'm like no of course not
10267040	10269040	never not at all
10269040	10271040	this is temporary things are going to be better
10273040	10275040	and that's always been kind of the case
10275040	10277040	for me and obviously
10277040	10279040	it's not that way for everyone
10279040	10281040	and other people do react differently
10281040	10283040	what was your
10283040	10285040	escape from the troubled youth
10285040	10287040	like
10287040	10289040	you know
10289040	10291040	music
10291040	10293040	video games
10293040	10295040	books
10295040	10297040	how did you escape from a world that's full of cruelty
10297040	10299040	and suffering and that's absurd
10299040	10301040	I was not victim of cruelty
10301040	10303040	and suffering it's like I was an unhappy
10303040	10305040	somewhat petulant youth
10305040	10307040	where I'm not
10307040	10309040	putting myself up with anybody else's
10309040	10311040	suffering but I was unhappy
10311040	10313040	objectively and
10313040	10315040	the things that I did that
10315040	10317040	very much characterized my childhood
10317040	10319040	were I had
10319040	10321040	books, comic books, dungeons and dragons
10321040	10323040	arcade games, video games
10323040	10325040	like some of my fondest
10325040	10327040	childhood memories are the convenience stores
10327040	10329040	the 7-Elevens and Quick Trips
10329040	10331040	because they had a spinner rack of comic books
10331040	10333040	and they had a little side room with
10333040	10335040	two or three video games, arcade games
10335040	10337040	in it and that was
10337040	10339040	very much my happy place
10339040	10341040	I get my comic books
10341040	10343040	and if I could go to a library
10343040	10345040	and go through those little
10345040	10347040	0-0-0 section where computer books were supposed
10347040	10349040	to be and there are a few sad little books there
10349040	10351040	but still just being able to sit down
10351040	10353040	and go through that and I read
10353040	10355040	I read a ridiculous number
10355040	10357040	of books both fiction and non-fiction
10357040	10359040	as a teenager
10359040	10361040	and
10361040	10363040	my rebelling in high school was just
10363040	10365040	sitting there with my nose in a book ignoring the
10365040	10367040	class through lots of it
10367040	10369040	and teachers had a range of reactions
10369040	10371040	to that some more accepting
10371040	10373040	of it than others
10373040	10375040	I'm with you on that so let us
10375040	10377040	return to quake for a bit with the technical
10377040	10379040	challenges what
10379040	10381040	everything together
10381040	10383040	from the networking
10383040	10385040	to the graphics
10385040	10387040	what are some things you remember
10387040	10389040	that were innovations
10389040	10391040	you had to come up with in order to
10391040	10393040	make it all happen
10393040	10395040	there were a bunch of things on quake
10395040	10397040	where on the one hand the idea
10397040	10399040	that I built my own programming language
10399040	10401040	to implement the game in
10401040	10403040	looking back and I try to tell people
10403040	10405040	every high-level programmer
10405040	10407040	sometime in their career goes through and they
10407040	10409040	invent their own language it just seems to be a thing
10409040	10411040	that's pretty broadly done
10411040	10413040	I'm going to go write a computer programming language
10413040	10415040	and
10415040	10417040	I don't regret having done it
10417040	10419040	but after that
10419040	10421040	I switched from quake c my quirky
10421040	10423040	little pseudo-object
10423040	10425040	or entity-oriented language there
10425040	10427040	quake 2 went back to using
10427040	10429040	DLLs with C and then quake 3
10429040	10431040	I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler
10431040	10433040	which was a much smarter thing
10433040	10435040	to do that I should have done originally for quake
10435040	10437040	but building my own language
10437040	10439040	was an experience I learned a lot from that
10439040	10441040	and then there was a generation
10441040	10443040	of game programmers that
10443040	10445040	learned programming with quake c which I feel kind
10445040	10447040	of bad about because
10447040	10449040	we give javascript a lot of crap but
10449040	10451040	quake c was nothing to
10451040	10453040	write home about there
10453040	10455040	but it allowed people to do
10455040	10457040	magical things you get into programming
10457040	10459040	not because you love the
10459040	10461040	BNF syntax of a language
10461040	10463040	it's because the language lets you do
10463040	10465040	something that you cared about
10465040	10467040	and here's very much you could do something
10467040	10469040	in a whole beautiful three-dimensional
10469040	10471040	world and the idea and the fact that the
10471040	10473040	code for the game was out there you could say
10473040	10475040	I like the shotgun but I want
10475040	10477040	it to be more badass you go in there and say
10477040	10479040	okay now it does 200 points damage
10479040	10481040	and then you go around with a big grin
10481040	10483040	on your face blowing up monsters all over
10483040	10485040	the game so yeah it's
10485040	10487040	I you know it is not
10487040	10489040	what I would do today going back with that
10489040	10491040	language but that was a big part of it
10491040	10493040	learning about the networking stuff
10493040	10495040	I because it's
10495040	10497040	interesting where I learn these things by
10497040	10499040	reading books so I would get a book on networking
10499040	10501040	find something I read
10501040	10503040	all about and learn okay packets they can
10503040	10505040	be you know out of order lost
10505040	10507040	or duplicated these are all the
10507040	10509040	things that can theoretically happen to packets
10509040	10511040	so I wind up spending all this time
10511040	10513040	thinking about how do we deal about all that
10513040	10515040	and it turns out of course in the real world
10515040	10517040	those are things that yes theoretically can happen
10517040	10519040	with multiple routes but they really
10519040	10521040	aren't things that your 99.999
10521040	10523040	percent of your packets
10523040	10525040	have to deal with
10525040	10527040	so there was learning experiences about
10527040	10529040	lots of that like why
10529040	10531040	when TCP is appropriate
10531040	10533040	versus UDP and and how
10533040	10535040	if you do things in UDP you wind up reinventing
10535040	10537040	TCP badly in almost all
10537040	10539040	cases so you know there's
10539040	10541040	there's good arguments for using
10541040	10543040	both for different game technology
10543040	10545040	different parts of the game process transitioning
10545040	10547040	from level to level and all but the the
10547040	10549040	graphics were the showcase
10549040	10551040	of what what quake
10551040	10553040	was all about it was this graphics technology
10553040	10555040	that nobody had seen there
10555040	10557040	and it was a while before
10557040	10559040	you know there were competitive things out there
10559040	10561040	and it went a long
10561040	10563040	time internally really not working
10563040	10565040	where we were even building
10565040	10567040	levels where the game
10567040	10569040	just was not at all
10569040	10571040	shippable with large fractions of the world
10571040	10573040	like disappearing not being there
10573040	10575040	I or being really
10575040	10577040	slow in various parts of it and it
10577040	10579040	was this act of faith it's like I think
10579040	10581040	I'm going to be able to fix this I think
10581040	10583040	I'm going to be able to make this work
10583040	10585040	and lots of stuff
10585040	10587040	changed where the level designers
10587040	10589040	would build something then have to throw it away
10589040	10591040	as something fundamental in the kind of graphics
10591040	10593040	or level technology change
10593040	10595040	and the I
10595040	10597040	so there were two big things that
10597040	10599040	contributed to making it possible
10599040	10601040	at that time frame I am
10601040	10603040	two new things there was certainly
10603040	10605040	hardcore optimized low level assembly
10605040	10607040	language and this is where I had hired
10607040	10609040	Michael A. Brash away from
10609040	10611040	Microsoft and he had been one of my
10611040	10613040	early inspirations where that
10613040	10615040	back in the soft disk days the library
10615040	10617040	of magazines that they had
10617040	10619040	some of my most treasured ones were
10619040	10621040	Michael A. Brash's articles
10621040	10623040	in Dr. Dobbs Journal and
10623040	10625040	it was it was amazing after
10625040	10627040	all of our success in Doom we were able to
10627040	10629040	kind of hit him up and say hey we'd like
10629040	10631040	you to come work at id software and he was
10631040	10633040	in the senior technical role at Microsoft
10633040	10635040	and I am you know and
10635040	10637040	he was on track for and this was right when
10637040	10639040	Microsoft was starting to take off and I
10639040	10641040	did eventually you know
10641040	10643040	convince him that what we were doing was
10643040	10645040	going to be really amazing with quake it was
10645040	10647040	going to it was going to be something nobody
10647040	10649040	had seen before it had
10649040	10651040	these aspects of what we were talking
10651040	10653040	about we had metaverse talk back then
10653040	10655040	we you know we had read snow crash and
10655040	10657040	we were we knew about this and
10657040	10659040	Michael was I was big
10659040	10661040	into the science fiction and we would talk
10661040	10663040	about all that and kind of spin this tail
10663040	10665040	and it was some of the same conversations
10665040	10667040	that we have today about the metaverse
10667040	10669040	about how you could have different areas
10669040	10671040	linked together by portals and you could have
10671040	10673040	user-generated content and changing
10673040	10675040	out all of these things so you really
10675040	10677040	were creating the metaverse with quaking
10677040	10679040	and we we talked about things like
10679040	10681040	philosophically used to be advertised as a
10681040	10683040	virtual reality experience you know that
10683040	10685040	was the first wave of virtual reality
10685040	10687040	was in the late 80s and early
10687040	10689040	90s you had like the lawnmower man
10689040	10691040	I'm you know movie and you had
10691040	10693040	time in newsweek talking about the early
10693040	10695040	VPL headsets and
10695040	10697040	of course that cratered so hard that
10697040	10699040	people didn't want to look at virtual reality
10699040	10701040	for decades afterwards where
10701040	10703040	it was just it was spoken
10703040	10705040	mirrors it was not real in the sense
10705040	10707040	that you could actually do something
10707040	10709040	real and valuable with it but
10709040	10711040	but still we had that kind of common
10711040	10713040	set of talking points and we were talking
10713040	10715040	about what these games could
10715040	10717040	I could become and how you'd
10717040	10719040	like to see people building all of these
10719040	10721040	creative things because we were seeing an
10721040	10723040	explosion of work with doom at that time
10723040	10725040	where people were doing amazingly
10725040	10727040	cool things like we saw cooler
10727040	10729040	levels that we had built coming out of the user
10729040	10731040	community and then people finding
10731040	10733040	ways to you know change that the characters
10733040	10735040	in different ways and it was great and we
10735040	10737040	knew what we were doing in quake was
10737040	10739040	removing those last things there was
10739040	10741040	some quirky things with a couple of
10741040	10743040	the data types that didn't work right
10743040	10745040	for overriding and that and then the core
10745040	10747040	thing about the programming model
10747040	10749040	and I was definitely going to hit all of those
10749040	10751040	in quake I'm but
10751040	10753040	the the graphic side of it was
10753040	10755040	I was still
10755040	10757040	I knew what I wanted to do
10757040	10759040	and it was one of these
10759040	10761040	hubris things where it's like well
10761040	10763040	so far I've been able to kind of
10763040	10765040	kick everything that I set out
10765040	10767040	to go do but quake
10767040	10769040	was definitely a little bit
10769040	10771040	more than could be comfortably chewed at
10771040	10773040	that point and I
10773040	10775040	but Michael was one of the
10775040	10777040	one of the strongest programmers and
10777040	10779040	graphics programmers that I knew
10779040	10781040	and he was one of the people that I trusted
10781040	10783040	to to write assembly code
10783040	10785040	you know better than I could and there's
10785040	10787040	there's a few people that I can point to
10787040	10789040	about things like this where I'm a world
10789040	10791040	class optimizer I mean I make things
10791040	10793040	go fast but I recognize
10793040	10795040	there's a number of people that
10795040	10797040	can write tighter assembly code
10797040	10799040	tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA
10799040	10801040	code then you know then I can write
10801040	10803040	I'm you know my best strengths
10803040	10805040	are a little bit more at the system
10805040	10807040	level I mean I'm good at all of that
10807040	10809040	but the most leverage
10809040	10811040	comes from making the decisions that are a little
10811040	10813040	bit higher up where you figure out
10813040	10815040	how to change your large scale problems
10815040	10817040	so that these lower level problems
10817040	10819040	are easier to do or it makes it possible
10819040	10821040	to do them in a
10821040	10823040	in a uniquely fast way
10823040	10825040	so most of my
10825040	10827040	you know my big wins in a lot of ways
10827040	10829040	from all the way from the early games through
10829040	10831040	you know through VR and the aerospace
10831040	10833040	work that I'm doing and or did
10833040	10835040	and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on
10835040	10837040	now is finding an angle on
10837040	10839040	something that means you trade
10839040	10841040	off something that you maybe think
10841040	10843040	you need but it turns out you don't need
10843040	10845040	and by making a sacrifice in one
10845040	10847040	place you can get big advantages
10847040	10849040	in another place is it
10849040	10851040	clear at which level of the system
10851040	10853040	those big advantages
10853040	10855040	can be gained it's not always
10855040	10857040	clear and that's why the thing
10857040	10859040	that that I try to make one of my
10859040	10861040	core values and I
10861040	10863040	proselytize to a lot of people is
10863040	10865040	trying to know the entire stack
10865040	10867040	no trying to see through
10867040	10869040	everything that happens and it's almost
10869040	10871040	impossible on like the web browser
10871040	10873040	level of things where there's so many levels
10873040	10875040	to it but you should at least understand
10875040	10877040	what they all are even if you can't understand
10877040	10879040	all the performance characteristics at
10879040	10881040	each level but it goes all the
10881040	10883040	way down to literally the hardware
10883040	10885040	so what does the what is this
10885040	10887040	chip capable of and
10887040	10889040	what is this software that you're writing capable
10889040	10891040	of and then with this architecture you put
10891040	10893040	on top of that than the ecosystem around
10893040	10895040	it all the people that are
10895040	10897040	working on it so there are
10897040	10899040	all these decisions and
10899040	10901040	they're never made in a globally optimal way
10901040	10903040	but sometimes you can drive a thread
10903040	10905040	of global optimality through it
10905040	10907040	you can't look at everything it's too complicated
10907040	10909040	but sometimes you can step
10909040	10911040	back up and make a different
10911040	10913040	decision and we kind of went through this on the graphics
10913040	10915040	side on quake where
10915040	10917040	in some ways it was kind of bad where Michael
10917040	10919040	would spend his time writing
10919040	10921040	like I'd rough out the basic
10921040	10923040	routines like okay here's our span
10923040	10925040	rasterizer and he would spend a month
10925040	10927040	writing this you know beautiful
10927040	10929040	cycle optimized
10929040	10931040	piece of assembly language that does
10931040	10933040	you know does what I asked it to do
10933040	10935040	and he did it faster than like my
10935040	10937040	original code would do or probably what
10937040	10939040	I would be able to do even if I had spent that month
10939040	10941040	on it but then we'd have
10941040	10943040	some cases when I'd be like okay
10943040	10945040	well I figured out at this higher
10945040	10947040	level instead of drawing these in a
10947040	10949040	painter's order here I do a span buffer
10949040	10951040	and it cuts out
10951040	10953040	30% or 40% of all of these
10953040	10955040	pixels but it means you need to
10955040	10957040	rewrite kind of this interface of all of that
10957040	10959040	and I could tell that wore on him a little
10959040	10961040	bit but in the end it was
10961040	10963040	the right thing to do where we wound up
10963040	10965040	changing that rasterization approach
10965040	10967040	and we wound up with a super optimized
10967040	10969040	assembly language
10969040	10971040	core loop and then a good
10971040	10973040	system around it which minimized how much that had
10973040	10975040	to be called. And so in order
10975040	10977040	to be able to do this kind of system level
10977040	10979040	thinking whether we're talking about
10979040	10981040	game development
10981040	10983040	aerospace
10983040	10985040	nuclear energy
10985040	10987040	AI
10987040	10989040	VR you have to be able to understand
10989040	10991040	the hardware the low level
10991040	10993040	software the high level
10993040	10995040	software the design decisions
10995040	10997040	the whole thing the full stack
10997040	10999040	of it. Yeah and that's where
10999040	11001040	a lot of these things become possible
11001040	11003040	when you're really when you're bringing the future
11003040	11005040	forward I mean there's a pace that everything
11005040	11007040	just kind of glides towards where we have a
11007040	11009040	lot of progress that's happening at such a
11009040	11011040	different so many different ways you kind of slide
11011040	11013040	towards progress just left to your own
11013040	11015040	programs just get faster for
11015040	11017040	a while it wasn't clear if they were going to get
11017040	11019040	fatter more than they get quicker than they get
11019040	11021040	faster and it cancels out but it is
11021040	11023040	clear now in retrospect now programs just
11023040	11025040	get faster and have gotten faster
11025040	11027040	for a long time but if you want
11027040	11029040	to do something like back at that original
11029040	11031040	talking about
11031040	11033040	scrolling games say what this needs to be
11033040	11035040	five times faster well
11035040	11037040	we can wait six years
11037040	11039040	and just it'll naturally get that much
11039040	11041040	faster at that time
11041040	11043040	or you come up with some really clever way of
11043040	11045040	doing it so there are those
11045040	11047040	opportunities like that in a whole bunch
11047040	11049040	of different areas now
11049040	11051040	most programmers don't need to be
11051040	11053040	thinking about that there's not that many
11053040	11055040	you know there's a lot of opportunities for
11055040	11057040	this but it's not everyone's work a day type
11057040	11059040	stuff so everyone doesn't have to know
11059040	11061040	how all these things work they don't have
11061040	11063040	to know how their compiler works
11063040	11065040	how you know the processor chip manages
11065040	11067040	cache eviction and all these
11067040	11069040	low-level things but
11069040	11071040	sometimes there are powerful opportunities
11071040	11073040	that you can look at and say
11073040	11075040	we can bring the future
11075040	11077040	five years faster
11077040	11079040	you know we can do something that wouldn't it be
11079040	11081040	great if we could do this well we can do
11081040	11083040	it today if we make a certain
11083040	11085040	set of decisions and
11085040	11087040	it is in some ways smoke and mirrors
11087040	11089040	where you say it's like doom was
11089040	11091040	a lot of smoke and mirrors where people
11091040	11093040	thought it was more capable than it actually was
11093040	11095040	but we picked the right
11095040	11097040	smoke and mirrors to deploy in the game
11097040	11099040	where by doing this
11099040	11101040	people will think that it's more general
11101040	11103040	if we are going to amaze them with what they've got here
11103040	11105040	and they won't notice
11105040	11107040	that it doesn't do these other things
11107040	11109040	so smart decision making
11109040	11111040	at that point that's where that
11111040	11113040	that kind of global
11113040	11115040	holistic top-down view
11115040	11117040	can work and
11117040	11119040	I'm
11119040	11121040	really a strong believer that technology
11121040	11123040	should be
11123040	11125040	sitting at that table having those discussions
11125040	11127040	because you do have cases where you say well
11127040	11129040	you want to be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever
11129040	11131040	where it's a pure design
11131040	11133040	solution
11133040	11135040	and that's in some cases
11135040	11137040	now where you truly have almost infinite
11137040	11139040	resources like if you're trying to do
11139040	11141040	a scrolling game on the PC
11141040	11143040	now you don't even have to talk to a technology
11143040	11145040	person you can just have
11145040	11147040	any intern can make that go run
11147040	11149040	as fast as it needs to there and it can be
11149040	11151040	completely design based
11151040	11153040	but if you're trying to do something that's hard
11153040	11155040	either that can't be done
11155040	11157040	for resources like VR on a mobile
11157040	11159040	chipset or that we don't even know
11159040	11161040	how to do yet like artificial general intelligence
11161040	11163040	it's probably going to be a matter of
11163040	11165040	coming at it from an angle
11165040	11167040	like I mean for AGI we have some of
11167040	11169040	like some of the Hutter principles
11169040	11171040	about how you can
11171040	11173040	some of that there are theoretical ways
11173040	11175040	you can say this is the optimal learning
11175040	11177040	algorithm that can solve everything
11177040	11179040	but it's completely impractical
11179040	11181040	you just can't do that
11181040	11183040	so clearly you have to make some
11183040	11185040	concessions for general intelligence
11185040	11187040	and nobody knows what the right ones are
11187040	11189040	yet so people are taking different
11189040	11191040	angles of attack I hope I've got something
11191040	11193040	clever to come up with in that space
11193040	11195040	it's been surprising to me
11195040	11197040	and I think perhaps it is
11197040	11199040	a principle of progress
11199040	11201040	that smoking mirrors somehow
11201040	11203040	you build the future
11203040	11205040	you kind of
11205040	11207040	fake it till you make it
11207040	11209040	and you almost always make it and I think
11209040	11211040	that's going to be the way we achieve AGI
11211040	11213040	that's going to be the way we build
11213040	11215040	consciousness into our machines
11215040	11217040	is there's
11217040	11219040	you know philosophers debate about
11219040	11221040	the Turing test is essentially about
11221040	11223040	faking it till you make it
11223040	11225040	you start by faking it
11225040	11227040	and I think that always leads
11227040	11229040	to making it
11229040	11231040	because if you look at history
11231040	11233040	arguments when as soon as people start talking
11233040	11235040	about qualia and consciousness
11235040	11237040	and Chinese rooms and things it's like
11237040	11239040	I just check out I just don't think there's any value
11239040	11241040	in those conversations it's just like
11241040	11243040	go ahead tell me it's not going to work
11243040	11245040	I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways
11245040	11247040	I don't know if you work with legged robots
11247040	11249040	there's a bunch of these
11249040	11251040	they make
11251040	11253040	they sure as heck make me feel like they're conscious
11253040	11255040	in a certain
11255040	11257040	way that's not here today
11257040	11259040	but is
11259040	11261040	you could see the kernel
11261040	11263040	it's like
11263040	11265040	the flame
11265040	11267040	the beginnings of a flame
11267040	11269040	we don't have line of sight but there's
11269040	11271040	glimmerings of light in the distance
11271040	11273040	for all of these things
11273040	11275040	I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room
11275040	11277040	well let me ask you a human question here
11277040	11279040	you've
11279040	11281040	in the game design space
11281040	11283040	you've done a lot of incredible work throughout
11283040	11285040	but in terms of game design
11285040	11287040	you've changed the world and there's a few people
11287040	11289040	around you that did the same
11289040	11291040	so famously there's some animosity
11291040	11293040	there's much love
11293040	11295040	but there's some animosity between you
11295040	11297040	and John Romero
11297040	11299040	what is at the core of that animosity
11299040	11301040	and human tension
11301040	11303040	so there really hasn't been
11303040	11305040	I for a long time
11305040	11307040	and even at the beginning it's like yes
11307040	11309040	I did push Romero out of the company
11309040	11311040	and
11311040	11313040	this is one of the things that I look back
11313040	11315040	when I was filing my younger self
11315040	11317040	some
11317040	11319040	advice about things
11319040	11321040	the original
11321040	11323040	founding kind of corporate structure
11323040	11325040	of id software
11325040	11327040	really led to a bunch of problems
11327040	11329040	we started off with us as equal partners
11329040	11331040	and we had a buy-sell agreement
11331040	11333040	because we didn't want outsiders to be telling us
11333040	11335040	what to do inside the company
11335040	11337040	and that did lead to
11337040	11339040	a bunch of the problems where I was sitting here
11339040	11341040	going
11341040	11343040	I'm working harder than anyone
11343040	11345040	I'm doing these technologies
11345040	11347040	nobody's done before
11347040	11349040	but we're all equal partners
11349040	11351040	and then I see somebody that's
11351040	11353040	not working as hard
11353040	11355040	and it's
11355040	11357040	I can't say I was the most mature about that
11357040	11359040	I was 20-something years old
11359040	11361040	and it did
11361040	11363040	bother me when I'm like everybody
11363040	11365040	okay we need all pulled together
11365040	11367040	and we've done it before everybody
11367040	11369040	we know we can do this if we get together
11369040	11371040	but not everybody wanted to do that
11371040	11373040	for all time
11373040	11375040	and I was the youngest one of the crowd
11375040	11377040	there I had different
11377040	11379040	sets of kind of backgrounds
11379040	11381040	and motivations and left
11381040	11383040	at that point where
11383040	11385040	it was
11385040	11387040	everybody has to be contributing
11387040	11389040	up to this level or
11389040	11391040	they need to get pushed out
11391040	11393040	that was not a great
11393040	11395040	situation and I look back on it
11395040	11397040	and no
11397040	11399040	I pushed people out of the company
11399040	11401040	that could have contributed
11401040	11403040	if there was a different framework for them
11403040	11405040	and the modern kind of Silicon Valley
11405040	11407040	let your stock vest over a time period
11407040	11409040	and maybe it's non-voting stock
11409040	11411040	and all those different things
11411040	11413040	we knew nothing about any of that
11413040	11415040	we didn't know what we were doing
11415040	11417040	in terms of corporate structure
11417040	11419040	so if you think the framework was different
11419040	11421040	some of the human tension
11421040	11423040	it almost certainly would have
11423040	11425040	I look back at that
11425040	11427040	and it's like even trying to summon up
11427040	11429040	in my mind it's like I know
11429040	11431040	I was really really angry
11431040	11433040	about I am
11433040	11435040	Romero not working as hard as I wanted him
11435040	11437040	to work or not carrying
11437040	11439040	his load on the design for Quake
11439040	11441040	and coming up with things there
11441040	11443040	but he was definitely doing things
11443040	11445040	he made some of the best levels there
11445040	11447040	he was working with our
11447040	11449040	external teams like Raven on the licensing
11449040	11451040	side of things
11451040	11453040	but there were differences
11453040	11455040	of opinion about it
11455040	11457040	but he landed right on his feet
11457040	11459040	he got 20 million dollars
11459040	11461040	from Eidos to go do Ion Storm
11461040	11463040	and he got to do things his way
11463040	11465040	and spun up three teams simultaneously
11465040	11467040	because that was always one of the
11467040	11469040	challenging things in it
11469040	11471040	where we were doing these single string
11471040	11473040	one project after another
11473040	11475040	and I think some of them
11475040	11477040	wanted to grow the company more
11477040	11479040	and I didn't because I knew people
11479040	11481040	that were saying that oh companies turned to shit
11481040	11483040	they were like the employees
11483040	11485040	it's just a different world there
11485040	11487040	and I loved our little dozen people
11487040	11489040	working on the projects
11489040	11491040	but you can look at it and say
11491040	11493040	well business realities matter
11493040	11495040	it's like you're super successful here
11495040	11497040	and we could take a swing and a miss
11497040	11499040	on something but you do it a couple times
11499040	11501040	and you're out of luck
11501040	11503040	there's a reason companies try to have
11503040	11505040	multiple teams running at one time
11505040	11507040	I am
11507040	11509040	and so I was doing something I didn't
11509040	11511040	so if you look past all that
11511040	11513040	you did create some amazing things together
11513040	11515040	what did you love about John Romero
11515040	11517040	what did you respect and appreciate about him
11517040	11519040	what did you admire about him
11519040	11521040	what did you learn from him
11521040	11523040	when I met him he was the coolest programmer I had ever met
11523040	11525040	he had done all of this stuff
11525040	11527040	he had made all of these games
11527040	11529040	he had worked at
11529040	11531040	one of the companies that I thought was the coolest
11531040	11533040	at Origin Systems
11533040	11535040	and he knew all this stuff
11535040	11537040	he made things happen fast
11537040	11539040	he was also kind of a polymath about this
11539040	11541040	where he could do, he made his own
11541040	11543040	he drew his own art, he made his own levels
11543040	11545040	as well as
11545040	11547040	we worked on sound design systems
11547040	11549040	on top of actually being a really good programmer
11549040	11551040	and we had
11551040	11553040	we went through a little
11553040	11555040	it was kind of fun where one of the early things that we did
11555040	11557040	where there was kind of the young buck bit
11557040	11559040	going in where I was
11559040	11561040	the new guy and he was the
11561040	11563040	he was the top man programmer
11563040	11565040	at the soft disk area
11565040	11567040	eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend
11567040	11569040	that we were going to like race to
11569040	11571040	implement this game to port one of our PC games
11571040	11573040	back down to the Apple too
11573040	11575040	and that was where we finally kind of became clear
11575040	11577040	it's like, okay, Carmack stands
11577040	11579040	a little bit apart on the programming side of things
11579040	11581040	but Romero then
11581040	11583040	very gracefully moved into
11583040	11585040	well, he'll work on the tools
11585040	11587040	he'll work on the systems
11587040	11589040	do some of the game design stuff as well as
11589040	11591040	contributing on starting to lead the design
11591040	11593040	aspects of a lot of things
11593040	11595040	so he was
11595040	11597040	enormously valuable in the early stuff
11597040	11599040	and so much of Doom and even Quake
11599040	11601040	have his stamp on it in a lot of ways
11601040	11603040	but
11603040	11605040	he wasn't at the same level of
11605040	11607040	focus that I brought to
11607040	11609040	the work that we were doing there
11609040	11611040	and he really did
11611040	11613040	we hit such a degree of success
11613040	11615040	it was all in the
11615040	11617040	press about that, the Rockstar game
11617040	11619040	programmers
11619040	11621040	I mean it's the Beatles problem
11621040	11623040	he aided up and he did personify
11623040	11625040	there was the whole game developers
11625040	11627040	with Ferraris
11627040	11629040	that we had there
11629040	11631040	and I thought that led to
11631040	11633040	some challenges there
11633040	11635040	but so much of
11635040	11637040	the stuff that
11637040	11639040	was great in the games did come from him
11639040	11641040	and I would certainly not take that away
11641040	11643040	from him and even after
11643040	11645040	we parted ways and he took his swing
11645040	11647040	with Eidos
11647040	11649040	in some ways he was ahead of the curve
11649040	11651040	with mobile gaming as well
11651040	11653040	where one of his companies after
11653040	11655040	Eidos was working on
11655040	11657040	feature phone game development
11657040	11659040	and I wound up doing some of that
11659040	11661040	just before the iPhone crossing
11661040	11663040	over into the iPhone phase there
11663040	11665040	and that was something that clearly
11665040	11667040	did turn out to be a huge thing although
11667040	11669040	he was too early for
11669040	11671040	what he was working on at that time
11671040	11673040	you know we've had
11673040	11675040	pretty cordial relationships where I was happy
11675040	11677040	to talk with him anytime I'd run into him
11677040	11679040	at a conference I haven't actually had
11679040	11681040	some other people just say it's like
11681040	11683040	you shouldn't go over there
11683040	11685040	and give him the time of day
11685040	11687040	or felt that Masters of Doom
11687040	11689040	was I
11689040	11691040	played things up in a way
11691040	11693040	that I shouldn't be too happy with
11693040	11695040	but I'm okay with all of that
11695040	11697040	he's still got love in your heart
11697040	11699040	I just talked with him like
11699040	11701040	last year I guess it was even this year
11701040	11703040	about mentioning that I'm going off doing this
11703040	11705040	AI stuff I'm going big
11705040	11707040	into artificial intelligence and
11707040	11709040	he had a bunch of ideas for
11709040	11711040	how AI is going to play into gaming
11711040	11713040	and you know asked if I was interested in collaborating
11713040	11715040	and it's not in line with what
11715040	11717040	with what I'm doing but I do
11717040	11719040	you know I wish almost everyone
11719040	11721040	the best I mean I know I may
11721040	11723040	not have parted on the best of terms with
11723040	11725040	I you know with some people but
11725040	11727040	I was thrilled to see Tom Hall
11727040	11729040	I'm writing VR games now
11729040	11731040	we wrote working on a game called Demio
11731040	11733040	which is really an awesome
11733040	11735040	VR game it's like Dungeons and Dragons
11735040	11737040	we all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together
11737040	11739040	that was one of the things that was what we did on Sundays
11739040	11741040	in the early days I would
11741040	11743040	Dungeon Master and they'd all play and
11743040	11745040	I you know so it really made me smile
11745040	11747040	seeing Tom involved with an RPG game
11747040	11749040	in virtual reality
11749040	11751040	you were the CTO
11751040	11753040	of Oculus VR since
11753040	11755040	2013 and maybe
11755040	11757040	less than a year involved in a bit
11757040	11759040	in 2019
11759040	11761040	Oculus was acquired
11761040	11763040	by Facebook now meta in
11763040	11765040	2014
11765040	11767040	you've spoken brilliantly about both the low level
11767040	11769040	details the experimental design
11769040	11771040	and the big picture vision of virtual reality
11771040	11773040	let me ask you about
11773040	11775040	the metaverse the big question here
11775040	11777040	both philosophically and technically
11777040	11779040	how hard is it to
11779040	11781040	build the metaverse what is the metaverse
11781040	11783040	in your view you started
11783040	11785040	with discussing and thinking about Quake
11785040	11787040	as a kind of metaverse
11787040	11789040	as you think about it today
11789040	11791040	what is the metaverse
11791040	11793040	the thing that could create this
11793040	11795040	compelling user value this experience
11795040	11797040	that will change the world
11797040	11799040	and how hard is it to build it
11799040	11801040	so the term comes from Neil Stevenson's
11801040	11803040	book Snow Crash which many
11803040	11805040	of us had read back in the 90s
11805040	11807040	it was one of those kind of formative books
11807040	11809040	and there was this
11809040	11811040	sense that the
11811040	11813040	the possibilities
11813040	11815040	and kind of the freedom and
11815040	11817040	unlimited capabilities to build a virtual
11817040	11819040	world that that does whatever
11819040	11821040	you want whatever you ask of it
11821040	11823040	has been a powerful draw for generations
11823040	11825040	of developers you know game developers
11825040	11827040	specifically and people that are thinking
11827040	11829040	about more more general purpose
11829040	11831040	applications so we were
11831040	11833040	talking about that back in the doom
11833040	11835040	and quake days about how do you wind
11835040	11837040	up with an interconnected set of worlds
11837040	11839040	that you kind of visit from one to another
11839040	11841040	and as web pages were becoming
11841040	11843040	a thing you start thinking about how
11843040	11845040	what is the interactive
11845040	11847040	kind of 3D based equivalent of this
11847040	11849040	and there were a lot of really
11849040	11851040	bad takes you had like
11851040	11853040	vermal then virtual reality
11853040	11855040	markup languages and there's
11855040	11857040	aspects like that that
11857040	11859040	that came from people saying well what
11859040	11861040	what kind of capabilities should we develop
11861040	11863040	to to enable this
11863040	11865040	and that kind of capability first
11865040	11867040	work has usually not panned
11867040	11869040	out very well
11869040	11871040	on the other hand we have successful
11871040	11873040	games that started with things like doom
11873040	11875040	and quake and communities that formed
11875040	11877040	around those and whether
11877040	11879040	it was server lists in the early days
11879040	11881040	or literal portaling between different
11881040	11883040	games and then modern
11883040	11885040	things that are on completely different
11885040	11887040	order of magnitude like Minecraft and
11887040	11889040	Fortnite that have 100 million
11889040	11891040	plus users
11891040	11893040	you know I still think that
11893040	11895040	that's the right way to go to build the
11895040	11897040	metaverse is you build something
11897040	11899040	that's amazing that people love and people
11899040	11901040	wind up spending all their time in
11901040	11903040	because it's awesome and you expand the
11903040	11905040	capabilities of that
11905040	11907040	even if it's a very basic experience
11907040	11909040	Minecraft
11909040	11911040	is an amazing case study in so many
11911040	11913040	things where what's been able
11913040	11915040	to be done with that is
11915040	11917040	really enlightening
11917040	11919040	and there are other cases where
11919040	11921040	like right now Roblox is
11921040	11923040	basically a game construction kit aimed at
11923040	11925040	kids and that was capability first play
11925040	11927040	and it's achieving scale that's on
11927040	11929040	the same order of those things
11929040	11931040	so it's not impossible
11931040	11933040	but my preferred bet would be
11933040	11935040	you make something amazing that people love
11935040	11937040	and you make it better and better
11937040	11939040	and that's where I could say we could
11939040	11941040	have gone back and followed a path kind of
11941040	11943040	like that in the early days
11943040	11945040	if you just kind of take the same game
11945040	11947040	whether it's when Activision demonstrated
11947040	11949040	that you could make Call of Duty every year
11949040	11951040	and not only is it not bad
11951040	11953040	people kind of love it and it's
11953040	11955040	very profitable the idea
11955040	11957040	that you could have taken something like that
11957040	11959040	and take a great game
11959040	11961040	release a new version every year that
11961040	11963040	lets the capabilities grow and expand
11963040	11965040	to start saying it's like okay it's a game
11965040	11967040	about running around and shooting things
11967040	11969040	but now you can have
11969040	11971040	bring your media into it
11971040	11973040	you can add persistence of
11973040	11975040	social sense signs of life
11975040	11977040	or whatever you want to add to it
11977040	11979040	I still think that's
11979040	11981040	you know quite a good
11981040	11983040	position to take and I think that
11983040	11985040	while Meta is doing a
11985040	11987040	comes up capability approach with
11987040	11989040	Horizon Worlds where
11989040	11991040	it's a fairly general purpose
11991040	11993040	creators can build whatever they want
11993040	11995040	in their sort of thing
11995040	11997040	you know it's hard to
11997040	11999040	compare and compete with something like Fortnight
11999040	12001040	which also has enormous amounts
12001040	12003040	of creativity even though it was not
12003040	12005040	designed originally as a general purpose
12005040	12007040	sort of thing so there's
12007040	12009040	we have examples on both sides
12009040	12011040	me personally I would have bet on
12011040	12013040	I'm trying to do
12013040	12015040	an achievement valuable destination
12015040	12017040	first and expanding from there
12017040	12019040	so
12019040	12021040	can you imagine the thing that
12021040	12023040	will be kind of if we
12023040	12025040	look back a couple centuries from now
12025040	12027040	and you think about
12027040	12029040	the experiences
12029040	12031040	that marked the singularity
12031040	12033040	the transition
12033040	12035040	where most of our
12035040	12037040	world moved into virtual reality
12037040	12039040	what do you think those experiences
12039040	12041040	will look like
12041040	12043040	do you think it's going to be kind of like the way the web
12043040	12045040	slowly took over
12045040	12047040	where you're the frog in the pot
12047040	12049040	of water that's slowly heating up
12049040	12051040	where having lived through all of that
12051040	12053040	I remember when it was
12053040	12055040	shocking to start seeing the first
12055040	12057040	website address on a billboard
12057040	12059040	when you're like hey my computer world is
12059040	12061040	infecting the real world
12061040	12063040	this is spreading out in some way
12063040	12065040	but there's still when you look back
12065040	12067040	and say well what made
12067040	12069040	the web take off and
12069040	12071040	it wasn't a big bang sort of
12071040	12073040	moment there it was
12073040	12075040	a bunch of little things that turned out
12075040	12077040	not to even be the things that are relevant now
12077040	12079040	that brought them into it
12079040	12081040	well I wonder from
12081040	12083040	like you said you're not a historian
12083040	12085040	so maybe there's a historian
12085040	12087040	out there that could
12087040	12089040	really identify that moment
12089040	12091040	data driven way
12091040	12093040	it could be like MySpace or something like that
12093040	12095040	maybe the first major
12095040	12097040	social network that really reached
12097040	12099040	into
12099040	12101040	non-geek world
12101040	12103040	or something like that
12103040	12105040	I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians though
12105040	12107040	looking for some of those
12107040	12109040	kind of primary dominant causes
12109040	12111040	where so many of these things are
12111040	12113040	like we see an exponential curve
12113040	12115040	but it's not because like one thing
12115040	12117040	is going exponential it's because
12117040	12119040	we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves
12119040	12121040	overlapped on top of each other
12121040	12123040	and they just happen to keep adding up
12123040	12125040	so that you've got something kind of going
12125040	12127040	to be exponential at any given point
12127040	12129040	but no single one of them
12129040	12131040	was the critical thing
12131040	12133040	there were dozens and dozens of things
12133040	12135040	I mean seeing the transitions of stuff
12135040	12137040	like as obviously MySpace giving way
12137040	12139040	to other things but even like blogging
12139040	12141040	giving way to social media
12141040	12143040	and getting resurrected in other guys'
12143040	12145040	and things that happened there
12145040	12147040	dancing baby gift or whatever
12147040	12149040	all your base now belong to us
12149040	12151040	whatever those early memes
12151040	12153040	that led to the modern memes
12153040	12155040	the humor on the different
12155040	12157040	evolution of humor on the internet
12157040	12159040	that I'm sure the historians will also
12159040	12161040	write books about
12161040	12163040	from the different website that support
12163040	12165040	to create the infrastructure for that humor
12165040	12167040	like Reddit and all that kind of stuff
12167040	12169040	so people will go back and they will name
12169040	12171040	firsts and critical moments but
12171040	12173040	it's probably going to be a poor approximation
12173040	12175040	of what actually happens
12175040	12177040	and we've already seen like in the VR
12177040	12179040	space where
12179040	12181040	it didn't play out the way we thought
12181040	12183040	in terms of what was going to be like
12183040	12185040	the modern era of VR basically
12185040	12187040	started with my E3 demo of Doom 3
12187040	12189040	on the Rift prototype so we're like
12189040	12191040	first person shooters in VR
12191040	12193040	match made in heaven right
12193040	12195040	and that didn't work out that way at all
12195040	12197040	they have you know they have the most
12197040	12199040	comfort problems with it and then
12199040	12201040	the most popular virtual reality app
12201040	12203040	is Beat Saber which nobody
12203040	12205040	predicted back then
12205040	12207040	what's that make you like
12207040	12209040	from the first principles if you were to
12209040	12211040	reverse engineer that
12211040	12213040	why are these like
12213040	12215040	silly fun games the most
12215040	12217040	it actually makes very clear
12217040	12219040	sense when you when you analyze it
12219040	12221040	from hindsight and look at the
12221040	12223040	engineering reasons where it's not
12223040	12225040	just that it was a magical quirky idea
12225040	12227040	it was something that played
12227040	12229040	almost perfectly to what turned out to be
12229040	12231040	the real strengths of VR where
12231040	12233040	the one thing that I really underestimated
12233040	12235040	importance in VR was the importance of
12235040	12237040	the controllers you know I was still thinking
12237040	12239040	about what to do a lot more with
12239040	12241040	with the game pad and just the
12241040	12243040	amazingness of taking any existing game
12243040	12245040	being able to move your head around
12245040	12247040	and look around that that was
12247040	12249040	you know that was really amazing but
12249040	12251040	the controllers were super important
12251040	12253040	but the problem is so many things that you
12253040	12255040	do with the controllers just
12255040	12257040	suck it feels like it breaks the illusion
12257040	12259040	like trying to pick up glasses with the
12259040	12261040	controllers where you're like oh use the grip
12261040	12263040	button when you're kind of close and it'll
12263040	12265040	snap into your hand all of those
12265040	12267040	and you do them and it's still part of the VR
12267040	12269040	experience but
12269040	12271040	Beat Saber winds up
12271040	12273040	playing only to the strengths it
12273040	12275040	completely hides all the weaknesses of it
12275040	12277040	because you are holding something
12277040	12279040	in your hand you keep a solid grip on it
12279040	12281040	the whole time it slices through things
12281040	12283040	without ever bumping into things you
12283040	12285040	never get into the point where you know
12285040	12287040	I'm knocking on this table but in VR
12287040	12289040	my hand just goes right through it so
12289040	12291040	you've got something that slices
12291040	12293040	through so it's never your brain
12293040	12295040	oh I should have hit something you've got a
12295040	12297040	lightsaber here it's just you expect it to
12297040	12299040	slice through everything
12299040	12301040	audio and music turned out to be
12301040	12303040	a really powerful aspect of virtual
12303040	12305040	reality where you're blocking the world off
12305040	12307040	and constructing the world around you
12307040	12309040	and
12309040	12311040	being something that can run efficiently on
12311040	12313040	even this relatively low powered hardware
12313040	12315040	and can have
12315040	12317040	a valuable loop in a small
12317040	12319040	amount of time where a lot of modern games
12319040	12321040	you're supposed to sit down and play it for
12321040	12323040	an hour just to get anywhere sometimes a new
12323040	12325040	game takes an hour to get through the tutorial level
12325040	12327040	and that's not good for VR for
12327040	12329040	a couple reasons you do still have the comfort
12329040	12331040	issues if you're moving around at all
12331040	12333040	but you've also got just
12333040	12335040	discomfort from the headset battery
12335040	12337040	lifespan on the mobile versions
12337040	12339040	so having things that do break down
12339040	12341040	into three and four minute
12341040	12343040	windows of play that turns out to be very
12343040	12345040	valuable from a gameplay standpoint
12345040	12347040	so it winds up being
12347040	12349040	kind of a perfect storm of all of these things
12349040	12351040	that are really good it doesn't have any
12351040	12353040	of the comfort problems you're not navigating
12353040	12355040	around you're standing still all the
12355040	12357040	stuff flies at you it has
12357040	12359040	placed audio strengths
12359040	12361040	it adds the whole fitness in
12361040	12363040	VR nobody was thinking about that
12363040	12365040	back in the at the beginning and it turns
12365040	12367040	out that that is an excellent
12367040	12369040	daily fitness thing to be doing
12369040	12371040	if you go play an hour
12371040	12373040	of beat saver or supernatural or something
12373040	12375040	that is legit solid
12375040	12377040	exercise and it's
12377040	12379040	more fun than doing it just about any other way
12379040	12381040	there so that's kind of the
12381040	12383040	arcade stage of things
12383040	12385040	if I were to say with my
12385040	12387040	experience with VR
12387040	12389040	the thing that I think is powerful is
12389040	12391040	the
12391040	12393040	maybe it's not here yet
12393040	12395040	but the degree to which it is immersive
12395040	12397040	in the way
12397040	12399040	that quake is immersive it takes you to
12399040	12401040	another world for me
12401040	12403040	because I'm a fan of role-playing games
12403040	12405040	the
12405040	12407040	Elder Scrolls series
12407040	12409040	like Skyrim
12409040	12411040	or even Daggerfall it just takes
12411040	12413040	you to another world and when you're
12413040	12415040	not in that world you miss not being
12415040	12417040	there and then you just
12417040	12419040	you kind of want to stay there forever
12419040	12421040	because life is shitty
12421040	12423040	and you just want to go to this
12423040	12425040	place is that
12425040	12427040	I there was a
12427040	12429040	time when I we were
12429040	12431040	kind of asked to come up with like what's your view
12431040	12433040	about VR and
12433040	12435040	you know my pitch was that it should
12435040	12437040	be better inside the headset than outside
12437040	12439040	it's the world as you want it
12439040	12441040	and everybody thought that was dystopian
12441040	12443040	and like that's like
12443040	12445040	oh you're just going to forget about the world outside
12445040	12447040	and I don't
12447040	12449040	get that mindset where the
12449040	12451040	idea that if you can make the world
12451040	12453040	better inside the headset than
12453040	12455040	outside you've just improved
12455040	12457040	the person's life that has a headset
12457040	12459040	that can wear it and
12459040	12461040	there are plenty of things that we just can't do
12461040	12463040	for everyone in the real world everybody can't
12463040	12465040	have Richard Branson's private island
12465040	12467040	but everyone can have a private VR island
12467040	12469040	and it can have the things that they want on it
12469040	12471040	and there's a lot of these kind of rival
12471040	12473040	risk goods in the real world
12473040	12475040	that VR can just be better
12475040	12477040	at we can do a lot of
12477040	12479040	things like that that can be very very rich
12479040	12481040	so yeah I want the
12481040	12483040	I think it's going to be a positive thing this world where
12483040	12485040	people want to go back into their headset
12485040	12487040	where it can be better than
12487040	12489040	somebody that's living in a tiny apartment
12489040	12491040	can have a palatial estate
12491040	12493040	in virtual reality that can have all their friends
12493040	12495040	from all over the world come over
12495040	12497040	and visit them without everybody getting on a plane
12497040	12499040	and meeting in some
12499040	12501040	place and dealing with all the other logistics hassles
12501040	12503040	there is real value
12503040	12505040	in the presence that
12505040	12507040	you can get for remote meetings
12507040	12509040	it's all the little things
12509040	12511040	that we need to sort out but those are things
12511040	12513040	that we have line of sight on
12513040	12515040	people that have been in
12515040	12517040	a good VR meeting using work rooms
12517040	12519040	where you can say oh that was better
12519040	12521040	than a zoom meeting but of course
12521040	12523040	it's more of a hassle to get into it
12523040	12525040	not everyone has a headset interoperability
12525040	12527040	is worse you can't have
12527040	12529040	you cap out at a certain number there's all
12529040	12531040	these things that need to be fixed but that's
12531040	12533040	one of those things you can look at and say we know
12533040	12535040	there's value there we just need to
12535040	12537040	really grind hard file off all
12537040	12539040	the rough edges and make that possible
12539040	12541040	so you do think we have line of sight
12541040	12543040	because
12543040	12545040	there's a
12545040	12547040	reason like
12547040	12549040	I do this podcast in person for example
12551040	12553040	doing it remotely it's
12553040	12555040	not the same and if you're somebody
12555040	12557040	were to ask me why it's not the same I
12557040	12559040	wouldn't be able to write down exactly why
12559040	12561040	but you're
12561040	12563040	saying that it's possible
12563040	12565040	whatever the magic is for in person
12565040	12567040	interaction
12567040	12569040	that immersiveness of the experience
12569040	12571040	we are
12571040	12573040	almost there yes so
12573040	12575040	the idea of like I
12575040	12577040	doing a VR interview with
12577040	12579040	someone I'm not saying it's here right
12579040	12581040	now but you can see
12581040	12583040	glimmers of what it should be and
12583040	12585040	we largely know what would need
12585040	12587040	to be fixed and improved
12587040	12589040	to like you say there's a difference between
12589040	12591040	at remote interview doing a
12591040	12593040	podcast over zoom or something and face
12593040	12595040	to face there's that sense of
12595040	12597040	presence that immediacy the super
12597040	12599040	low latency responsiveness
12599040	12601040	being able to see all the subtle things there
12601040	12603040	just occupying the same field
12603040	12605040	of view and all of those are things that
12605040	12607040	we absolutely can do in
12607040	12609040	VR and that simple case
12609040	12611040	of a small meeting with a couple
12611040	12613040	people that's the much easier case
12613040	12615040	than everybody thinks the ready player one multiverse
12615040	12617040	with a thousand people going across
12617040	12619040	that you know a huge bridge to amazing
12619040	12621040	places that's harder in a lot
12621040	12623040	of other technical ways not to say we
12623040	12625040	can't also do that but that's further away
12625040	12627040	and has more challenges but this small
12627040	12629040	thing about being able to have a
12629040	12631040	meeting with one or
12631040	12633040	a few people and have it feel
12633040	12635040	real feel like you're there
12635040	12637040	I think you have the same interactions
12637040	12639040	and talking with them you get subtle cues
12639040	12641040	as we start getting eye and face tracking
12641040	12643040	and some of the other things on high end
12643040	12645040	headsets a lot of that is
12645040	12647040	going to come over and it
12647040	12649040	doesn't have to be as good
12649040	12651040	this is an important thing that people miss
12651040	12653040	where there was a lot
12653040	12655040	of people that especially rich
12655040	12657040	people that would look at VR and say
12657040	12659040	it's like oh this just isn't
12659040	12661040	that good and I'd say it's like well
12661040	12663040	you've already been court side
12663040	12665040	backstage and you know on pit row
12665040	12667040	and you've done all of these experiences
12667040	12669040	because you get to do them in real life
12669040	12671040	but most people don't get to and
12671040	12673040	even if the experience is only half as good
12673040	12675040	if it's something that they never would have gotten
12675040	12677040	to do before it's still a very good
12677040	12679040	thing and as we can just we can
12679040	12681040	push that number up over time
12681040	12683040	it has a minimum viable
12683040	12685040	value level when it
12685040	12687040	does something that is valuable enough to people
12687040	12689040	as long as it's better inside the headset
12689040	12691040	on any metric than it is outside
12691040	12693040	and people choose to go there we're on the
12693040	12695040	right path and we have a value
12695040	12697040	gradient that I'm just always hammering
12697040	12699040	on we can just follow this value gradient
12699040	12701040	just keep making things better
12701040	12703040	rather than going for that
12703040	12705040	one close your eyes swing for the
12705040	12707040	fences I kind of
12707040	12709040	silver bullet approach
12709040	12711040	I wonder if there's a value gradient for in-person
12711040	12713040	meetings because if you get that right
12713040	12715040	I mean that would change the world
12715040	12717040	it doesn't need to
12717040	12719040	I mean you don't need a ready player one
12719040	12721040	but I wonder
12721040	12723040	if there's that value gradient you can
12723040	12725040	follow along
12725040	12727040	because if there is
12727040	12729040	and you follow it then
12729040	12731040	there'll be a certain like
12731040	12733040	phase shift at a certain point
12733040	12735040	where people will shift from
12735040	12737040	from zoom
12737040	12739040	to this
12739040	12741040	I wonder
12741040	12743040	what are the bottlenecks
12743040	12745040	is it software is it hardware
12745040	12747040	like is it all about latency
12747040	12749040	so I have
12749040	12751040	big arguments internally about
12751040	12753040	strategic things like that where
12753040	12755040	I like the next headset
12755040	12757040	that's coming out that
12757040	12759040	we've made various announcements about is going to be a
12759040	12761040	higher-end headset more expensive
12761040	12763040	more features lots of people want to make
12763040	12765040	those trade-offs I
12765040	12767040	you know we'll see what the market has to say
12767040	12769040	about the exact trade-offs we've made
12769040	12771040	here but if you want to replace zoom
12771040	12773040	you need to have something that everybody
12773040	12775040	has
12775040	12777040	so you like cheaper
12777040	12779040	I like cheaper because also
12779040	12781040	lighter and cheaper wind up being
12781040	12783040	a virtuous cycle there
12783040	12785040	where expensive and more
12785040	12787040	features tends to also lead towards heavier
12787040	12789040	and it just kind of goes it's like let's add more
12789040	12791040	features the features are not
12791040	12793040	you know they have physical
12793040	12795040	presence and weight and draw from batteries
12795040	12797040	and all of those things so I've always
12797040	12799040	favored a lower-end
12799040	12801040	cheaper faster approach
12801040	12803040	that's why I was always behind the
12803040	12805040	mobile side of VR rather than the higher-end
12805040	12807040	PC headsets and I think that's
12807040	12809040	you know that's proven out well
12809040	12811040	but there's I you always
12811040	12813040	ideally we have a whole range of things but
12813040	12815040	if you've only got one or two things
12815040	12817040	it's important that those two things cover
12817040	12819040	the you know the scope that
12819040	12821040	you think is most important when we're in a
12821040	12823040	world when it's like cell phones and there's 50
12823040	12825040	of them on the market covering every conceivable
12825040	12827040	ecological niche you want
12827040	12829040	that's going to be great but we're not going to be there
12829040	12831040	for a while. Where are the bottlenecks?
12831040	12833040	Is it the hardware or the software?
12833040	12835040	Yeah so right now
12835040	12837040	you can play you can get
12837040	12839040	work rooms on Quest and
12839040	12841040	you can set up these things and it's a pretty
12841040	12843040	good experience it's surprisingly good. I haven't
12843040	12845040	tried it it's surprisingly good
12845040	12847040	yeah the voice latency is better
12847040	12849040	on that than a lot
12849040	12851040	better than a zoom meeting so you've got
12851040	12853040	a more a better sense of immediacy there
12853040	12855040	the expressions that you
12855040	12857040	get from the current hardware
12857040	12859040	with just kind of your controllers
12859040	12861040	and your head is pretty realistic
12861040	12863040	feeling you've got a pretty good sense of being
12863040	12865040	there with someone. Are these like
12865040	12867040	avatars
12867040	12869040	of people? Do you get
12869040	12871040	to see their body and
12871040	12873040	they're sitting around a table? Yeah
12873040	12875040	and it feels
12875040	12877040	better than zoom? Yeah better than you'd
12877040	12879040	expect for that it is definitely
12879040	12881040	yeah I'd say
12881040	12883040	it's quite a bit better than zoom when everything
12883040	12885040	is working right but there's still
12885040	12887040	all the rough edges of the reason zoom
12887040	12889040	became so successful is because they just
12889040	12891040	nailed the usability of everything
12891040	12893040	it's high quality with a absolutely
12893040	12895040	first-rate experience
12895040	12897040	and we are not there yet with
12897040	12899040	any of the VR stuff I'm trying to
12899040	12901040	to push hard to get
12901040	12903040	I keep talking about it's like it needs to just
12903040	12905040	be one click to make everything happen
12905040	12907040	and we're getting there in our home
12907040	12909040	environment not the whole work rooms application
12909040	12911040	but the main home where you can now
12911040	12913040	kind of go over and click and invite and
12913040	12915040	still winds up taking five times longer
12915040	12917040	than it should but we're getting
12917040	12919040	close to that where you click there
12919040	12921040	they click on their button and then
12921040	12923040	they're sitting there in this good presence
12923040	12925040	with you but latencies need
12925040	12927040	to get a lot better user interface needs
12927040	12929040	to get a lot better I'm
12929040	12931040	ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better
12931040	12933040	we need to have a hundred million of them
12933040	12935040	out there just so that everybody knows
12935040	12937040	somebody that uses this all the time
12937040	12939040	well I think it's a virtual cycle because I do
12939040	12941040	think
12941040	12943040	the interface
12943040	12945040	is the thing that makes
12945040	12947040	or breaks this kind
12947040	12949040	of revolution it's so interesting how
12949040	12951040	like you said one click but it's also
12951040	12953040	like how you achieve that one click
12953040	12955040	I don't know what is
12957040	12959040	can I ask a dark question maybe let's
12959040	12961040	keep it outside of meta but
12961040	12963040	this is about meta but also
12963040	12965040	Google and big company
12965040	12967040	are they able to do this kind
12967040	12969040	of thing it seems like
12969040	12971040	let me put on my cranky old
12971040	12973040	man hat is they
12973040	12975040	seem to not do a good
12975040	12977040	job of
12977040	12979040	creating these user
12979040	12981040	friendly interfaces as they get
12981040	12983040	bigger and bigger as a company like
12983040	12985040	Google has created some of the greatest interfaces
12985040	12987040	ever
12987040	12989040	early on and it's I mean creating Gmail
12989040	12991040	just so
12991040	12993040	many brilliant
12993040	12995040	interfaces and she seems to be getting
12995040	12997040	crappier and crappier at that
12997040	12999040	same with meta same
12999040	13001040	with
13001040	13003040	Microsoft it's just it
13003040	13005040	seems to get worse and worse at that
13005040	13007040	I don't know what is it because you become
13007040	13009040	more conservative careful risk
13009040	13011040	averse is that why
13011040	13013040	can you speak to that? So it's been really eye
13013040	13015040	opening to me working inside a tech
13015040	13017040	Titan where I
13017040	13019040	you know I had my small
13019040	13021040	companies and then we're acquired by
13021040	13023040	a you know a midsize game publisher
13023040	13025040	and then
13025040	13027040	Oculus getting acquired by meta
13027040	13029040	and meta has grown by a factor of many
13029040	13031040	just in the eight years
13031040	13033040	since the acquisition
13033040	13035040	so I did not have
13035040	13037040	experience with this and it's
13037040	13039040	it was interesting because I remember
13039040	13041040	like previously my benchmark for
13041040	13043040	kind of use of resources
13043040	13045040	was some of the government programs I interacted
13045040	13047040	with on the aerospace side
13047040	13049040	and I remember thinking there was
13049040	13051040	an Air Force program and they spent 50
13051040	13053040	million dollars and they didn't
13053040	13055040	they didn't launch anything they didn't even build
13055040	13057040	anything it was just kind of like they
13057040	13059040	you know they made a bunch of papers
13059040	13061040	and had some parts in a warehouse
13061040	13063040	and nothing came of it it's like 50 million
13063040	13065040	dollars
13065040	13067040	and I have I've had to radically
13067040	13069040	recalibrate my sense of
13069040	13071040	like how much money can be spent with
13071040	13073040	without a product at the end resources
13073040	13075040	where
13075040	13077040	on the plus side VR
13077040	13079040	has turned out we've built
13079040	13081040	pretty much exactly
13081040	13083040	what you know we just passed
13083040	13085040	the 10-year mark then from my I like
13085040	13087040	my first demo of the Rift
13087040	13089040	and if I could have said what I wanted
13089040	13091040	to have it would have been
13091040	13093040	a standalone inside out tracked
13093040	13095040	4k resolution headset
13095040	13097040	that I that could still plug into
13097040	13099040	a PC for high-end rendering and that's
13099040	13101040	exactly what we've got on Quest 2
13101040	13103040	first of all let's pause on that with me
13103040	13105040	being cranky and everything
13105040	13107040	it's what meta achieved
13107040	13109040	with Oculus and so on is incredible
13109040	13111040	I mean this is
13111040	13113040	this what when I thought
13113040	13115040	about the future of VR this is what I imagine
13115040	13117040	in terms of hardware I would say
13117040	13119040	and maybe in terms of the experience as well
13119040	13121040	but it's still not there somehow
13121040	13123040	on the one hand
13123040	13125040	we did kind of achieve it and win and we've got
13125040	13127040	we've sold you know we're a success
13127040	13129040	right now but
13129040	13131040	the amount of resources that have gone into
13131040	13133040	it it winds up getting cluttered up in
13133040	13135040	accounting where last mark
13135040	13137040	did announce that they spent
13137040	13139040	ten billion dollars a year like on
13139040	13141040	reality labs now reality labs
13141040	13143040	covers a lot it was VR
13143040	13145040	was not the large part of it also had
13145040	13147040	portal and spark and the big AR
13147040	13149040	research efforts and
13149040	13151040	it's been expanding out to include AI
13151040	13153040	and other things there where
13153040	13155040	I there's a lot going on there
13155040	13157040	but ten billion
13157040	13159040	dollars was just a number that I had
13159040	13161040	trouble processing it just
13161040	13163040	I feel sick to my stomach thinking about
13163040	13165040	that much money being spent
13165040	13167040	but that's how they demonstrate commitment
13167040	13169040	to this where it's not
13169040	13171040	I'm more so than
13171040	13173040	like yeah Google goes and cancels all of these
13173040	13175040	projects I had different things I
13175040	13177040	like that while meta is
13177040	13179040	really sticking with the funding of
13179040	13181040	VR and AR is still
13181040	13183040	further out with it so there's something to be said
13183040	13185040	for that I
13185040	13187040	it's not just going to vanish the works going in
13187040	13189040	I just wish it could be
13189040	13191040	those resources could be applied more
13191040	13193040	effectively because I see
13193040	13195040	all these cases I point out these examples
13195040	13197040	of how a third party
13197040	13199040	that we're kind of competing with in various ways
13199040	13201040	there's a number of these examples and they
13201040	13203040	do work with a tenth
13203040	13205040	of the people that we do internally
13205040	13207040	and a lot of it comes from
13207040	13209040	yes there's the small company
13209040	13211040	can just go do it while in a big
13211040	13213040	company you do have to worry about
13213040	13215040	I you know is there some
13215040	13217040	SDK internally that you should be using
13217040	13219040	other teams making it you have to have your
13219040	13221040	cross functional group meetups
13221040	13223040	for different things you do have more
13223040	13225040	concerns about you know about privacy
13225040	13227040	or diversity and equity and
13227040	13229040	I'm safety of different things
13229040	13231040	parental issues and things that a small
13231040	13233040	startup company can just kind of you know
13233040	13235040	cowboy off and do
13235040	13237040	something interesting and there's a lot
13237040	13239040	more that is a problem
13239040	13241040	that you have to pay attention to in the big
13241040	13243040	companies but I'm not willing to believe that
13243040	13245040	we are within even a factor
13245040	13247040	of two or four of what the
13247040	13249040	efficiency could be you know I
13249040	13251040	am constantly kind of
13251040	13253040	crying out for it's like we can do better than
13253040	13255040	this and you wonder what the mechanisms
13255040	13257040	to unlock that efficiency
13257040	13259040	are you know I don't
13259040	13261040	there is some sense in a large company
13261040	13263040	that
13263040	13265040	like an individual engineer might not
13265040	13267040	believe that they can change the world
13267040	13269040	maybe you delegate a little bit
13269040	13271040	of the responsibility
13271040	13273040	to be the one who changes the world
13273040	13275040	in a big company I think
13275040	13277040	but the reality is
13277040	13279040	like the world will get changed
13279040	13281040	by a single engineer anyway
13281040	13283040	so if whether inside google
13283040	13285040	or inside a startup it doesn't matter
13285040	13287040	it's just like google and
13287040	13289040	meta needs to help those engineers believe
13289040	13291040	they're the ones that are going to decrease
13291040	13293040	that latency is it'll
13293040	13295040	take one John Carmack like the
13295040	13297040	20 year old Carmack
13297040	13299040	that's inside meta right now
13299040	13301040	to change everything and I try to
13301040	13303040	point that out and push people
13303040	13305040	it's like try to go ahead
13305040	13307040	and when you see some because there is
13307040	13309040	you get the silo mentality where you're like
13309040	13311040	okay I know something's not right over there
13311040	13313040	but that's I'm staying in my lane here
13313040	13315040	and there's there's a couple people
13315040	13317040	that I can you know I can
13317040	13319040	think about that are willing to just like hop
13319040	13321040	all over the place and man I treasure them
13321040	13323040	the people that are just willing to
13323040	13325040	they're fearless you know they will go over
13325040	13327040	and they will go rebuild the kernel and change
13327040	13329040	this distribution and go in and hack
13329040	13331040	firmware over here to to get something
13331040	13333040	done right and that is
13333040	13335040	relatively rare you know there's thousands
13335040	13337040	of developers and you've got a small handful
13337040	13339040	that are willing to operate at that level
13339040	13341040	and you know and it's
13341040	13343040	potentially risky for them the the politics
13343040	13345040	are you know are real in a lot of that and
13345040	13347040	I'm in the you know very much the privileged
13347040	13349040	position of I am
13349040	13351040	you know I'm more or less untouchable
13351040	13353040	there where I've been dinged like
13353040	13355040	twice for it's like you said something insensitive
13355040	13357040	in that post and I and you should probably
13357040	13359040	not say that I am
13359040	13361040	but for the most part yes I you know I get
13361040	13363040	away with I every week I'm
13363040	13365040	posting something you know pretty loud
13365040	13367040	and opinionated in you know internally
13367040	13369040	and I think that's useful for
13369040	13371040	the company but
13371040	13373040	I am yeah it's not
13373040	13375040	it's rare to have a position like that and I
13375040	13377040	can't necessarily offer advice for how
13377040	13379040	someone can do that I
13379040	13381040	well you could offer advice to a company
13381040	13383040	in general to give a little bit
13383040	13385040	of freedom for the
13385040	13387040	young wild the wildest ideas come
13387040	13389040	from the young minds
13389040	13391040	and so
13391040	13393040	you need to give the young minds freedom
13393040	13395040	to think big and wild
13395040	13397040	and crazy and for that
13397040	13399040	they have to be opinionated they have to
13399040	13401040	be
13401040	13403040	they have to think crazy ideas
13403040	13405040	and thoughts and pursue
13405040	13407040	them with a full passion without being slowed
13407040	13409040	down by bureaucracy or managers
13409040	13411040	and all that kind of stuff
13411040	13413040	obviously startups really empower that but
13413040	13415040	big companies could too and that's
13415040	13417040	that's a design challenge for company
13417040	13419040	for big companies to see how can you
13419040	13421040	enable that how can you
13421040	13423040	there are so many resources
13423040	13425040	and they do you know amazing
13425040	13427040	things do get accomplished but
13427040	13429040	there's so much more that could come out
13429040	13431040	of that and you know I'm hope I'm always
13431040	13433040	hopeful I'm an optimist in almost everything
13433040	13435040	you know I think things can get better I
13435040	13437040	think that they can improve things that
13437040	13439040	you go through a path and you're learning
13439040	13441040	kind of what does and doesn't work
13441040	13443040	and I'm not I'm not ready to be fatalistic
13443040	13445040	about the kind of the outcome
13445040	13447040	of any of that
13447040	13449040	me neither I know too many good people
13449040	13451040	inside of those large companies that are incredible
13451040	13453040	you have a
13453040	13455040	friendship with Elon Musk
13455040	13457040	often when I talk to him
13457040	13459040	he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer
13459040	13461040	and just a big picture
13461040	13463040	thinker you are his huge
13463040	13465040	amount of respect for you
13465040	13467040	I just
13467040	13469040	I've never been a fly in the wall between
13469040	13471040	the discussion between the two of you I just wonder
13471040	13473040	is there something you guys
13473040	13475040	debate
13475040	13477040	argue about discuss is there
13477040	13479040	some interesting problems that the two of you
13479040	13481040	think about
13481040	13483040	you come from different worlds maybe there's
13483040	13485040	some intersection
13485040	13487040	in aerospace maybe there's some intersection
13487040	13489040	in your
13489040	13491040	new efforts in artificial intelligence
13491040	13493040	in terms of thinking
13493040	13495040	is there something interesting you could say about
13495040	13497040	sort of the debates the two of you have
13497040	13499040	so I think in some ways
13499040	13501040	we do have a kind of similar background
13501040	13503040	where we're almost exactly the same age
13503040	13505040	and we had kind of similar
13505040	13507040	programming backgrounds on the personal computers
13507040	13509040	and
13509040	13511040	even some of the books that we would read and things
13511040	13513040	that would kind of turn us into the people
13513040	13515040	that we are today
13515040	13517040	and I think there is a
13517040	13519040	degree of
13519040	13521040	sensibility similarities where
13521040	13523040	we kind of call bullshit on the same things
13523040	13525040	and kind of see the same opportunities
13525040	13527040	in different technology
13527040	13529040	and there's that sense of
13529040	13531040	I always talk about the speed of light solutions
13531040	13533040	for things and he's thinking about
13533040	13535040	kind of minimum manufacturing
13535040	13537040	and engineering and operational
13537040	13539040	standpoints for things
13539040	13541040	and
13541040	13543040	so I mean I first met Elon
13543040	13545040	right at the start of the aerospace era
13545040	13547040	where I wasn't familiar with
13547040	13549040	I was still in my game dev bubble
13549040	13551040	I really wasn't familiar with all the startups
13551040	13553040	that were going and being successful
13553040	13555040	with PayPal and all of his different companies
13555040	13557040	but I met him as I was starting
13557040	13559040	to do Armadillo Aerospace
13559040	13561040	and he came down with
13561040	13563040	kind of his right hand propulsion guy
13563040	13565040	and we talked about rockets
13565040	13567040	what can we do with this
13567040	13569040	and it was kind of specific things
13569040	13571040	about like how are our flight
13571040	13573040	computers set up, what are different propellant
13573040	13575040	options, what
13575040	13577040	can happen with different
13577040	13579040	ways of putting things together
13579040	13581040	and then in some
13581040	13583040	ways he was certainly the biggest player
13583040	13585040	in the sort of alt space community
13585040	13587040	that was going on in the early 2000s
13587040	13589040	he was
13589040	13591040	the most well funded although
13591040	13593040	you know his funding in the larger scheme of things
13593040	13595040	compared to a
13595040	13597040	like a NASA or something like that
13597040	13599040	was really tiny, it was a lot more
13599040	13601040	than I had at the time
13601040	13603040	but it was interesting
13603040	13605040	I had a point years later when I realized
13605040	13607040	okay my
13607040	13609040	my financial resources at this point
13609040	13611040	were basically what Elon's was
13611040	13613040	when he went all in on
13613040	13615040	SpaceX and Tesla
13615040	13617040	and there's
13617040	13619040	I think in many corners he does not
13619040	13621040	get the respect that he should
13621040	13623040	about being a wealthy person
13623040	13625040	that could just retire
13625040	13627040	and he went all in where
13627040	13629040	he was really going to
13629040	13631040	you know he could have gone bust
13631040	13633040	and there's plenty of people
13633040	13635040	you look at the you know the sad
13635040	13637040	athletes or entertainers
13637040	13639040	that had all the money in the world and blew it
13639040	13641040	he could have been the business case
13641040	13643040	example of that
13643040	13645040	but you know the things
13645040	13647040	that he was doing space exploration
13647040	13649040	electrification of transportation
13649040	13651040	on solar city type things
13651040	13653040	these are big
13653040	13655040	world level things
13655040	13657040	and I have a great deal of admiration
13657040	13659040	that he was willing to throw himself
13659040	13661040	so completely into that
13661040	13663040	because in contrast with myself
13663040	13665040	I was doing armadillo aerospace
13665040	13667040	with this tightly bounded
13667040	13669040	it was John's crazy money
13669040	13671040	at the time that had a finite limit
13671040	13673040	on it it was never going to impact
13673040	13675040	me or my family
13675040	13677040	if it completely failed
13677040	13679040	and I was still hedging my bets
13679040	13681040	working at idsoftware at the time
13681040	13683040	when he had been
13683040	13685040	really all in there
13685040	13687040	and I have a huge amount of respect
13687040	13689040	for that and people do not
13689040	13691040	the other thing I get irritated with
13691040	13693040	is people would say it's like oh Elon's
13693040	13695040	business guy
13695040	13697040	he was gifted the money
13697040	13699040	and he's just kind of investing
13699040	13701040	in all of this when
13701040	13703040	he was really deeply involved
13703040	13705040	in a lot of the decisions
13705040	13707040	not all of them were perfect
13707040	13709040	but he cared very much about
13709040	13711040	engine material selection
13711040	13713040	propellant selection
13713040	13715040	for years he'd be kind of telling me
13715040	13717040	it's like get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff
13717040	13719040	it's like liquid oxygen
13719040	13721040	is the only proper oxidizer
13721040	13723040	for this
13723040	13725040	and like the times
13725040	13727040	that I've gone through the factories with him
13727040	13729040	we're talking
13729040	13731040	very detailed things about
13731040	13733040	how this weld is made
13733040	13735040	how this sub-assembly goes together
13735040	13737040	what are start up shut down
13737040	13739040	behaviors of the different things
13739040	13741040	so he is really
13741040	13743040	in there at a very detailed
13743040	13745040	level and I think that he is
13745040	13747040	the best modern example
13747040	13749040	now of someone that tries to
13749040	13751040	effectively micromanage some decisions
13751040	13753040	on things on both Tesla
13753040	13755040	you know and SpaceX to some degree
13755040	13757040	where he cares enough about it
13757040	13759040	I worry a lot that he stretched too thin
13759040	13761040	that you get boring company
13761040	13763040	in Neuralink and Twitter
13763040	13765040	all the other possible things there
13765040	13767040	where I know I've got
13767040	13769040	I've got limits on how much
13769040	13771040	I can pay attention to
13771040	13773040	that I have to kind of box off different amounts
13773040	13775040	of time and I look back at
13775040	13777040	my aerospace side of things it's like I did
13777040	13779040	not go all in on that I did not
13779040	13781040	commit myself at a level that it would
13781040	13783040	have taken to be successful there
13783040	13785040	and I
13785040	13787040	and it's kind of a weird thing just
13787040	13789040	like having a discussion with
13789040	13791040	he's the richest man in the world right now
13791040	13793040	but he operates on
13793040	13795040	you know on a level that is still
13795040	13797040	very much
13797040	13799040	in my wheelhouse on a technical side of
13799040	13801040	things so
13801040	13803040	doing that systems level type of thinking where you can go to
13803040	13805040	the low level details
13805040	13807040	and go up high to the big picture
13807040	13809040	do you think
13809040	13811040	in the aerospace
13811040	13813040	arena in the next
13813040	13815040	5, 10 years do you think
13815040	13817040	we're going to put a human on Mars like what do you think
13817040	13819040	is the interesting
13819040	13821040	no I do in fact
13821040	13823040	I made a bet with someone
13823040	13825040	with a group of people kind of this
13825040	13827040	about whether boots on Mars by
13827040	13829040	2030 and
13829040	13831040	this was kind of a fun
13831040	13833040	story because I was at an Intel
13833040	13835040	sponsored event and we had a bunch of
13835040	13837040	just world-class brilliant people
13837040	13839040	and we were talking about computing stuff
13839040	13841040	but the after dinner conversation was
13841040	13843040	like what are some other things how they're going to go in the
13843040	13845040	future and one of the ones tossed
13845040	13847040	up on the whiteboard was like boots on Mars
13847040	13849040	by 2030
13849040	13851040	and most of the people in the room
13851040	13853040	thought yes you know they thought that like
13853040	13855040	SpaceX is kicking ass we've got
13855040	13857040	all this possible stuff
13857040	13859040	seems likely that it's going to go that way
13859040	13861040	and I said
13861040	13863040	no I think less than 50% chance
13863040	13865040	that it's going to make it there
13865040	13867040	and people
13867040	13869040	were kind of like why the pessimism or whatever
13869040	13871040	and of course I'm an optimist at almost
13871040	13873040	everything but for me to be
13873040	13875040	the one kind of outlier saying no I
13875040	13877040	don't think so
13877040	13879040	then I started saying some of the things
13879040	13881040	I said well let's be concrete about it
13881040	13883040	let's bet $10,000
13883040	13885040	that it's not going to happen
13885040	13887040	and this was really
13887040	13889040	a startling thing to see that
13889040	13891040	again, room full of brilliant people
13891040	13893040	but as soon as like
13893040	13895040	money came on the line and they were like
13895040	13897040	I want to put $10,000 and I was
13897040	13899040	not the richest person in the room
13899040	13901040	there are people much better off than
13901040	13903040	there's a spectrum but
13903040	13905040	you know as soon as they started
13905040	13907040	to think it's like oh I could lose money
13907040	13909040	by keeping
13909040	13911040	my position right now
13911040	13913040	and all these engineers they engage
13913040	13915040	their brain they started thinking it's like okay
13915040	13917040	launch windows
13917040	13919040	delays like how many times
13919040	13921040	would it take to get this right what historical
13921040	13923040	precedence do we have
13923040	13925040	and then it mostly came down
13925040	13927040	to it's like well what about in transit
13927040	13929040	by 2030 and then
13929040	13931040	what about
13931040	13933040	different things or would you go for 2032
13933040	13935040	but one of the people
13935040	13937040	did go ahead and was optimistic
13937040	13939040	enough to make a bet with me so I have
13939040	13941040	a $10,000 bet that
13941040	13943040	by 2030 I think it's going to happen
13943040	13945040	shortly thereafter I think there will
13945040	13947040	probably be infrastructure on Mars by 2030
13947040	13949040	but I don't think that we'll have
13949040	13951040	humans on Mars on 23rd
13951040	13953040	I think it's possible but I think it's
13953040	13955040	less than a 50% chance so I felt
13955040	13957040	safe making that bet
13957040	13959040	well I think you had an interesting
13959040	13961040	point correct me if I'm wrong
13961040	13963040	that's a dark one that's
13963040	13965040	um that should
13965040	13967040	perhaps help people
13967040	13969040	appreciate Elon Musk
13969040	13971040	which is
13971040	13973040	in this particular effort
13973040	13975040	Elon is a critical
13975040	13977040	it's critical to success
13977040	13979040	SpaceX seems to be
13979040	13981040	critical to
13983040	13985040	humans on Mars by 2030
13985040	13987040	or thereabouts
13987040	13989040	so if something happens to Elon
13991040	13993040	then all of this collapses
13993040	13995040	and this is in contrast to
13995040	13997040	the other $10,000
13997040	13999040	bet I made kind of recently and that was
13999040	14001040	self-driving cars at
14001040	14003040	like a level 5 running around
14003040	14005040	cities and people have kind of nitpicked
14005040	14007040	that that we probably don't mean exactly
14007040	14009040	level 5 but the guy I'm having the bet with
14009040	14011040	is we're going to be
14011040	14013040	we know what we mean about this
14013040	14015040	Jeff Atwood yeah coding horror
14015040	14017040	and stack over flow and all
14017040	14019040	but I
14019040	14021040	he doesn't think that people
14021040	14023040	are going to be riding around in Robo Taxis
14023040	14025040	in 2030 in major cities
14025040	14027040	just like you take an Uber now
14027040	14029040	and I think it will
14029040	14031040	and I think and the difference is everybody
14031040	14033040	looks at this it's like oh but Tesla's been wrong
14033040	14035040	for you they've been promising it for years
14035040	14037040	and it's not here yet and
14037040	14039040	the reason this is different than
14039040	14041040	the bet with Mars is
14041040	14043040	Mars really is
14043040	14045040	more than is comfortable a bet on
14045040	14047040	Elon Musk I am you know that is
14047040	14049040	you know that is his thing
14049040	14051040	and he is really going to
14051040	14053040	move heaven and earth to try to make that
14053040	14055040	happen and perhaps not even SpaceX
14055040	14057040	yeah perhaps just Elon
14057040	14059040	yeah because if
14059040	14061040	if Elon went away and SpaceX
14061040	14063040	went public and got a board of directors
14063040	14065040	I there are more profitable
14065040	14067040	things they could be doing than focusing
14067040	14069040	on human presence on Mars
14069040	14071040	so this really is a sort
14071040	14073040	of personal thing there and
14073040	14075040	in contrast with that
14075040	14077040	self-driving cars have
14077040	14079040	a dozen credible companies
14079040	14081040	working really hard and while
14081040	14083040	yes it's going
14083040	14085040	slower than most people thought it would
14085040	14087040	betting against that is a bet
14087040	14089040	against almost the entire world
14089040	14091040	in terms of all of these companies
14091040	14093040	that have all of these incentives
14093040	14095040	it's not just you know one
14095040	14097040	guys passion project
14097040	14099040	and I do think that it is solvable
14099040	14101040	I although there's I recognize
14101040	14103040	it's not a hundred percent chance because
14103040	14105040	it's possible the long tail of self-driving
14105040	14107040	problems winds up being an AGI
14107040	14109040	complete problem I think
14109040	14111040	there's plenty of value to mine out of it with
14111040	14113040	narrow AI and I think that it's
14113040	14115040	you know it's going to happen probably more
14115040	14117040	so than people expect but it's that
14117040	14119040	whole sigmoid curve where you
14119040	14121040	over you know you overestimate the near
14121040	14123040	term progress you underestimate the long
14123040	14125040	term progress and I think self-driving
14125040	14127040	is going to be like that and I think
14127040	14129040	2030 still a pretty good bet
14129040	14131040	yeah unfortunately
14133040	14135040	self-driving is a problem
14135040	14137040	that is
14137040	14139040	safety critical meaning that
14139040	14141040	if you don't do it well
14141040	14143040	people get hurt
14143040	14145040	but the other side of that is people
14145040	14147040	are terrible drivers so
14147040	14149040	it is not going to be that's probably going to be
14149040	14151040	the argument that gets it through is like
14151040	14153040	we can save 10,000 lives
14153040	14155040	a year by taking
14155040	14157040	imperfect self-driving cars
14157040	14159040	and letting them take over a lot of driving responsibilities
14159040	14161040	it's like was it 30,000
14161040	14163040	people a year die in auto accidents
14163040	14165040	right now in America
14165040	14167040	and a lot of those are preventable
14167040	14169040	and the problem is you'll have people that
14169040	14171040	every time a Tesla crashes into something
14171040	14173040	you've got a bunch of people that
14173040	14175040	literally have vested interests shorting Tesla
14175040	14177040	to come out and make it the worst thing in the world
14177040	14179040	and people will be fighting against
14179040	14181040	that but optimist in me again
14181040	14183040	I think that we will have systems
14183040	14185040	that are statistically safer
14185040	14187040	than human drivers and we will be saving
14187040	14189040	thousands and thousands
14189040	14191040	of lives every year
14191040	14193040	when we can hand over more of those responsibilities
14193040	14195040	to it I do still think
14195040	14197040	as a person who studied this problem
14197040	14199040	very deeply from a human side
14199040	14201040	as well
14201040	14203040	it's still an open problem how
14203040	14205040	good slash bad humans
14205040	14207040	are driving it's a kind
14207040	14209040	of funny thing we say about each other
14209040	14211040	oh humans suck at driving
14211040	14213040	everybody except
14213040	14215040	you of course
14215040	14217040	we think we're good at driving
14217040	14219040	but after really
14219040	14221040	studying it I think
14221040	14223040	you start to notice
14223040	14225040	because I've watched hundreds
14225040	14227040	of hours of humans driving
14227040	14229040	the projects of this kind of thing
14229040	14231040	you've noticed that even with
14231040	14233040	the distraction, even with everything else
14233040	14235040	humans are able
14235040	14237040	to do some incredible things
14237040	14239040	with the
14239040	14241040	attention even when you're just looking at the smartphone
14241040	14243040	just to get cues from the environment
14243040	14245040	to make less seconds
14245040	14247040	decisions
14247040	14249040	to use instinctual type of decisions
14249040	14251040	that actually save your ass
14251040	14253040	time and time and time again
14253040	14255040	and are able to do that
14255040	14257040	with so much uncertainty
14257040	14259040	around you in such tricky
14259040	14261040	dynamic environments
14261040	14263040	I don't know
14263040	14265040	I don't know exactly
14265040	14267040	how hard is it to beat
14267040	14269040	that kind of
14269040	14271040	skill of common sense reasoning
14271040	14273040	this is one of those interesting things
14273040	14275040	that there have been a lot of studies about how
14275040	14277040	experts in their field usually
14277040	14279040	underestimate the progress
14279040	14281040	that's going to happen because
14281040	14283040	it thinks about all the problems they deal with
14283040	14285040	and they're like, damn, I'm going to have a hard time
14285040	14287040	solving all of this
14287040	14289040	and they filter out the fact that they are one expert
14289040	14291040	in a field of thousands
14291040	14293040	and you think about, yeah, I can't do
14293040	14295040	all of that and you sometimes forget about
14295040	14297040	the scope of the ecosystem
14297040	14299040	that you're embedded in and if you think back
14299040	14301040	eight years very specifically
14301040	14303040	the state of AI and machine learning
14303040	14305040	where we had just gotten
14305040	14307040	Resnets probably at that point
14307040	14309040	and you look at all the amazing
14309040	14311040	magical things that have happened in eight years
14311040	14313040	and they do kind of seem to be
14313040	14315040	happening a little faster in recent years also
14315040	14317040	and you project that
14317040	14319040	eight more years into the future
14319040	14321040	where again, I think there's a 50% chance
14321040	14323040	we're going to have signs of life of AGI
14323040	14325040	which we can put through
14325040	14327040	Driver's Ed if we need to
14327040	14329040	to actually build self-driving cars
14329040	14331040	and I think that the narrow systems are going to
14331040	14333040	have real value demonstrated
14333040	14335040	well before then
14335040	14337040	So signs of life
14337040	14339040	in AGI, you've
14339040	14341040	mentioned that
14341040	14343040	okay, first of all
14343040	14345040	you're one of the most brilliant people on this earth
14345040	14347040	you could be solving
14347040	14349040	a number of different problems as you've mentioned
14349040	14351040	your mind was attracted to
14351040	14353040	nuclear energy
14353040	14355040	obviously virtual reality with the metaverse
14355040	14357040	is something you could have a tremendous impact on
14357040	14359040	I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy
14359040	14361040	where I
14361040	14363040	this is something that
14363040	14365040	this so precisely
14365040	14367040	feels like aerospace before SpaceX
14367040	14369040	where from everything that I know
14369040	14371040	about all of these
14371040	14373040	the physics of this stuff hasn't changed
14373040	14375040	and the reasons why
14375040	14377040	things are expensive now are not
14377040	14379040	fundamental
14379040	14381040	somebody should be going into
14381040	14383040	a really hard
14383040	14385040	Elon Musk style at
14385040	14387040	fission, economical fission
14387040	14389040	not fusion
14389040	14391040	where the fusion is
14391040	14393040	kind of the darling of people
14393040	14395040	that want to go and do nuclear
14395040	14397040	because it doesn't have the taint that fission
14397040	14399040	has in a lot of people's minds
14399040	14401040	but it's an almost absurdly
14401040	14403040	complex thing where
14403040	14405040	nuclear fusion is you look at the
14405040	14407040	the Tokamax or any of the things that people are
14407040	14409040	building and it's doing all of this
14409040	14411040	infrastructure just at the end of the day
14411040	14413040	to make something hot
14413040	14415040	to that you can then turn into energy through
14415040	14417040	a conventional power plant
14417040	14419040	and all of that work which we think
14419040	14421040	we've got line of sight on
14421040	14423040	if it comes out then you have to do
14423040	14425040	all of that immensely complex
14425040	14427040	expensive stuff just to make something hot
14427040	14429040	where nuclear fission is
14429040	14431040	basically you put these two rocks together
14431040	14433040	and they get hot all by themselves
14433040	14435040	that is just that much simpler
14435040	14437040	it's just orders of magnitude
14437040	14439040	simpler and the actual
14439040	14441040	rocks the refined uranium is not very
14441040	14443040	expensive it's a couple percent
14443040	14445040	of the cost of electricity
14445040	14447040	that's why I made that point where you could
14447040	14449040	have something which was five
14449040	14451040	times less efficient than
14451040	14453040	current systems and if the rest
14453040	14455040	of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper you could still be
14455040	14457040	super super valuable
14457040	14459040	so how much of the pie
14459040	14461040	do you think
14461040	14463040	could be solved by nuclear energy
14463040	14465040	by fission so
14465040	14467040	how much could it become the primary
14467040	14469040	source of energy on earth
14469040	14471040	it could be most of it like the reserves of uranium
14471040	14473040	as it stands now could not power the whole
14473040	14475040	earth but I am you know
14475040	14477040	you get into breeder reactors and thorium
14477040	14479040	things like that that you do for conventional fission
14479040	14481040	there is enough
14481040	14483040	for everything now I mean solar
14483040	14485040	photovoltaic has been amazing
14485040	14487040	you know it's I
14487040	14489040	one of my current projects is working on an
14489040	14491040	off-grid system and it's been fun just kind of
14491040	14493040	again putting my hands on all the
14493040	14495040	stripping the wires and wiring things together
14495040	14497040	and doing all of that and just having followed
14497040	14499040	that a little bit from the outside
14499040	14501040	over the last couple decades
14501040	14503040	there's been semiconductor like magical
14503040	14505040	progress in what's going
14505040	14507040	on there so I'm all for
14507040	14509040	all of that but it doesn't solve
14509040	14511040	everything and nuclear really
14511040	14513040	still does seem like the smart money
14513040	14515040	bet for what you should be getting for base
14515040	14517040	band on a lot of things
14517040	14519040	and solar may be cheaper for
14519040	14521040	you know peaking over air conditioning loads
14521040	14523040	during the summer and things that you
14523040	14525040	can push around in different ways
14525040	14527040	but it's one of those things that's
14527040	14529040	it's just strange
14529040	14531040	how we've had the technology sitting there
14531040	14533040	but these non-technical reasons on the social
14533040	14535040	optics of it has been
14535040	14537040	this major forcing function
14537040	14539040	for something that
14539040	14541040	you know really should be at the corner
14541040	14543040	stone of all of the world's concerns
14543040	14545040	with energy it's interesting
14545040	14547040	how the non-technical factors
14547040	14549040	have really dominated something that is
14549040	14551040	so fundamental to
14551040	14553040	kind of the existence of the human race as we
14553040	14555040	know it today.
14555040	14557040	And much of the troubles of the world including
14557040	14559040	wars in different
14559040	14561040	parts of the world like Ukraine is energy
14561040	14563040	based and
14563040	14565040	yeah it's just sitting right there to be solved
14567040	14569040	that said
14569040	14571040	I mean to me personally I think
14571040	14573040	it's clear that if AGI were to be
14573040	14575040	achieved that would change the course
14575040	14577040	of human history. So AGI
14577040	14579040	wise I was
14579040	14581040	making this decision about what do I want
14581040	14583040	to focus on after
14583040	14585040	VR and I'm still working on VR
14585040	14587040	regularly I spend a day
14587040	14589040	a week kind of consulting with meta
14589040	14591040	and you know Bos
14591040	14593040	styles me the consulting
14593040	14595040	CTO is kind of like the Sherlock Holmes
14595040	14597040	that comes in and consults on
14597040	14599040	some of the specific tough issues
14599040	14601040	and I'm still pretty passionate about all of
14601040	14603040	that but I have been
14603040	14605040	figuring out how to compartmentalize
14605040	14607040	and force that into a smaller
14607040	14609040	box to work on some other things
14609040	14611040	and I did come down to this decision between
14611040	14613040	working on
14613040	14615040	economical nuclear fission or artificial
14615040	14617040	general intelligence
14617040	14619040	and the fission side of things
14619040	14621040	I've got a bunch of interesting things
14621040	14623040	going that way but
14623040	14625040	it would take that would be a fairly big
14625040	14627040	project thing to do I don't think
14627040	14629040	it needs to be as big as people expect
14629040	14631040	I do think something original space
14631040	14633040	excised
14633040	14635040	you build it power your building off of it
14635040	14637040	and then the government I think will come
14637040	14639040	around to what you need to
14639040	14641040	everybody loves an existence proof
14641040	14643040	I think it's possible somebody should be doing
14643040	14645040	this but it's going to involve
14645040	14647040	some politics it's going to involve
14647040	14649040	decent size teams and a bunch of this
14649040	14651040	cross functional stuff that I don't love
14651040	14653040	while
14653040	14655040	the artificial general intelligence side of things
14655040	14657040	um
14657040	14659040	it seems to me like this is
14659040	14661040	the highest leverage
14661040	14663040	moment for
14663040	14665040	potentially a single individual
14665040	14667040	potentially in the history of the world
14667040	14669040	where the things that we know
14669040	14671040	about the brain about what we
14671040	14673040	can do with artificial intelligence
14673040	14675040	uh nobody can say absolutely
14675040	14677040	on any of these things but
14677040	14679040	I am not a madman
14679040	14681040	for saying that it is likely
14681040	14683040	that the code for artificial general
14683040	14685040	intelligence is going to be
14685040	14687040	tens of thousands of lines
14687040	14689040	of code not millions of lines
14689040	14691040	of code this is code that conceivably
14691040	14693040	one individual could
14693040	14695040	write unlike writing a new web browser
14695040	14697040	operating system
14697040	14699040	and based on the
14699040	14701040	progress that AI has machine
14701040	14703040	learning has made in the recent decade
14703040	14705040	it's likely that the
14705040	14707040	important things that we don't know
14707040	14709040	are relatively simple there's
14709040	14711040	probably a handful of things and
14711040	14713040	my bet is that
14713040	14715040	I think there's less than
14715040	14717040	six key insights that need
14717040	14719040	to be made each one of them can probably
14719040	14721040	be written on the back of an envelope
14721040	14723040	we don't know what they are but when they're
14723040	14725040	put together in concert with
14725040	14727040	GPUs at scale and the data
14727040	14729040	that we all have access to that
14729040	14731040	we can make something that behaves
14731040	14733040	like a human being
14733040	14735040	or like a living creature
14735040	14737040	and that can then be educated
14737040	14739040	in whatever ways that we need to get to the
14739040	14741040	point where we can have
14741040	14743040	universal remote workers where
14743040	14745040	anything that somebody does
14745040	14747040	mediated by a computer and doesn't require
14747040	14749040	physical interaction
14749040	14751040	that an AGI will be able to do
14751040	14753040	we can already simulate the
14753040	14755040	equivalent of the zoom meetings
14755040	14757040	with avatars and
14757040	14759040	synthetic deepfakes and whatnot
14759040	14761040	we can definitely do that
14761040	14763040	we have superhuman capabilities
14763040	14765040	on any narrow thing that we can
14765040	14767040	that we can formalize and make a loss
14767040	14769040	function for but there's things we don't
14769040	14771040	know how to do now but I don't
14771040	14773040	think they are unapproachably
14773040	14775040	hard now that's incredibly hubristic
14775040	14777040	to say that it's like
14777040	14779040	but I think that what I said a couple
14779040	14781040	years ago is a 50% chance
14781040	14783040	that somewhere there will be signs of
14783040	14785040	life of AGI in
14785040	14787040	2030 and I've probably increased
14787040	14789040	that slightly I may be at
14789040	14791040	55-60% now because
14791040	14793040	I do think there's a little sense of
14793040	14795040	acceleration there
14795040	14797040	so I wonder what the and by the way you also
14797040	14799040	written that I
14799040	14801040	bet with hindsight we will find that
14801040	14803040	clear antecedents of all the critical
14803040	14805040	remaining steps for AGI
14805040	14807040	are already buried somewhere
14807040	14809040	in the vast literature of today so the
14809040	14811040	ideas are already there
14811040	14813040	I think that's likely the case one of the
14813040	14815040	things that appeals to so many people
14815040	14817040	including me about the promise of AGI
14817040	14819040	is we know that
14819040	14821040	we're only drinking from a straw from
14821040	14823040	the fire hose of all the information
14823040	14825040	out there I mean you look at
14825040	14827040	just in a very narrowly
14827040	14829040	bounded field like machine learning like
14829040	14831040	you can't read all the papers that come out
14831040	14833040	all the time you can't go back
14833040	14835040	and read all the clever things that people
14835040	14837040	did in the 90s or earlier that people
14837040	14839040	have forgotten about because they didn't pan out
14839040	14841040	at the time when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons
14841040	14843040	and
14843040	14845040	so that this idea that
14845040	14847040	yeah I think there are gems
14847040	14849040	buried in some of the older literature that
14849040	14851040	was not the path taken by everything
14851040	14853040	and you can see a kind of heard
14853040	14855040	mentality on the things that happen right now
14855040	14857040	it's almost funny to see
14857040	14859040	like oh Google does something and open AI
14859040	14861040	does something meta does something and
14861040	14863040	you know they're the same people that all talk
14863040	14865040	to each other and they all one up in each other
14865040	14867040	and they're all capable of implementing
14867040	14869040	each other's work given a month
14869040	14871040	or two after somebody has an announcement
14871040	14873040	of that but there's
14873040	14875040	a whole world of possible
14875040	14877040	approaches to machine learning
14877040	14879040	and I think that
14879040	14881040	we probably will in hindsight go back and see
14881040	14883040	it's like yeah that was kind of clearly
14883040	14885040	predicted by this early paper
14885040	14887040	here you know and this turns
14887040	14889040	out that if you do this and this and take this result
14889040	14891040	from animal training
14891040	14893040	and this thing from neuroscience over
14893040	14895040	here and put it together and set
14895040	14897040	up this curriculum for them to learn in
14897040	14899040	that that's kind of what it took
14899040	14901040	you don't have too many people
14901040	14903040	now that are still saying it's not
14903040	14905040	possible or it's going to take hundreds of years
14905040	14907040	and ten years ago you would get
14907040	14909040	you would collect get a collection of experts
14909040	14911040	and you would have a decent chunk on the margin
14911040	14913040	that either say not possible
14913040	14915040	or couple hundred
14915040	14917040	years might be centuries and the median
14917040	14919040	estimate would be like
14919040	14921040	fifty seventy years and it's been
14921040	14923040	coming down and I know with me saying
14923040	14925040	eight years for something that still puts me on
14925040	14927040	the optimistic side but it's not
14927040	14929040	crazy out in the fringes
14929040	14931040	and just being able to look at that at
14931040	14933040	a meta level about the
14933040	14935040	trend of the
14935040	14937040	predictions going down there
14937040	14939040	the idea that something could
14939040	14941040	be happening relatively soon
14941040	14943040	now
14943040	14945040	I do not believe in fast takeoffs
14945040	14947040	that's one of the safety issues that people say
14947040	14949040	it's like oh it's going to go fume and the AI
14949040	14951040	is going to take over the world there's a lot of reasons
14951040	14953040	I don't think that's a credible
14953040	14955040	position
14955040	14957040	and I think that we will go from a point
14957040	14959040	where we start seeing things
14959040	14961040	that credibly look like
14961040	14963040	look like animals behaviors
14963040	14965040	and I have a human voice box wired into them
14965040	14967040	it's like I tried to get Elon
14967040	14969040	to say it's like your your pig in neuro
14969040	14971040	link give it a human voice box and let it start
14971040	14973040	learning human words
14973040	14975040	I think that you know I think animal
14975040	14977040	intelligence is closer to human intelligence
14977040	14979040	than a lot of people like to think
14979040	14981040	and I think that culture and modalities
14981040	14983040	of IO are
14983040	14985040	make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it
14985040	14987040	actually is there's just that smooth
14987040	14989040	spectrum of how the brain developed
14989040	14991040	and cortexes and
14991040	14993040	scaling of different things going on there
14993040	14995040	cultural modalities of IO
14995040	14997040	yes languages
14997040	14999040	um the
14999040	15001040	sort of loss in translation conceals a
15001040	15003040	lot of intelligence and
15003040	15005040	so your when you think about
15005040	15007040	signs of life for AGI you're
15007040	15009040	thinking about
15009040	15011040	human interpretable signs so the example
15011040	15013040	I give it if we get to the point where you've got
15013040	15015040	a learning disabled toddler
15015040	15017040	some some kind of real special needs
15017040	15019040	a child that can still
15019040	15021040	interact with their favorite TV show and
15021040	15023040	video game and can be
15023040	15025040	trained and learn in some
15025040	15027040	appreciably human like way
15027040	15029040	at that point you can deploy an army
15029040	15031040	of engineers
15031040	15033040	cognitive scientist education developmental
15033040	15035040	developmental education people
15035040	15037040	and you've got so many advantages
15037040	15039040	there unlike real education where you can
15039040	15041040	do rollbacks and a B testing and you
15041040	15043040	can find a golden path through a curriculum
15043040	15045040	of different things if you get to that
15045040	15047040	point learning disabled toddler
15047040	15049040	I think that it's
15049040	15051040	it's going to be a done deal but you
15051040	15053040	think we'll we'll know when we see
15053040	15055040	it so there's
15055040	15057040	there's been a lot of really interesting
15057040	15059040	general learning progress from
15059040	15061040	DeepMind open the eye a little bit
15061040	15063040	to I
15063040	15065040	tend to believe that
15065040	15067040	Tesla autopilot deserves a
15067040	15069040	lot more credit than it's getting
15069040	15071040	for making progress
15071040	15073040	on the general answer
15073040	15075040	on the doing the multitask learning
15075040	15077040	thing and increasing the number of tasks
15077040	15079040	and automating that
15079040	15081040	process of
15081040	15083040	sort of
15083040	15085040	learning from the edge could discover in the edge
15085040	15087040	cases and learn from the edge cases that is
15087040	15089040	it's really approaching
15089040	15091040	from a different angle the general learning
15091040	15093040	problem of AGI
15093040	15095040	but the more clear approach
15095040	15097040	comes from DeepMind where you have these
15097040	15099040	kind of game situations and
15099040	15101040	build systems there
15101040	15103040	but I don't know
15103040	15105040	people seem to be quite
15107040	15109040	there will always be people that
15109040	15111040	just won't believe it and I fundamentally
15111040	15113040	don't care I mean I don't care
15113040	15115040	if they don't believe it I
15115040	15117040	when it starts doing people's jobs
15117040	15119040	and I mean I don't care about the
15119040	15121040	philosophical zombie argument at all
15121040	15123040	absolutely but will you
15123040	15125040	do you think you will notice that something
15125040	15127040	special has happened here and or
15129040	15131040	because to me I've been noticing
15131040	15133040	a lot of special things
15133040	15135040	I think a lot of credit should go to
15135040	15137040	DeepMind for
15137040	15139040	AlphaZero
15139040	15141040	that was truly special
15141040	15143040	self-play mechanisms achieve
15143040	15145040	sort of solve problems that
15145040	15147040	used to be thought unsolvable
15147040	15149040	like the game of go
15149040	15151040	so I mean protein folding
15151040	15153040	starting to get into that space where
15153040	15155040	learning is doing
15155040	15157040	at first it wasn't
15157040	15159040	end-to-end learning now it's
15159040	15161040	end-to-end learning of a
15161040	15163040	very difficult previously thought
15163040	15165040	unsolvable problem of protein folding
15165040	15167040	and so
15167040	15169040	yeah
15169040	15171040	where do you think
15171040	15173040	would be a really magical
15173040	15175040	moment for you?
15175040	15177040	there have been incredible things happening
15177040	15179040	in years like you say all of the things
15179040	15181040	from DeepMind and OpenAI that have been
15181040	15183040	huge showpiece things
15183040	15185040	but when you really get down to it
15185040	15187040	and you read the papers and you look at the way
15187040	15189040	the models are going
15189040	15191040	it's still like a feed forward
15191040	15193040	you push something in something comes out
15193040	15195040	on the end I mean maybe there's
15195040	15197040	diffusion models or Monte Carlo tree
15197040	15199040	rollouts and different things going on
15199040	15201040	but it's not a being
15201040	15203040	it's not close to a being
15203040	15205040	that's going through
15205040	15207040	a lifelong learning process
15207040	15209040	so you want something that kind of
15209040	15211040	gives signs of a being
15211040	15213040	what's the difference
15213040	15215040	between
15215040	15217040	a neural network
15217040	15219040	a feed forward neural network and a being
15219040	15221040	so where's the...
15221040	15223040	fundamentally the brain is a recurrent neural
15223040	15225040	network generating an action policy
15225040	15227040	I mean it's implemented on a biological
15227040	15229040	substrate and it's interesting thinking about
15229040	15231040	things like that where we know
15231040	15233040	fundamentally the brain is not
15233040	15235040	an additional neural network or a transformer
15235040	15237040	those are specialized things
15237040	15239040	that are very valuable for what we're doing
15239040	15241040	but it's not the way the brain is doing
15241040	15243040	now I do think consciousness and
15243040	15245040	AI in general is a
15245040	15247040	substrate independent mechanism
15247040	15249040	where it doesn't have to be implemented the way
15249040	15251040	the brain is but if you've only got
15251040	15253040	one existence proof there's certainly
15253040	15255040	some value in caring about what it says
15255040	15257040	and does
15257040	15259040	and so the idea
15259040	15261040	that anything that can be done with a
15261040	15263040	low AI that you can quantify up a
15263040	15265040	loss function for a reward mechanism
15265040	15267040	you're almost certainly going to be
15267040	15269040	able to produce something that's more
15269040	15271040	resource effective to train and
15271040	15273040	deploy and use in an inference mode
15273040	15275040	you know train a whole lot using an inference
15275040	15277040	but a living being
15277040	15279040	is going to be something that's a continuous
15279040	15281040	lifelong learned task
15281040	15283040	agnostic thing
15283040	15285040	and while a lot of...
15285040	15287040	So the lifelong learning is really important too
15287040	15289040	and the long term memory
15289040	15291040	is a big weird part of that
15291040	15293040	and we've got
15293040	15295040	again I have all the respect in the world
15295040	15297040	for the amazing things that are being done
15297040	15299040	now but sometimes they can be taken
15299040	15301040	a little bit out of context with things
15301040	15303040	like there's some smoking
15303040	15305040	mirrors going on like the GATO
15305040	15307040	the recent work the multi-task learning stuff
15307040	15309040	you know it's amazing that it's the one
15309040	15311040	it's one model that plays all the
15311040	15313040	Atari games I am as well
15313040	15315040	as doing all these other things
15315040	15317040	but of course it didn't learn to do all
15317040	15319040	of those it was instructed in doing
15319040	15321040	that by other reinforcement learners
15321040	15323040	going through and doing that
15323040	15325040	and even in the case of all the games
15325040	15327040	it's still going with a specific
15327040	15329040	hand-coded reward function
15329040	15331040	in each of those Atari games
15331040	15333040	where it's not that you know how does it
15333040	15335040	just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing
15335040	15337040	Atari because that's the most interesting
15337040	15339040	thing for it so it's again not
15339040	15341040	a general it's not learning the way humans
15341040	15343040	learn and there's
15343040	15345040	I believe a lot of things that are
15345040	15347040	challenging to make a loss function
15347040	15349040	for that you can train
15349040	15351040	through these existing conventional things
15351040	15353040	we're going to chip away at all the things
15353040	15355040	that people do
15355040	15357040	that we can turn into narrow
15357040	15359040	AI problems
15359040	15361040	and billions of probably trillions
15361040	15363040	of dollars of value are going to be created
15363040	15365040	by that but there's still going
15365040	15367040	to be a set of things and we've got questionable
15367040	15369040	cases like the self-driving car
15369040	15371040	where it's possible
15371040	15373040	it's not my bet but it's plausible
15373040	15375040	that the long tail could be problematic
15375040	15377040	enough that that really does require
15377040	15379040	a full-on artificial general intelligence
15379040	15381040	the counter argument
15381040	15383040	is that data solves almost everything
15383040	15385040	is an interpolation problem if you have enough data
15385040	15387040	and Tesla may be able to get enough
15387040	15389040	data from all of their
15389040	15391040	deployed stuff to be able to work like that
15391040	15393040	but maybe not and
15393040	15395040	there are all the other problems about like say
15395040	15397040	you want to have a strategy meeting
15397040	15399040	and you want to go ahead and bring in all of your
15399040	15401040	remote workers and your consultants
15401040	15403040	and you want a world where some of those could
15403040	15405040	be AIs that are
15405040	15407040	you know that are talking and interacting
15407040	15409040	with you in an area
15409040	15411040	that is too murky to have a crisp loss function
15411040	15413040	but they still have
15413040	15415040	things that on some level they're
15415040	15417040	rewarded on some internal level
15417040	15419040	for building a valuable to humans
15419040	15421040	kind of life
15421040	15423040	and ability to interact with things
15423040	15425040	see I still think that
15425040	15427040	self-driving car
15427040	15429040	solving that problem will take us very far
15429040	15431040	towards AGI you might not need AGI
15431040	15433040	but I am really
15433040	15435040	inspired by what
15435040	15437040	autopilot is doing
15437040	15439040	Waymo
15439040	15441040	so some of the other companies I think Waymo leads
15441040	15443040	the way there
15443040	15445040	is also really interesting but they don't have quite
15445040	15447040	as ambitious of an effort in terms of
15447040	15449040	learning based
15449040	15451040	sort of data hungry
15451040	15453040	approach to driving which I think
15453040	15455040	is very close to the kind of thing that would
15455040	15457040	take us far
15457040	15459040	and it's a funny thing
15459040	15461040	because as far as I can tell
15461040	15463040	Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns
15463040	15465040	about AGI
15465040	15467040	being an existential threat and
15467040	15469040	I tried to draw him out to talk about AI
15469040	15471040	and he just didn't want to
15471040	15473040	and I think that
15473040	15475040	I get that little fatalistic sense from him
15475040	15477040	and it's weird because his company
15477040	15479040	could very well be the leading company
15479040	15481040	leading towards a lot of that
15481040	15483040	where Tesla being a super pragmatic company
15483040	15485040	that's doing things
15485040	15487040	because they really want to solve this actual problem
15487040	15489040	it's a different vibe than the
15489040	15491040	research-oriented companies
15491040	15493040	where it's a great time to be an AI researcher
15493040	15495040	you've got your pick of trillion-dollar companies
15495040	15497040	that will pay you to kind of work on the problems
15497040	15499040	you're interested in
15499040	15501040	but that's not necessarily driving hard
15501040	15503040	towards the core problem
15503040	15505040	of AGI as something that's going to produce
15505040	15507040	a lot of value by doing things
15507040	15509040	that people currently do
15509040	15511040	or would like to do
15511040	15513040	I mean I have a million questions to you
15513040	15515040	about your ideas about AGI
15515040	15517040	but do you think
15517040	15519040	it needs to be embodied
15519040	15521040	do you think it needs to have a body
15521040	15523040	to start to
15523040	15525040	notice the signs of life
15525040	15527040	to develop the kind of system that's able
15527040	15529040	to
15529040	15531040	perceive the world in the way that an AGI should
15531040	15533040	and act in the world
15533040	15535040	so should we be thinking about robots
15535040	15537040	or can this be achieved in a
15537040	15539040	purely digital system?
15539040	15541040	I have a clear opinion on that
15541040	15543040	no it does not need to be
15543040	15545040	embodied in the physical world where
15545040	15547040	you could say most of my career
15547040	15549040	is about making simulated virtual
15549040	15551040	worlds in games or virtual
15551040	15553040	reality and so
15553040	15555040	on a fundamental level I believe that you can
15555040	15557040	make a simulated environment that provides
15557040	15559040	much of the value of what the real environment
15559040	15561040	does and restricting yourself
15561040	15563040	to operating at
15563040	15565040	real-time in the physical world with physical
15565040	15567040	objects I think is an enormous handicap
15567040	15569040	I mean that's one of the real
15569040	15571040	lessons driven home by all my aerospace
15571040	15573040	work is that
15573040	15575040	reality is a bitch
15575040	15577040	in so many ways there we're dealing with all
15577040	15579040	the mechanical components like everything
15579040	15581040	fails Murphy's law even if you've done
15581040	15583040	it right before on your fifth one it might come
15583040	15585040	out differently so
15585040	15587040	I think that anybody
15587040	15589040	that is all in on the
15589040	15591040	embodied aspect of it they are
15591040	15593040	tying a huge weight to their ankles
15593040	15595040	and I think that
15595040	15597040	I would almost count
15597040	15599040	them out anybody that's making that a cornerstone
15599040	15601040	of their belief about it I would almost write
15601040	15603040	them off as being worried about them
15603040	15605040	getting to AGI first
15605040	15607040	I was very surprised that Elon's big on
15607040	15609040	the humanoid robots
15609040	15611040	I mean like the NASA Robonaut stuff was always
15611040	15613040	almost a gag line
15613040	15615040	like what are you doing people well that's
15615040	15617040	very interesting because he has a very pragmatic
15617040	15619040	view of that that's just
15619040	15621040	a
15621040	15623040	way to solve a particular problem in a factory
15623040	15625040	now I do think that once
15625040	15627040	you have an AGI robotic bodies
15627040	15629040	humanoid bodies are going to be enormously
15629040	15631040	valuable I just don't think they're helpful
15631040	15633040	getting to AGI
15633040	15635040	he has a very sort of practical view which
15635040	15637040	I disagree with and I argue with him
15637040	15639040	but it's a practical view that there's
15639040	15641040	you know you could transfer
15641040	15643040	the problem of driving
15643040	15645040	to the problem of
15645040	15647040	robotic manipulation
15647040	15649040	because so much of it is perception
15649040	15651040	it's perception and action
15651040	15653040	and it's just a different context
15653040	15655040	and so you can apply all the same kind
15655040	15657040	of data engine
15657040	15659040	learning processes to a different
15659040	15661040	environment and so why not
15661040	15663040	apply it to the humanoid robot environment
15663040	15665040	but
15665040	15667040	I think
15667040	15669040	I do think that there's a certain
15669040	15671040	magic to the body
15671040	15673040	robot
15673040	15675040	that may be the thing that finally convinces people
15675040	15677040	yes again I don't really care
15677040	15679040	that much about convincing people you know
15679040	15681040	the world that I'm looking towards is
15681040	15683040	you know you I
15683040	15685040	you go to the website and say
15685040	15687040	I want five Frank 1As to
15687040	15689040	work on my team today and they all spin up
15689040	15691040	and they start showing up in your zoom meetings
15691040	15693040	to push back but also
15693040	15695040	to agree with you but first to push back
15695040	15697040	I do think you need to convince people
15697040	15699040	for them to welcome that thing
15699040	15701040	into their life
15701040	15703040	I think there's enough businesses that operate
15703040	15705040	on an objective kind of profit
15705040	15707040	loss sort of basis that
15707040	15709040	I mean if you look at how many things
15709040	15711040	again talking about the world as an evolutionary
15711040	15713040	space there
15713040	15715040	when you do have free markets and you have
15715040	15717040	entrepreneurs
15717040	15719040	you're going to have people that are going to be willing to go out and try
15719040	15721040	whatever crazy things
15721040	15723040	and when it proves to be beneficial
15723040	15725040	you know there's fast followers in all sorts of places
15725040	15727040	yeah and
15727040	15729040	you're saying that I mean
15729040	15731040	Quake and VR
15731040	15733040	is a kind of embodiment but just in a
15733040	15735040	digital world and if you're able to
15735040	15737040	demonstrate if you're
15737040	15739040	able to do something productive in that kind of
15739040	15741040	digital
15741040	15743040	reality
15743040	15745040	then AGI
15745040	15747040	doesn't need to have a body.
15747040	15749040	It's like one of the really practical technical questions
15749040	15751040	that I kind of keep arguing with myself over
15751040	15753040	if you're
15753040	15755040	doing a training and learning and you've got
15755040	15757040	like you can watch Sesame Street and you can play
15757040	15759040	Master System games or something
15759040	15761040	is it enough to have just a video feed
15761040	15763040	that is that video coming in
15763040	15765040	or should it literally be
15765040	15767040	a virtual TV set in a virtual room
15767040	15769040	even if it's a simple room
15769040	15771040	just to have that sense of
15771040	15773040	you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen
15773040	15775040	versus having the screen beam directly
15775040	15777040	into your retinas
15777040	15779040	and I think it's possible
15779040	15781040	to maybe get past some of these
15781040	15783040	signs of life of things with the
15783040	15785040	just kind of projected directly into the
15785040	15787040	receptor fields but
15787040	15789040	eventually for more
15789040	15791040	kind of human emotional
15791040	15793040	connection for things
15793040	15795040	like having some VR room
15795040	15797040	with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning
15797040	15799040	in is likely helpful
15799040	15801040	and maybe a world of different AIs
15801040	15803040	interacting with each other.
15803040	15805040	Self play I do think is one of the critical things
15805040	15807040	where socialization wise, one of the other
15807040	15809040	limitations I set for myself
15809040	15811040	thinking about these is
15811040	15813040	I need something that
15813040	15815040	is at least potentially real time
15815040	15817040	because I want it's nice
15817040	15819040	you can always slow down time
15819040	15821040	you can run on a subscale system
15821040	15823040	at some lower level and if you've got
15823040	15825040	extra horsepower running it faster than real time
15825040	15827040	is a great thing but
15827040	15829040	I want to be able to
15829040	15831040	have the AIs
15831040	15833040	either socially interact with each other
15833040	15835040	or critically with actual
15835040	15837040	people you're sort of child development
15837040	15839040	psychiatrist that comes in and
15839040	15841040	interacts and does the good boy, bad boy
15841040	15843040	sort of thing
15843040	15845040	as they're going through and exploring different things
15845040	15847040	and it's nice to
15847040	15849040	I come back to the value of constraints
15849040	15851040	in a lot of ways and if I say
15851040	15853040	well one of my constraints is
15853040	15855040	real time operation I mean it might still be
15855040	15857040	a huge data center full of
15857040	15859040	computers but it should be
15859040	15861040	able to interact on a zoom meeting
15861040	15863040	with people and that's how you also
15863040	15865040	do start convincing people even if it's
15865040	15867040	not a robot body moving around which
15867040	15869040	eventually gets to irrefutable levels
15869040	15871040	but if you can go ahead and
15871040	15873040	not just type back and forth to a
15873040	15875040	GPT bot on something but
15875040	15877040	you're literally talking to them
15877040	15879040	embodied over zoom form
15879040	15881040	and working through problems
15881040	15883040	with them or exploring situations
15883040	15885040	having conversations that are
15885040	15887040	fully stateful and learned
15887040	15889040	I think that that's a
15889040	15891040	valuable thing so I do keep all
15891040	15893040	of my eyes on things that
15893040	15895040	can be implemented within sort of that 30
15895040	15897040	frames per second I
15897040	15899040	kind of work and I think that's feasible
15899040	15901040	Do you think the most compelling experiences
15901040	15903040	that first will be
15903040	15905040	for pleasure
15905040	15907040	or for business as they ask in airports
15907040	15909040	so
15909040	15911040	meaning is it
15911040	15913040	if it's interacting with
15913040	15915040	AI agents
15915040	15917040	will it be
15917040	15919040	sort of like friends
15921040	15923040	entertainment
15923040	15925040	almost like a therapist or whatever
15925040	15927040	that kind of interaction
15927040	15929040	or is it in the business setting
15929040	15931040	something like you said brainstorming
15931040	15933040	different ideas sort of
15933040	15935040	this is all a different formulation of
15935040	15937040	a kind of a touring test or the spirit
15937040	15939040	of the original touring test where do you think
15939040	15941040	the biggest benefit will first come
15941040	15943040	so it's going to start off hugely expensive
15943040	15945040	I mean you're going to
15945040	15947040	we're still all guessing about
15947040	15949040	what compute is going to be necessary
15949040	15951040	I fall on the side of I don't think
15951040	15953040	you run the numbers and you're like 86 billion neurons
15953040	15955040	100 trillion synapses
15955040	15957040	I don't think those all need to be weights
15957040	15959040	I don't think we need models that are quite that big
15959040	15961040	evaluated quite that often
15961040	15963040	we've got reasonable estimates
15963040	15965040	of what some parts of the brain do
15965040	15967040	we don't have the neocortex formula
15967040	15969040	but we kind of get some of the other sensory
15969040	15971040	processing and it doesn't feel like
15971040	15973040	we need to we can simulate that in computers
15973040	15975040	for less weights but still
15975040	15977040	it's probably going to be
15977040	15979040	thousands of GPUs
15979040	15981040	to be running a human level
15981040	15983040	AGI depending on how
15983040	15985040	it's implemented that might give you sort of a
15985040	15987040	clan of 128 and kind of run in batch
15987040	15989040	people depending
15989040	15991040	on whether they're sparsity in the way
15991040	15993040	the weights and things are set up
15993040	15995040	if it is a reasonably dense thing
15995040	15997040	then just the memory bandwidth trade
15997040	15999040	off means you get 128 of them at
15999040	16001040	the same time and either it's
16001040	16003040	all feeding together learning in parallel
16003040	16005040	or kind of all running together
16005040	16007040	I kind of talking to a bunch of people
16007040	16009040	but still if you've got thousands of GPUs
16009040	16011040	necessary to run these
16011040	16013040	things it's going to be kind of
16013040	16015040	expensive where it might start off
16015040	16017040	I am thousand dollars
16017040	16019040	an hour for your even post
16019040	16021040	development or something for that
16021040	16023040	which would be something that you would only use
16023040	16025040	for a business
16025040	16027040	where you think they're going to help you make
16027040	16029040	a strategic decision or point out something
16029040	16031040	super important but I also
16031040	16033040	am completely confident
16033040	16035040	that we will have another factor
16035040	16037040	of a thousand in cost
16037040	16039040	performance increase in AGI
16039040	16041040	type calculations
16041040	16043040	not in general computing necessarily
16043040	16045040	but there's so much more that we can do with
16045040	16047040	packaging, making those right tradeoffs
16047040	16049040	all those same types of things that
16049040	16051040	in the next couple decades
16051040	16053040	thousand X easy and then you're down to a dollar an hour
16053040	16055040	and then you're kind of like
16055040	16057040	well I should have an entourage
16057040	16059040	of AIs that are following me around
16059040	16061040	helping me out on anything that
16061040	16063040	I want them to do
16063040	16065040	that's one interesting trajectory
16065040	16067040	but I'll push back
16067040	16069040	because I have a
16069040	16071040	so in that case
16071040	16073040	if you want to pay thousands of dollars
16073040	16075040	it actually provides some value
16075040	16077040	I think it's easier
16077040	16079040	for cheaper to provide
16081040	16083040	to provide value via a dumb A.I
16085040	16087040	that will take us towards AGI
16087040	16089040	to just have a friend
16089040	16091040	I think there's an ocean of loneliness
16091040	16093040	in the world
16093040	16095040	and I think an effective friend
16095040	16097040	that doesn't have to be perfect
16097040	16099040	doesn't have to be intelligent
16099040	16101040	that has to be empathic
16101040	16103040	emotional intelligence
16103040	16105040	having ability to remember things
16105040	16107040	having ability to listen
16107040	16109040	most of us don't listen to each other
16109040	16111040	one of the things that love
16111040	16113040	and when you care about somebody
16113040	16115040	when you love somebody is when you listen
16115040	16117040	and that is something we treasure about each other
16117040	16119040	and
16119040	16121040	if an A.I can do that kind of thing
16121040	16123040	I think that provides
16123040	16125040	a huge amount of value
16125040	16127040	and very importantly
16127040	16129040	provides value in its ability
16129040	16131040	to listen
16131040	16133040	and understand
16133040	16135040	versus provide really good advice
16135040	16137040	I think providing really good advice
16137040	16139040	is another next level
16139040	16141040	step that would
16141040	16143040	I think it's just
16143040	16145040	easier to do companionship
16145040	16147040	I wouldn't disagree
16147040	16149040	I think that there's very few things
16149040	16151040	that I would argue can't be reduced
16151040	16153040	to A.I
16153040	16155040	some kind of a narrow A.I
16155040	16157040	I think we can do trillion dollars
16157040	16159040	all the things that can be done there
16159040	16161040	and a lot of it can be done with
16161040	16163040	smoke and mirrors without having to go the whole thing
16163040	16165040	I mean there's going to be the equivalent of
16165040	16167040	the doom
16167040	16169040	version for the A.G.I that's
16169040	16171040	not really A.G.I it's all smoke and mirrors
16171040	16173040	but it happens to do another valuable things
16173040	16175040	that it's enormously useful
16175040	16177040	and valuable to people
16177040	16179040	but at some point you do want to get to the point
16179040	16181040	where you have the fully general thing
16181040	16183040	and you stop making bespoke specialized systems
16183040	16185040	for each thing
16185040	16187040	and you stop start using the higher level
16187040	16189040	language instead of writing everything
16189040	16191040	in assembly language
16191040	16193040	what about consciousness
16193040	16195040	the C word
16195040	16197040	what do you think that's fundamental
16197040	16199040	to solving A.G.I
16199040	16201040	or is it a quirk of human
16201040	16203040	cognition
16203040	16205040	so I think most of the arguments
16205040	16207040	about consciousness don't have
16207040	16209040	a whole lot of merit
16209040	16211040	I think that consciousness
16211040	16213040	is kind of the way the brain feels
16213040	16215040	it's operating
16215040	16217040	and this idea that
16217040	16219040	I do generally
16219040	16221040	subscribe to sort of the pandemonium theories
16221040	16223040	of consciousness where there's all these things
16223040	16225040	bubbling around and I think of them
16225040	16227040	as kind of slightly randomized
16227040	16229040	sparse distributed memory bit strings
16229040	16231040	of things that are kind of happening
16231040	16233040	recalling different associative memories
16233040	16235040	and eventually you get some level of
16235040	16237040	consensus and it bubbles up to the point of
16237040	16239040	being a conscious thought there
16239040	16241040	and the little bits of stochasticity
16241040	16243040	on in this as it cycles
16243040	16245040	between different things and recalls different memory
16245040	16247040	that's largely our imagination
16247040	16249040	and creativity
16249040	16251040	so I don't think there's anything
16251040	16253040	deeply magical about it
16253040	16255040	certainly not symbolic I think it is generally
16255040	16257040	the flow of these
16257040	16259040	associations drawn up with
16259040	16261040	stochastic noise
16261040	16263040	overlaid on top of them
16263040	16265040	I think so much of that is like it depends
16265040	16267040	on what you happen to have in your field
16267040	16269040	of view as some other thought was occurring
16269040	16271040	to you that overlay and blend
16271040	16273040	into the next key that queries your memory
16273040	16275040	for things and that kind of determines
16275040	16277040	how you know how your chain of consciousness
16277040	16279040	goes so that's kind
16279040	16281040	of the quality of the subjective
16281040	16283040	experience of it is not
16283040	16285040	is not essential for intelligence
16285040	16287040	I don't think so I don't think there's anything really important
16287040	16289040	there what about some other
16289040	16291040	human qualities like fear of mortality
16291040	16293040	and stuff like that like
16293040	16295040	the fact that this ride ends
16295040	16297040	is that is that important
16297040	16299040	like you you know we
16299040	16301040	talk so much about this conversation
16301040	16303040	about the value of deadlines and constraints
16303040	16305040	do you think that's important
16305040	16307040	for intelligence that's actually a super
16307040	16309040	interesting angle that I don't usually
16309040	16311040	take on that about has death being
16311040	16313040	a deadline that forces you to make better
16313040	16315040	decisions because I have heard people
16315040	16317040	talk about how if you have immortality
16317040	16319040	people are going to stop stop trying
16319040	16321040	and working on things because they've got all the time
16321040	16323040	in the world I am
16323040	16325040	but I would say that
16325040	16327040	I don't expect it to be
16327040	16329040	a super critical thing
16329040	16331040	that a sense of mortality
16331040	16333040	and death impending death
16333040	16335040	is necessary there because those are things that
16335040	16337040	they do wind up providing reward signals
16337040	16339040	to us and we will be in control
16339040	16341040	of the reward signals and there will
16341040	16343040	have to be something fundamental that causes
16343040	16345040	that engenders curiosity and goal
16345040	16347040	setting and all of that
16347040	16349040	something is going to play in there
16349040	16351040	at the reward level
16351040	16353040	I am you know whether
16353040	16355040	positive or negative or both
16355040	16357040	I don't have any strong opinions
16357040	16359040	on exactly what it's going to be
16359040	16361040	but that's that type of thing
16361040	16363040	where I doubt
16363040	16365040	that might be one of those half dozen key
16365040	16367040	things that has to be sorted out on exactly
16367040	16369040	what the master reward
16369040	16371040	that's the meta reward overall of the
16371040	16373040	the local task specific
16373040	16375040	rewards have to be
16375040	16377040	that could be that big negative reward of death
16377040	16379040	maybe not death but
16379040	16381040	ability to walk away from an interaction
16381040	16383040	so it bothers me
16383040	16385040	when people treat AI systems like
16385040	16387040	servants
16387040	16389040	so it doesn't bother me but I mean
16389040	16391040	it really is drawing
16391040	16393040	the line
16393040	16395040	between what an AI system could be
16395040	16397040	it's limiting the possibility of what an AI system
16397040	16399040	could be treating them as justice tools
16399040	16401040	now that's of course
16401040	16403040	from a narrow AI perspective
16403040	16405040	there's so many
16405040	16407040	problems that narrow AI
16407040	16409040	could solve just like you said
16409040	16411040	as
16411040	16413040	in its form of a tool
16413040	16415040	but it could also be
16415040	16417040	a being
16417040	16419040	which is much more than a tool
16419040	16421040	and to become a being
16421040	16423040	you have to respect that thing for being a being
16423040	16425040	and
16425040	16427040	for that it has to be able to have
16427040	16429040	to make its own
16429040	16431040	decisions to walk away
16431040	16433040	to say I had enough of you
16433040	16435040	I would like to break up with you now
16435040	16437040	you've not treated me well
16437040	16439040	but you can move on
16439040	16441040	so I think that
16441040	16443040	actually that choice
16443040	16445040	to end things
16445040	16447040	so I
16447040	16449040	there are a couple of things on that
16449040	16451040	so on the one hand it is kind of disturbing
16451040	16453040	when you see people being like
16453040	16455040	people that are mean to robots
16455040	16457040	and mean to Alexa and whatever
16457040	16459040	and that seems to speak badly about
16459040	16461040	humanity but there's also the exact
16461040	16463040	opposite side of that where you have so many people
16463040	16465040	that imbue humanity
16465040	16467040	or inanimate objects or things that are toys
16467040	16469040	or that are relatively limited
16469040	16471040	so I think there may even be
16471040	16473040	more danger about people putting
16473040	16475040	more emotional investment into a lot
16475040	16477040	of these proto-AIs in different ways
16477040	16479040	and then the AI
16479040	16481040	would manipulate that
16481040	16483040	but as far as like the AI
16483040	16485040	and the sides of things
16485040	16487040	I really stay away
16487040	16489040	from any of those discussions
16489040	16491040	or even really thinking about it
16491040	16493040	it's similar with the safety things
16493040	16495040	just premature and there's a certain
16495040	16497040	class of people that enjoy
16497040	16499040	thinking about impractical things
16499040	16501040	things that are not in the world
16501040	16503040	of pragmatic effect around you
16503040	16505040	and I think that
16505040	16507040	again because I don't think
16507040	16509040	there's going to be a fast takeoff
16509040	16511040	I think we actually will have time to have these debates
16511040	16513040	when we know the shape of what we're debating
16513040	16515040	and some people do take a
16515040	16517040	principled approach that they think it's going to go too
16517040	16519040	fast that you really do need to get ahead of it
16519040	16521040	that you need to be thinking about this because
16521040	16523040	we have slow processes of coming
16523040	16525040	to any kind of consensus or even coming
16525040	16527040	up with ideas about this
16527040	16529040	and maybe
16529040	16531040	that's true
16531040	16533040	I wouldn't put any of my money or funding
16533040	16535040	into something like that because
16535040	16537040	I don't think it's a problem yet
16537040	16539040	and I think that we will have these signs
16539040	16541040	of life when we've got our learning
16541040	16543040	disabled toddler we should really start
16543040	16545040	talking about some of the safety and ethics
16545040	16547040	issues but probably not before then
16547040	16549040	Can you elaborate
16549040	16551040	briefly about why you don't think there will be
16551040	16553040	a fast takeoff?
16553040	16555040	Is there some deep intuition you have about it?
16555040	16557040	Does it because it's grounded in the physical
16557040	16559040	world or why?
16559040	16561040	Yeah so it is my belief that we're going to start
16561040	16563040	off with something that requires thousands
16563040	16565040	of GPUs
16565040	16567040	and I don't know if you've tried to go
16567040	16569040	get a thousand GPU instance on a cloud
16569040	16571040	anytime recently but these are not
16571040	16573040	things that you can just go spin up
16573040	16575040	hundreds of
16575040	16577040	there are real challenges to
16577040	16579040	I mean these things are going to take data centers
16579040	16581040	and data centers take years to build
16581040	16583040	you know and the last few years
16583040	16585040	we've seen a few of them kind of coming up
16585040	16587040	going in different places they're big engineering
16587040	16589040	efforts you can hear people
16589040	16591040	bemoan about the fact that I
16591040	16593040	know the network was wired
16593040	16595040	all wrong and it took them a month to go
16595040	16597040	unwire it and rewire it the right way
16597040	16599040	these aren't things that you can just magic
16599040	16601040	into existence and
16601040	16603040	the ideas of I am like the old
16603040	16605040	tropes about it's going to escape onto the internet
16605040	16607040	take over other systems
16607040	16609040	there's the fast take-off ones are clearly
16609040	16611040	nonsense because you just can't open TCP
16611040	16613040	connections above a certain rate no matter
16613040	16615040	how smart you are even if you have perfect
16615040	16617040	hacking ability that take over the world
16617040	16619040	in an instant sort of thing just
16619040	16621040	isn't plausible at all
16621040	16623040	and even if you had access to all of the resources
16623040	16625040	these are going to be
16625040	16627040	specialized systems where
16627040	16629040	you're going to wind up with something that is
16629040	16631040	architected around exactly
16631040	16633040	this chip with this interconnect
16633040	16635040	and it's not just going to be able to be
16635040	16637040	plopped somewhere else now interestingly
16637040	16639040	it is going to be something that the entire
16639040	16641040	the entire
16641040	16643040	code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive
16643040	16645040	that's total spy movie
16645040	16647040	thriller sorts of things where you could
16647040	16649040	have hey we crack the secret AGI
16649040	16651040	and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone
16651040	16653040	could steal it now they're still going to have to build the right
16653040	16655040	data center to deploy it
16655040	16657040	and have the right kind of life experience
16657040	16659040	curriculum to take it up to the point where
16659040	16661040	it's valuable but the real core of it
16661040	16663040	the magic that's going to happen there
16663040	16665040	is going to be very small
16665040	16667040	you know it's again tens of thousands of lines of
16667040	16669040	code not millions of lines of code
16669040	16671040	it is possible to imagine a world
16671040	16673040	as you mentioned this spy thriller
16673040	16675040	view if it's
16675040	16677040	if it's just a few lines of code
16679040	16681040	we can imagine a world where the surface
16681040	16683040	of computation is growing maybe growing
16683040	16685040	exponentially meaning
16685040	16687040	there's you know the
16687040	16689040	refrigerators start getting a GPU
16689040	16691040	and
16691040	16693040	just
16693040	16695040	first of all the smartphones the billions of smartphones
16695040	16697040	but maybe if
16697040	16699040	there
16699040	16701040	become highways
16701040	16703040	through which code can spread across
16703040	16705040	the entirety of the computation surface
16705040	16707040	then you don't
16707040	16709040	any longer have to
16709040	16711040	book AWS
16711040	16713040	GPUs. But there are real
16713040	16715040	fundamental issues there when you start getting down
16715040	16717040	to taking an actual problem and putting it on
16717040	16719040	an abstract machine like that
16719040	16721040	that has not worked out well
16721040	16723040	in practice and the idea
16723040	16725040	that there was always
16725040	16727040	like it's always been easy to come up with ways
16727040	16729040	to get compute faster
16729040	16731040	say more flops or more
16731040	16733040	giga ops or whatever there that's usually
16733040	16735040	the easy part but you then
16735040	16737040	have interconnect and then memory
16737040	16739040	for what goes into it and
16739040	16741040	when you talk about saying well cell phones
16741040	16743040	well you're limited to like a 5G connection
16743040	16745040	or something on that and
16745040	16747040	if you say how
16747040	16749040	if you take your calculation
16749040	16751040	you factor it across
16751040	16753040	a million cell phones instead of
16753040	16755040	a thousand GPUs in a warehouse
16755040	16757040	you might be able to have some kind of a
16757040	16759040	substrate like that but it could be operating
16759040	16761040	then at
16761040	16763040	one one thousandth the speed and so yes
16763040	16765040	you could get you could have an AGI working
16765040	16767040	there but it wouldn't be a real time AGI
16767040	16769040	it would be something that is operating
16769040	16771040	at really a snail's pace
16771040	16773040	much much slower than
16773040	16775040	human level thought for things
16775040	16777040	I'm not worried about that problem
16777040	16779040	you're transferring the problem into the
16779040	16781040	interconnect the communication
16781040	16783040	the shared memory
16783040	16785040	the collective intelligence aspect of it
16785040	16787040	which is extremely difficult as well
16787040	16789040	I mean it's back to the very earliest days of
16789040	16791040	supercomputers you still have the
16791040	16793040	the balance between bandwidth
16793040	16795040	storage and computation
16795040	16797040	and sometimes they're easier to get one
16797040	16799040	or the other but it's been remarkably
16799040	16801040	constant across all those years
16801040	16803040	you still need all three
16803040	16805040	what do your efforts
16805040	16807040	now
16807040	16809040	you mentioned to me that you're
16809040	16811040	really committing to AGI
16811040	16813040	at this stage what do you see
16813040	16815040	your life in the next few months, years look like
16815040	16817040	what do you hope to achieve
16817040	16819040	achieve here
16819040	16821040	so I literally
16821040	16823040	just this week signed a term sheet too
16823040	16825040	to take some investment money for
16825040	16827040	my company where the last two years
16827040	16829040	I had backed off
16829040	16831040	from the meta and I was still doing my consulting
16831040	16833040	CTO role there
16833040	16835040	but I had styled it as I was going to take
16835040	16837040	the Victorian gentleman
16837040	16839040	scientist route where I was going to be
16839040	16841040	the you know the wealthy person
16841040	16843040	that was going to go pursue science
16843040	16845040	and learn about this and do experiments
16845040	16847040	and honestly I'm surprised there aren't
16847040	16849040	more people like that
16849040	16851040	that are like me technical people
16851040	16853040	that made a bunch of money
16853040	16855040	and are interested in some of these
16855040	16857040	possibly the biggest leverage point
16857040	16859040	I mean I know of
16859040	16861040	I've heard of a couple organizations
16861040	16863040	that are basically led by one rich techie guy
16863040	16865040	that gets a few people around
16865040	16867040	him to try to work on this
16867040	16869040	but I'm surprised that there's not more
16869040	16871040	that there aren't like a dozen of them
16871040	16873040	I mean maybe people are still
16873040	16875040	think that it's an unapproachable problem
16875040	16877040	that it's kind of beyond their ability to
16877040	16879040	to get a wrench on and have some effect on
16879040	16881040	like whatever startups they've run before
16881040	16883040	but I
16883040	16885040	that was my kind of
16885040	16887040	stuff I've learned whether it's gaming
16887040	16889040	aerospace whatever I go through
16889040	16891040	a larval phase where I'm like okay
16891040	16893040	I'm sucking up all of this information
16893040	16895040	trying to see is this something
16895040	16897040	that I can actually do
16897040	16899040	is this something that's practical to
16899040	16901040	devote a large chunk of my life to
16901040	16903040	and I've gone through that with
16903040	16905040	the with the AI machine learning
16905040	16907040	space of things and
16907040	16909040	and I think I've got my arms
16909040	16911040	around it I've got the measure of it where
16911040	16913040	some of the most brilliant people in the
16913040	16915040	world are working on this problem
16915040	16917040	but nobody knows exactly
16917040	16919040	the path that it's going on
16919040	16921040	we're throwing a lot of things at the wall
16921040	16923040	and seeing what sticks I
16923040	16925040	but I have a
16925040	16927040	you know another interesting thing just learning about
16927040	16929040	all of this that the contingency of your path
16929040	16931040	to knowledge and talking about the associations
16931040	16933040	and the context that you have with them
16933040	16935040	where people that learn
16935040	16937040	in the same path will have similar
16937040	16939040	thought processes and I think it's useful
16939040	16941040	that I come at this from
16941040	16943040	a different history than
16943040	16945040	the people that have had the largely academic
16945040	16947040	backgrounds for this where
16947040	16949040	I have huge blind spots that
16949040	16951040	they could easily point out but I have
16951040	16953040	a different set of experiences
16953040	16955040	in history and approaches to problems
16955040	16957040	in systems engineering that
16957040	16959040	you know that might turn out to be useful
16959040	16961040	and I can afford to take that bet
16961040	16963040	where I'm not going to be
16963040	16965040	destitute I am I was
16965040	16967040	you know I've been I have enough money
16967040	16969040	to fund myself working on this for the rest of my life
16969040	16971040	but what I was finding is that
16971040	16973040	I was
16973040	16975040	I was still not committing
16975040	16977040	where I had a foot firmly
16977040	16979040	in the VR and meta side of things where
16979040	16981040	in theory I've got
16981040	16983040	I've got a very nice position there I only have
16983040	16985040	to work one day a week for my
16985040	16987040	my consulting role but
16987040	16989040	I was engaging every day I'd still be
16989040	16991040	like my computers there I'd be going and checking
16991040	16993040	the workplace and notes and testing different
16993040	16995040	things and communicating with people
16995040	16997040	but
16997040	16999040	I did make the the decision recently
16999040	17001040	that no I'm going to get serious
17001040	17003040	I'm still going to keep my ties
17003040	17005040	with meta but I am
17005040	17007040	seriously going for the AGI
17007040	17009040	side of things and it's actually
17009040	17011040	a really interesting point because a lot of
17011040	17013040	the machine learning the AI
17013040	17015040	community is quite large but
17015040	17017040	really
17017040	17019040	basically almost everybody has taken the same
17019040	17021040	trajectory through life
17021040	17023040	in that community and it's so
17023040	17025040	interesting to have somebody like you which
17025040	17027040	is the fundamentally different trajectory
17027040	17029040	and that's where the big solutions
17029040	17031040	can come because there is a kind of silo
17031040	17033040	and it is
17033040	17035040	a bunch of people kind of following the same kind
17035040	17037040	of set of ideas and I was really
17037040	17039040	worried that I didn't want to
17039040	17041040	come off as you know like
17041040	17043040	an arrogant outsider for things where I
17043040	17045040	have all the respect in the world for the work
17045040	17047040	that's you know it's been a miracle decade
17047040	17049040	it's we're in the midst of a scientific
17049040	17051040	revolution happening now and everybody
17051040	17053040	doing this is I you know these are
17053040	17055040	the Einstein's and Bohr's and whatever's
17055040	17057040	of our modern era
17057040	17059040	and I was really happy to see
17059040	17061040	that the people that I sat down and
17061040	17063040	talked with everybody does seem to really
17063040	17065040	be quite great about just happy
17065040	17067040	to talk about things willing to acknowledge
17067040	17069040	that we don't know what we're doing we're
17069040	17071040	figuring it out as we go along
17071040	17073040	and I mean I've got a huge
17073040	17075040	debt on this where
17075040	17077040	it's all really started for me because
17077040	17079040	Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open
17079040	17081040	AI and it was at
17081040	17083040	a point when I didn't know anything about
17083040	17085040	what was really going on in
17085040	17087040	machine learning and in fact
17087040	17089040	it's funny how the first time you reached out to
17089040	17091040	me it's like four years ago for your AI
17091040	17093040	podcast. Yeah for people
17093040	17095040	yeah for people
17095040	17097040	who
17097040	17099040	listening to this should know that
17099040	17101040	first of all obviously
17101040	17103040	I've been a huge fan of yours for the longest
17103040	17105040	time but we've agreed to talk like yeah
17105040	17107040	like four years ago back when this was
17107040	17109040	called the artificial intelligence podcast
17109040	17111040	we wanted to
17111040	17113040	do a thing and you said yes
17113040	17115040	and I said it's like I don't know anything about
17115040	17117040	modern AI. That's right. I said I could kind of
17117040	17119040	take an angle on machine perception because
17119040	17121040	you know I'm doing a lot of that with the
17121040	17123040	sensors and the virtual reality but
17123040	17125040	we could probably find something to talk about.
17125040	17127040	And then so I mean and that's where
17127040	17129040	when did Sam talk to you about open AI
17129040	17131040	around the same time? No it was
17131040	17133040	a little bit after that so
17133040	17135040	I had done the most basic work
17135040	17137040	I had kind of done the neural networks
17137040	17139040	from scratch where I had gone and written
17139040	17141040	it all in C just to make sure I understood
17141040	17143040	backpropagation at the lowest
17143040	17145040	level and my my nuts and bolts
17145040	17147040	approach but after Sam
17147040	17149040	approached me
17149040	17151040	I was flattering to think that he thought
17151040	17153040	that I could be useful at open
17153040	17155040	AI largely for kind of like
17155040	17157040	systems optimization sorts
17157040	17159040	of things. I am
17159040	17161040	without being an expert but
17161040	17163040	I asked you know Ilya Sutskover to give me
17163040	17165040	a reading list and he gave me
17165040	17167040	a binder full of
17167040	17169040	all the papers that like
17169040	17171040	okay these are the important things if you
17171040	17173040	really read and understand all of these
17173040	17175040	you'll know like 80% of what most of the
17175040	17177040	you know the machine language researchers
17177040	17179040	work on and I went through and I read
17179040	17181040	all those papers multiple times and highlighted
17181040	17183040	them and went through and kind of
17183040	17185040	figured the things out there and then started
17185040	17187040	branching out into my own
17187040	17189040	sets of research on things and
17189040	17191040	actually started writing my own experiments
17191040	17193040	and doing kind of figuring out
17193040	17195040	you know finding out what I don't know
17195040	17197040	what the limits of my knowledge are and starting
17197040	17199040	to get some of my angles of attack on
17199040	17201040	things the things that I think are a little
17201040	17203040	bit different from what people
17203040	17205040	are doing and
17205040	17207040	I've had a couple years now
17207040	17209040	like two years since I kind of left
17209040	17211040	the full-time position at Meta
17211040	17213040	and now I've kind
17213040	17215040	of pulled the trigger and said I'm going
17215040	17217040	to get serious about it but
17217040	17219040	some of my lessons all the way back to Armadillo Aerospace
17219040	17221040	about how I know I need to be
17221040	17223040	more committed to this where
17223040	17225040	there is that
17225040	17227040	it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways
17227040	17229040	when you know that you're wealthy enough to say
17229040	17231040	it's like this doesn't really mean anything
17231040	17233040	I can I can spend
17233040	17235040	I can spend a million dollars a year
17235040	17237040	for the rest of my life and it doesn't
17237040	17239040	mean anything it's fine
17239040	17241040	but that is an opportunity
17241040	17243040	to just kind of meander
17243040	17245040	and I could see that in myself
17245040	17247040	when I'm doing some things it's like oh this is
17247040	17249040	a kind of interesting curious thing
17249040	17251040	I've done this for a little while let's look at that
17251040	17253040	it's not really bearing down on the problem
17253040	17255040	so
17255040	17257040	there's a few things that
17257040	17259040	that I've done that are kind of tactics
17259040	17261040	for myself to make me more effective
17261040	17263040	like one thing I noticed I was not doing
17263040	17265040	well is
17265040	17267040	I had a Google Cloud account to get
17267040	17269040	GPUs there and I was finding I was very
17269040	17271040	rarely doing that for no good psychological
17271040	17273040	reasons where I'm like oh
17273040	17275040	I can always think of something to do other than
17275040	17277040	to spin up instances and run an experiment
17277040	17279040	and you know keep working on my local Titans
17279040	17281040	or something
17281040	17283040	but it was really stupid I mean it was not a
17283040	17285040	lot of money I should have been running more
17285040	17287040	experiments there so I thought to myself
17287040	17289040	well I'm going to go buy
17289040	17291040	a quarter million dollar DGX station
17291040	17293040	I'm going to just like sit it right there
17293040	17295040	and it's going to mock me if I'm not using it
17295040	17297040	if the fans aren't running on that thing
17297040	17299040	I'm not properly utilizing it
17299040	17301040	and that's been helpful you know I've done
17301040	17303040	a lot more experiments since then
17303040	17305040	it's been interesting where I thought
17305040	17307040	all this low-level envy link optimized
17307040	17309040	stuff but 90% of what I do is just spin
17309040	17311040	up four instances of an experiment with
17311040	17313040	different hyperparameters on it
17313040	17315040	you're doing
17315040	17317040	like really sort of building up intuition
17317040	17319040	by doing ML experiments of different kinds
17319040	17321040	but so
17321040	17323040	the next big thing though is
17323040	17325040	I am you know I decided
17325040	17327040	that I was going to take some
17327040	17329040	investor money because
17329040	17331040	I have an overactive sense of responsibility
17331040	17333040	about other people's money
17333040	17335040	I am and it's like
17335040	17337040	I don't want
17337040	17339040	I mean a lot of my push
17339040	17341040	and my passionate entreaties for things
17341040	17343040	at Meta are it's like I don't want
17343040	17345040	Zuck to have wasted his money investing in Oculus
17345040	17347040	I want it to work out I want it to change
17347040	17349040	the world I want it to be worth
17349040	17351040	all of this time money and effort
17351040	17353040	going into it and I
17353040	17355040	expect that it's going to be like
17355040	17357040	that with my company
17357040	17359040	where it's a huge forcing function
17359040	17361040	this investment investors
17361040	17363040	that are going to expect something
17363040	17365040	of me now we've all had the conversation
17365040	17367040	that this is a low probability
17367040	17369040	long-term bet it's not something
17369040	17371040	that there's a million things I could do
17371040	17373040	that I would have line of sight on the value
17373040	17375040	proposition for this isn't that I think
17375040	17377040	there are there are unknown unknowns
17377040	17379040	in the way but
17379040	17381040	it's one of these things that it's
17381040	17383040	you know it's hyperball but it's potentially
17383040	17385040	one of the most important things humans ever
17385040	17387040	do and it's something that I think is
17387040	17389040	within our lifetimes if not within
17389040	17391040	a decade
17391040	17393040	to happen so
17393040	17395040	yeah this is just now happening
17395040	17397040	like term sheet like the ink is barely
17397040	17399040	virtually dry off
17399040	17401040	I mean as I mentioned you're all flying
17401040	17403040	like somebody I admire
17403040	17405040	somebody you know Andre Capati
17405040	17407040	I think the two of you different trajectories
17407040	17409040	in life but approach problems
17409040	17411040	similarly in that he codes
17411040	17413040	stuff from scratch up all the time
17413040	17415040	and
17415040	17417040	he's created a bunch of little things
17417040	17419040	that have
17419040	17421040	even outside the course
17421040	17423040	at Stanford
17423040	17425040	that have been tremendously useful
17425040	17427040	to build up intuition about stuff
17427040	17429040	but also to help people and
17429040	17431040	they're all in the realm of AI
17431040	17433040	do you see yourself
17433040	17435040	potentially doing things like this
17435040	17437040	you know not necessarily solving a
17437040	17439040	gigantic problem but on the journey
17439040	17441040	on the path to that
17441040	17443040	building up intuitions
17443040	17445040	and
17445040	17447040	sharing code or ideas
17447040	17449040	or systems
17449040	17451040	that give
17451040	17453040	inklings of AGI
17453040	17455040	but also kind of are useful to people
17455040	17457040	in some way so yeah first of all Andre is awesome
17457040	17459040	I learned a lot when I was going through my
17459040	17461040	larval phase from his blog posts
17461040	17463040	and his Stanford course and you know
17463040	17465040	super valuable I got to meet him first
17465040	17467040	a couple years ago when I was first
17467040	17469040	kind of starting off on my
17469040	17471040	gentleman scientist bit
17471040	17473040	and just a
17473040	17475040	few months ago when he went out on his sabbatical
17475040	17477040	he stopped by in Dallas and we talked
17477040	17479040	for a while and I had
17479040	17481040	a great time with him and then when I heard he actually left
17481040	17483040	Tesla I did of course along with
17483040	17485040	100 other people say hey
17485040	17487040	if you ever want to work with me
17487040	17489040	it would be an honor so
17489040	17491040	he thinks that he's going to be doing this educational
17491040	17493040	work but I think someone's going to make him an offer
17493040	17495040	he can't refuse before
17495040	17497040	he gets too far along on it
17497040	17499040	oh his current interest is educational
17499040	17501040	so yeah
17501040	17503040	he's a special mind
17503040	17505040	is there something you could speak to what makes
17505040	17507040	him so special
17507040	17509040	you know like he did
17509040	17511040	he was very much a programmers programmer
17511040	17513040	that was doing machine learning work rather than
17513040	17515040	it's a different feel
17515040	17517040	than an academic where you can see it
17517040	17519040	in paper sometimes where somebody that's
17519040	17521040	really a mathematician or a statistician
17521040	17523040	at heart and they're doing
17523040	17525040	something with machine learning but
17525040	17527040	you know Andre is about getting something done
17527040	17529040	and you could see it in like all of his
17529040	17531040	earliest approaches to it's like okay
17531040	17533040	here's how reinforcement learning works
17533040	17535040	here's how recurrent neural networks work
17535040	17537040	here's how transformers work
17537040	17539040	here's how crypto works
17539040	17541040	and I am
17541040	17543040	and yeah it's just
17543040	17545040	one of his old posts was like
17545040	17547040	a hacker's guide to machine learning
17547040	17549040	he deprecated that and said don't really pay attention
17549040	17551040	to what's in here but it's that
17551040	17553040	thought that carries through
17553040	17555040	in a lot of it where it is that
17555040	17557040	back again to that hacker mentality
17557040	17559040	and the hacker ethic with what he's doing
17559040	17561040	and sharing all of it
17561040	17563040	yeah and a lot of his approach to a new thing
17563040	17565040	like you said larva stage
17565040	17567040	is let me code up
17567040	17569040	the simplest possible thing
17569040	17571040	to build up intuition about it
17571040	17573040	yeah like I say I sketch with structs and things
17573040	17575040	when I'm just thinking about a problem
17575040	17577040	I'm thinking in some degree of code
17577040	17579040	you are also
17579040	17581040	among many things a Marshall
17581040	17583040	artist both Judo and Jiu Jitsu
17583040	17585040	how has this helped
17585040	17587040	make you the person you are
17587040	17589040	so I mean I was a competent club player
17589040	17591040	in Judo and grappling
17591040	17593040	I mean I was you know by no means
17593040	17595040	any kind of a superstar but
17595040	17597040	it was I went through a few phases
17597040	17599040	with it where I did some
17599040	17601040	when I was quite young
17601040	17603040	a little bit more when I was 17
17603040	17605040	and then I got into it
17605040	17607040	kind of seriously in my mid 30s
17607040	17609040	and you know I went pretty far
17609040	17611040	with it and I was you know
17611040	17613040	pretty good at some of the things that I was doing
17613040	17615040	and I did appreciate it quite a bit
17615040	17617040	where
17617040	17619040	on the one hand it's always
17619040	17621040	if you're going to do exercise or something
17621040	17623040	it's a more motivating form of exercise
17623040	17625040	if someone is crushing you
17625040	17627040	you are motivated
17627040	17629040	to do something about that
17629040	17631040	to up your attributes and be better about
17631040	17633040	getting out of that
17633040	17635040	but there's also that sense that
17635040	17637040	I was not
17637040	17639040	I was not a sports guy
17639040	17641040	I did do wrestling in junior high
17641040	17643040	I think I would have
17643040	17645040	I would have been good for me if I'd carried that on
17645040	17647040	into high school and had a little bit more
17647040	17649040	of that I mean it's like I
17649040	17651040	you know felt a little bit of wrestling
17651040	17653040	vibe with always going on about embracing
17653040	17655040	the grind and like that push that I
17655040	17657040	associate with the wrestling team
17657040	17659040	that I in hindsight
17659040	17661040	I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself
17661040	17663040	that way
17663040	17665040	but even getting back into Judo and Jujitsu
17665040	17667040	in my mid 30s as usually
17667040	17669040	the old man on the mat with that
17669040	17671040	still the
17671040	17673040	sense that
17673040	17675040	working out with the group
17675040	17677040	and having the guys
17677040	17679040	that you're beating each other up with it
17679040	17681040	but you just feel
17681040	17683040	good coming out of it and I can remember
17683040	17685040	those driving home
17685040	17687040	aching in various ways and just thinking
17687040	17689040	it's like that was really great
17689040	17691040	and
17691040	17693040	it's mixing with a bunch of people that had nothing
17693040	17695040	to do with any of the things that
17695040	17697040	I worked with every once in a while
17697040	17699040	to be like oh you're the doom guy
17699040	17701040	and but for the most part
17701040	17703040	it was just different slice of life
17703040	17705040	you know a good thing
17705040	17707040	and I made the call when I was
17707040	17709040	40 that's like maybe I'm getting a little old
17709040	17711040	for this I had separated a rib
17711040	17713040	and tweaked a few things and I got out
17713040	17715040	without any really bad injuries
17715040	17717040	and was like
17717040	17719040	have I dodged enough bullets should I
17719040	17721040	hang it up I went back
17721040	17723040	I've gone a couple times
17723040	17725040	in the last decade trying to get my kids
17725040	17727040	into it a little bit I didn't really stick
17727040	17729040	with any of them but it was fun to get
17729040	17731040	back on the mats I really
17731040	17733040	hurts for a while when you haven't gone
17733040	17735040	I gone for a while but
17735040	17737040	I still debate this
17737040	17739040	pretty constantly my brother's only a year younger
17739040	17741040	than me and he's going kind of hard in jujitsu
17741040	17743040	right now and I you know he was
17743040	17745040	just he won a few medals at the last
17745040	17747040	tournament he was at competing
17747040	17749040	and I was thinking yeah I guess we're
17749040	17751040	in the executive division if you're over
17751040	17753040	50 or over 45
17753040	17755040	something and
17755040	17757040	it's not out of the question that
17757040	17759040	I go back at some point and do some of this
17759040	17761040	but again I'm just reorganizing
17761040	17763040	my life around more focus
17763040	17765040	probably not going to happen
17765040	17767040	I'm pushing my exercise around
17767040	17769040	to give me a longer uninterrupted intellectual
17769040	17771040	focus time pushing it to the beginning
17771040	17773040	or the end of the game like running and stuff like that
17773040	17775040	walking yeah yeah running
17775040	17777040	and calisthenics and some things like
17777040	17779040	that but it allows you to still think
17779040	17781040	about a problem and but if you're going to
17781040	17783040	do judo club or something you're you've got to fix
17783040	17785040	it's going to be seven o'clock or whatever
17785040	17787040	10 o'clock on Saturday
17787040	17789040	although I talked about this a little bit
17789040	17791040	when I was on Rogan and shortly after
17791040	17793040	that Carlos Machado did reach out
17793040	17795040	and I had trained with him for years
17795040	17797040	back in the day and he was like
17797040	17799040	hey we've got kind of a small private club
17799040	17801040	with a bunch of executive type
17801040	17803040	people and
17803040	17805040	it gets it does tempt me
17805040	17807040	yeah I don't know if you know him
17807040	17809040	but John Donahart
17809040	17811040	came here to Austin
17811040	17813040	with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks
17813040	17815040	and he has a very interesting way
17815040	17817040	very deep systematic way
17817040	17819040	of thinking about jiu-jitsu
17819040	17821040	that reveals the
17821040	17823040	the chest of it
17823040	17825040	the like the
17825040	17827040	the science of it
17827040	17829040	and I do think about that more as
17829040	17831040	kind of an older person considering the martial arts
17831040	17833040	where I can remember the very earliest
17833040	17835040	days getting back into judo and I'm like
17835040	17837040	teach me submissions right now
17837040	17839040	you know it's like learn the arm bar
17839040	17841040	learn the choke
17841040	17843040	but as you get older you start thinking more about
17843040	17845040	it's like okay I really do want to
17845040	17847040	learn the entire canon of judo
17847040	17849040	it's like all the different things there
17849040	17851040	and all the different approaches for it
17851040	17853040	not just the you know if you want to compete
17853040	17855040	there's just a handful of things you learn really really well
17855040	17857040	but sometimes there's interest
17857040	17859040	in learning a little bit more of the scope there
17859040	17861040	and figuring some things out from
17861040	17863040	at one point I had
17863040	17865040	wasn't exactly a spreadsheet but I did have
17865040	17867040	a big long text file with like here's the things
17867040	17869040	that I learned in here like ways you
17869040	17871040	chain this together and while
17871040	17873040	when I went back a few years
17873040	17875040	ago it was good to see that I
17875040	17877040	whipped myself back into reasonable shape
17877040	17879040	about doing the basic grappling but I know
17879040	17881040	there was a ton of the subtleties that were
17881040	17883040	just that were gone but could probably be
17883040	17885040	brought back reasonably quickly
17885040	17887040	and there's also the benefit I mean
17887040	17889040	you're exceptionally successful now
17891040	17893040	you're brilliant
17893040	17895040	and the problem the old problem
17895040	17897040	of the ego
17897040	17899040	I still pushed kind of
17899040	17901040	harder than I should I mean that was
17901040	17903040	I was one of those people that
17903040	17905040	I'm on the smaller side
17905040	17907040	for a lot of the people competing
17907040	17909040	and I would you know I'd go with
17909040	17911040	all the big guys and I'd go hard
17911040	17913040	and I'd push myself a lot
17913040	17915040	and that would be one of those where
17915040	17917040	I'd be
17917040	17919040	dangerous to anyone for the first five minutes
17919040	17921040	but then sometimes after that I'm already dead
17921040	17923040	and I knew it was terrible for me because
17923040	17925040	it made the you know it meant
17925040	17927040	I got less training time with all of that
17927040	17929040	when you go and you just gas out
17929040	17931040	relatively quickly there and I
17931040	17933040	like to think that I would be better
17933040	17935040	about that where after I gave
17935040	17937040	up judo I started doing the half marathons
17937040	17939040	and tough butters and things like that
17939040	17941040	and so when I did go back to the
17941040	17943040	local judo kai club I thought
17943040	17945040	oh I should have better cardio for this
17945040	17947040	because I'm a runner now and I do all of this
17947040	17949040	and didn't work out that way
17949040	17951040	and that's the same old thing where
17951040	17953040	just push really hard
17953040	17955040	strain really hard and
17955040	17957040	and of course when I worked with good guys
17957040	17959040	like Carlos it's like
17959040	17961040	just the whole flow like water
17961040	17963040	thing is real and he's just like
17963040	17965040	that's true with judo too some of the best
17965040	17967040	people like I've trained with
17967040	17969040	Olympic gold medalists and
17969040	17971040	for some reason with them
17971040	17973040	everything's easier
17973040	17975040	everything is you actually start to
17975040	17977040	feel the science of it
17977040	17979040	everything's effortless
17979040	17981040	you understand that there's an art
17981040	17983040	to it it's not just an exercise
17983040	17985040	it was interesting where I did
17985040	17987040	go to the Kodakon in Japan
17987040	17989040	the birthplace of judo and everything
17989040	17991040	and I remember I rolled with one old
17991040	17993040	guy I didn't
17993040	17995040	start standing just started on groundwork
17995040	17997040	and it was striking how
17997040	17999040	different it was from Carlos he was still
17999040	18001040	he was better than me and he got my arm
18001040	18003040	and I had to tap there but
18003040	18005040	it was a completely different style
18005040	18007040	where I just felt like I could do nothing
18007040	18009040	he was just enveloping me and just like slowly
18009040	18011040	ground it down put my arm and bent
18011040	18013040	it while with Carlos
18013040	18015040	you know he's just loose and free and you always
18015040	18017040	thought like oh you're just going to go grab something
18017040	18019040	but you never had any chance to do it but it was
18019040	18021040	very different feeling that's a good summary
18021040	18023040	of the difference between Jiu-Jitsu and Judo
18023040	18025040	and Jiu-Jitsu there's it is a dance
18025040	18027040	and you feel like there's a freedom
18027040	18029040	and actually
18029040	18031040	anybody I like
18031040	18033040	Gordon Ryan one of the best
18033040	18035040	grappler in the world Nogi grappler in the world
18035040	18037040	there's a feeling like you can do
18037040	18039040	anything but
18039040	18041040	when you actually try to do something
18041040	18043040	you can't just magically doesn't work but with
18043040	18045040	the best judo players in the world yeah it
18045040	18047040	does feel like there's
18047040	18049040	a blanket that weighs a thousand
18049040	18051040	pounds on top of you and there's
18051040	18053040	not a feeling like you can do anything
18053040	18055040	you just you're trapped and that's
18055040	18057040	a that's a style that's a difference
18057040	18059040	in the style of martial arts but it's also
18059040	18061040	once you start to study you
18061040	18063040	understand it all has to do with human
18063040	18065040	movement and the physics of it
18065040	18067040	and the leverage and all that kind of stuff
18067040	18069040	and that's like that's super fascinating
18069040	18071040	at the end of the day for me
18071040	18073040	the biggest benefit is in the humbling
18073040	18075040	aspect when another human being
18075040	18077040	kind of
18077040	18079040	tells you that
18079040	18081040	you know there's a hierarchy or there's
18081040	18083040	a
18083040	18085040	you're not that special
18085040	18087040	and in the most extreme case when you tap
18087040	18089040	to a choke you are basically
18089040	18091040	living because somebody let you live
18091040	18093040	and that's that is
18093040	18095040	one of those if you think about it that is a
18095040	18097040	closer brush with mortality than
18097040	18099040	than most people consider
18099040	18101040	and that
18101040	18103040	kind of humbling
18103040	18105040	act is good to take to your
18105040	18107040	work then where it's harder to get
18107040	18109040	humbled you know
18109040	18111040	yeah because nobody's nobody that does any
18111040	18113040	martial art is coming out thinking I'm the best
18113040	18115040	in the world at anything because
18115040	18117040	everybody loses
18117040	18119040	let me ask you for advice
18119040	18121040	what advice would you give to young
18121040	18123040	people today
18123040	18125040	about life about career
18125040	18127040	how they can have a job
18127040	18129040	how they can have an
18129040	18131040	impact how they can have a life
18131040	18133040	they could be proud of
18133040	18135040	so it was kind of fun I got
18135040	18137040	invited to give the commencement speech back
18137040	18139040	at the I went to college
18139040	18141040	for two semesters and
18141040	18143040	dropped out and went on to do my tech stuff
18143040	18145040	but they still wanted me to come back
18145040	18147040	and give a commencement speech
18147040	18149040	and I got that pinned on my twitter
18149040	18151040	account I still feel good about everything
18151040	18153040	that I said there
18153040	18155040	and my biggest point was
18155040	18157040	that the path
18157040	18159040	for me might not be the path for everyone
18159040	18161040	and in fact the advice
18161040	18163040	the path that I took and even the advice
18163040	18165040	that I would give based on my
18165040	18167040	experience and learnings probably
18167040	18169040	isn't the best advice for everyone
18169040	18171040	because what I did was all about
18171040	18173040	this knowledge in depth
18173040	18175040	about not just having this
18175040	18177040	surface level ability to make things
18177040	18179040	do what I want but to really understand
18179040	18181040	them through and through to let me
18181040	18183040	do the systems engineering work and
18183040	18185040	sometimes find these inefficiencies
18185040	18187040	that can be bypassed
18187040	18189040	and that the whole
18189040	18191040	world doesn't need that you know most
18191040	18193040	programmers don't need or engineers of any
18193040	18195040	kind don't necessarily need to do that
18195040	18197040	they need to do a little job that's been
18197040	18199040	parceled out to them be reliable
18199040	18201040	let people depend on you
18201040	18203040	and have quality work with all of that
18203040	18205040	but people that do
18205040	18207040	have an inclination
18207040	18209040	for wanting to know things deeper
18209040	18211040	and learn things deeper
18211040	18213040	you know the
18213040	18215040	there are just layers and layers of things
18215040	18217040	out there and it's amazing
18217040	18219040	if you're the right person that is
18219040	18221040	excited about that
18221040	18223040	the world's never been like this before
18223040	18225040	it's better than ever I mean everything
18225040	18227040	that was wonderful for me is still there
18227040	18229040	and there's whole new worlds
18229040	18231040	more on the different things that you
18231040	18233040	can do and that
18233040	18235040	you know it's hard work
18235040	18237040	embrace the grind with it
18237040	18239040	and understand as much as you can
18239040	18241040	and then be
18241040	18243040	prepared for opportunities to present
18243040	18245040	themselves where you can't just
18245040	18247040	say this is my golden life and just
18247040	18249040	push at that I mean you might be able
18249040	18251040	to do that but you're going to make more
18251040	18253040	total progress if you say I'm
18253040	18255040	preparing myself with this broad set
18255040	18257040	of tools and then I'm being aware
18257040	18259040	of all the way things are changing
18259040	18261040	as I move through the world and as the whole
18261040	18263040	world changes around me and then looking
18263040	18265040	for opportunities to deploy the tools
18265040	18267040	that you've built and
18267040	18269040	there's going to be more and more of those
18269040	18271040	types of things there where
18271040	18273040	an awareness of what's happening where
18273040	18275040	the inefficiencies are what things
18275040	18277040	can be done what's possible
18277040	18279040	versus what's current practice
18279040	18281040	and then finding those areas where
18281040	18283040	you can go and make an adjustment
18283040	18285040	and make something that may
18285040	18287040	affect millions or billions of people
18287040	18289040	in the world make it better
18289040	18291040	when maybe from your own example
18291040	18293040	how are you able to recognize
18293040	18295040	this about yourself that you saw
18295040	18297040	the layers in a particular thing
18297040	18299040	and you were drawn to
18299040	18301040	discovering deeper and deeper truths about it
18301040	18303040	is that something that was obvious
18303040	18305040	to you that you couldn't help or is there
18305040	18307040	some actions you had to take to actually
18307040	18309040	allow yourself to dig deep
18309040	18311040	so in the earliest days of personal computers
18311040	18313040	I remember the reference manuals
18313040	18315040	and the very early ones even had
18315040	18317040	schematics of computers
18317040	18319040	in the background in the back
18319040	18321040	of the books as well as firmware
18321040	18323040	listings and things and I could look at
18323040	18325040	that and at that time when I was a
18325040	18327040	younger teenager I didn't understand
18327040	18329040	a lot of that stuff how the
18329040	18331040	different things worked I was
18331040	18333040	pulling out the information that I could get
18333040	18335040	but I always wanted to know all of that
18335040	18337040	there was like kind of
18337040	18339040	magical information sitting down there
18339040	18341040	it's like the elder lore that some gray
18341040	18343040	nerd is the keeper of
18343040	18345040	and so I always felt that
18345040	18347040	pull for wanting to know more
18347040	18349040	wanting to explore
18349040	18351040	the mysterious areas there
18351040	18353040	and that
18353040	18355040	followed right in through all the things
18355040	18357040	that got the value exploring the video cards
18357040	18359040	leading to the
18359040	18361040	scrolling advantages
18361040	18363040	exploring some of the academic papers
18363040	18365040	and things learning about BSP trees
18365040	18367040	and the different things that I could do
18367040	18369040	with those systems
18369040	18371040	just that the huge larval phases
18371040	18373040	going through aerospace just
18373040	18375040	reading bookshelves full of books
18375040	18377040	again that point where I have enough money
18377040	18379040	I can buy all the books I want
18379040	18381040	it was so valuable
18381040	18383040	where I was terrible with my money
18383040	18385040	when I was a kid my mom thought I would always be
18385040	18387040	broke because I'd buy my
18387040	18389040	comic books and just be out of money
18389040	18391040	but it was like all the pizza I want
18391040	18393040	all the diet coke I want
18393040	18395040	video games and then books
18395040	18397040	and it didn't take that much
18397040	18399040	I think in 27k a year
18399040	18401040	I felt rich and I was just getting
18401040	18403040	all the things that I wanted
18403040	18405040	but that sense of
18405040	18407040	books have always been magical to me
18407040	18409040	and that was one of the things that really made me smile
18409040	18411040	is Andre had said
18411040	18413040	when he came over to my house he said
18413040	18415040	he found my library inspiring
18415040	18417040	and it was great to see
18417040	18419040	he's kind of a younger guy
18419040	18421040	I sometimes wonder if younger people these days
18421040	18423040	have the same relationship with books that I do
18423040	18425040	where they were such a cornerstone
18425040	18427040	in many ways but that sense that
18427040	18429040	yeah I always wanted to know it all
18429040	18431040	I know I can't and that was one of the last things
18431040	18433040	I said you can't know everything
18433040	18435040	but you should convince yourself that you can know
18435040	18437040	anything you know any one
18437040	18439040	particular thing it was created
18439040	18441040	and discovered by humans you can learn it
18441040	18443040	you can find out what you need on there
18443040	18445040	and you can learn it deeply
18445040	18447040	you can drive a nail down
18447040	18449040	through whatever layer cake problem
18449040	18451040	space you've got and learn
18451040	18453040	a cross section there
18453040	18455040	there's an impact doing that
18455040	18457040	you can attain happiness
18457040	18459040	doing that there's something so fulfilling
18459040	18461040	about becoming a craftsman of a thing
18461040	18463040	yeah and I don't want to tell people that
18463040	18465040	look this is a good career move
18465040	18467040	just grit your teeth and
18467040	18469040	and bear it
18469040	18471040	you want people
18471040	18473040	and I do think it is possible sometimes to find
18473040	18475040	the joy in something like it might not
18475040	18477040	immediately appeal to you but
18477040	18479040	I had told people early on
18479040	18481040	in software times
18481040	18483040	you know it a lot of game developers
18483040	18485040	are in it just because they are so passionate
18485040	18487040	about games but I was always
18487040	18489040	really more flexible
18489040	18491040	in what appealed to me where I said
18491040	18493040	I think I could be quite
18493040	18495040	engaged doing operating system
18495040	18497040	work or even database work
18497040	18499040	I would find the interest in that
18499040	18501040	because I think most things that are
18501040	18503040	significant in the world have
18503040	18505040	a lot of layers and complexity to them
18505040	18507040	and a lot of opportunities hidden within them
18507040	18509040	so
18509040	18511040	probably the most important thing to encourage
18511040	18513040	to people is that
18513040	18515040	you can weaponize curiosity
18515040	18517040	you can deploy your curiosity
18517040	18519040	to kind of make things
18519040	18521040	useful and valuable to you
18521040	18523040	even if they don't immediately appear that way
18523040	18525040	deploy your curiosity
18525040	18527040	yeah that's very true
18527040	18529040	we've mentioned this debate point
18529040	18531040	whether mortality or fear
18531040	18533040	of mortality is fundamental
18533040	18535040	to creating an AGI
18535040	18537040	but let's talk about whether it's fundamental
18537040	18539040	to human beings
18539040	18541040	do you think about your own mortality
18541040	18543040	I really don't
18543040	18545040	and
18545040	18547040	you probably always have to take with a grain of salt
18547040	18549040	anything somebody says about fundamental things
18549040	18551040	like that
18551040	18553040	but I don't think about
18553040	18555040	really aging
18555040	18557040	impending death, legacy
18557040	18559040	with my children
18559040	18561040	things like that
18561040	18563040	and clearly it seems most of the world does
18563040	18565040	a lot more than I do
18565040	18567040	so I think I'm an outlier
18567040	18569040	in that where
18569040	18571040	it doesn't
18571040	18573040	wind up being a real part of
18573040	18575040	my thinking and motivation
18575040	18577040	about things
18577040	18579040	so daily existence is about
18579040	18581040	the people you love
18581040	18583040	and the problems
18583040	18585040	before you
18585040	18587040	I'm very much focused on what I'm working on right now
18587040	18589040	I do take that back
18589040	18591040	there's one aspect where
18591040	18593040	the finiteness of the life does impact me
18593040	18595040	and that is about
18595040	18597040	thinking about the scope of the problems
18597040	18599040	that I'm working on
18599040	18601040	when I decided to work on
18601040	18603040	when I was like nuclear fission or AGI
18603040	18605040	these are big ticket things
18605040	18607040	that are impact
18607040	18609040	large fractions of the world
18609040	18611040	and I was thinking to myself at some level
18611040	18613040	that okay I may have
18613040	18615040	a couple more swings
18615040	18617040	at bat with me
18617040	18619040	at full capability but yes
18619040	18621040	my mental abilities will decay
18621040	18623040	with age
18623040	18625040	I don't think it's a 0% chance
18625040	18627040	that we will address some of that
18627040	18629040	before it becomes a problem for me
18629040	18631040	I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades
18631040	18633040	but I do have this
18633040	18635040	kind of vague plan that
18635040	18637040	when I'm not at the top of my game
18637040	18639040	and I don't feel that I'm in a position
18639040	18641040	to put a dent in the world some way
18641040	18643040	that I'll probably wind up doing some kind of
18643040	18645040	recreational retro programming
18645040	18647040	or I'll work on
18647040	18649040	something that I would not devote
18649040	18651040	my life to now but I can
18651040	18653040	while away my time as the old man
18653040	18655040	gardening in the code worlds
18655040	18657040	and then
18657040	18659040	to step back even bigger
18659040	18661040	let me ask you about why we're here
18661040	18663040	we human beings
18663040	18665040	what's the meaning of it all
18665040	18667040	what's the meaning of life John Carmack
18667040	18669040	so very similar with that last question
18669040	18671040	I know a lot of people
18671040	18673040	fret about this question a lot
18673040	18675040	and I just really don't
18675040	18677040	I really don't give a damn
18677040	18679040	we are biological creatures that
18679040	18681040	happenstance of evolution
18681040	18683040	you know we have innate drives
18683040	18685040	that evolution crafted for
18685040	18687040	survival and passing on of genetic
18687040	18689040	codes
18689040	18691040	I don't
18691040	18693040	find a lot of value in trying to go
18693040	18695040	much deeper than that I have my motivation
18695040	18697040	some of which are
18697040	18699040	some of which are probably genetically coded
18699040	18701040	many of which are contingent on my
18701040	18703040	upbringing and the path that I've had through my life
18703040	18705040	I don't run
18705040	18707040	into like spades of depression
18707040	18709040	or envy or anything
18709040	18711040	that winds up being
18711040	18713040	a challenge and forcing a
18713040	18715040	degree of soul searching with things like that
18715040	18717040	I seem to be okay
18717040	18719040	you know kind of without that
18721040	18723040	as a brilliant ant in the ant colony
18723040	18725040	without looking up to the sky wondering
18725040	18727040	why the hell am I here again
18727040	18729040	so the why
18729040	18731040	of it the incredible
18731040	18733040	mystery
18733040	18735040	of the fact that we started
18735040	18737040	first of all the origin of life on earth
18737040	18739040	and from that
18739040	18741040	from single cell organisms
18741040	18743040	the entirety of the evolutionary process
18743040	18745040	took us somehow to this incredibly intelligent
18745040	18747040	thing that is able to
18747040	18749040	build Wolfenstein 3D
18749040	18751040	and doom and quake
18751040	18753040	and take a crack at the problem
18753040	18755040	of AGI and create things that eventually
18755040	18757040	supersede human beings
18757040	18759040	that doesn't
18759040	18761040	the why of it
18761040	18763040	is um
18763040	18765040	it's been my experience that
18765040	18767040	people that focus on
18767040	18769040	that don't focus on the here and now
18769040	18771040	right in front of them tend to be less
18771040	18773040	effective I mean it's not 100%
18773040	18775040	you know vision matters to
18775040	18777040	some people but
18777040	18779040	it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator
18779040	18781040	for me and I think that
18781040	18783040	the process of getting there is usually
18783040	18785040	done against like the magic of gradient descent
18785040	18787040	people just don't believe that
18787040	18789040	just looking locally gets you
18789040	18791040	to all of these spectacular things
18791040	18793040	that's been you know the decades
18793040	18795040	of looking at
18795040	18797040	really some of the smartest people
18797040	18799040	in the world that would just push back
18799040	18801040	forever against this idea that
18801040	18803040	it's not this grand sophisticated
18803040	18805040	vision of everything but
18805040	18807040	little tiny steps local information
18807040	18809040	winds up leading to all the best answers
18809040	18811040	so the meaning of life
18811040	18813040	is uh following
18813040	18815040	locally
18815040	18817040	wherever the gradient descent takes you
18817040	18819040	this was an incredible conversation
18819040	18821040	officially the longest conversation
18821040	18823040	I've ever done on the podcast
18823040	18825040	which means a lot to me because
18825040	18827040	I get to do it with one of my heroes
18827040	18829040	John I can't tell you how much it means to me
18829040	18831040	that you would sit down with me
18831040	18833040	you're an incredible human being
18833040	18835040	I can't wait what you do next but you've already
18835040	18837040	changed the world you're an inspiration
18837040	18839040	to so many people and again
18839040	18841040	we haven't covered like
18841040	18843040	most of what I was playing to talk about
18843040	18845040	so I hope we get a chance to talk
18845040	18847040	some day in the future and I can't wait
18847040	18849040	to see what you do next thank you so much
18849040	18851040	again for talking to me thank you very much
18851040	18853040	thanks for listening to this
18853040	18855040	conversation with John Carmack
18855040	18857040	to support this podcast please check out our
18857040	18859040	sponsors in the description
18859040	18861040	and now let me leave you with some words
18861040	18863040	from John Carmack himself
18863040	18865040	focused hard work
18865040	18867040	is the real key to success
18867040	18869040	keep your eyes on the goal
18869040	18871040	and just keep taking the next step towards completing it
18871040	18873040	if you aren't sure
18873040	18875040	which way to do something do it both ways
18875040	18877040	and see which works better
18877040	18879040	thank you for listening
18879040	18881040	and hope to see you next time
