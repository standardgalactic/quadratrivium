1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Without naming names, can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at Harvard?

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,040
Maybe in a way that tells the bigger story of the struggle of young, bright minds that

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:23,340
are trying to come up with big, bold ideas within the institutions that we're talking

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,340
about?

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,840
You can start.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:40,900
In part, it starts with coffee with a couple of Croatians in the math department at MIT.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:48,560
We used to talk about music and dance and math and physics and love and all this kind

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,800
of stuff as Eastern Europeans love to and I ate it up.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,820
My friend, Gordana, who was an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduate

10
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,840
student at Harvard, said to me, I'm probably going to do a bad version of her accent.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Here we go.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,000
Eric, will I see you tomorrow at the secret seminar?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,600
And I said, what secret seminar?

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,120
Eric, don't joke.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,840
I said, I'm not used to this style of humor, Gordana.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:34,000
The secret seminar that your advisor is running, I said, what are you talking about?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,960
Your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,000
I think it was like the churned Simon's invariant.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,640
Not sure what the topic was again, but she gave me the room number and the time and she

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,320
was like not cracking a smile.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,880
I've never known her to make this kind of a joke and I thought this was crazy and I

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,680
was trying to have an advisor.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,560
I didn't want an advisor, but people said you have to have one, so I took one.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,520
And I went to this room like 15 minutes early and there was not a soul inside it.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
It was outside of the math department and it was still in the same building, the Science

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
Center at Harvard.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,040
And I sat there and I let five minutes go by, I let seven minutes go by, 10 minutes

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
go by, there's nobody.

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,480
I thought, okay, so this was all an elaborate joke.

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,280
And then like three minutes to the hour, this graduate student walks in and like sees me

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
and does a double take.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,960
And then I start to see the professors in geometry and topology start to file in.

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,640
And everybody's like very disconcerted that I'm in this room.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,960
And finally, the person who was supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,440
sees me and goes, why does it ghost?

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,040
And I realized that the secret seminar is true, that the department is conducting a

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,680
secret seminar on the exact topic that I'm interested in, not telling me about it.

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,000
And that these are the reindeer games that the Rudolphs of the department are not invited

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
to.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,400
And so then I realized, okay, I did not understand it.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,160
There's a parallel department.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:31,200
And that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which I came to understand that

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:43,360
the game that I had been sold about publication, about blind refereeing, about openness and

44
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,800
public transmission of information was all a lie.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,200
I came to understand that at the very top, there's a second system that's about closed

46
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:04,320
meetings and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,600
of us don't understand.

48
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,600
And that in large measure, that is the thing that I won't submit to.

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,040
And so when you ask me questions like, well, why wouldn't you feel good about talking to

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
your critics?

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Or why wouldn't you feel...

52
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,800
The answer is, oh, you don't know.

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,600
If you stay in a nice hotel, you don't realize that there is an entire second structure inside

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,640
of that hotel where there's usually a workers' cafe in a resort complex that isn't available

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,480
to the people who are staying in the hotel.

56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,560
And then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are parallel structures.

57
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,160
So that's what I found, which was, in essence, just the way you can stay hotels your whole

58
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,520
life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're not

59
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,800
supposed to see as the guest.

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,160
There is a second structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respect

61
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,240
to how people get dinged, how people get their grants taken away, how this person comes

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
to have that thing named after them.

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,520
And by pretending that we're not running a parallel structure, I have no patience for

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
that anymore.

65
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,960
So I got a chance to see how the game, how hardball is really played at Harvard.

66
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,400
And I'm now eager to play hardball back with the same people who played hardball with me.

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,160
Let me ask two questions on this.

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,080
So one, do you think it's possible, I call those people assholes, that's the technical

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
term.

70
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Do you think it's possible that that's just not the entire system, but a part of the

71
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
system?

72
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Sort of that there's, you can navigate, you can swim in the waters and find the groups

73
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
of people who do aspire to open this.

74
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,280
The guy who rescued my PhD was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar.

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Right, but are there people outside of this?

76
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Is he an asshole?

77
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,120
Well, yes, I was, it was a bad, no, but I'm trying to make this point, which is this isn't

78
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,640
my failure to correctly map these people.

79
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
It's yours.

80
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,720
You have a simplification that isn't going to work.

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,120
I think, okay, as long as it was the wrong term, I would say lacking of character and...

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,160
What would you have had these people do?

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,280
Why did they do this?

84
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,680
Why have a secret seminar?

85
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't understand the exact dynamics of a secret seminar, but I think the right thing

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,080
to do is to, I mean, to see individuals like you.

87
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,560
There might be a reason to have a secret seminar, but they should detect that an individual

88
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,960
like you, a brilliant mind who's thinking about certain ideas could be damaged by this.

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,440
I don't think that they see it that way.

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,200
The idea is we're going to sneak food to the children we want to survive.

91
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,360
Yeah, so that's highly problematic, and there should be people within that room.

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,360
But I'm trying to say, this is the thing, the ball that can't is thrown, but won't be caught.

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:21,000
The problem is they know that most of their children won't survive, and they can't say

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I see.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,120
Sorry to interrupt.

97
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,000
You mean that the fact that the whole system is underfunded, that they naturally have to

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
pick favorites?

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,500
They live in a world which reached steady state of some level, let's say, in the early

100
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
70s.

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,300
In that world, before that time, you have a professor like Norman Steenrod, and you'd

102
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,500
have 20 children that is graduate students, and all of them would go on to be professors,

103
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,700
and all of them would want to have 20 children.

104
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:01,660
You start taking higher and higher powers of 20, and you see that the system could not,

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,260
it's not just about money, the system couldn't survive.

106
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,620
The way it's supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhD

107
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:19,620
programs, and we should let the small number of truly top places populate mostly teaching

108
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,620
and research departments that aren't PhD producing.

109
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,500
We don't want to do that because we use PhD students as a labor force.

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,420
The whole thing has to do with growth, resources, dishonesty.

111
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,500
In that world, you see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world, the key question is where

112
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,700
are we going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out?

113
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,020
My problem was I wasn't interested in dying.

114
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,020
You clearly highlight that there's aspects of the system that are broken, but as an individual,

115
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:03,220
is your role to exit the system or just acknowledge that it's a game and win it?

116
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,180
My role is to survive and thrive in the public eye.

117
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:16,100
In other words, when you have an escapee of the system, like yourself, such as, and that

118
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,740
person says, you know, I wasn't exactly finished.

119
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,020
Let me show you a bunch of stuff.

120
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,140
Let me show you that the theory of telomeres never got reported properly.

121
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,860
Let me show you that all of marginal economics is supposed to be redone with a different

122
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,580
version of the differential calculus.

123
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,980
Let me show you that you didn't understand the self-dual Yang-Mills equations correctly

124
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:46,140
in topology and physics because they're in fact much more broadly found and it's only

125
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,900
the mutations that happen in special dimensions.

126
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,900
There are lots of things to say, but this particular group of people, like if you just

127
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,580
take, where are all the Gen X and Millennial University presidents?

128
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,820
Right.

129
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,300
Okay.

130
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,740
They're all in a holding pattern.

131
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:15,860
Now, why in the story of telomeres was it an older professor and a younger graduate student?

132
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,460
It's this issue of what would be called interference competition.

133
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,980
So, for example, orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blowholes so that

134
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,100
they suffocate because the needed resource is air.

135
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,500
Okay.

136
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,100
Well, what do the universities do?

137
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,460
They try to make sure that you can't be viable, that you need them, that you need their grants.

138
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:46,060
You need to be zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the

139
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,380
locals love to play.

140
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,660
Well, my point is, okay, what's the cost of this?

141
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,460
How many people died as a result of these interference competition games?

142
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,820
You know, when you take somebody like Douglas Prasher who did green fluorescent protein and

143
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,260
he drives a shuttle bus, right?

144
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,860
Because his grant runs out and he has to give away all of his research and all of that

145
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,980
research gets a Nobel Prize and he gets to drive a shuttle bus for $35,000 a year.

146
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,260
What do you mean by died?

147
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,700
Do you mean their career, their dreams, their passions?

148
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,020
Yeah, the whole, as an academic, Doug Prasher was dead for a long period of time.

149
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:29,180
Okay, so as a person who's escaped the system, can't you at this, because you also have in

150
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,100
your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be useful, maybe not?

151
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:35,940
Let's hope.

152
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,420
Can't you also play the game enough, like with the children?

153
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,180
So like publish and but also if you told me that this would work, really what I want to do,

154
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:55,140
you see, is I would love to revolutionize a field with an H index of zero.

155
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,900
Like we have these proxies that count how many papers you've written, how cited are the papers

156
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,420
you've written.

157
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,740
All this is nonsense.

158
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,860
That's interesting.

159
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,260
Sorry, what do you mean by a field with an H index?

160
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,700
So totally new field H index is count somehow.

161
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,060
How many papers have you gotten that get so many citations?

162
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,260
Yeah.

163
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,220
Let's say H index undefined.

164
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,980
Like for example, I don't have an advisor for my PhD, but I have to have an advisor as

165
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,660
far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks who advised whom down the line.

166
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,300
So I am my own advisor, which sets up a loop, right?

167
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,300
How many students do I have an infinite number?

168
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,980
Your descendants, they don't want to have that story.

169
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,020
So I have to be, I have to have formal advisor, Raoul bot, and my Wikipedia entry, for example,

170
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,580
says that I was advised by Raoul bot, which is not true.

171
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,220
So you get fit into a system that says, well, we have to know what your H index is.

172
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,860
We have to know, you know, where are you a professor if you want to apply for a grant?

173
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,380
It makes all of these assumptions.

174
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,260
What I'm trying to do is in part to show all of this is nonsense.

175
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,380
This is proxy BS that came up in the institutional setting.

176
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,660
And right now, it's important for those of us who are still vital, like Elon, it would

177
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,220
be great to have Elon as a professor of physics and engineering, right?

178
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:31,980
It seems ridiculous to say, but just as a shot in the arm, you know, like, it'd be

179
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,940
great to have Elon at Caltech, even one day a week, one day a month.

180
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,900
One day a month.

181
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,260
Okay, well, why can't we be in there?

182
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,140
It's the same reason.

183
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,820
Well, why can't you be on the view?

184
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,260
Why can't you be on Bill Martin?

185
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,060
We need to know what you're going to do before we take you on the show.

186
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,700
On the show.

187
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,140
Well, I don't want to tell you what I'm going to do.

188
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,860
Do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit?

189
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,300
I can dance the dance fun.

190
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,100
To be on the view.

191
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,660
Oh, come on.

192
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:58,940
So you can.

193
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,500
Yeah, you do.

194
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,140
You're not, you're not.

195
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,180
I can do that fine.

196
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,220
Here's where it's, the place that it goes south is,

197
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,580
there's like a set of questions that get you into this more adversarial stuff.

198
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,500
And you've in fact asked some of those more adversarial questions this setting.

199
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,180
And they're not things that are necessarily aggressive, but they're

200
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,100
things that are making assumptions.

201
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,540
Right.

202
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,860
Right.

203
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,220
Well, so when you make, I have a question, it's like, you know, Lex,

204
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,420
are you avoiding your critics?

205
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,580
You know, it's just like, okay, well, why did you frame that that way?

206
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,740
Or the next question would be like, do you think that you should have a

207
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,100
special exemption and that you should have the right to break rules and everyone else

208
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,900
should have to follow them?

209
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,540
Like that question I find innervating.

210
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:40,860
Yeah.

211
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,780
It doesn't really come out of anything meaningful.

212
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,900
It's just like, we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other person

213
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,700
to show that we're not captured by their madness.

214
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
That's not the real question you want to ask me.

215
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,100
If you want to get really excited about this, you want to ask,

216
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,020
do you think this thing is right?

217
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,700
Yeah.

218
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,500
Weirdly, I do.

219
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,620
Do you think that it's going to be immediately seen to be right?

220
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,100
I don't.

221
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,780
I think it's going to, it's going to have an interesting fight and it's going to have

222
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,460
an interesting evolution.

223
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,140
And well, what do you hope to do with it in non-physical terms?

224
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:17,020
Oh, gosh, I hope it revolutionizes our relationship of, well, with people outside

225
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,540
of the institutional framework and it reinflicts us into the institutional

226
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,620
framework where we can do the most good to bring the institutions back to health.

227
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,940
You know, it's like, these are positive uplifting questions.

228
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,900
If you had Frank Wilczek, you wouldn't say, Frank, let's be honest,

229
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,580
you have done very little with your life after the original huge show that you used to break

230
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,460
under the physics scene.

231
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,340
Like, we weirdly ask people different questions based upon how they sit down.

232
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,860
Yeah, that's very strange, right?

233
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:54,620
But you have to understand that, so here's the thing, I get these days a large number

234
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,260
of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory of everything for AGI.

235
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:10,940
And I use my own radar, BS radar, to detect unfairly, perhaps, whether they're full of

236
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,500
shit or not.

237
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,420
I love where you're going with this, by the way.

238
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:24,940
And my concern, I often think about, is there's elements of brilliance in what people write

239
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,900
to me and I'm trying to, right now, as you made it clear, the kind of judgments and

240
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,780
assumptions we make, how am I supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system

241
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,620
and think about what you're doing, because my radar is saying you're not full of shit.

242
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,540
But I'm also not completely outside of the system.

243
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,100
That's right.

244
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,940
You've danced beautifully.

245
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,620
You've actually got all the credibility that you're supposed to get, all the nice little

246
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,340
stamps of approval, not all, but a large enough amount.

247
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:12,220
I mean, it's hard to put into words exactly why you sound, whether your theory turns out to

248
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,940
be good or not, you sound like a special human being.

249
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,380
I appreciate that.

250
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,940
And thank you very much for this.

251
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,740
In a good way.

252
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,140
No, no, no.

253
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,180
So, but what am I supposed to do with that flood of emails from AGI folks?

254
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,380
Why do I sound different?

255
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,660
I don't know.

256
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,140
And I would like to systemize that.

257
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,620
I don't know.

258
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:38,460
Look, when you're talking to people, you very quickly can surmise.

259
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,860
Am I claiming to be a physicist?

260
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,060
No, I say it every turn.

261
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,380
I'm not a physicist, right?

262
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,860
When I say, when you say something about bundles, you say, well, can you explain it differently?

263
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,780
And I, you know, I'm pushing around on this, this area, that lever over there.

264
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm trying to find something that we can play with and engage.

265
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,980
And, you know, another thing is, is that I'll say something at scale.

266
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,180
So if I was saying completely wrong things about bundles on the Joe Rogan program,

267
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,300
you don't think that we wouldn't hear a crushing chorus?

268
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,020
Yes.

269
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,740
And, you know, same thing with geometric unity.

270
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,620
So I put up this, this video from this Oxford lecture.

271
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,540
I understand that it's not a standard lecture,

272
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,860
but you haven't heard, you know, the most brilliant people in the field say,

273
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,460
well, this is obviously nonsense.

274
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,380
They don't know what to make of it.

275
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,020
And they're going to hide behind, well, he hasn't said enough details.

276
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,140
Where's the paper?

277
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,860
Where's the paper?

278
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,020
I've seen the criticism.

279
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,380
I've gotten the same kind of criticism.

280
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,420
I've published a few things and like, especially stuff related to Tesla,

281
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,540
that we did studies on Tesla vehicles.

282
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,260
And the kind of criticism I've gotten was showed that they're completely...

283
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,740
Oh, right.

284
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,220
Like the guy who had Elon Musk on his program twice is going to give us an accurate assessment.

285
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,100
Yeah, exactly.

286
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,740
Exactly.

287
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,420
It's just very low level.

288
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,740
Like without actually ever addressing the content.

289
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:16,300
You know, Lex, I think that in part you're trying to solve a puzzle that isn't really your puzzle.

290
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,980
I think you know that I'm sincere.

291
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,460
You don't know whether the theory is going to work or not.

292
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,700
And you know that it's not coming out of somebody who's coming out of left field.

293
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,700
Like the story makes sense.

294
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,700
There's enough that's new and creative and different in other aspects where you can check me

295
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,940
that your real concern is, are you really telling me that when you start breaking the rules,

296
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,340
you see the system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive?

297
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,140
And the answer is yes.

298
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,620
And I had to break the rules in part because of learning issues because I came into this field,

299
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,900
you know, with a totally different set of attributes.

300
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,620
My profile just doesn't look like anybody else's remotely.

301
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,260
But as a result, what that did is it showed me what is the system true to its own ideals?

302
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,500
Or does it just follow these weird procedures?

303
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,980
And then when you take it off the rails, it behaves terribly.

304
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,700
And that's really what my story, I think, does is it just says, well,

305
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,980
he completely takes the system into new territory where it's not expecting to have to deal with

306
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,380
somebody with these confusing sets of attributes.

307
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,780
And I think what he's telling us is he believes it behaves terribly.

308
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,940
Now, if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests and, you know,

309
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,780
a winner of math competitions and you put them in a PhD program,

310
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,020
they're probably going to be okay.

311
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm not saying that the system, you know, breaks down for everybody under all circumstances.

312
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,740
I'm saying when you present the system with a novel situation,

313
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,260
at the moment, it will almost certainly break down with probability approaching 100%.

314
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,780
But to me, the painful and the tragic thing is it sorry to bring out my motherly instinct,

315
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,860
but it feels like it's too much.

316
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,620
It could be too much of a burden to exist outside the system.

317
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,540
Maybe, bi psychologically.

318
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:22,220
First of all, I've got a podcast that I kind of like and I've got amazing friends.

319
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,380
I have a life which has more interesting people passing through it than I know what to do with.

320
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,500
And they haven't managed to kill me off yet, so so far so good.
