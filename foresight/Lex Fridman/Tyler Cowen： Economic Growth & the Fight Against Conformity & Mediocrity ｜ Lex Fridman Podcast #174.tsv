0	4960	The following is a conversation with Tyler Cohen, an economist at George Mason University
4960	11520	and co-creator of an amazing economics blog called Marginal Revolution. Author of many books,
11520	17200	including The Great Stagnation, Average is Over, and his most recent Big Business,
17200	23360	a love letter to an American anti-hero. He's truly a polymath in his work, including his love
23360	29520	for food, which makes his amazing podcast called Conversations with Tyler really fun to listen
29520	37520	to. Quick mention of our sponsors, Linode, ExpressVPN, SimplySafe, and Public Goods. Check
37520	43920	them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, given Tyler's culinary
43920	50000	explorations, let me say that one of the things that makes me sad about my love-hate relationship
50000	56560	with food is that while I've found a simple diet, plain meat and veggies that makes me happy
56560	62000	in day-to-day life, I sometimes wish I had the mental ability to moderate consumption of food
62000	67520	so that I could truly enjoy meals that go way outside of that diet. I've seen my mom, for example,
67520	73680	enjoy a single piece of chocolate, and yet if I were to eat one piece of chocolate, the odds are high
73680	78160	that I would end up eating the whole box. This is definitely something I would like to fix,
78160	83760	because some of the amazing artistry in this world happens in the kitchen, and some of the
83760	90160	richest human experiences happen over a unique meal. I recently was eating cheeseburgers with Joe
90160	96400	Rogan and John Donahar late at night in Austin talking about jiu-jitsu and life, and I was
96400	103120	distinctly aware of the magic of that experience, magic made possible by the incredibly delicious
103120	109840	cheeseburgers. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Tyler Cohen.
110800	117440	Would you say economics is more art or science or philosophy or even magic? What is it?
118000	123440	Economics is interesting because it's all of the above. To start with magic, the notion that you
123440	128240	can make some change and simply everyone's better off, that is a kind of modern magic
128240	133920	that has replaced old-style magic. It's an art in the sense that the models are not very exact.
134480	138400	It's a science in the sense that occasionally propositions are falsified,
138480	143360	are a few basic things we know, and however trivial they may sound, if you don't know them,
143360	149200	you're out of luck. So all of the above. But from my outsider's perspective, economics
149920	157920	is sometimes able to formulate very simple, almost like E equals MC squared, general models of how
157920	166320	our human society will function when you do a certain thing. But it seems impossible or almost
166320	172320	way too optimistic to think that a single formula or just a set of simple principles can describe
173760	178400	behavior of billions of human beings with all the complexity that we have involved.
178400	185840	So do you have a sense there's a hope for economics to have those kinds of physics level
185840	190480	descriptions and models of the world, or is it just our desperate attempts as humans to make sense
190560	197840	of it even though it's more desperate than rigorous and serious and actually predictable,
197840	203360	like a physics type science? I don't think economics will ever be very predictive.
204000	209200	It's most useful for helping you ask better questions. You look at something like game theory.
209200	214240	Well, game theory never predicted USA and USSR would have a war, would not have a war,
214800	219360	but trying to think through the logic of strategic conflict. If you know game theory,
219360	225280	it's just a much more interesting discussion. Are you surprised that we, speaking of the Soviet
225280	229760	Union and the United States, and speaking of game theory, are you surprised that we haven't
229760	235040	destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons yet, like that simple formulation of mutually assured
235040	242240	destruction? That's a good example of an explanation that perhaps allows us to ask better questions,
242240	248240	but it seems to have actually described the reality of why we haven't destroyed ourselves
248240	254400	with these ultra-powerful weapons. Are you surprised? Do you think the game theory explanation
254400	260480	is at all accurate there? I think we will destroy each other with those weapons. Eventually?
260480	266560	Eventually. Look, it's a very low probability event, so I'm not surprised it hasn't happened yet.
266560	271840	I'm a little surprised it came as close as it did. Your general thinking, realizing it might have
271840	276640	just been a flock of birds or it wasn't a first strike attack from the USA, we got very lucky
276640	281280	on that one. But if you just keep on running the clock on a low probability event,
282080	288400	it will happen. It may not be USA and China, USA and Russia, whatever. It could be the Saudis and
288400	292640	Turkey. It might not be nuclear weapons, it might be some other destruction. Bio weapons,
292640	298640	but it simply will happen, is my view. I've argued at best we have seven or eight hundred years,
298640	302000	and that's being generous. Worst? How long we got?
302960	308800	Well, maybe it's like a person arrival process, right? So, tiny probability could come anytime,
309520	316960	probably not in your lifetime, but the chance presumably increases the cheaper weapons of
316960	323040	mass destruction are. So, the person process description doesn't take in consideration
323040	328880	the game theoretic aspect. So, another way to consider is repeated games, iterative games.
329680	335040	So, is there something about our human nature that allows us to fight against
335920	342560	probability? Reduce, like the closer we get to trouble, the more we're able to figure out how
342560	348560	to avoid trouble. The same thing is for when you take exams or you go and take classes,
348560	353360	the closer or paper deadlines, the closer you get to a deadline, the better you start to perform
353360	357840	and get your shit together. It actually gets stuff done. I'm really not so negative on human
357920	363760	nature. And as an economist, I very much see the gains from cooperation. But if you just ask,
363760	368480	are there outliers in history? Like, was there a Hitler? For instance. Obviously. And again,
368480	374400	you let the clock tick. Another Hitler with nuclear weapons doesn't, per se, care about his own
374400	380560	destruction. It will happen. So, your sense is fundamentally people are good, but-
380560	384720	A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it. Trumbling hand equilibrium?
385360	390080	That the basic logic is for cooperation, which is mostly what we've seen,
390080	395280	even between enemies. But every now and then, someone does something crazy and you don't
395280	400880	know how to react to it. And you can't always beat Hitler. Sometimes, Hitler drags you down.
401520	408480	To push back is it possible that the crazier the person, the less likely they are,
409440	417360	and in a way where we're safe. Meaning, this is the kind of proposition- I had the discussion
417360	426080	with my dad as a physicist about this, where he thinks that if you have a graph, evil people
426080	432400	can't also be geniuses. So, this is his defense why evil people will not get control of nuclear
432400	440800	weapons, because to be truly evil. But evil meaning, you can argue that not even the evil of
440800	445120	Hitler we're talking about, because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany and all those kinds of-
446400	450800	He probably deluded himself and the people around him to think that he's actually doing good for
450800	455600	the world, similar with Stalin and so on. By evil, I mean more like almost like terrorists,
455600	462080	to where they want to destroy themselves and the world. Those people will never be able to be
462800	468720	actually skilled enough to do, to deliver that kind of mass scale destruction. So, the hope is
469280	476560	that it's very unlikely that the kind of evil that would lead to extinctions of humans or mass
476560	483120	destruction is so unlikely that we're able to last way longer than some 100, 800 years.
484160	489680	It's very unlikely in that sense. I accept the argument, but that's why you need to let the clock
490320	495680	It's also the best argument for bureaucracy. To negotiate a bureaucracy, it actually selects
495680	500320	against pure evil, because you need to build alliances. So, bureaucracy in that regard is
500320	505840	great, right? It keeps out the worst apples. But look, put it this way, could you imagine 35 years
505840	513120	from now, the Osama bin Laden of the future has nukes or very bad bio-weapons? It seems to me,
513120	519520	you can. And Osama was pretty evil. And actually, even he failed, right? But nonetheless,
520080	525360	that's what the 700 or 800 years is there for. And it might be destructive technology that don't
525360	532560	have such a high cost of production or such a high learning curve, like cyber attacks or
532560	537680	artificial intelligence, all those kinds of things. So, yeah. I mean, let me ask you a question. Let's
537760	543440	say you could as an active will, by spending a million dollars obliterate any city on earth,
543440	548320	and everyone in it dies, and you'll get caught, and you'll be sentenced to death,
548320	553680	but you can make it happen just by willing it. How many months does it take before that happens?
555760	559280	So, the obvious answer is like very soon. There's probably a good answer for that,
559280	562640	because you can consider how many millionaires there are, how many you can look at that, right?
563520	568160	I have a sense that there's just people that have a million dollars.
570000	572960	I mean, there's a certain amount, but have a million dollars,
573600	581200	have other interests that will outweigh the interest of destroying the entire city.
581920	586480	Like, there's a particular, you know, like, I mean, maybe that's a hope.
586480	588560	It's why we should be nice to the wealthy, too, right?
591280	597040	Yeah, all that trash talking is Bill Gates. We should stop that, because that doesn't inspire
597040	603520	the other future Bill Gates is to be nice to the world. It's true. But your sense is that
603520	606560	cheaper guests to destroy the world, the more likely it becomes.
607360	611520	Now, when I say destroy the world, there's a trick in there. I don't think literally every human
611520	617040	will die. But it would set back civilization by an extraordinary degree. It's then just
617040	619120	hard to predict what comes next. Yeah.
619120	623360	But a catastrophe where everyone dies, that probably has to be something more like an
623360	629040	asteroid or supernova. And those are purely exogenous for the time being, at least.
629600	634640	So, I immigrated to this country. I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia.
635280	637520	And which one?
637520	641440	Again, it's an important question. You were born in the Soviet Union, right?
641440	646480	Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union. The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.
647360	653920	But I came to this country and this country even back there, but it's always symbolized to me
653920	661120	a place of opportunity where everybody could build the most incredible things,
661120	667440	especially in the engineering side of things, just invent and build and scale and have a huge
667440	673440	impact on the world. And that's been, to me, that's my version of the American ideal, the American
673440	683760	dream. Do you think the American dream is still there? What do you think of that notion in itself?
683760	688720	From an economics perspective, from a human perspective, is it still alive? And how do you
688720	694560	think about it? The American dream? The American dream is mostly still there. If you look at which
694560	701680	groups are the highest earners, it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran, which is a
701680	707760	fairly new development, great for them, not necessarily easy. Both you could call persons of
707760	714000	color, may have faced discrimination, also on the grounds of religion, yet they've done it. That's
714000	719120	amazing. It says great things about America. Now, if you look at Native-born Americans, the story's
719120	726560	trickier. People think intergenerational mobility has declined a lot recently, but it has not for
726560	732800	Native-born Americans. For about, I think, 40 years it's been fairly constant, which is sort of good.
733760	740640	But compared to much earlier times, it was much higher in the past. I'm not sure we can replicate
740640	745360	that, because look, go to the beginning of the 20th century. Very few Americans finish high school
746640	750800	or even have much wealth. There's not much credentialism. There aren't that many credentials.
750800	756320	So there's more upward mobility across the generations than today. And it's a good thing
756320	763200	that we had it. I'm not sure we should blame the modern world for not being able to reproduce that.
763200	769520	But look, the general issue of who gets into Harvard or Cornell, is there an injustice? Should
769520	775360	we fix that? Is there too little opportunity for the bottoms, say, half of Americans? Absolutely.
775360	780320	It's a disgrace how this country has evolved in that way. And in that sense, the American dream
780320	785920	is clearly ailing. But it has had problems from the beginning for blacks, for women, for many other
785920	792240	groups. I mean, isn't that the whole challenge of opportunity and freedom is that it's hard and
792960	799680	the difficulty of how hard it is to move up in society is unequal often. And that's the injustice
799680	805600	of society. But the whole point of that freedom is that over time, it becomes better and better.
805600	815920	You start to fix the leaks, the issues, and it keeps progressing in that kind of way. But ultimately,
815920	820960	there's always the opportunity, even if it's harder, there's the opportunity to create something
820960	827760	truly special, to move up, to be president, to be a leader in whatever the industry that you're
827760	834400	passionate about. We each have podcasts in English. The value of joining that American English
834400	839520	language network is much higher today than it was 30 years ago, mostly because of the internet.
840240	846480	So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed. So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,
847120	851200	I think has become much more valuable in relative terms than, say, going to France,
851200	853680	would just still a pretty well off, very nice country.
856480	861680	If you had gone to France, your chance of having a globally known podcast would be much smaller.
861680	868480	Yeah, this is the interesting thing about how much intellectual influence the United States has.
868480	873440	I don't know if it's connected to what we're discussing here, the freedom and the opportunity
873520	880480	of the American dream. Or does it make any sense to you that we have so much impact on the rest
880480	888880	of the world in terms of ideas? Is it just simply because the English is the primary language of
888880	894320	the world, or is there something fundamental to the United States that drives the development of
894320	904400	ideas? It's almost like what's cool, what's entertaining, what's meme culture, the internet
904400	912160	culture, the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts, the movies, music, all that stuff,
912160	916560	driving culture. There's something above and beyond language in the United States.
916560	920880	It's a sense of entertainment, really mattering, how to connect with your audience,
920880	926400	being direct and getting to the point, how humor is integrated even with science.
927200	932560	That is pretty strongly represented here, much more so than on the European continent.
932560	937120	Britain has its own version of this, which it does very well. Not surprisingly,
937120	942400	they're hugely influential in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mention. Canada,
942400	947680	yes, but their best talent tends to come here. You could say it's like a broader North American
947680	953120	thing and give them their fair share of credit. What about science? There's a sense,
954640	959120	higher education is really strong, research is really strong in the United States, but it just
959120	965760	feels like culturally speaking, when we zoom out, scientists aren't very cool here.
967440	973200	Most people wouldn't be able to name basically a single scientist. Maybe they would say what,
973440	978880	Einstein and Neil deGrasse Tyson, maybe. Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't exactly a scientist. He's
978880	988800	a science communicator. There's not the same admiration of science and innovators as there is
988800	998080	of athletes or actors, actresses, musicians. You can become a celebrity scientist if you want to.
998160	1003680	May or may not be best for science. We have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal,
1004240	1009760	but look at it this way. Which country is most comfortable with inegalitarian rewards
1009760	1014160	for scientists, whether it's fame or money? I still think it's here. Some of that's just
1014160	1019600	the tax rate. Some of it is a lot of America is set up for rich people to live really well.
1020320	1025440	Again, that's going to attract a lot of top talent. You ask the two best vaccines. I know
1025440	1030320	the Pfizer vaccine is sorted from Germany, sorted from Turkey, but it's nonetheless
1031280	1037360	being distributed through the United States, Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through
1037360	1042160	Lebanon, first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area. Those are incredible
1042160	1049840	vaccines. US nailed it. Yeah. Well, that's more almost like the, I don't know what you would call
1050080	1056160	engineering the sort of scaling. That's what US is really good at, not just inventing of ideas,
1056160	1060960	but taking an idea and actually building the thing and scaling it and being able to distribute it
1060960	1070000	at scale. I think some people would attribute that to the general word of capitalism. I don't
1070000	1077760	know if you would. Sure. What in your views are the pros and cons of capitalism as it's
1077760	1082960	implemented in America? I don't know if you would say capitalism has really existed in America,
1082960	1088240	but to the extent that it does. People use the word capitalism in so many different ways.
1088240	1093360	What is capitalism? The literal meaning is private ownership of capital goods,
1093360	1098880	which I favor in most areas, but no, I don't think the private sector should own our F-16s
1098880	1104800	or military assets. Government-owned water utilities seem to work as well as privately
1104800	1111520	owned water utilities, but with all those qualifications put to the side, business,
1112720	1117920	for the most part, innovates better than government. It is oriented toward consumer services.
1117920	1123520	The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages. Business is great at getting things done.
1123520	1129040	USA is fundamentally a nation of business, and that makes us a nation of opportunity.
1129440	1133280	I am indeed mostly a fan, subject to numerous caveats.
1135120	1138960	What's the con? What are some negative downsides of capitalism
1140160	1145520	in your view or some things that we should be concerned about maybe for long-term impacts of
1145520	1152880	capitalism? Capitalism takes a different form in each country. I would say in the United States,
1152880	1159280	our weird blend of whatever you want to call it has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning,
1160000	1166240	has been a force of taking away land from Native Americans and oppressing them pretty much from
1166240	1176880	the beginning. It has done very well by immigrants for the most part. We revel in chimpaterian
1176880	1182800	creative destruction more, so we don't just prop up national champions forever, and there's a
1182960	1188160	precariousness to life for some people here that is less so, say, in Germany or the Netherlands.
1188960	1193760	We have weaker communities in some regards than, say, Northwestern Europe often would.
1194320	1199040	That has pluses and minuses. I think it makes us more creative. It's a better country in which
1199040	1205360	to be a weirdo than, say, Germany or Denmark. But there is truly, whether from the government
1205360	1209920	or from your private community, there is less social security in some fundamental sense.
1210000	1220400	On the point of weirdo, that's kind of a beautiful little statement. What is that? That seems to
1220400	1226160	be, you could think of a guy like Elon Musk and say that he's a weirdo. Is that the sense of what
1226160	1232560	you're using the weirdo? Outside of the norm, breaking conventions. Absolutely. Here, that is
1232560	1238640	either acceptable or even admired or to be a loner. Since so many people are outsiders,
1239280	1243040	and that where all immigrants is selecting for people who left something behind,
1243040	1247360	were willing to leave behind their families, were willing to undergo a certain brutality
1248080	1255600	of switch in their lives, makes us a nation of weirdos, and weirdos are creative. Denmark
1256560	1262000	is not a nation of weirdos. It's a wonderful place, great for them. Ideally, you want part
1262000	1266160	of the world to be fully weirdos and innovating, and the other part of the world to be a little
1266400	1272800	kind of chicken shit, risk averse, and enjoy the benefit to the innovation, and to give people
1272800	1278560	these smooth lives in six weeks off and free ride. Everyone's like, oh, American way versus
1278560	1283520	European way, but basically they're compliments. Yeah, that's fascinating. I used to have this
1283520	1289360	conversation with my parents when I was growing up, and just others from the immigrant kind of
1289440	1296400	flow, and they used this term, especially in Russian, is to criticize something I was doing,
1296400	1303200	that would suggest normal people don't do this. I used to be really offended by that,
1304480	1314080	but as I got older, I realized that that's a kind of compliment, because in the same kind of,
1314640	1321520	I would say, way that you're saying that is the American ideal, because if you want to do anything
1321520	1328000	special or interesting, you don't want to be doing, in one particular avenue, what normal people do,
1328480	1334640	because that won't be interesting. Russians, I think, fit in very well here,
1334640	1338960	because the ones who come are weirdos, and there's a very different Russian weirdo tradition,
1338960	1344240	like Alyosha, right, and Brother Skaramisov, or Perlman, the mathematician. They're weirdos,
1344960	1349600	and they have their own different kind of status in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever.
1350640	1355120	And when Russians come to America, they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me a week later,
1355120	1361520	they've somehow adjusted, and the ways in which they might want to be grumpier than Americans,
1361520	1366720	not smile, think that people who smile are idiots. They can do that. No one takes that away from them.
1367040	1373920	Yeah. Yeah. What are you on the tiny tangent? I'd love to hear a few thoughts about Grisha Perlman
1374880	1380800	turning down the Fields Medal. Is that something you admire? Does that make sense to you that somebody,
1381920	1386240	you know, we have the structure of Nobel Prizes, of these huge awards, of the reputations,
1386240	1392960	the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding how special you are, and here's a person who was
1392960	1396720	doing one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mathematics. It doesn't want
1396720	1401120	the stupid prize and doesn't want recognition, doesn't want to do interviews, it doesn't want to be
1401120	1407920	famous. What do you make of that? It's great. Look, prizes are corrupting. After scientists win
1407920	1412960	Nobel Prizes, they tend to become less productive. Now, statistically, it's hard to sort out the
1412960	1416800	different effects. There's a Russian toward the mean. Does the prize make you too busy? It's a
1416800	1423280	little tricky, but there's not enough Nobel Prizes either to gather enough data. Right. But it's,
1423280	1427680	I've known a lot of Nobel Prize winners, and it is my sense they become less productive.
1427680	1432640	They repeat more of their older messages, which may be highly socially valuable. But if someone
1432640	1438160	wants to turn their back on that and keep on working, which I assume is what he's doing,
1438160	1443680	that's awesome. I mean, we should respect that. It's like he wins a bigger prize, right? Our extreme
1443680	1454160	respect. Yeah. Well, Grisha, if you're listening, I need to talk to you soon. Okay. I've been trying
1454160	1460640	to get ahold of them. Okay. Back to capitalism. I got to ask you, just competition in general,
1460640	1469280	in this world of weirdos, is competition good for the world? This seems to be one of the fundamental
1469360	1473680	engines of capitalism, right? Do you see it as ultimately constructive or destructive for the
1473680	1479200	world? What really matters is how good your legal framework is. So competition within nature,
1480080	1484960	for food, leads to bloody conflict all the time. The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the
1484960	1492720	least. If you have something like the rule of law and clearly defined property rights, which are
1492720	1498240	within reason justly allocated, competition probably is going to work very well.
1498880	1504000	But it's not an unalloyed good thing at all. It can be highly destructive. Military competition,
1504000	1508800	right? Which actually is itself sometimes good, but it's not good per se.
1509920	1514480	What aspects of life do you think we should protect from competition? So is there some,
1515200	1519600	you said like the rule of law, is there some things we should keep away from competition?
1519600	1524240	Well, the fight for territory most of all, right? So violence, anything that involves
1524240	1528000	like actual physical violence. Right. And it's not that I think the current borders are just.
1528000	1534400	I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians, Serbians, Bosnians, they'll talk your ear off.
1534400	1539600	And some of them are probably right. But at the end of the day, we have some kind of international
1539600	1546080	order. And I would rather we more or less stick with it. If Catalonians want to leave, they keep
1546080	1551200	up with it, you know, let them go. But what about a space of like healthcare? This is where you
1551200	1557840	get into a tension of like between capitalism and kind of more, I don't want to use socialism,
1557840	1563360	but those kinds of policies, they're less free market. I think in this country,
1563360	1568000	healthcare should be much more competitive. So you go to hospitals, doctors, they don't treat
1568000	1573680	you like a customer. They treat you like an idiot or like a child or someone with third party
1573680	1581920	payment. And it's a pretty humiliating experience often. Yeah. Do you think free market in general
1581920	1588160	is possible, like a pure free market? And is that a good goal to strive for?
1588160	1593040	I don't think the term pure free markets well defined, because you need a legal order. The
1593040	1598400	legal order has to make decisions on like what is intellectual property more important than ever.
1598400	1603200	There's no benchmark that like represents the pure free market way of doing things.
1603920	1608880	What will penalties be? How much do we put into law enforcement? No simple answers,
1608880	1613840	but just saying free market doesn't pin down what you're going to do on those all important questions.
1613840	1620160	So free market is an economics, I guess, idea. So there's no, it's not possible for free market
1620160	1624960	to generate the rules. They're like emergent, like self governing. It generates a lot of them,
1624960	1629680	right, through private norms, through trade associations. International trade is mostly
1629680	1636320	done privately and by norms. So it's certainly possible. But at the end of the day, I think
1636320	1643360	you need governments to draw very clear lines to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.
1644080	1650640	You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos lately, Michael Malis,
1650640	1659600	who espouses to be an anarchist anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually, just
1660880	1667680	fascinating set of ideas, where, you know, taking free market to the full extreme of
1667680	1675520	basically saying there should be no, no government. What is it? Oversight, I guess,
1675520	1680240	and then everything should be fully, like all the agreements, all the collectives you form
1680240	1687840	should be voluntary, not based on the geographic land you were born on and so on. Do you think
1688560	1694320	that's just a giant mess? Like, do you think it's possible for an anarchist society to work where
1694320	1701840	it's, you know, in a fully distributed way, people agree with each other, not just on financial
1701920	1709680	transactions, but, you know, on their personal security, on sort of military type of stuff,
1710800	1715600	on healthcare, on education, all those kinds of things. And where does it break down?
1715600	1720000	Well, I wouldn't press a button to say, get rid of our current constitution, which I view is pretty
1720000	1725840	good and quite wise. But I think the deeper point is that all societies are, in some regards,
1725840	1730880	anarchistic. And we should take the anarchists seriously. So globally, there's a kind of anarchy
1731840	1738400	across borders, even within federalistic systems. They're typically complex. There's not a clear
1738400	1745120	transitivity necessarily of who has the final say over what. Just the state vis-a-vis its people.
1745120	1752000	There's not, per se, a final arbitrator in that regard. So you want a good anarchy rather than
1752000	1756800	a bad anarchy. You want to squish your anarchy into the right corners. And I don't think there's a
1756800	1762640	theoretical answer how to do it. But you start with a country like, is it working well enough now?
1763440	1768400	This country, you'd say mostly, you'd certainly want to make a lot of improvements. And that's
1768400	1772480	why I don't want to press that get rid of the constitution button. But to just dump on the
1772480	1778000	anarchists is to miss the point. Always try to learn from any opinion, you know, and what in it is
1778000	1785680	true? I'm just like marveling at the poetry of saying that we should squish our anarchy into
1785680	1794560	the right corners. I love it. Okay, I gotta ask, I've been talking with, since we're doing a
1794560	1799520	whirlwind introduction to all of economics, I've been talking to a few objectivists recently.
1801680	1807600	Ayn Rand comes up as a person, as a philosopher throughout many conversations. A lot of people
1807600	1814080	really despise her. A lot of people really love her. It's always weird to me when somebody arouses
1814080	1820640	a philosophy or a human being arouses that much emotion in either direction. Do you understand,
1820640	1825840	first of all, that level of emotion? And what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand and her philosophy,
1825840	1834720	objectivism? Is it useful at all to think about this kind of formulation of rational self-interest,
1834720	1843760	if I could put it in those words, or I guess, more negatively, the selfishness, or she would put,
1843840	1849600	I guess, the virtue of selfishness? Ayn Rand was the big influence on me growing up. The book that
1849600	1854880	really mattered for me was capitalism, the unknown ideal, the notion that wealth creates
1854880	1861120	opportunity and good lives, and wealth is something we ought to valorize and give very high status.
1861120	1866160	It's one of her key ideas. I think it's completely correct. I think she has the most profound and
1866160	1872800	articulate statement of that idea. That said, as a philosopher, I disagree with her on most things,
1872800	1878080	and I did, even as a boy when I was reading her. I read Plato before Ayn Rand, and in a
1878080	1882720	Socratic dialogue, there's all these different points of view being thrown around. And whomever
1882720	1887760	it is you agree with, you understand the wisdom isn't coming together at the different points of
1887760	1894240	view, and she doesn't have that. So altruism can be wonderful in my view. Humans are not actually
1894240	1900960	that rational. Self-interest is often poorly defined. To pound the table and say existence exists,
1900960	1905600	I wouldn't say I disagree, but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement.
1906320	1910800	I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian. I'd love to have her on my podcast if
1910800	1916000	she was still alive. I'd only ask her about Russia, which she mostly never talked about
1916000	1922320	after writing We the Living. And she is much more Russian than she seems at first, even like purging
1922320	1927760	people from the Objectivist circles. It's like how Russians, especially female Russians, so often
1927760	1936240	purge their friends. It's weird, all the parallels. So you're saying, so yes, assuming she's still not
1936240	1941840	around. But if she is, and she comes into your podcast, can you dig into that a little bit?
1941840	1951280	Do you mean like her personal demons around the social and economic Russia of the time,
1951840	1956960	when she escaped? The traumas she suffered there. What she really likes in the music and literature
1957440	1962720	and getting deeply into that, her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,
1962720	1969120	how it differs from America, why she still carries through the old Russian vision in her fiction,
1969120	1975680	this extreme sexual dimorphism, but with also very strong women. To me is a uniquely, at least
1975680	1982400	Eastern European vision, mostly Russian, I would say. And that's in her. That's her actual real
1982400	1987600	philosophy, not this table-bounding existence exists. And that's not talked about enough.
1987600	1992320	She's a Russian philosopher or Soviet, whatever you want to call it.
1992320	1996720	And if she wasn't so certain, she could have been a Dostoevsky, where it's not,
1997440	2003840	that certainty is almost the thing that brings over the adoration of millions, but also the
2003840	2009280	hatred of millions. She became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian-like manner. Yeah.
2010240	2017120	It is what it is. But I love the idea that, again, you're just dropping bombs that are poetic,
2017120	2022480	that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas. It's kind of interesting to think that
2023280	2032080	no one human possesses wisdom. No one idea is the wisdom, that the coming together is the wisdom.
2032080	2036800	Like in my view, Boswell's life of Johnson, 18th century British biography,
2036800	2040960	it's, in essence, a co-authored work, Boswell and Johnson. It's one of the greatest
2040960	2046320	philosophy books ever, though it is commonly regarded as a biography. John Stuart Mill,
2046320	2052000	who, in a sense, was co-authoring with Harriet Taylor, a better philosopher than is realized,
2052000	2057280	though he's rated very, very highly. Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works
2058000	2064880	are in a kind of dialogue form, Kurtis Faust, would be another example. It's very much a dialogue.
2064960	2070160	Yes, it's drama, but it's also philosophy, Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.
2071920	2077680	In your book, Big Business, speaking of Anne Rand, Big Business, a love letter to an American
2077680	2084000	antihero, you make the case for the benefit that large businesses bring to society. Can you explain?
2085120	2090080	If you look at, say, the pandemic, which has been a catastrophic event, right, for many reasons,
2091040	2098160	but who is it that saved us? So Amazon has done remarkably well. They upped their delivery game
2098160	2102960	more or less overnight with very few hitches. I've ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,
2103600	2109360	direct delivery food, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats or using Whole Foods through Amazon
2109360	2115680	shipping. Again, it's gone remarkably well. Switching over our entire higher educational system,
2115760	2121120	basically within two weeks to Zoom. Zoom did it. I mean, I've had a Zoom outage,
2121120	2126400	but their performance rate has been remarkably high. So if you just look at resources,
2126400	2132720	competence, incentives, who's been the star performers, the NBA even, just canceling the
2132720	2138160	season as early as they did, sending a message like, hey people, this is real. And then pulling
2138160	2144000	off the bubble with not a single found case of COVID and having all the testing set up in advance.
2144960	2150160	Big business has done very well lately. And throughout the broader course of American
2150160	2155840	history, in my view, has mostly been a hero. Can we engage in a kind of therapy session?
2158720	2166560	I'm often troubled by the negativity towards big business. And I wonder if you could help
2166560	2172560	figure out how we've removed that or maybe first psychoanalyze it and then how we remove it.
2174000	2181520	It feels like once we've gotten Wi-Fi on flights, on airplane flights,
2183760	2188320	people start complaining about how shady the connection is, right? They take it for granted
2188320	2195360	immediately and then start complaining about little details. Another example that's closer to,
2196320	2203040	especially as a aspiring entrepreneur is closer to the things I'm thinking about is Jack Dorsey
2203040	2209760	with Twitter. To me, Twitter has enabled an incredible platform of communication.
2210560	2216880	And yet the biggest thing that people talk about is not how incredible this platform is.
2218400	2223440	They essentially use the platform to complain about the censorship of a few individuals,
2224720	2230240	as opposed to how amazing it is. Now, you should also talk about how shady the Wi-Fi is and how
2230240	2234720	censorship or the removal of Donald Trump from the platform is a bad thing. But it feels like
2234720	2242080	we don't talk about the positive impacts at scale of these technologies. Can you explain why and is
2242080	2248000	there a way to fix it? I don't know if we can fix it. I think we are beings of high neuroticism,
2248000	2254240	for the most part, as a personality trait. Not everyone, but most people. And as a compliment
2254240	2259040	to that, if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult, you're more bothered by the
2259040	2262880	insult than you're pleased by the nice things, especially if the insult is somewhat true.
2263760	2267680	So you have these media, these vehicles, Twitter is one you mentioned,
2268240	2271600	where there's all kinds of messages going back and forth. And you're really bugged
2271600	2277360	by the messages you don't like. Most people are neurotic to begin with. It's not only taken out
2277360	2283600	on big business to be clear. So Congress catches a lot of grief and some of it they deserve, yes.
2284560	2290800	Religion is not attacked the same way, but religiosity is declining. If you poll people,
2291520	2297200	the military still polls quite well. But people are very disillusioned with many things. And the
2297200	2302320	Martin-Gurrey thesis that because of the internet, you just see more of things. And the more you see
2302320	2306640	of something, whether it's good, bad, or in between, the more you will find to complain about,
2306640	2311680	I suspect, is the fundamental mechanism here. I mean, look at Clubhouse, right?
2312560	2317280	To me, it's a great service. May or may not be like my thing, but gives people this opportunity.
2317280	2321760	No one makes you go on it. And all these media articles like, oh, is Clubhouse going to wreck
2321760	2326000	things? Are they going to break things? New York Times is complaining. Of course,
2326000	2330240	it's their competitor as well. I'm like, give these people a chance. Talk it up.
2330800	2335920	You may or may not like it. Let's praise the people who are getting something done. Very
2335920	2342720	unrandom point. As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster, what do you think about
2342720	2350640	Clubhouse? What do you think about? Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it. I used to use
2350640	2355920	Discord, which is another service where people use voice. So the only thing you do is just hear
2355920	2363600	each other. There's no face. You just see a little icon. That's the essential element of Clubhouse.
2363680	2368960	There's an intimacy to voice-only communication that's hard. That didn't make sense to me,
2368960	2374000	but it was just what it is, which feels like something that won't last for some reason. Maybe
2374000	2382080	it's the cynical view. But what's your sense about the intimacy of what's happening right now with
2382080	2387600	Clubhouse? I've greatly enjoyed what I've done, but I'm not sure it's for me in the long run for two
2387600	2395120	reasons. First, if you compare it to doing a podcast, podcasting has greater reach than Clubhouse.
2395120	2402720	So I would rather put time into my podcast, but then also my core asset, so to speak,
2402720	2408400	is I'm a very fast reader. So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage. I don't
2408400	2413520	speak or listen faster than other people. In fact, I'm a slower listener because I like 1.0,
2413520	2418720	not 1.5x. So I should spend less time on audio and more time reading and writing.
2418720	2427920	Yeah. It's interesting because you mentioned podcasts and audiobooks. The podcasts are recorded,
2428480	2434720	and so I can skip things. I can skip commercials or I can skip parts where it's like, this part
2434720	2441680	is boring. With live conversations, especially when there's a magic to the fact that when you
2441680	2447200	have a lot of people participating in that conversation, but some people are like, this
2447200	2452800	topic, they're going into this thing and you can't skip it or you can't fast forward. You can go 1.5x
2452800	2459680	or 2x. You can't speed it up. Nevertheless, there's a tension between that. So that's the productivity
2459680	2467520	aspect with the actual magic of live communication where anything can happen where Elon Musk can
2467520	2473200	ask the CEO of Robin Hood, Vlad, about like, hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,
2473200	2478160	there's something shady going on, the magic of that. That's also my criticism of like,
2478160	2485600	there's been a recent conversation with Bill Gates that he won a platform and had a basically
2485600	2491120	a regular interview on the platform without allowing the possibility of the magic of the chaos.
2492080	2498240	So I'm not exactly sure. It's probably not the right platform for you and for many other people
2498240	2502880	who are exceptionally productive in other places, but there's still nevertheless the magic to the
2502880	2509040	chaos that could be created with live conversation that gives me pause. Maybe what it's perfect for
2509040	2513920	is the tribute. So they had an episode recently that I didn't hear, but I heard it was wonderful.
2513920	2519360	It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs. That you can't do one to one, right? And you don't want control.
2519360	2522880	You want different people appearing and stepping up and saying their bit.
2523680	2529840	And Clubhouse is 110% perfect for that, the tribute. I love that, the tribute.
2530400	2536320	But there's also the possibility, I think there was a time when somebody arranged a conversation
2536320	2540560	with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on stage. I remember that happen a long time ago.
2542480	2549040	And it was very formal. It could have probably gone better, but it was still magical
2549040	2553040	to have these people that obviously had a bunch of tension throughout their history.
2554400	2562480	It's so frictionless to have two major figures in world history just jump on on a Clubhouse stage.
2562480	2563680	Putin and Elon Musk.
2563680	2564640	Putin and Elon Musk.
2565520	2570800	And that's exactly it. So there's a language barrier there. There's also the problem that
2570800	2576960	in particular, it's like Biden would have a similar problem. It's like they're just not
2576960	2582480	into a new technology. So it's very hard to catch the Kremlin up to, first of all, Twitter.
2583600	2588720	But to catch them up to Clubhouse, you have to have the Elon Musk has a sense of the internet,
2588720	2592240	the humor, the memes and all that kind of stuff that you have to have in order to
2593440	2597920	use a new app and figure out the timing, the beat. What is this thing about?
2599600	2606160	That's the challenge there. But that's exactly it. That magic of have two big personalities
2606240	2611520	just show up. And I wonder if it's just the temporary thing that we're going through with
2611520	2617520	the pandemic where people are just lonely and they're seeking for that human connection that
2617520	2622480	we usually get elsewhere through our work. But they'll stay lonely, in my opinion.
2622480	2623120	You think so?
2623120	2629360	I do. So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist. And the idea of wanting to be
2629360	2634960	connected to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that. And all the mental health issues
2634960	2640480	out there, a lot of people have broken ties and they will still be lonely post vaccines.
2642240	2645440	Yeah, from an artificial intelligence perspective,
2646800	2652960	have a sense that there is like a deep loneliness in the world that all of us are really lonely.
2652960	2657440	Like we don't even acknowledge it. Even people in happy relationships. It feels like there's
2657440	2663120	like an iceberg of loneliness in all of us, like seeking to be understood, like deeply
2663120	2669200	understood. Like having somebody with whom you can have a deep interaction enough
2670240	2675760	to where they can help you to understand yourself. And they also understand you.
2676320	2680560	Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence systems can provide that as well.
2680560	2686320	But humans, I think, crave that from other humans in ways that we perhaps don't acknowledge.
2686320	2690720	And I have a hope that technology will enable that more and more. Like Clubhouse is an example
2690720	2696560	that allows that. Are touring bots going to outcompete Clubhouse? Like why not sort of program
2696560	2702080	your own session? You'll just talk into your device and say, here's the kind of conversation I want.
2702080	2706880	And it will create the characters for you. And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin,
2706880	2711520	but it will be better than ordinary Clubhouse. Yeah. And one of the things that's missing,
2711520	2717600	it's not just conversation. It's memory. So long term memory is what current AI systems don't have
2717920	2724560	is sharing an experience together. Forget the words. It's like sharing the highs and the lows
2724560	2730400	of life together and the systems around us remembering that. Remembering we've been through
2730400	2735360	that. Like that's the thing that creates really close relationships is going through some shit.
2735360	2740880	Like go and struggle. If you've survived together, there's something really difficult
2740880	2745200	that bonds you with other humans. And this is related to immigration in the American dream.
2746160	2750960	In what way? The people who have come to this country, however weird and different they may be,
2751680	2754960	they or their ancestors at some point probably have shared this thing.
2758000	2762160	Right. US is not going to split up. It may get more screwed up as a country,
2762160	2766240	but Texas and California are not going to break off. Yeah. I mean, they're big enough
2766240	2770240	where they could do it, but it's just never going to happen. We've been through too much together.
2770560	2776960	Yeah. That's a hopeful message. Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein,
2776960	2786160	you've talked to Eric Weinstein. He has a sense that growth, the entirety of the American system
2786160	2790880	is based on the assumption that we're going to grow forever. The economy is going to grow forever.
2790880	2796960	Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely or will we stagnate?
2797040	2804800	I've long been in agreement with Eric Peter Thiel, Robert Gordon, and others that growth has slowed
2804800	2811600	down. I argued that in my book, The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled, but the last two years,
2811600	2816320	I've become much more optimistic. I've seen a lot of breakthroughs in green energy and battery
2816320	2824240	technology. mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already. It will repair our GDP and save
2824240	2830160	millions of lives around the world. There's an anti-malaria vaccine that's now in stage three
2830160	2837920	trial. It probably works. CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia. This space area after area after
2837920	2842880	area, there's suddenly this surge of breakthroughs. I would say many of them rooted in superior
2842880	2849120	computation and ultimately Moore's law and access to those computational abilities. I'm much more
2849120	2854800	optimistic than say the last time I spoke to Eric. He moves all the time in his views. I don't
2854800	2862240	know where he's at now. He hasn't gained. That's really interesting. Your little drop of optimism
2862240	2868720	comes from, there might be a fundamental shift in the kind of things that computation has unlocked
2868720	2874960	for us in terms of, it could be a wellspring of innovation that enables growth for a long time
2874960	2882640	to come. Eric has not quite connected to the computation aspect yet to where it could be
2882640	2887600	a wellspring of innovation. You're very close to it in your own work. I don't have to tell you that.
2887600	2892000	The work you're doing would not have been possible not very long ago. The question is,
2892000	2897600	how much does that work enable continued growth for decades to come? For all their problems,
2897600	2902240	some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing. I'm not sure when. You know much better
2902240	2908800	than I do, maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal. One of the open questions that the
2908800	2918400	Peter Thiel School area of ideas is how much can be converted to technology? How many parts of our
2918400	2926000	lives can technology integrate and then innovate? Can it replace healthcare? Can it replace legal
2926000	2935360	system? Can it replace government? Never replace, but make it digital and thereby enable computation
2935360	2942480	to improve it. That's the open question because many aspects of our lives are still not really that
2943920	2950480	digitized. There was a New York Times symposium in April, which is not long ago, and they asked
2950560	2955840	the so-called experts, when are we going to get vaccines? The most optimistic answer was
2955840	2963200	in four years. Obviously, we beat that by a long mile. I think people still haven't woken up. You
2963200	2968800	mentioned my tiny drop of optimism, but it's a big drop of optimism. Is it a waterfall yet?
2970800	2975680	Here's my pessimism. Whenever there are major new technologies, they also tend to be used for
2975680	2981040	violence directly or indirectly. Radio, Hitler, not that he hit people over the head with radios,
2981040	2987760	but it enabled the rise of various dictators. The new technologies now, whatever exactly they may
2987760	2992960	be, they're going to cause a lot of trouble. That's my pessimism, not that I think they're all going
2992960	3001520	to slow to a trickle. When was the stagnation book? 2011. It was the first of these stagnation books,
3001520	3008800	in fact. It's very interesting. Even then, I said, this is temporary. I was predicting it
3008800	3014720	would be gone in about 20 years' time. I'm not sure that's exactly the right prediction, like
3014720	3020880	2030, but I think we're actually going to beat that. You think the United States might still be
3020880	3026880	on top of the world for the rest of the century in terms of its economic growth, impact on the
3026880	3031600	world, scientific innovation, all those kinds of things. That's too long to predict, but I'm
3031600	3038800	bullish on America in general. Got it. Speaking of being bullish on America,
3038800	3046640	the opposite of that is, we talked about capitalism, we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.
3046960	3058160	What do you think about communism? Why doesn't it work? Is it the implementation?
3058160	3064240	Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling, or is it just a fundamentally flawed
3065200	3070080	system? Communism is like capitalism. The words mean many things to different people.
3070720	3075600	You could argue, my life as a tenured professor comes closer to communism than anything the human
3075600	3080880	race has seen, and I would argue it works pretty well. If you mean the Soviet Union,
3081600	3088880	it devolved pretty quickly to a decentralized set of incentives that were destructive
3088880	3094640	rather than value-maximizing. It wasn't even central planning, much less communism. Paul
3094640	3098960	Craig Roberts and Poignet were correct in their descriptions of the Soviet system.
3099520	3103040	Think of it as weird mixes of barter and malfunctioning incentives,
3103920	3108720	and being very good at a whole bunch of things, but in terms of progress, innovation,
3108720	3116240	and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure. Now, I wouldn't call that communism,
3116240	3123520	but that's what I think of the system the Soviets had, and it required an ever-increasing pile of
3123520	3129520	lies that both alienated people but created an elite that by the end of the thing no longer
3130080	3135680	believed in the system itself or even thought they were doing better by being crooks than by
3135680	3139840	just moving to Switzerland and being an upper-middle-class individual. You would have a higher
3139840	3145200	standard of living by Gorbachev's time, not Gorbachev, but if you're a number 30 in the hierarchy,
3145200	3149920	you're better off as a middle-class person in Switzerland, and that, of course, did not prove
3149920	3154960	sustainable. What is it? A momentum of bureaucracy or something like that? It just builds up where
3154960	3160080	you lose control of the original vision, and that naturally happens. It's just people.
3160080	3164320	And you can't use normal profit and loss in price incentives, so you get all prices,
3164320	3170800	or most prices, set to low. Shortage is everywhere. People trade favors. You have this culture of
3170800	3176960	bartered bribes, sexual favors, or family friends, and you get more and more of that,
3176960	3181600	and you over time lose more and more of the information and the prices and quantities
3182240	3187600	and practices and norms you had, and that slowly decays, and then by the end, no one is believing
3187600	3194080	in it. That would be my take, but again, you're the expert here, the Russian scholar.
3195760	3203920	Well, perhaps no more an expert than Ayn Rand. It's more personal than it is scholarly or historic.
3204880	3214160	So Stalin held power for 30 years. Vladimir Putin has held power for 21 years,
3214160	3219840	we could argue. He took a little break. But not much. He was still holding power, I think.
3219840	3225920	And it's still possible now with the new constitution that he could hold power for
3225920	3233040	longer than Stalin, 30 years. What do you think about the man, the state of affairs in Russia,
3234720	3240080	in general, the system they have there? Is there something interesting to use in economists as
3240080	3244640	a human being about Russia today? Everything is interesting. I mean, here would be
3244640	3251760	part of my take. As you know, the Russian economy starting what, 1999, 2000, has really quite a
3251760	3258960	few years of super excellent growth. And Putin is still riding on that. It more or less coincides
3258960	3265280	with his rise as the truly focal figure on the scene. Since then, pretty recently,
3265280	3270640	they've had a bunch of years of negative 4% to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible.
3271440	3276720	The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels. But the structural problem is this.
3277520	3283520	You need a concordance across economic power, social power, political power. They don't have to
3283600	3290400	be allocated identically, but they have to be allocated consistently. And the Russian system
3290400	3297120	under Putin from almost the beginning has never been able to have that, that ultimately his incentives
3297120	3302960	are to steer the system where the economic power is in a small number of hands in a non-diversified
3302960	3309840	way. The system won't deliver sustainable gains and living standards anymore, ever the way it's
3309840	3314560	set up now, that with fossil fuel prices go up, they'll have some good years for sure.
3315920	3321360	And that is really quite structural what has gone wrong. And then on top of that,
3321360	3325840	you can have an opinion of Putin. But you've got to start with those structural problems. And that's
3325840	3331200	why it's just not going to work. But he had all those good years in the beginning. So the number
3331200	3337280	of Russians, say, who live here or in Russia, who love Putin and it's sincere, they're not just afraid
3337280	3345200	of being dragged away. That's a real phenomenon. Yeah, I'm really torn on Putin's approval rating,
3345200	3352080	real approval rating. It seems to be very high. And I'm torn in whether that has to do with
3353440	3361120	the fact that there is control of the press or if it's, which is the people I talk to who are
3361120	3367760	in Russia, family and so on, a genuine love of Putin, appreciation of what Putin has done
3367760	3373040	and is going to do with Russia. But a lot of that would go away if the press were freer, I think.
3374240	3378480	Well, Singapore realizes this. Anyone discussed by the press, no matter who they are,
3378480	3384000	people in Singapore have done a great job. But if you're discussed by the press, you don't look
3384000	3390320	good. Tech company executives are learning this, right? It's just like a rule. So in that sense,
3390320	3395360	I think their rating is artificially high. But I don't, by any means, think it's all insincere.
3395920	3400800	But that high popularity, I view as bearish for Russia. I would feel better about the country
3400800	3405600	if people were more pissed off at him. Yeah, that's right. It's nice to see free speech,
3405600	3414240	even if it's full of hate. I am also troubled on the scientific side and entrepreneurial side.
3414240	3422560	It seems difficult to be an entrepreneur in Russia. It's not even in terms of rules.
3423120	3431520	It's just culturally that people I speak to, it's not easy to build a business. No,
3431520	3437120	it's not easy to even dream of building a business in Russia. That's just not part of the culture,
3437120	3443840	part of the conversation. It's almost like the conversation is, if you want to be the next
3443840	3449120	Bill Gates or Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or whatever, you come to America. That's the
3449120	3456320	sense they have. History matters. Is history just structural problems of today?
3457280	3461360	It's all the same thing. So a history of hostility to commerce, which of course,
3461920	3469280	the old USSR is gone, but a lot of the attitudes remain, a lot of the corruption remains. You have
3469280	3474320	this legacy distribution of wealth from the auctioning off of the assets, which is not conducive
3474320	3480560	to some kind of broadly egalitarian democracy. You have these small number of power points
3480560	3486320	that try to control information and wealth and not really so keen to encourage the others who
3486320	3490720	ultimately would pull the balance of political power away from the very wealthy and from Putin,
3491520	3496160	and they support that culture. The return of interest in Orthodox church and all that,
3496160	3502080	it's all part of the same piece, I think, because the old Orthodox church is not that pro-commerce,
3502080	3506480	you'd have to say, but it's traditionalist, it's pro-family, those are safer ideas,
3507280	3511280	and then there's such a great safety valve, the most ambitious, smartest people,
3511280	3516560	like they probably will learn English. They can look like they belong in all sorts of other
3516560	3520960	countries that can show up and blend in. Super talented, they've probably had an excellent
3520960	3525760	education, especially if they're from one of the two major cities, but even if not so,
3525760	3530480	even from Siberia, and they go off, they leave, they're not a source of opposition,
3531120	3533680	and that keeps the whole thing up and running for another generation.
3534720	3543680	Yeah. What do you make of the other big player, China? They seem to have a very different
3544560	3553120	messed up, but also functioning system. They seem to be much better at encouraging entrepreneurs.
3553840	3558080	They're choosing winners, but what do you make of the entire Chinese system?
3560000	3565280	Why does it work as well as it does currently? What are your concerns about it, and what are
3566080	3575120	its threats to the United States, or possible wisdom when two ideas come together? Is there
3575120	3579520	some possible benefits of these kinds of ideas coming together?
3580320	3585840	It's amazing what China has done, but I would say to put it in perspective, if you compare them
3585840	3590560	to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, they've still done much worse,
3591840	3599760	not even close. That's both living standards, or I hesitate to cite democracy as an unalloyed good
3599760	3604880	in and of itself, but there's more freedom in all those other places by a lot. China has all
3604880	3610160	these problems of history, but they've managed, as actually the Soviets did in the middle of the
3610160	3616240	20th century, one of the two great mass migrations from the countryside to cities, which boosts
3616240	3622720	productivity enormously, and will sustain totalitarian systems, but they move from a totalitarian
3622720	3630480	system to an oligarchy, where the CCP is actually, at least for a while, has been really good at
3630480	3636560	governing, have made a lot of very good decisions. You have to admit that. I don't know how long
3636560	3645760	that streak will continue, with one person so much now holding authority in a more extreme manner.
3645760	3651600	The selection pressures for the next generation of high-level CCP members probably become much
3651600	3657040	worse. You have this general problem of the state-owned enterprise is losing relative productivity
3657040	3662480	compared to the private sector. Well, we're going to kind of hold Jack Ma on this island,
3662480	3669520	and he can only issue weird hello statements. It kind of smells bad to me. I don't feel that
3669520	3677200	it's about to crash, but I don't see them supplanting America as the world's number one country.
3677200	3682720	I think they will muddle through and have very serious problems, but there's enough talent there
3682720	3687920	they will muddle through. Is there ideas from China, from anywhere in general, of large-scale
3687920	3694320	role of government that you find might be useful? Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform, UBI,
3695200	3701760	my universal basic income. Is there some interesting ideas of large-scale
3703520	3710080	government welfare programs at scale that you find interesting?
3710480	3717920	Well, keep in mind, the current version of the Chinese Communist Party post Mao dismantled what
3717920	3723760	was called the iron rice ball. It took apart the healthcare protections, a lot of the welfare system,
3723760	3729120	a lot of the guaranteed jobs. The economic rise of China coincided with the weakening
3729120	3736720	of welfare. I'm not saying that's causal per se, but people think of China as having a government
3736720	3741840	that takes care of everyone. It's very far from the truth. By a lot of metrics, I don't mean control
3741840	3746960	over people's lives. I don't mean speech, but by a lot of metrics, economically, we have a lot more
3746960	3753280	government than they do. What one means here by government, private control, I don't think you
3753280	3758880	can just add up the numbers and get a simple answer. They've been fantastic at building
3758880	3764800	infrastructure in cities in ways that will attract people from the countryside. Furthermore,
3764800	3771200	they more or less enforce a meritocracy in this sense. If you're a kid of a rich guy,
3771200	3776800	you'll get unfair privilege. That's unfair, but systems can afford that. If you are smart and
3776800	3782160	from the countryside and your parents have nothing, you will be elevated and sent to a very good
3782160	3787040	school, graduate school, because of the exam system. They do that and they mean that very
3787040	3792320	consistently. It's like the Soviets had a version of that, like the chess and romantic piano,
3792320	3796880	not for everything, but where they had it. Again, they were tremendous.
3799040	3803440	Chinese have it in so many areas, a genuine meritocracy in this one way.
3803440	3809040	That moves people from the rural to the big city and that's a big boost of productivity for
3809040	3813920	so amount of time. When they get there, they're taken seriously. Jack Ma was riding a bicycle
3813920	3820880	teaching English in his late 20s. He was a poor guy. Not a society of credentialism.
3821520	3825280	In America, it's way too much a credentialist society.
3825280	3828960	As we were talking about, even with the Nobel Prize. What do you think about
3829600	3835760	these large government programs like UBI? The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me
3835760	3841840	is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids. Kids are vulnerable. If their parents screw up, you
3841840	3847760	shouldn't blame the kid or make the kids suffer. I believe in something like UBI for kids, maybe
3847760	3855600	just cash. But if you don't have kids, even with AI, my sense is at least in the world we know,
3856320	3862480	you should be able to find a way to adjust. You might have to move to North Dakota to work
3864320	3872960	next to fracking, say. But look, before the pandemic, the two most robot-intensive societies,
3872960	3879520	Japan and the US, at least for manufacturing, were at full employment. Maybe there's some far
3879520	3885040	off day where there's literally no work. John Lennon and Imagine, it's piped everywhere.
3886400	3893760	Then we might revisit the question. But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years and full
3893760	3900240	employment. You don't see automation as a threat that fundamentally shakes our society.
3900240	3904560	It's a threat in the following sense. The new technologies are harder to work with for many
3904560	3911120	people and that's a social problem. But I'm not sure a universal basic income is the right answer
3911120	3920160	to that very real problem. I like the UBI for kids. It's also your definition or the line,
3920160	3925840	the threshold for what is vulnerable and what is basic human nature. Going back to Russia,
3925840	3934880	life is suffering. That struggle is a part of life and perhaps changing. Maybe what defines
3934880	3940480	the 21st century is having multiple careers and adjusting and learning and evolving.
3941920	3954480	Some of the technology we see like the internet allows us to make those pivots easier.
3955840	3961120	Allows later life education possible. It makes it possible. I don't know.
3961120	3964560	And your earlier point about loneliness being this fundamental human problem,
3964560	3970080	which I would agree with strongly, UBI, if it's at a high level, will make that worse.
3970080	3972560	I mean, say UBI were higher enough, you could just sit at home.
3974800	3979360	People are not going to be happy. They don't actually want that. We've relearned that in the
3979360	3987040	pandemic. Yeah. The flip side, the hope with UBI is you have a little bit more freedom to find the
3987040	3992560	thing that alleviates your loneliness. That's the idea. So it's kind of an open question.
3993200	4000560	If I give you a million dollars or a billion dollars, will you pursue the thing you love?
4001520	4007440	Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love, to do the thing you love? Or will you be
4008400	4014160	lazy and lose yourself in the sort of daily activities that don't actually bring you joy,
4014800	4022720	but pacify you in some kind of way where you just let the day slip by? That's an open question.
4022720	4027520	A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions, whether it was Mozart or James Brown
4027520	4033840	or the great painters in history. They had to work pretty hard. And if you look at heirs to great
4033840	4039840	fortunes, maybe I'm forgetting someone, but it's hard to think of any who have creatively been
4039840	4047520	important as novelists or they might have continued to run the family business. But Van Gogh was not
4048480	4057360	heir to a great family fortune. It's sad that cushions get in the way of progress. It's the same
4057360	4061760	point about prizes, right? Yeah. Heriting too much money is like winning a prize.
4062000	4068560	We mentioned Eric, Eric Weinstein. I know you agree on a bunch of things. Is there some beautiful,
4068560	4073040	fascinating insights for disagreement that you have? Does he have to be resolved with him?
4074000	4079600	Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on? Is it the stagnation question that you've
4079600	4086960	mentioned? That's one of them, but here's at least two others. But I would stress Eric is
4086960	4091760	always evolving. So I'm just talking about a time slice, Eric, right? I don't know where he's at
4091760	4096400	right now. Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago, but that was three nights ago.
4097680	4102640	But I think he's far too pessimistic about the impact of immigration on US science.
4103360	4109200	He thinks it has displaced US scientists, which I think that is partly true. I just think we've
4109200	4115360	gotten better talent. I'm like, bring it on, double down. And look at Kurt Eco, who basically
4115360	4121520	came up with mRNA vaccines. She was from Hungary and was ridiculed and mocked. She couldn't cut
4121520	4128320	her papers published. She stuck at it. An American might not have been so stubborn because we have
4128320	4133520	these cushions. So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in, they're discouraging
4134400	4140240	native US citizens from doing math. I'm like, bring in the best people. If we all end up
4141120	4145920	in other avocations, absolutely fine by me. Does it trouble you that we kick them out
4146720	4152400	after they get a degree often? I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree a green card
4152400	4158880	universally. Yeah. I agree with that. It makes no sense. It makes so strange that the best people
4158880	4163760	that come here suffer here, create awesome stuff here. Then when we kick them out, it doesn't make
4163760	4169840	any sense. Here's another view I have. I call it open borders for Belarus. Now, Russia is a big
4169840	4178320	country. I would gladly increase the Russian quota by 3x, 4x, 5x. Not 20%, but a big boost.
4179200	4185760	But Belarus is a small country. They're poor and they have decent education
4186480	4192480	and a lot of talent there. Why can't we just open the door and convert a Belarus passport to a green
4192480	4197520	card? Open borders for Belarus. It's my new campaign slogan. Are you running for president?
4197520	4204080	23 or 24? Well, writings are welcome. What's the second thing you disagree with, Eric?
4205680	4214080	Trade. Again, I'm not sure where he's at now, but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.
4214720	4219760	I do understand what's called the China shock has been a big problem for the US middle class.
4219760	4225920	I fully accept that. I think most of that is behind us. National security issues aside,
4225920	4232960	I think free trade is very much a good thing. Eric, I'm not sure he'll say it's not a good thing,
4232960	4239680	but he won't say it is a good thing. I know he's like, Eric, free trade. But look,
4239680	4244400	on things like vaccines, I don't believe in free trade. You want vaccine production
4244400	4249040	in your own country. Look at the EU. They have enough money. No one will send them vaccines.
4250080	4254560	What's different about vaccines? There's some things you want to prioritize the
4254640	4261120	citizenry on. You could argue it would be cheaper to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.
4261920	4267920	They have the technologies, obviously lower wages. But look, there's talk in India right now of cutting
4267920	4273280	off the export of vaccines. If you outsource your vaccine production, you're not sure the other country
4273280	4279280	will respect the norm of free trade. You need to keep some vaccine production in your country.
4280000	4282160	It's an exception to free trade, not to the logic.
4284720	4289120	A bunch of things the Navy uses. You can't buy those components from China. That's insane.
4291440	4297680	But look, it would be cheaper to do so, right? Yeah. Let me completely shift topics on something
4297680	4302640	that's fascinating. It's all the same topic, but great. Everything is interesting.
4303200	4311200	What do you think about what the hell is money and the recent
4313840	4323120	excitement around cryptocurrency that brings to the forefront the philosophical discussion
4323120	4327840	of the nature of money? Are you bullish on cryptocurrency? Are you excited about it?
4327840	4331760	What does it make you think about how the nature of money is changing?
4331760	4337200	No one knows what money is. Probably no one ever knew. Go back to medieval times. Bills of
4337200	4342880	exchange. Were they money? Maybe it's just a semantic debate. Gold, silver. What about copper
4342880	4347440	coins? What about metals that were considered legal tender, but not always circulating?
4348160	4355200	What about credit? Being confused about money is the natural state of affairs for human beings.
4355200	4357680	If there's more of that, I'd say that's probably a good thing.
4358640	4364480	Now, crypto, per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over a lot of the space held by gold.
4365440	4373360	That to me seems sustainable. I'm not short Bitcoin. I don't have some view that the price
4373360	4376560	has to be different than the current price, but I know it changes every moment.
4378240	4384560	I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto, which seems connected to ultimate visions of
4384640	4392000	using it for transactions in ways where I'm not sure whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.
4393200	4398240	I'm not sure the retail demand really is there once it is regulated like everything else is.
4399360	4405520	I would say I'm 40, 60 optimistic on those forms of crypto. That is, I think it's somewhat more
4405520	4409040	likely they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously.
4409040	4412800	So we're talking about it becoming one of the main currencies in the world.
4412800	4415120	That's what we're discussing. That I don't think will happen.
4416960	4422160	But the reality is that Bitcoin used to be in the single digits of a dollar,
4422160	4428800	and now has crossed $50,000 for a single Bitcoin. Do you think it's possible it reaches something
4428800	4434560	like a million dollars? I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin. If people
4434560	4438800	decide it's worth a million dollars, it's worth a million dollars. But isn't that money, like you
4438800	4443120	said, isn't the ultimate state of money confusion, however beautifully you put it?
4443120	4447680	It's like valuing an Andy Warhol painting. So when Warhol started off, probably those things
4447680	4453520	had no value in the sketches, early sketches of shoes. Now a good Warhol could be worth over
4453520	4459920	$50 million. That's an incredible rate of price appreciation. Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.
4460640	4465680	I don't pretend to know where it will stop, but it's about trying to figure out what did people
4465680	4470880	think of Andy Warhol. He could be out of fashion in a century, maybe yes, maybe no.
4472560	4478640	But you don't think about Warhol's as money. They perform some money-like functions. You
4478640	4485920	can even use them as collateral for deals between gangs. But they're not basically money, nor is
4485920	4490640	Bitcoin. And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin, I would think, is likely to fall, if anything.
4491200	4494480	So you don't think there will be some kind of phase shift? Will it become adopted,
4494480	4500080	become mainstream for one of the main mechanisms of transactions?
4500080	4504640	Bitcoin, no. Now, Ether has some chance at that. I would bet against it,
4504640	4512240	but I wouldn't give you a definitive no. Bitcoin is too costly. It may be fine to hold it like gold,
4512240	4519440	but gold is also costly. You have smart people trying to make, say, Ether, much more effective
4519440	4525440	as a currency than Bitcoin. And there's certainly a decent chance they will succeed.
4525440	4530960	Yeah, there's a lot of innovation. It was smart contracts with NFTs as well. There's a lot of
4530960	4537040	interesting innovations that are plugging into the human psyche somehow, just like money does.
4538320	4545280	Money seems to be this viral thing, our ideas of money. And if the idea is strong enough,
4545280	4549760	it seems to be able to take hold. Like there's network effects that just take over.
4550800	4556720	And I particularly see that with, I'd love to get your comment on the Dogecoin,
4557280	4563120	which is basically by a single human being Elon Musk has been created. It's like these celebrities
4563120	4570800	can have a huge ripple effect on the impact of money. Is it possible that in the 21st century,
4571440	4575280	people like Elon Musk and celebrities, I don't know, Donald Trump, the Rock,
4576000	4584080	whoever else, can actually define the currencies that we use. Can Dogecoin be
4584080	4589120	kind of the primary currency of the world? I think of it as like baseball cards.
4589120	4593920	So right now, every baseball player has a baseball card. And the players who are stars,
4593920	4598720	their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money. And that's stable. We've had it for many
4598720	4605040	decades. Sort of the player defines the card. They sign a contract with Tops or whatever company.
4606000	4610080	Now, could you imagine celebrities, baseball players, LeBron James,
4610080	4615280	having their own currencies instead of cards? Absolutely. And you're somewhat seeing that
4615280	4618960	right now, as you mentioned, artists with these unique works on the blockchain.
4620320	4625040	But I'm not sure those are macroeconomically important. If it's just a new class of collectibles
4625040	4632000	that people have fun with, again, I say bring it on. But whether there are use cases beyond that,
4632000	4637680	the challenge fiat monies, which actually work very well. Yesterday, I sent money
4638480	4644160	to a family in Ethiopia that I helped support. In less than 24 hours, they got that money.
4645040	4651760	Digitally. Yes. No, not digitally, through my bank. My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&T,
4651840	4654640	Mid-Atlantic Bank, had quartered in North Carolina,
4655280	4660720	charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and the OCC. Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate
4661280	4668880	was not so great. I don't see crypto as close to beating that once you take into account all of
4668880	4674800	the last mile problems. The fiat currency works really well. People are not sitting around bitching
4674800	4678880	about it. And when you talk to crypto people, the number who have to postulate some out of the
4678880	4684640	blue hyperinflation, there's no evidence for that whatsoever. That's Denise's sign, they're not
4684640	4688960	thinking clearly about how hard they have to work to outcompete fiat currency.
4690240	4695120	There's a bunch of different technologies that are really exciting that don't want to address
4695760	4700480	how difficult it is to outcompete the current accepted alternative. So, for example, autonomous
4700480	4707120	vehicles, a lot of people are really excited. Yeah. But it's not trivial to outcompete Uber
4707840	4712720	on the cost and the effectiveness and the user experience and all those kinds of...
4712720	4714720	Correct. Sorry, Uber driven by humans.
4714720	4715120	Yes.
4715920	4722400	And it's not, that's taken for granted, I think, that look, wouldn't it be amazing? How amazing
4722400	4726800	would the world look when the cars are driving themselves fully? It's going to drive the cost
4726800	4731440	down. You can remove the cost of drivers, all those kinds of things. But when you actually get down
4731440	4735760	to it and have to build a business around it, it's actually very difficult to do. And I guess
4735760	4742400	you're saying your sense is a similar competition is facing cryptocurrency. You have to actually
4742400	4752720	present a killer app reason to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or whatever.
4752720	4757040	And the Biden people are going to regulate crypto and they're going to do it soon. So,
4757040	4762800	something like DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper or for some can be cheaper than other
4762880	4767760	ways of conducting financial intermediation. But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.
4768400	4773600	It will not be allowed to go on forever for better or worse. I would rather see it given
4773600	4778480	greater tolerance. But the point is banking lobby is strong. The government will only let
4778480	4783920	it run so far. There'll be capital requirements, reporting requirements imposed. And it will lose
4783920	4789760	a lot of those advantages. What do you make of Wall Street bets? Another thing that recently
4789760	4797600	happened that shook the world and at least me from the outside of perspective make me question
4797600	4805280	what I do and don't understand about economics, which is a large number of individuals getting
4805280	4811280	together on the internet and having a large-scale impact on the markets. If you tell a group of
4811280	4815200	people and coordinate them through the internet, we're going to play a fun game. It might cost you
4815200	4818880	money, but you're going to make the headlines. And there's a chance you'll screw over some
4818880	4824400	billionaires and hedge funds. Enough people will play that game. So that game might continue. But I
4824400	4830560	don't think it's of macroeconomic importance. And the price of those stocks in the medium term
4830560	4836640	will end up wherever it ought to be. So these are little outliers from a macroeconomics perspective.
4839440	4846400	These are not signals of shifting power, like from centralized power to distributed power. These
4846400	4851840	aren't some fundamental changes in the way our economy works. I think of it as a new brand of
4851840	4858000	eSports, maybe more fun than the old brand, which is fine. It's like push the anarchy into the
4858000	4864480	corners where you want it. It doesn't bother me, but I think people are seeing it as a more fun
4864480	4869600	amount than it is. It's a new eSport, more fun for many, but more expensive than the old eSports.
4870480	4876800	Like chess is a new eSport. It's super cheap. Not as fun as sending hedge funds to their doom,
4876800	4883360	but what would you expect? The poetry of that. I love it. But macroeconomically,
4883360	4888800	it's not fundamental. I was going to say, I hope you're right because I'm uncomfortable with the
4888800	4895920	chaos of the masses that's creates. I think that chaos is somewhat real, to be clear,
4896800	4905200	but it will matter through other channels, not through manipulating GameStop or AMC.
4906480	4910560	You're seeing the real macro phenomenon. When people see a real macro phenomenon,
4910560	4916080	they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative. This micro story fits the narrative,
4916080	4919520	but it doesn't mean its importance fits the narrative. That's how I would
4920080	4922720	kind of dissect the mistake I think people are making.
4925120	4927760	The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean?
4927760	4932880	Everyone's weird now. The internet either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder.
4932880	4935280	I'm not sure what's the right way to put it. Maybe a mix of both.
4936320	4940960	You're probably right that it allows us to be weirder because, well, this is the other.
4940960	4946480	Okay, so this connects to our previous conversation. Does America allow us to be weirder,
4946560	4951600	or does it make us weirder? Say we're weirder and somewhat neurotic to begin with,
4952160	4956880	but the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower and I Love Lucy and Network TV.
4957680	4963760	That's going to keep us within certain bounds in good and bad ways. That's obviously totally gone,
4963760	4967920	and the internet you can connect to, not just QAnon, but all sorts of things,
4967920	4974160	many of them just fantastic. But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder.
4974160	4977920	So that maybe is troubling, right? Like if someone's worried about that,
4977920	4982800	I would at least say they should give it deep serious thought. And then it has a whole lot of
4983440	4988720	ebbs and flows, micro-realizations of the weirdness that don't actually matter.
4989440	4993760	So like chess players today, they play a lot more weird openings than they did 20 years ago.
4994480	4998960	Like it reflects the same thing because you can research any weird opening on the internet,
4999040	5004320	but like does that matter? Probably not. So a lot of the things we see are just like the
5004320	5008720	weird chess openings. And to figure out which are like the weird chess openings and which are
5008720	5013440	fundamental to the new and growing weirdness. Like that's what a hedge fund investor type
5013440	5019120	should be trying to do. I just think no one knows yet. It's like this itself, this fun weird guessing
5019120	5024880	game, which we're partly engaging in right now. Exactly. And I mean, as Eric talks about
5025840	5031280	on the science side of things, I mean, I said, like at MIT, especially in the machine learning
5031280	5037520	field, there's a natural institutional resistance to the weird. As they talk about,
5037520	5044000	it's difficult to hire weird faculty, for example. Correct. You want to hire and give
5044000	5049600	tenure to people that are safe, not weird. And that's one of the concerns is like,
5049600	5052960	it seems like the weird people are the ones that push the science forward usually.
5053920	5059360	And so how do you balance it too? It's not obvious. It's another area where Eric and I
5059360	5065360	disagree. As I interpret him, he thinks academia is totally bankrupt. And I think it's only
5065360	5071920	partially bankrupt. How do we fix it? Because I'm with you. I'm bullish on academia.
5071920	5077200	You need up and coming schools that end up better than where they started off. And MIT
5077200	5082240	was once one of them. Now they're not in every area. In some areas, they have become the problem.
5083040	5087200	You Chicago, you wouldn't call it up and coming, but it's still different. And that's great. Let's
5087200	5095360	hope they manage to keep it that way. The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism at
5095360	5100560	kind of second tier schools, maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen, that are just trying to
5100560	5106720	be like a junior MIT, but it's mediocre and copycat. And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of
5106720	5111920	weirdness that like Harvard is more open than those second tier schools. And those second
5112000	5116800	tier schools are pretty good, typically, right? Yeah. But the mediocrity is enforced there.
5117360	5122960	Correct. Very strictly. And the homogenization pressure is trying to climb their rankings by
5122960	5127680	another three places and be a little closer to MIT, though you'll never touch them. That to me is
5127680	5133360	very harmful. And you'd rather they be more like Chicago, more like Caltech, or the older Caltech
5133360	5139840	all the more like pick some model, be weird in it. You might fail. That's socially better.
5140480	5148240	Yeah. So the problem with MIT, for example, is the mediocrity is really enforced on the
5148240	5153840	junior faculty. So the people that are allowed to be weird, or actually they just don't even ask
5153840	5158880	for permissions anymore, are more senior faculty. And that's good, of course, but you want the
5158880	5167120	weird young people. I find this podcast, I like talking to tech people, and I find the young
5167120	5171040	faculty to be really boring. They are. They're the most boring of faculty.
5171040	5178800	Their work is interesting technically, technically, but just the passion. They are dredges.
5181280	5186560	And some of them sneak by. Like you have like the young version of Max Tagmark who
5187360	5194160	knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in. And then on the side, he does the weird shit.
5195120	5200800	But they're not, they're far and few in between, which I'd love to figure out a way to shake up
5200800	5206080	that system because. If you look at MIT's Broad Institute, right, in biomedical, it's been a
5206080	5211600	huge hit. I'm not privy to their internal doings, but I suspect they support weird
5212400	5216560	more than the formal departments do at the junior level. Yes, that's probably true. Yeah,
5216560	5223760	I don't know what whatever they're doing is working, but it needs to figure it out because I
5223840	5231280	think the best ideas still do come from the, so forget my apologies, but for the humanity side
5231280	5236400	of things, I don't know anything, Bob, but the engineering and the science side, I think there's
5236400	5240800	so many amazing ideas that are still coming from universities. It's not true that you don't know
5240800	5245600	anything about the humanities. You're doing the humanities right now. We're talking about people.
5245600	5250160	There are no numbers put on a blackboard, right? There's no hypothesis testing per se.
5250880	5256080	You have however many subscribers to your podcast, all listening to you on the humanities.
5257600	5260800	Whatever your frequency is. But I'm not in the department of the humanities.
5260800	5264240	That's why it's innovative. They have very different conversations.
5265520	5273840	The number of emails I get about, listen, I really deeply respect diversity and the full
5274640	5278880	scope of what diversity means and also the more narrow scope of different races and genders and
5278880	5283920	so on. It's a really important topic, but there's a disproportionate number of emails I'm getting
5283920	5289840	about meetings and discussions and that just kind of is overwhelming. I don't get enough emails
5289840	5298720	from people like a meeting about why are all your ideas bad? For example, let me call out MIT.
5298720	5305440	Why don't we do more? Why don't we kick Stanford's ass or Google's ass more importantly in deep
5305440	5311520	learning and machine learning and AI research. What CCEL, for example, used to be a laboratory,
5311520	5319680	is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research. Why is that not the beacon of
5321520	5325040	greatness in artificial intelligence? Let's have those meetings as well.
5325600	5330400	Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism for enforcing conformity.
5330400	5334880	Yes, exactly. It's almost like this conformity mechanism finds
5334880	5338080	the hot new topic to use to enforce further conformity.
5338080	5343280	Exactly. Oh boy, I still hope I'm an optimistic.
5343280	5346880	The humanities have innovated through podcasts, including yours and mine,
5347520	5353760	and they're alive and well. All the bad talk you hear about the humanities in universities,
5353760	5357520	there's been this huge end run of innovation on the internet, and it's amazing.
5357520	5360080	You're right. I never thought, I mean, this is humanities.
5360080	5365920	It's like I've been speaking prose all one's life and didn't know it, right?
5368080	5371840	Yeah, I am actually part of the humanities department at MIT now.
5371840	5376000	I did not realize this, and I will fully embrace it from this moment on.
5376000	5378960	Look, you have this thing, the Media Lab, I'm sure you know about it.
5378960	5381680	Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,
5382320	5384960	but you're out competing them. You're blowing them out of the water.
5384960	5386800	Yeah. Like you are them.
5386800	5391360	Yeah, and I'm talking to those folks, and they're trying to figure it out.
5391360	5396320	I mean, they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on, but outside of that,
5397040	5401680	there's actually gone through a shift with this particular podcast, for example,
5402240	5408880	where at first, it was seen as one, at the very first, it was seen as a distraction.
5409680	5413600	Second, it was a source of almost like a kind of jealousy,
5413600	5418080	like the same kind of jealousy you feel when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.
5418080	5418960	Of course.
5418960	5423680	And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing. We should do more of that.
5423680	5426240	We should embrace this guy. We should embrace this thing.
5426800	5431920	So there's a sense that podcasting and whatever this is, and it doesn't have to be podcasting,
5432880	5437440	will drive some innovation within MIT, within different universities.
5437440	5441120	There's a sense that things are changing. It's just that university is lagged behind.
5441760	5449440	And my hope is that they catch up quickly. They innovate in some way that goes along
5449440	5454160	with the innovations of the internet. I think the internet will outrace them for a long time,
5454160	5458480	maybe forever. Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're, as long as they keep them.
5458480	5462640	Yeah, and we're both in universities, so we have multiple hats on here, as we're speaking.
5463200	5467520	We can complain about the university, but that's like complaining about the podcast.
5468400	5469280	Yeah, we be them.
5470960	5477520	But speaking on the weird, you've, in the best sense of the word weird, you've written about
5477520	5481280	and made the case that we should take you a full sightings more seriously.
5482160	5492960	So that's one of the things that I've been inundated with, sort of the excitement and the
5492960	5500000	passion that people have for the possibility of extraterrestrial life, of life out there in
5500000	5504000	the universe. I've always felt this excitement. I'm just looking up at the stars and wondering
5504000	5511520	what the hell's out there. But there's people that have more like, more grounded excitement
5511520	5517040	and passion of actually interacting with the, with aliens on this here, our planet.
5517840	5524800	What's the case from your perspective for taking these sightings more seriously?
5527600	5533840	The data from the Navy to me seem quite serious. I don't pretend that I have the technical
5533840	5540480	abilities to judge it as data, but there are numerous senators at the very highest of levels,
5541040	5545840	former heads of CIA, Brennan, I talked to him, did an interview with him. I asked him,
5545840	5550640	what's up with these? What do you think it is? He basically said that was the single most likely
5550640	5556240	explanation was of alien origin. Now you don't have to agree with him. But look, if you know how
5556240	5561520	government works, these senators or Hillary Clinton for that matter or Brennan, they sat down,
5561520	5565920	they were briefed by their smartest people and they said, hey, what's going on here?
5566800	5573040	And everyone around the table, I believe is telling them, we don't know. And that is sociological data.
5573760	5578960	I take very seriously. I have not seen a debunking of the technical data.
5578960	5579440	Yes.
5579440	5583760	Which is eyewitness reports and images and radar. Again, at a technical level,
5583760	5589200	I feel quite uncertain on that turf. But evaluating the testimony of witnesses,
5589920	5594320	it seems to me it's now at a threshold where one ought to take it seriously.
5594960	5600320	Yeah, there's a, one of the problems with UFO sightings is that because of people with good
5600320	5607280	equipment, don't take it seriously. It's such a taboo topic that you have just like really
5607280	5612640	shitty equipment collecting data. And so you have the blurry bigfoot kind of situation where you
5612640	5619760	have just bad video and all those kinds of things. As opposed to, I mean, there's a bunch of people,
5621040	5629920	Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Amua Amua. It's just like people with the equipment to do
5629920	5639120	the data collection don't want to help out. And that creates a kind of divide where the scientists
5639120	5643440	ignore that this is happening. And there's the masses of people who are curious about it.
5644000	5650000	And then there's the government that's full of secrets. That's leaking some confusion.
5650640	5654400	And it creates distrust in the government. It creates distrust in science.
5655200	5659760	And it prevents the scientists from being able to explore some cool topics,
5659760	5665280	some exciting possibilities that they should be, be curious kids like Avi talks about.
5665280	5670320	Even if it has nothing to do with aliens, whatever the answer is, it has to be something
5670320	5673600	fascinating. We already know everything's interesting, but this is fascinating.
5675920	5680000	But look, that all said, I suspect they're not of alien origin. And let's let me tell you my
5680000	5685920	reason. The people who are all gung-ho, they do a kind of reasoning in reverse or argument from
5685920	5691520	elimination. They figure out a bunch of things that can't be like, is it a Russian advanced vehicle?
5692320	5696560	No, probably pretty good arguments there. Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle? No.
5697200	5703520	Is it people like from the Earth's future coming back in time? No. And they go through a few others.
5703520	5706960	They have some really good, no arguments. And they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens.
5707840	5713600	This argument from elimination, I don't actually find that persuasive. You can talk yourself into
5713600	5720400	a lot of mistaken ideas that way. The positive evidence that it's aliens is still quite weak.
5720400	5723360	The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.
5724400	5728400	And whatever the solutions to the puzzle is, it might be fascinating.
5728400	5732800	And it's going to be so weird or fascinating or maybe even trivial, but that's weird in its own way
5733600	5738640	that we can't set up by elimination all the things that might be able to be.
5738640	5743200	Yeah. And just like you said, the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things
5743840	5752160	are less explorations and solutions to the puzzle and more a kind of have-hearted dismissal.
5752720	5758640	And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him, he's been attacked an awful lot.
5758720	5762880	And when I hear the idea carrier attacked, I get very suspicious of the critics.
5764560	5771200	If he's wrong, just tell me why. My ears are open. I don't have a set view on Oumuamua.
5772400	5775920	I know I can't judge Avi's arguments. He can't convince me in that sense.
5775920	5779760	I'm too stupid to understand how good his argument may or may not be.
5780560	5787920	And like you said, ultimately, in the argument, in the meeting of that debate
5787920	5792560	is where we find the wisdom, like dismissing it. There's one thing that troubles me.
5792560	5795360	There's a bunch of people like Nietzsche, sometimes dismiss this way,
5795360	5801200	Ein Miranda, sometimes dismiss this way. Oh, here we go. There's a supposed to
5801200	5807520	arguing against her ideas, dismissing it outright. And that's not productive at all.
5808240	5812800	She may be wrong in a lot of things, but like laying out some arguments,
5812800	5818480	even if they're basic human arguments, that's where we arrive at the wisdom. I love that.
5819760	5826640	Is there something deeper to be said about our trust in institutions and governments and so on
5826640	5833120	that has to do with UFOs? That there's a kind of suspicion that the US government and governments
5833120	5836960	in general are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs.
5838160	5842800	This is my view on that. If we declassified everything, I think we would find a lot more
5842800	5848160	evidence all pointing toward the same puzzle. There aren't some alien men being held underground.
5848160	5851520	Yes. There's not some secret file that lays out whatever is happening.
5852560	5858080	I think the real lesson about government is government cannot bring itself to any
5858080	5864640	new belief on this matter of any kind. And it's a funny inertia. Government is deeply puzzled.
5864640	5870080	They're more puzzled than they want to admit to us, which I'm okay with that, actually.
5870080	5874560	They shouldn't just be out panicking people in the streets. But at the end of the day,
5874560	5878960	it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which does work, and they haven't
5878960	5885520	approved it. When are they going to do it? When is our government actually, if only internally,
5886480	5890240	going to take this more than just seriously, but take it truly seriously?
5890800	5894320	And I just don't know if we have that capability, kind of mentally,
5894960	5897600	to sound like Eric Weinstein for another moment.
5899760	5903520	To stay on the same topic, although on the surface shifting completely,
5904960	5911120	because it is all the same topic, you have written and studied art. What do you think we humans
5911360	5917120	mean? Long to create art. Human society in general, and just the human mind.
5917920	5922640	Well, most of us don't really long to create art, right? I would start with that point.
5923760	5929840	You think so? You think that's the unique weirdness of some particular humans?
5929840	5935520	I think, I don't know, 10% of humans, roughly, which is a lot. But it is somewhat weird.
5935840	5939280	Yeah. I don't aspire to create art. You could say
5940000	5945440	a writing nonfiction, there's something art-like about it, but it's a different urge, I would say.
5947920	5955200	So why do some people have it? I think human brains are very different. It's a different
5955200	5960800	notion of working through a problem, like you and I enjoy working through analytic problems.
5960880	5966400	For me, economics for you AI in other areas or your humanity's podcast, but that's fun.
5967600	5973520	For that problem to be visual and linked to physical materials and putting those on a canvas,
5974880	5981440	to me, it's not a huge leap. But I really don't want to do it. It would be pain. If you paid me
5982560	5989280	like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting, I don't know. Is that worth it? Maybe, but
5989920	5995920	I'm happy when that hour's over. And would not be proud or happy with the results?
5995920	5999040	It would suck. I don't think I would do it, actually.
6000080	6006640	Do you think you're suppressing some deep... Absolutely not. Now, when I was young, I played
6006640	6010720	the guitar as you played the guitar, and that I greatly enjoyed, although I was never good.
6011360	6016240	But it helped me appreciate music much, much more. Well, this is the question. Okay. So from the
6016240	6022160	perspective of the observer and the appreciator of art, you said good. Is there such a concept as
6022160	6028160	good in art? There's clearly a concept of bad. My guitar playing fit that concept.
6029520	6033520	Okay. But I wasn't trying to be good. I wanted to learn how do chords work?
6033520	6037040	Okay. Analytical. How does a jazz improvisation work? How is blues different?
6037680	6040560	Classical guitar, sort of physically, how do you make those sounds?
6040560	6044640	Yes. And I did learn those things. And you can't learn everything about them,
6044640	6048560	but you can learn a lot about them without ever being good or even trying to be that good.
6048560	6053680	But I could play all the notes. So from the observer perspective, what do you...
6055360	6060240	Apologize to the absurd question, but what do you use the most beautiful or maybe a moving
6060240	6064800	piece of art you've encountered in your life? It's not an absurd question at all.
6065680	6073440	And I think about this quite a bit. I would say the two winners by a clear margin are both by
6073440	6080720	Michelangelo. It's the Pieta in the Vatican and the David statue in Florence.
6080720	6085200	Why? Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?
6085200	6088960	I don't think you can view it apart from historical context and being in Florence
6088960	6094400	or in the Vatican. You're already primed for a lot, right? You can't pull that out.
6095280	6102000	But just technically how they express the emotion of human form, I do honestly intellectually think
6102000	6107280	they're the two greatest artworks for doing that. That's not all that art does. Not all art is about
6107280	6114160	the human form, but they are phenomenal. And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,
6114160	6118880	but my view is not considered a crazy one within the broader part of critical opinion.
6118880	6125440	Now in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away was to see Vermeer's artwork. It's
6125440	6131760	called the Art of Painting and it's in Vienna in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. And I saw that,
6131840	6138880	I think I was 23. It just stunned me because I'd seen reproductions, but live in front of you
6138880	6142480	in huge, a completely different artwork. And again, Vienna primed.
6143360	6148560	Yes. And I was living abroad for the first time in Vienna itself, the city and so on.
6148560	6152080	Now, unlike the Michelangeloes, that is not my current favorite painting,
6152960	6155360	but that would be like historically the one I would pick.
6155360	6159600	What do you make in the context of those choices? What do you make of modern art?
6159600	6165520	And I apologize if I'm not using the correct terminology, but art that maybe
6167280	6173200	is goes another level of weird outside of the art that you've kind of mentioned and breaks
6173200	6180720	all the conventions and rules and so on and becomes something else entirely that doesn't make sense
6181520	6186880	in the same way that David might. I think a lot of it is phenomenal. And I would say the single
6186880	6193040	biggest mistake that really smart people make is to think contemporary art or music for that
6193040	6197840	matter is just a load of junk or rubbish. It's just like a kind of mathematics they haven't
6197840	6203920	learned yet. It's really hard to learn. Maybe some people can never learn it. But there's
6203920	6209600	a very large community of super smart, well-educated people who spend their lives with it, who love it.
6209600	6213360	Those are genuine pleasures. They understand it. They talk about it with the common language.
6214080	6218640	And to think that somehow they're all frauds, it just isn't true. Like one doesn't have to
6218640	6224000	like it oneself, just like love house may or may not be your thing. But it is amazing and for me
6224000	6229840	personally highly rewarding. And if someone doesn't get it, I do kind of have the conceited response
6229840	6235840	of thinking like in that area, I'm just smarter than you are. Yeah. So the interesting thing is,
6235840	6239040	as with most... We get back to Eric Weinstein again. Yes.
6239040	6243920	Who is in general smarter than I am. This I get. But when it comes to contemporary
6243920	6248720	artistic creations, I'm smarter than he is. So he's not a fan of contemporary art?
6248720	6252000	I don't want to speak for him. I've heard him say... He's evolving always.
6252560	6256400	He's evolving always. I've heard him say derogatory things about some of it. Doesn't
6256400	6261840	mean he doesn't love some other parts of it. So I wonder if there's just a higher learning curve,
6262320	6268080	a steeper learning curve for contemporary art, meaning like it takes more work to appreciate
6268080	6273360	the stories, the context from which they're like thinking about this work. It feels like
6273360	6277600	in order to appreciate the art, contemporary, certain pieces of contemporary art,
6277600	6282800	you have to know the story better behind the art. I think that's true for many people,
6282800	6287120	but I think it's a funny shape distribution because there's a whole other set of people,
6287760	6292880	sometimes just small children, and they get abstract art more easily. You show them Vermeer
6292880	6300640	or Rembrandt, they don't get it. But just like a wall of color, they're in love with it. So
6301680	6305120	I don't think I know the full story. Again, some strange kind of distribution. The entry
6305120	6309040	barriers are super high or super low, but not that often in between.
6311040	6316160	But you would challenge saying that there's a lot to be explored in contemporary art is just
6316160	6324000	you need to learn. Yeah, it's one of the most profound bodies of human thought out there,
6324000	6328720	and it's part of the humanities. And yes, there are people who also don't like podcasts, right?
6330400	6337040	And that's fine. Yeah. He's also been a scholar of food. We're just going through the entirety of
6337040	6344560	the human experience today on this humanities podcast. Another absurd question, say this
6344640	6348720	conversation is the last thing you ever do in your life. We're in the suit,
6348720	6352560	would murder you at the end of the conversation. So this is your last day on earth,
6352560	6358560	but I would offer you a last meal. What would that meal contain? We can also travel to other
6358560	6364160	parts of the world. Well, we have to travel because my preferred last meal here, I probably had like
6364160	6370160	two nights ago. Which is what? Can you describe or no? The best restaurant around here is called
6370160	6377440	Mama Chang's and it's in Fairfax and it's food from Wuhan, actually. And they take pandemic
6377440	6383760	safety seriously in addition to the food being very good. But this is what I would do. I would fly
6383760	6390400	to Hermosillo in northern Mexico, which has some of the best food in Mexico, but I sadly only had
6390400	6398000	two days there. So somewhere like Oaxaca Puebla, I think they have food just as good or some people
6398000	6403920	would say better, but I've spent a lot of time in those places. Wait, is it possible the scarcity
6403920	6408480	of time contributed to the richness of the experience? Of course, but the point is that scarcity
6408480	6415520	still holds. So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo. Can we describe what the food is?
6415520	6419680	It's the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally is just like the Mexican food you get
6419680	6425760	in the US. So there are burritos, there's fajitas. It doesn't taste at all like our stuff. But again,
6425760	6431040	nominally, it's the part of Mexican food that made it into the US was then transformed.
6431040	6436480	Yes. But it's in a way the most familiar. But for that reason, it's the most radical because you
6436480	6442080	have to rethink all these things you know, and they're way better in Hermosillo. Hardly any tourists
6442080	6448000	go there. Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo. Nothing to do other than eat. It's not ruined by any
6448000	6454640	outsiders. It's this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap. And the thing to do there is just sweet
6454640	6461200	talk a taxi driver into first taking you seriously and then trusting you enough to know that you
6461200	6467920	trust him to bring you to the very best like food stands. So where's the magic of that
6469040	6476960	nominally similar entity of the burrito? Where's the magic come from? Is it the taxi ride? Is it
6476960	6481440	the whole experience? Or is there something actually in the food? Well, you can break the food down
6481680	6487360	part by part. So if you think of the beef, the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air
6487360	6492400	in a way the FDA here would never permit. Like they dry age it till it turns green,
6492400	6497440	but it is phenomenal. The quality of the chilies. So here, there's only a small
6497440	6502640	number of kinds of chilies you can get in most parts of Mexico. There's quite a large number
6502640	6507840	of chilies you can get. They're different. They're fresher, but it's just like a different thing,
6507840	6515280	the chilies. The wheat used, so this is wheat territory, not corn territory, which is itself
6515280	6521040	interesting. The wheat is more diverse and more complex. Here, it's more homogenized,
6521040	6528320	obviously cheaper, more efficient, but there it is better. Non-pasteurized cheeses are legal
6528320	6533760	in all parts of Mexico, and they can be white and gooey and amazing in a way that here again,
6533760	6537600	it's just against the law. You could legalize them. The demand wouldn't be that great.
6537600	6541440	There's a black market in these cheeses that Latino groceries around here,
6541440	6547120	but you just can't get that much of it. So the cheese, the meat, the wheat, all different
6547840	6553440	in significant ways. The chilies, I don't think the onions really matter much. Garlic,
6553440	6558560	I don't know. I wouldn't put much stock in that, but that's a lot of the core food,
6558560	6564160	and then it's cooked much better, and everything's super fresh. The food chain is not relying on
6564240	6569920	refrigeration, and this is one thing Russia and US have in common. We were early pioneers
6569920	6574800	in food refrigeration, and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early, and it took us a
6574800	6582000	long time to dig out of that because big countries, right? You've had an extensive rail system in
6582000	6588720	Russia at USSR a long time, which makes it easier to freeze and then ship. What about the actual
6588720	6596400	cooking? The chef, is there an artistry to the simple? I hesitate to call the burrito simple,
6596400	6602400	but- And there's no brain drain out of cooking. So if you're in the United States and you're
6602400	6606000	very talented, I'm not saying there aren't talented chefs. Of course there are,
6606640	6611680	but there's so many other things to pull people away. But in Mexico, there's so much talent going
6611680	6616640	into food, as there is in China, which would be another candidate for last meal questions,
6617360	6624160	or India. Oh, India. That's not even get started. Unbelievable. There's a
6624160	6627360	million things we could talk about here, but you've written about Jiro, dreams of sushi.
6628560	6636480	This is just a really clean, good example that people are aware of, of mastery in the art of
6636480	6644000	the simple in food. What do you make of that obsessive pursuit of perfection in creating
6644000	6648320	simple food? Sushi is about perfection, but it's a bit like the Beatles' white album,
6648320	6654160	which people think is simple and not overproduced. It's in a funny way, their most overproduced album,
6654160	6659680	but it's produced just perfectly. It sounds simple. It's really hard to produce music to the point
6659680	6664240	where it's going to sound so simple and not sound like sludge, like let it be album.
6664960	6670000	There's some great songs, but a lot of it sounds like sludge. One after 909, that's sludge. I dig
6670000	6674640	up on each sludge. Like it's a bit interesting. It's not that good. It doesn't sound that good.
6675600	6679840	White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence. Sounds perfect. Sounds simple.
6679840	6687440	Cry, baby, cry. It's not simple. Back in the USSR. Super complex. Sushi is like that. It's because
6687440	6693680	it's so incredibly not simple, starting with the rice. You try to refine it to make it appear super
6693680	6701120	simple, and that's the most complex thing of all. Do you admire, I mean, we're not talking about
6701680	6707840	days, weeks, months. We're talking about years, generations of doing the same thing over and
6707840	6713280	over and over again. Do you admire that kind of sticking to the, does that, you know, we talked
6713280	6720400	about our admiration of the weird. That doesn't feel weird. That seems like discipline and dedication
6721360	6727280	to like a stoic minimalism or something like that. I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad
6727280	6733440	about it. I feel they're sacrificial victims to me, which I benefit from. But don't you ever think
6733440	6739840	like, gee, you're a great master sushi chef. Wouldn't you be happier if you did something else?
6741680	6746560	Doesn't seem to happen. That might be something that a weird mind would think. Maybe it is weird
6746560	6752720	people, and maybe they're really enjoying it, but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years
6752720	6757680	before they let you do anything else. It's like these Indian, you know, Sarod players,
6757680	6762240	they just spent five years tapping out rhythms before they're allowed to touch their instruments.
6763360	6767520	Well, actually, to defend that. It's kind of like graduate school, right?
6768400	6776960	Well, I think graduate school, perhaps I graduate school is full of like every single day is full
6776960	6783920	surprises, I would say. I did martial arts for a long time, I do martial arts. And I've always
6783920	6790000	loved kind of the Russian way of drilling is doing the same technique. I don't know if this
6790000	6795840	applies into intellectual or academic disciplines where you can do the same thing over and over
6796080	6802560	and over again, thousands and thousands and thousands of times. What I've discovered through
6802560	6808480	that process is you get to start to appreciate the tiniest of details and find the beauty in them.
6809280	6815520	People who go to like monasteries to meditate, talk about this, is when you just sit in silence
6815520	6821920	and don't do anything, you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty there is in just
6821920	6828000	the movement of a finger. Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about how fun it is
6828000	6836240	to move a finger. And then you can almost become your full weird self about the tiniest details of
6836240	6840480	life. The thing you've got to wonder, like is there a free lunch in there? Are the rest of us
6840480	6846960	moving around too much? Yeah, exactly. They sure feel like they found a free lunch that people
6846960	6852800	meditate. They're onto something. I tend to think it's like artists that some percent of people
6852800	6857680	are like that, but most are not. And for most of us, there's no free lunch. Like my free lunch is
6857680	6863920	to move around a lot in search of lunch, in fact. Well, with all the food talk, it made me hungry.
6865600	6872720	What books, three or so books, if any come to mind, technical fiction philosophical,
6873440	6879520	would you recommend? Had a big impact on you? Or you just drew some insights from throughout your
6879520	6885600	life? Well, two of them we've already discussed. One is Plato's Dialogues, which I started reading
6885600	6892880	when I was like 13. Another is Inran Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal. But I would say the Friedrich
6892880	6898880	Hayek essay, The Use of Knowledge in Society, which is about how decentralized mechanisms can work,
6898880	6905040	also why they might go wrong. And that's where you start to understand the price system capitalism.
6905040	6909520	And that was in a book called Individualism and Economic Order. But it was just a few essays in
6909520	6914480	that book. Those are maybe the three I would cite. Can you elaborate a little bit on the...
6914480	6919200	Say the price of copper goes up, right? Because there's a problem with the copper mine in Chile
6919200	6924080	or Bolivia. So the price of copper goes up all around the world. People are led to economize
6924080	6929280	copper, to look for substitutes for copper, to change their production processes, to change
6929280	6935760	the goods and services they buy, to build homes a different way. And this one event creates this
6935760	6942480	one tiny change in information. It gets into your AI work very directly. And how much complexity
6942480	6948640	that one change engenders in a meaningful, coherent way, how the different pieces of
6948640	6956240	the price system fit together. Hayek really laid out very clearly. And it's like an AI problem.
6956240	6960240	And how well, not for everything, but for many things, we solved that AI problem.
6960800	6964000	I learned, I was, I think, 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.
6964800	6966640	The distributed nature of things there.
6967200	6970400	And it's like your work on human attention, like how much can we take in?
6970400	6970800	Yes.
6971600	6976880	Very often, not that much. And how many of the advances of modern civilization you need to
6976960	6981200	understand as a response to that constraint? I got that also from Hayek.
6981200	6982480	What's the title of the book again?
6983680	6987600	It's reprinted in a lot of books at this point. But back then, the book was called
6987600	6994400	Individualism and Economic Order. But the essay is online, Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society.
6994400	6998400	There are open access versions of it through Google. And you don't need the whole book.
6998960	7000000	So it's a very good book.
7000960	7007200	Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean, maybe sitting on a porch,
7007760	7015520	maybe with a drink of some kind. And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice. What advice
7015520	7022800	would you give? A drink. That's my advice. I'm serious. So, okay, after that,
7023680	7030800	what advice would you give to a young person today as they take on life?
7030800	7038240	Whether a career in academia in general or just a life, which is probably more important than career?
7039280	7043920	Most good advice is context specific. But here are my two generic pieces of advice.
7044960	7050000	First, get a mentor. Both career, but anything you want to learn. Say you want to learn about
7050080	7056000	contemporary art. People write me this. What book should I read? It's probably not going to work
7056000	7060080	that way. You need a mentor. Yes, you should read some books on it. But you want a mentor to help
7060080	7065120	you frame them, take you around to some art, talk about it with you. So get as many mentors as you
7065120	7073120	can in the things you want to learn. And then- Caske, a quick tangent on that. Presumably a
7073120	7079120	good mentor. Of course. Is there- I'm begging the question in there. It's complicated, right?
7079120	7082480	Well, it is complicated. Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?
7083200	7086320	I don't think that much because it's very easy to drop mentors. And in fact,
7086320	7090960	it's quite hard to maintain them. Good mentors tend to be busy. Bad mentors tend to be busy.
7092720	7096160	And you can try on mentors and maybe they're not good for you, but you still-
7096160	7101280	There's a good chance you'll learn something. Like I had a mentor. I was an undergrad. He was a
7101280	7106560	Stalinist. He edited the book called The Essential Stalin. Brilliant guy. I learned a tremendous
7106560	7112800	amount from him. Was he like as a Stalinist, a good mentor for me? Fanofiak? Well, no. But for a
7112800	7120800	year, it was tremendous. Yeah. He introduced me like to, you know, Soviet and Eastern European
7120800	7125280	science fiction because he was a Marxist. Like that's what I took from him, among other things.
7125280	7132560	Any advice on finding a good mentor? Daniel Kahneman has- somebody just popped us to mind
7132560	7137120	as somebody who was able to find exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life. There's
7137120	7145840	not many bright minds that find collaborators. They often, which I ultimately see what a mentor is.
7146320	7152160	Yeah. Be interesting, be direct and try. It's not like a perfect formula, but it's amazing
7152160	7156800	how many people don't even do those things. Be interesting, be direct and try.
7157360	7162160	Like what you want from a better known person, I would just say be very direct with them.
7162240	7170000	Yeah. Beautiful. What's the second piece of advice? Build small groups of peers. They don't have to be
7170000	7174400	your age, but very often they'll be your age, especially if you're younger, with broadly
7174400	7179040	similar interests, but there can be different points of view. People you hang out with, which
7179040	7184480	can include in a WhatsApp group online. And like every day or almost every day, they're talking
7184480	7189520	about the thing you care about, trying to solve problems in that thing. And that's your small
7189520	7193760	group and you really like them and they like you and you care what you think about each other,
7193760	7198240	and you have this common interest. That's for human connection or that's for development of
7198240	7203520	ideas? It's both. They're not that different. Like Beatles, classic small group, right?
7205040	7209440	But there's so much drama. The Florentine artists, of course there's drama and small groups tend to
7209440	7215120	split up, which is fine, just like entering relationships often end. But it's remarkable
7215680	7218800	how little has been done that was not done in small groups in some way.
7219840	7227600	So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships, what do you make this whole love thing?
7229840	7235600	Why do humans fall in love? What's the role of love, friendship, family, and life
7237360	7242000	in a successful life or just life in general? Why the hell are we so into this thing?
7242080	7246720	There are multiple layers of understanding that question. So the lowest layer is the
7246720	7252560	Darwinian answer. If we weren't this way, we wouldn't have been successful in reproducing and
7252560	7259120	building alliances. It's important to realize that's far from complete. The highest understanding
7259120	7265520	would be poetic, like read John Keats or many other love poets. So who do I go to to find out,
7265520	7269440	to learn about love in terms of poets? I would say start with John Keats,
7270000	7275680	but given that you're fluent in Russian. Yeah, let's go Russian literature for a
7275680	7285040	second. You keep mentioning Russia. What's your connection? What's your love in Russia?
7285040	7289280	Well, first, it's all interesting, but more concretely, my wife was born in Moscow.
7289280	7295200	Sokolniki was her favorite. Oh, wow. Yeah. Wow. And she grew up there. I married her here.
7295520	7301840	My daughter, I adopted her. I'm not her biological father, but I genuinely raised her. She was born
7301840	7307440	in Russia, though she came here when she was one. Wow. So you're basically Russian? No,
7307440	7312960	no, no. I'm a New Jersey boy. That's the same thing. I'm very sorry to report. My father-in-law
7312960	7320400	passed away a week ago. He lived with us for six years. He lived in Russia till he was 70,
7320400	7328080	saw Stalin, his father was brought to a camp, lived through World War II, much,
7328080	7335680	much more, had an incredible life, never really learned how to speak English. So I absorbed
7335680	7341840	something Russian from him as well. He was part Armenian. So that's my connection to Russia.
7341840	7346640	A bit of the Russian soul, too. I don't think I have it. I think I appreciate it,
7347440	7353280	but there's division of labor, right? Others in the family. Take care of that. I'm more superficial.
7354400	7358960	You mentioned Keats and that higher version, that non-Darwinian love. What's that about?
7359680	7365920	That it's the highest form of human connection, and it's intoxicating, and it's part of building a
7365920	7372480	life, and most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it. And it's part of the highest realization
7372480	7378880	of you being what you can be. Yeah. He mentioned you lost. But ask a Russian. I mean, this is
7379840	7385200	superficial New Jersey boy who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen, and that was his romanticism.
7386800	7393280	What's your favorite Bruce Springsteen song? I think the album Born to Run has actually held up
7393280	7398240	the best. That was very fashionable to think the earlier or later works are actually better,
7398320	7403360	and that's the overproduced Super Pop album. But the quality of the songs to me Born to Run is
7404080	7408720	far and away the best than Darkness on the Edge of Town, and those are still my favorites.
7409760	7416720	Born to Run is an incredible song, and perfectly produced in a Phil Specter kind of way. Every
7416720	7422960	detail is right. Every lyric. What else is on an album? Thunder Row, Jungle Land, 10th Avenue,
7422960	7429600	Freeze Out, She's the Wine, Unbelievable, Meeting Across the River. I really like,
7432000	7439120	I like when he goes into love personally, like I'm on fire. That's a very good song, Dancing in
7439120	7445120	the Dark. A lot of the later work, I find the percussion becomes too simple and kind of too white
7445120	7452000	somehow, and a little clunky. And it's still good work. He's super talented, but it doesn't speak
7452000	7458160	to me. But when it all bursts open into the open road like it does on Born to Run, that's magic.
7459600	7462160	Yeah. Have you ever seen him live?
7463440	7469280	Yes, twice. I wonder what he's like live when he was young, right? Those years.
7469280	7476080	I saw him live when he was young. I was young. New Jersey. I was a little disappointed actually.
7477040	7482800	I think what I like best from him is quite studio. He certainly played well. I don't fault
7482800	7488800	his performance. But it's like when I saw Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin, tremendous creators,
7488800	7493360	and they showed up. They were not drunk. They were paying attention. But I was underwhelmed
7493920	7498480	because Led Zeppelin, like the Beatles White album, is much more of a studio band than you
7498480	7502560	think at first. And in the case of Bruce Springsteen, I don't know about you, but for me,
7503280	7509920	he's somebody that I connect with the most when I'm alone and there's like a melancholy feeling.
7509920	7514320	And actually driving up my folks live in Philly. I went to school in Philly.
7518320	7520000	You're almost worthy of New Jersey then?
7520000	7527920	Yeah. Well, you're almost worthy of Russia. So we can connect and then ask. I mean,
7527920	7536560	I loved your something. I feel like, I don't know. There's this beautiful,
7536560	7543440	like there's an Olga's diner that closed down. I used to go there. There's a melancholy feeling
7543440	7549440	to me. Of course. A thickness to culture in that part of the world, which is oddly similar to some
7549440	7554240	elements of the thickness of Russian culture. And when you see Russian characters on the Sopranos,
7555200	7558320	it totally makes sense, even though they're these complete outliers.
7559360	7565760	Exactly. It totally makes sense. You mentioned you lost your father-in-law last week.
7567600	7574000	Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?
7574720	7578800	I don't think about my own mortality that much, which is probably a good thing.
7579760	7585360	I think death will be bad. I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it. For me, the worst thing about death
7585360	7589680	is not knowing how the human story turns out. The full human story.
7589680	7594480	The full human story. So if I could, right before I die, read like a Wikipedia page
7594480	7599040	called The Rest of Human History and have enough time, just like a few days to absorb it, think
7599040	7604960	about it. And no, like, oh, well, 643 years from now, that's when all the atomic weapons went off.
7604960	7609360	And here's what happened between now and then. I would feel much better dying.
7612080	7614960	Because that's not how it's going to be, right? That's unlikely.
7614960	7621840	It's almost like the Hitchhiker's Guide. They have a one or two sentence description of the human
7621840	7626960	of what goes on on Earth. It's interesting to think if there's a lot of intelligent civilizations
7626960	7632560	out there that in the big Encyclopedia that describes the universe, humans will only have one
7632640	7637440	sentence. Probably true. But it's the only one I can read and understand, right?
7638560	7642720	And it may be hard to understand the human one past a number of centuries.
7646320	7650320	Like how many years from now will reading Wikipedia be like trying to read Chaucer?
7650960	7655680	Which I almost can do, but I actually can't. I need a translation. Probably you can't do
7655680	7660960	it at all. Yeah. I mean, maybe reading will be outdated. It might be a very silly notion.
7661600	7666000	Maybe we're fundamentally, like we think language is fundamental to cognition,
7666000	7669680	but it could be something visual or something totally different that we'll plug in.
7670160	7675760	Neural anchor, yeah. But in that story, that Wikipedia article,
7675760	7679920	do you think there'll be a section on the meaning of it?
7680880	7686480	I hope not. Because that section we could write now and it's just not going to be very good,
7687200	7691520	what would you put in the section on the meaning of human existence?
7691520	7697520	I don't know, links to a lot of other sections. I don't think there are general statements about
7697520	7702640	the meaning of life that have that much meaning. I think if you study different cultures, the arts,
7702640	7707120	travel, mathematics, like whatever your thing is, you'll get a lot about the meaning of life.
7707120	7711760	So like it's there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense. But I don't want to read the page on
7711760	7715920	the meaning. I bet they have such a page. In fact, the fact that I've never visited it,
7715920	7719360	none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler, here's the page on the meaning of life. I know you've
7719360	7723280	been wondering about this. You got to read this one. No one's ever done that to you, have they?
7723280	7727920	It probably has. Well, I actually gone to that page. It does in fact have a lot of links to other
7727920	7736400	pages. Okay. So that's it. The meaning of life is just a bunch of self-referential
7737120	7744400	or citation needed type of statements. I think there's no better way to end it, Tyler. It's a
7744400	7750400	huge honor. I'm a huge fan. Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me. It was one of
7750400	7754560	the greatest conversations I've ever had. Thank you so much. My pleasure and delighted to finally
7754560	7760160	have met you and that we can do this. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tyler Cohen
7760160	7767440	and thank you to Linode, ExpressVPN, SimplySafe, and Public Goods. Check them out in the description
7767440	7772720	to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Adam Smith.
7773680	7779200	Little Else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest
7779200	7784880	barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice.
7785760	7797840	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
