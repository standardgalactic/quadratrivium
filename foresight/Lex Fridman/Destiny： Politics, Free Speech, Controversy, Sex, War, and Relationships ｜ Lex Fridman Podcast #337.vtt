If you have a democratic style of governance, you are entrusting people with one of the most

00:06.000 --> 00:10.240
awesome and radical of responsibilities. And that's saying that you're going to pick the people

00:10.240 --> 00:13.360
that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history. If you're

00:13.360 --> 00:17.520
going to trust people to vote correctly, you have to be able to trust them to have open

00:17.520 --> 00:21.920
and honest dialogue with each other. Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,

00:22.640 --> 00:26.880
you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct

00:26.880 --> 00:31.200
determinations when they hear these types of speeches. And if you're so worried that somebody's

00:31.200 --> 00:35.120
going to hear a certain political figure and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly,

00:35.120 --> 00:38.960
then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy to be a

00:38.960 --> 00:43.200
viable institution, which is fine. You can be anti-democratic, but I don't think you can be

00:43.200 --> 00:50.560
pro-democracy and anti-free speech. The following is a conversation with Stephen Bonnell,

00:51.280 --> 00:56.560
also known online as Destiny. He's a video game streamer and political commentator,

00:56.560 --> 01:01.440
one of the early pioneers of both live streaming in general and live streamed political debate and

01:01.440 --> 01:08.320
discourse. Politically, he is a progressive, identifying as either left or far left, depending

01:08.320 --> 01:13.600
on your perspective. There are many reasons I wanted to talk to Stephen. First, I just talked

01:13.600 --> 01:20.240
to Ben Shapiro and many people have told me that Stephen is the Ben Shapiro of the left

01:20.240 --> 01:26.000
in terms of political perspective and exceptional debate skills. Second reason

01:26.000 --> 01:33.280
is he skillfully defends some nuanced, non-standard views, at the same time being pro-establishment,

01:33.280 --> 01:38.400
pro-institutions, and pro-Biden, while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.000
Third reason is he has been there at the beginning and throughout the meteoric rise of the video

01:46.000 --> 01:52.640
game live streaming community. In some mainstream circles, this community is not taken seriously,

01:52.640 --> 01:59.120
perhaps because of its demographic distribution skewing young or perhaps because of the sometimes

01:59.120 --> 02:05.680
harsh style of communication. But I think this community should be taken seriously and shown

02:05.680 --> 02:11.920
respect. Millions of young minds tune into live streams like Destiny's to question and to try

02:11.920 --> 02:16.880
to understand what is going on with the world, often exploring challenging, even controversial

02:16.880 --> 02:22.160
ideas. The language is sometimes harsher and the humor is sometimes meaner than I would prefer,

02:22.880 --> 02:31.040
but I, grandpa Lex, put on my rain boots and went into the beautiful chaotic muck of online discourse

02:31.040 --> 02:37.680
and have so far survived to tell the tale with a smile and even more love in my heart than before.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.560
On top of all this, we were lucky to have Malina Goranson, a popular streamer and world traveler,

02:44.560 --> 02:50.640
join us at the end of the conversation. You can check out her channel on twitch.tv

02:50.640 --> 02:56.400
slash malina, and you can check out Stephen's channel on youtube.com slash destiny. This is

02:56.400 --> 03:01.360
the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And

03:01.440 --> 03:07.520
now, dear friends, here's destiny. I don't know if you watched me watching your

03:08.080 --> 03:13.200
yay interview. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm so curious. When you're navigating a conversation

03:13.200 --> 03:19.440
like that, are you, how intentional is the thought process between like building rapport and pushing

03:19.440 --> 03:24.560
and giving a little and letting like zero, zero intention? I was watching and thank you so much.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.880
I was very kind for you to review that conversation. It meant a lot that you were

03:28.880 --> 03:34.080
complimentary in parts on the technical aspects of the conversation, but no, zero. And I'm actually

03:34.080 --> 03:41.840
deliberately trying to avoid, I think you've called it debate brain, which is just another

03:41.840 --> 03:50.400
flavor of thinking about like the meta conversation, trying to optimize how should this conversation go.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.040
Because I feel like the more you do that, the better you get at that, the less human connection

03:57.040 --> 04:01.040
you have. Like the less genuinely you're actually sitting there in the moment and listening to the

04:01.040 --> 04:05.520
person, you're more like calculating what's the right thing to say versus like feeling. What is

04:06.880 --> 04:10.640
that person feeling right now? What are they thinking? That's what I'm trying to do is like

04:10.640 --> 04:16.240
putting myself in their mind and thinking, what does the world look like to them? What does the world

04:16.240 --> 04:23.280
feel like to them? And so from that, I truly try to listen. Now I'm also learning, especially because

04:23.360 --> 04:28.240
Rogan and others have been giving me shit for not pushing back. It's good sometimes to say

04:29.440 --> 04:36.800
from a place of care for the other human being to say, stop. What did you just say? I don't think

04:36.800 --> 04:43.840
that represents who you are and what you really mean. Or maybe if it does at that time represents

04:43.840 --> 04:50.560
who they are, I can see a better world if they grow into a different direction and try to point

04:50.560 --> 04:55.040
that direction out to them. There's a really complicated dance between letting somebody

04:55.040 --> 05:00.560
share their full story versus letting somebody like essentially proselytize your audience and

05:00.560 --> 05:06.160
it's like, okay, hold on, let's take a minute here. But yeah, I used to be four or five years ago,

05:06.160 --> 05:10.240
it was attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, whatever you said. And now I'm leaning way more

05:10.240 --> 05:13.360
towards the like, okay, well, tell me how you feel about everything and then we'll go from there.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.640
So a lot of people like my new approach, some older fans will watch and they're like,

05:16.640 --> 05:20.000
why are you letting this guy just ramble on? You know, he said like five or six wrong things and

05:20.000 --> 05:23.040
you're only going to call them out on two of them and it's like, it's different styles of

05:23.040 --> 05:26.720
conversation, but yeah. Do you do a lot of research beforehand too? Depending on the

05:26.720 --> 05:30.000
conversation, yeah. So if we're going to talk like vaccines and stuff, yeah, that's a ton of

05:30.000 --> 05:35.040
reading and stuff that I never thought I'd know going into it. If it's a more personal, like political

05:35.040 --> 05:38.560
philosophy conversation, there's not as much you can prepare for just, it truly depends on the

05:38.560 --> 05:42.960
conversation. How much are you actually listening to the other person? Always listening, you have

05:42.960 --> 05:46.640
to listen because as soon as you stop listening, the quality of everything falls apart, the connection

05:46.640 --> 05:50.320
disappears, the quality of the conversation disappears, but my natural inclination is to

05:50.320 --> 05:54.800
just be way more aggressive than normal. So I have to constantly remind myself, I guess you would

05:54.800 --> 05:58.160
call it a meta conversation when you're like, okay, he's probably saying this because of that or

05:58.160 --> 06:03.360
we'll let him go here and then we'll stop later. But yeah, because my preferred style of conversation

06:03.360 --> 06:06.640
is like, I'm going to talk and the second I say something you disagree with, then let's

06:07.360 --> 06:11.760
iron it out, right? I got like, I think in like syllogisms, like, okay, here's premise A,

06:12.560 --> 06:16.880
good, okay, premise B, okay, and then conclusion. And then as long as we're both deductively

06:16.880 --> 06:20.880
sound, we're not crazy, no psychosis, then we're going to agree on everything. Whereas other people

06:20.880 --> 06:24.560
like to, most people think in stories like narratives, like a whole, there's a whole like

06:24.560 --> 06:28.160
narrative and the individual facts don't matter as much because they'll pick and choose what they

06:28.160 --> 06:32.560
want. And it's really hard because everybody thinks narratives have to function in that world,

06:32.560 --> 06:37.600
but it's frustrating for me sometimes. Well, I've seen, you've had a lot of excellent debates.

06:37.600 --> 06:44.320
One of them I just recently last night watched is on systemic racism. And it's the first time

06:44.320 --> 06:48.640
I've seen you completely lose your shit. Oh, shoot, who was that against? I'm not sure exactly,

06:48.640 --> 06:52.880
but you were just very frustrated and sorry, not lose your shit, but you're frustrated constantly

06:52.880 --> 06:59.200
because of the thing, let's lay out 123. And every time you try to lay it out, it would falter.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.320
I think it had to do with sort of, can you use data to make an argument? Or do you need to use

07:04.320 --> 07:09.120
a study that does an interpretation of that data? And then there's like this tension between,

07:09.120 --> 07:13.520
I think this is a behavioral economist that you were talking to. And the point is, you do this

07:13.520 --> 07:18.000
kind of nice layout that the whole point of behavioral economics, it says there's more

07:18.000 --> 07:23.600
to it than just the data you have to give a context and like do the rich, rigorous interpretation

07:23.600 --> 07:28.080
in the context of the full human story. And then there was like a dance back and forth. Sometimes

07:28.080 --> 07:32.960
you use data, sometimes not, and you're getting really frustrated and shutting down. And so that

07:32.960 --> 07:38.000
felt like a failure mode. I've seen Sam Harris have similar sticking points. Like if we can't

07:38.000 --> 07:47.520
agree on the terminology, we can't go on. To me, I feel like the Wittgenstein perspective is like,

07:48.960 --> 07:52.880
I think if you get stuck on any one thing, you're just not going to make progress. You have to,

07:53.760 --> 08:02.080
part of the conversation has to be about doing a good dance together versus being

08:02.080 --> 08:08.480
dogmatically stuck on the path to truth. I think the true challenge is identifying

08:08.480 --> 08:15.040
what of those sticking points are important versus what is not important. It's like if I'm

08:15.040 --> 08:20.240
having an argument with somebody about Jewish representation and media, it might be like a

08:20.240 --> 08:24.800
big conversation and they might say a couple things. I think Jewish people, they tend to help

08:24.800 --> 08:29.120
their own or whatever and saying, okay. But for the purpose of the conversation, we can keep moving.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.040
But if they casually drop like, yeah, and I think that's why the Holocaust numbers were

08:33.040 --> 08:36.320
blown up from like 100,000 to 6 million. And I was like, okay, hold on, wait,

08:36.320 --> 08:40.720
if you think this, we have to stop here because this is going to be, it's not just a language

08:40.720 --> 08:44.480
game in this part. If you really believe this fact, then the whole rest of the conversation is

08:44.480 --> 08:50.480
going to be informed by that belief. And it has to be something that doesn't bother you personally.

08:50.480 --> 08:55.840
You have to step outside your own ego. So Holocaust denial is somebody that would bother a lot of

08:55.840 --> 09:01.200
people and there's some things just observing you. I feel like when you get really good at

09:01.200 --> 09:08.000
conversation, you can become a stickler to, you might have your favorite terms that really

09:08.000 --> 09:12.640
bothers you. People don't agree on those terms. Beggs the question. You mean racing the question.

09:12.640 --> 09:17.280
Yeah, I usually just want, people say stuff, I just let it slide, yeah. Because if you fight,

09:17.280 --> 09:20.000
when you're having a conversation with somebody and you're talking to their audience at the

09:20.000 --> 09:23.680
same time, because that's really what's happening, you never want to come off as over combative or

09:23.680 --> 09:28.320
over aggressive because it puts people in like, there's like a trigger in your brain and this

09:28.320 --> 09:31.680
is true of relationships or friendships of persuasive rhetoric or whatever. There's a

09:31.680 --> 09:34.640
trigger in the brain and as soon as that defensive trigger gets like flipped on,

09:34.640 --> 09:38.320
everything is over. You've lost the ability to persuade because everything becomes a fight at

09:38.320 --> 09:44.000
that point. Yeah. Well, I wanted to talk to you because I heard somewhere that you were referred

09:44.000 --> 09:49.120
to as the Ben Shapiro of the left and since I'm talking with Ben as well, I wanted to sort of

09:49.120 --> 09:56.960
complete spiritually this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head. You are a progressive

09:56.960 --> 10:01.840
but a progressive with many nonstandard progressive views and you had a heck of a fascinating

10:01.840 --> 10:07.280
journey through all of that. And like I said, I think you argue with passion sometimes with

10:07.280 --> 10:13.200
excessive amounts of passion. That's a really polite way of saying that. Almost always with

10:13.200 --> 10:18.320
good faith and with rigor, with seriousness. I asked on your subreddit, which is an excellent

10:18.320 --> 10:25.040
subreddit. Shout out to the Destiny subreddit so much, at least for that particular post.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.640
What I really loved is when I asked for questions for you, there were like, holy

10:28.640 --> 10:34.880
shit, there's adults and there's all behave. Like nobody say incest. I was like, what was going on

10:34.880 --> 10:39.920
here? But actually the questions that rose to the top were really good. So somebody said that

10:39.920 --> 10:46.560
Destiny was speaking of your journey was a conservative in his early teens. Then he became

10:46.880 --> 10:52.880
libertarian. Then he became a left-wing social justice warrior. Then he flirted with socialism.

10:52.880 --> 10:57.200
And now he is a social democrat liberal. I've also heard you refer to yourself

10:57.760 --> 11:02.960
as a far left person. So to the degree there's truth to that journey. Can you take me through

11:02.960 --> 11:08.560
your evolution through the landscape of political ideologies that you went through?

11:08.560 --> 11:16.400
So my dad comes from Kentucky and my mom is a Cuban immigrant. Cubans are notorious for being

11:16.480 --> 11:21.200
very conservative in the United States for historical reasons and for other reasons.

11:21.200 --> 11:28.080
But my upbringing was a very Republican one. I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck,

11:28.080 --> 11:33.680
Michael Savage on the radio, Billy Cunningham. I think Sean Hannity a little bit later on,

11:33.680 --> 11:37.200
like that was like my whole upbringing politically. I remember I was writing,

11:38.240 --> 11:40.720
I'd written like articles for the school journal, like in favor of

11:41.360 --> 11:45.840
defending the war in Iraq and defending Bush from all the criticism, etc. So that was my

11:46.400 --> 11:52.480
upbringing. I think once I hit high school college, I had my edgy, like libertarian-esque

11:52.480 --> 11:58.160
high school phase of like reading Ayn Rand, of figuring out that like, oh my god, nothing in life

11:58.160 --> 12:02.960
matters except for class and money. That's actually the answer to everything. And I got to college,

12:02.960 --> 12:10.800
I became a Ron Paul fan, very big Ron Paul fan. And then from there, I kind of work, do life, life

12:10.800 --> 12:14.880
happens at the kind of the lowest point in my life in terms of where I'm working financially.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.920
Everything is like kind of in ruin in my life. There's a whole bunch of dumb stuff that's happened

12:17.920 --> 12:22.480
probably my most conservative point. I don't know what it is about like being poor and thinking like

12:22.480 --> 12:25.200
you can work your way out of it, you can do whatever. It's just my upbringing is always just

12:25.200 --> 12:28.800
like, if you're not, if you're not, if you're not having financial success, just work, work, work,

12:28.800 --> 12:33.280
work, work. And then I got into streaming, very, very lucky break. Everything just lined up at

12:33.280 --> 12:36.560
the right time. And then as I've progressed through streaming, I would say through the years,

12:36.560 --> 12:41.520
I've gradually fallen more and more to the left, especially once my kid turned four, five, six years

12:41.520 --> 12:46.320
old. And I started to see like how much different his life was, just because of the financial

12:46.320 --> 12:50.160
opportunities that I was able to provide for him through no merit of his own. And that started

12:50.160 --> 12:54.400
to radically change how I viewed the world in a lot of ways. So actually, let's like linger on that.

12:54.400 --> 13:01.680
Yeah. Low point. You worked at McDonald's, you worked at a casino, you did carpet cleaning.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.960
What was the lowest point? Definitely the carpet cleaning.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.160
Really? Absolutely. Why? Why was it the lowest point? That's when you were just flirting with

13:10.160 --> 13:15.920
starting streaming. My whole life has been a series of lucky breaks, really, truly. I grew up

13:15.920 --> 13:21.920
playing a lot of video games. But back in my day, our day, you had to read, there was a lot of text

13:21.920 --> 13:26.320
on the screen. Back in my day, we used to play... They didn't all talk to you. Yeah, because nowadays,

13:26.320 --> 13:29.760
everything's voice acting. But back then, you'd have to read a lot. I was a really good reader

13:29.760 --> 13:33.200
and a really good vocabulary. Yeah, I've heard you actually say that. What games are we talking

13:33.200 --> 13:36.960
about? What do you mean just reading? You're talking about like RPGs or what? Yeah, JRPGs. So

13:37.040 --> 13:41.040
like Final Fantasy games, Fantasy Stars, all of these, like any RPG that would have been on the

13:41.040 --> 13:45.920
SNES, Sega, PlayStation, these are the things that I'm... Let's pause on that. Okay. I just talked

13:45.920 --> 13:54.880
to Howard, who's of the Elder Scrolls fame and the Fallout fame and beyond. What's your thoughts

13:54.880 --> 14:02.080
on Elder Scrolls? Why Skyrim the greatest RPG of all time? Man, I really don't like Skyrim or Fallout.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.600
You don't love it. Oh, really? No, not at all. Why do you hate Skyrim?

14:05.600 --> 14:09.920
Yeah, so I really like characters and like compelling stories and narratives around those

14:09.920 --> 14:13.920
characters. And I like to see them kind of like grow and change kind of like a movie or a story.

14:13.920 --> 14:18.160
So in your like Final Fantasy games, you've got characters. There are a lot of like,

14:19.440 --> 14:23.840
like classical tropes of like a character starts off kind of like edgy angsty all on their own.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.760
They develop relationships, friendships, they realize that the life is more about themselves

14:27.760 --> 14:31.520
and they do that. And I like that growth. That's kind of what you see in all of those old role

14:31.520 --> 14:35.120
playing games. I didn't like the open world ones as much because your main character is just like

14:35.120 --> 14:40.240
a blank slate, never talks. It's for you to like project onto. But there's not the same like linear

14:40.240 --> 14:44.480
narrative of like growth for the character. Oh, that's fascinating. There's an actual story arc

14:44.480 --> 14:48.960
to the character that's more crafted in a beautiful way by the designers of the game. Yeah.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.240
I don't think one is better or worse. I tend towards like, I want to hear a compelling story

14:52.240 --> 14:55.360
around like a set of characters that like grow and change just again. Oh, that's beautifully

14:55.360 --> 15:01.440
put then. Yeah, I just really loved being able to leave the town, you go outside the town and you

15:01.440 --> 15:06.160
look outside its nature and the world of possibilities is before you. You can do whatever the fuck you

15:06.160 --> 15:11.680
want. I mean, that immensity of just being lost in the world is really immersive for me. But yeah,

15:11.680 --> 15:18.400
you're right. Whatever attracts you about a world. So you were just starting to play video games.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.360
You go out play to video games. That's one of your lucky breaks.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.600
There's just like a lot of random skills you pick up depending on the type of game you play.

15:25.600 --> 15:30.000
I played a lot of tech space games on the computer. So I was a very fast type or I'm still a very

15:30.000 --> 15:35.520
fast type or read a lot, you know, learn weird kind of math stuff for some of the calculations,

15:35.520 --> 15:40.880
some of the games. I think I'm pretty good at getting information, figuring stuff out, learning

15:40.880 --> 15:45.280
patterns, all of that. And then that plus the reading and everything in the games meant that I

15:45.840 --> 15:49.520
I don't want to say I excelled in school because my grades were pretty bad, but I was on like all

15:49.520 --> 15:54.000
honors, all AP classes or whatever. A lot of dual enrollment, a lot of AP credit going into college.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.520
So I did pretty well in school, probably better than I should have, but it was because I had the

15:57.520 --> 16:01.040
game stuff that was like really powering a lot of my brain there while I was trying to sleep

16:01.040 --> 16:06.560
through class. So you're able to soak in information, integrate it, quickly take notes.

16:06.560 --> 16:11.120
Generally, I think I'm pretty good at that. You do this a lot when you stream your typing stuff.

16:11.120 --> 16:16.320
Is there a system in that note taking? And what note what do you use for note taking?

16:16.320 --> 16:23.360
Does it matter? I use a notepad. Like notepad.exe notepad.exe not the plus plus not.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.600
Is there genius to the madness behind that? Or you just don't give a shit?

16:27.600 --> 16:32.080
No, I mean, it's going to depend on the style of conversation. If I'm with somebody that is

16:32.080 --> 16:36.800
very meticulously organized their thoughts and they're a fine and better word here for Rambler,

16:36.800 --> 16:40.240
you can edit that in, better word for Rambler. Somebody that talks a lot and a lot, I'll start

16:40.240 --> 16:44.800
like taking notes, bullet points like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, because there's a

16:44.800 --> 16:48.960
style of conversation where I say seven or eight different things. And then when you go to respond

16:48.960 --> 16:52.480
to everything I said, I cut you off immediately and we argue that point. But if somebody's going

16:52.480 --> 16:55.680
to do that, he's just like, hold on, you just said these eight things, I'm going to respond to

16:55.680 --> 16:58.800
every single one. I've written them all down and then you can go, if you want to go point by

16:58.800 --> 17:01.360
point, we can, but you just said all this and I wrote it down, so we're going to go.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.560
So what are you actually writing down like a couple of words per point they left?

17:05.280 --> 17:09.040
Honestly, like there are very few unique conversations in politics. Like a lot of them

17:09.040 --> 17:13.520
are kind of retreading old ground. So if we're having a debate on abortion, somebody might say,

17:13.520 --> 17:16.800
like, oh, well, I believe this thing about viability. And I believe this thing about, you

17:16.800 --> 17:20.080
know, when they're a fetus versus a human and I'll just write down like those points so that when

17:20.080 --> 17:23.600
I go to respond, I kind of have like a like note cards, like a guiding thing there to

17:23.600 --> 17:27.120
keep me centered on my response. Political discourse is a kind of tree you're walking

17:27.120 --> 17:31.840
down and I got it and you're like taking just to keep my focus guided. So I'm not like

17:31.840 --> 17:34.320
running off in a weird tangent or responding to something I didn't say or something.

17:34.320 --> 17:39.120
What about like doing research? It's just, is there a system to your note taking? Because

17:39.680 --> 17:44.320
mentally, you seem to be one of the most organized people I've listened to. So is there,

17:44.320 --> 17:46.960
is it in your mind or is there a system that's on paper?

17:47.520 --> 17:52.960
A little of both. I feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing if you have interest in an area.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.520
So like what I'll tell people is, let's say there's like a totally new topic that I'm

17:57.520 --> 18:00.480
researching. I don't know anything. And I'll do a couple of these on stream. I think they're boring

18:00.480 --> 18:04.720
about it. People watch it. I might open a Wikipedia article and I'll read and I hit something I don't

18:04.720 --> 18:08.240
know. And then I open the next Wikipedia article and I'll read into and then I might have like seven

18:08.240 --> 18:12.240
tabs open and I'll read and I'll read and I'll read. And I'll read a ton of stuff maybe for

18:12.240 --> 18:15.840
hour two, three, four hours of stuff. And then by the end, you know, someone in chat will ask me

18:15.840 --> 18:20.880
like, do you even remember like this particular thing? And I'll say, not really. No, not too much.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.480
But what happens is as long as you've seen it once, what'll happen is like the next day of the

18:24.480 --> 18:28.720
day after we'll read something else. And we're like, oh, I remember that thing from this thing.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.080
I remember like vaguely that. And then if you see it like a third time, you're like, oh, this

18:32.080 --> 18:37.280
makes sense because especially when it comes to, oh, here's like a little trick on stuff. If you're

18:37.280 --> 18:42.240
ever reading any news and there's a place that pops up, always look at it on a map because so

18:42.320 --> 18:46.480
much of history is like on a map. It's so important to like know the geography. It makes things make

18:46.480 --> 18:51.360
so much more sense. But yeah, once I once I start to see stuff over and over again, just because

18:51.360 --> 18:54.800
I've like read it a few times, stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind and like, oh, yeah,

18:54.800 --> 18:58.240
well, this makes sense. Of course, these people believe this because of this or of course, like

18:58.240 --> 19:02.240
this happened here, it's because you know, that happened there. So yeah, it's a lot of that if

19:02.240 --> 19:07.440
there's like a topic that I'm doing specific research for. So like vaccine related stuff is a

19:07.440 --> 19:12.240
big one. The Ukrainian Russian conflict is a big one. That I'll break out a note. I'll probably

19:12.240 --> 19:15.440
get like a Google doc and I'll just start like writing like an outline of kind of the rough

19:15.440 --> 19:18.880
points of everything just to organize my thoughts around different topics. Yeah.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.240
We're just going to go on tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. We'll return to the

19:22.240 --> 19:26.400
low point of your life at some point, always returning from the philosophy to the psychology.

19:26.400 --> 19:37.760
So you did the Ukraine topic. One question is, what role does US play in this war? Could they

19:37.760 --> 19:44.320
have done something to avoid the war? Did they have a role to play in forcing Vladimir Putin's

19:44.320 --> 19:52.880
hand? Do they have a role to play in deescalating the war towards a peace agreement and the opposite?

19:52.880 --> 19:58.400
If it does escalate towards something like the use of a tactical nuclear weapon,

19:58.400 --> 20:03.600
are they to blame? Are we to blame? Oh man, somebody sent me an email a while ago with great

20:03.600 --> 20:09.520
words. There's a specific way to navigate a conversation where you can kind of like contribute

20:09.520 --> 20:14.800
to a negative event, but you're not really the one responsible for it. Like the classic example

20:14.800 --> 20:18.480
is a woman goes out late at night, gets a little bit too drunk, and then something happens. And

20:18.480 --> 20:22.160
it's like, while there might have been steps you could have taken to mitigate the risk,

20:22.160 --> 20:27.680
it's not her fault of what happened because the responsibility rests on the agent making

20:27.680 --> 20:31.920
the choice, right? There's a chooser at some point that is choosing to do wrong or evil.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.760
I don't believe in any of the arguments that say the United States has contributed to Russia's

20:37.760 --> 20:42.480
position on Ukraine or the actions that they've taken on Ukraine. There are several arguments

20:42.480 --> 20:48.000
that some people, some even political scholars are putting out there to say that the United

20:48.000 --> 20:51.680
States is to blame, but I find them completely unconvincing. I think that when you ask the

20:51.680 --> 20:56.000
question of like, what is the United States role or what has our role been? I think it's

20:56.000 --> 20:58.960
really important for us. I don't think we even agree as a country on what our role should be,

20:58.960 --> 21:02.800
which I think is a hard one because you've got this kind of, there's this growing populist

21:02.800 --> 21:06.560
movement in the United States. It might be the far left and the far right. And I think populists

21:06.560 --> 21:11.120
tend to have this kind of isolationist view of the world where the United States should just be

21:11.120 --> 21:15.200
our own thing. We shouldn't be telling anybody what to do. We shouldn't be the world police.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.720
And then kind of more in these like center left, center right positions. And then across a lot of

21:18.720 --> 21:22.720
Europe, you've got, well, okay, the United States is kind of like the big kid on the block.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.480
Like we're looking to them for guidance and leadership on situations like what's going on

21:26.480 --> 21:31.760
in Ukraine. So in so far as the original question is like, what is like the United

21:31.760 --> 21:36.000
States responsibility? I think we have a responsibility to ensure the relative like

21:36.000 --> 21:41.280
freedom, prosperity and stability across Europe. I think that defending Ukraine's sovereignty

21:41.280 --> 21:45.920
and right to their borders is a part of that. And I don't believe that prior to the invasion

21:45.920 --> 21:51.280
in 2022, I don't think the United States was contributing to Russia invading that country.

21:52.240 --> 21:56.400
I know there are arguments given that like the expansion of NATO has something that's been

21:56.400 --> 22:00.720
threatening to Russia, but the Baltics joined and Russia didn't do anything about it. The

22:00.720 --> 22:05.600
invasion to Crimea was very clearly a response to the revolution in 2014. The invasion on the

22:05.600 --> 22:11.600
borders is clearly a response to Ukraine winning that civil war in the Southeast and the Donbass

22:11.600 --> 22:15.120
and Russia becoming more aggressive. I don't think that you can blame any of that on NATO

22:15.120 --> 22:18.160
expansion. There's no NATO countries that are threatening Russia or debating Russia.

22:18.720 --> 22:24.160
Do you think there is a nuclear threat? Do you think about this? Do you worry about this that

22:24.160 --> 22:28.560
there is a threat of a tactical nuclear weapon being dropped? I think that possibility exists

22:28.560 --> 22:33.520
either way. I think the responsibility for that is on Russia because it just can't be the case

22:33.520 --> 22:37.120
that if you have nukes, you're allowed to invade countries and take their land. Because of anything,

22:37.120 --> 22:42.320
I think that that down the road also increases the potential for nuclear problems in the future,

22:42.880 --> 22:46.400
because at that point, either every single country has to acquire their own nuclear weapons,

22:46.400 --> 22:50.400
because if you don't, Russia's going to mess with you, or every single country has to join NATO,

22:50.400 --> 22:53.440
and now what? We're back at square zero, ground zero, square one, where people are like,

22:53.440 --> 22:56.240
oh, well look, all these countries joining NATO is aggressive towards Russia. What are you going

22:56.240 --> 23:03.120
to do? Yeah, you've mentioned that there's a complicated calculus going on with the countries

23:03.120 --> 23:09.520
that have nuclear weapons, and what's our responsibility? Are you allowed to do anything

23:09.600 --> 23:15.280
you want to countries that don't have nuclear weapons? That's a really tricky discussion,

23:15.280 --> 23:19.520
for sure, because what is U.S. supposed to do if Russia drops a tactical nuclear weapon?

23:20.240 --> 23:29.280
There's a set of options, none of which are good, and it's such a tricky moment right now,

23:29.280 --> 23:36.960
because the things that Biden and other public figures say, I feel like has a significant impact

23:36.960 --> 23:41.040
on the way this game turns out, because I think mutually assured destruction is partially a game

23:41.040 --> 23:50.400
of words. I mean, I believe in the power of conversation of leaders talking to each other.

23:50.400 --> 24:01.040
I feel like you have to have a balance between threat and compromise, and empathy for the needs,

24:01.040 --> 24:09.920
the geopolitical, the economic needs of a nation, but also respect and represent your own interests.

24:10.960 --> 24:16.720
It's a tricky one. How do you play the hand? It reminds me of, I don't know if you've ever

24:16.720 --> 24:20.160
heard of evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology. There are things called tit for tat

24:20.160 --> 24:25.120
strategies. It reminds me of that, where there are a whole bunch of these little biological

24:25.120 --> 24:28.560
mechanisms where creatures will develop, like socializing, like tit for tat. If you do something

24:28.640 --> 24:32.720
bad to me, I'm going to do something bad for you, and then more complicated schemes will come out,

24:32.720 --> 24:37.200
where it'll be like tit, tit for tat, where it's like you can make one mistake, and then I'm going

24:37.200 --> 24:40.640
to get you to do a second one, or it could be tit, tit, tit for tat, or there could be tit for tat,

24:40.640 --> 24:46.800
tat for tat. There's all these back and forths where creatures optimize themselves. I think

24:46.800 --> 24:50.400
something the United States did really well in terms of that kind of conversational strategy,

24:50.400 --> 24:55.280
and I approved of this in the beginning, was Biden was very clear about setting out the exact

24:55.280 --> 24:59.520
level of US involvement for the war. We're not going to do a no-fly zone. There's not going to be

24:59.520 --> 25:02.800
US troops on the ground in Ukraine, but we are going to send a whole bunch of money and a whole

25:02.800 --> 25:06.560
bunch of arms and a whole bunch of intel to them. I thought he did a good job at laying out the

25:06.560 --> 25:10.480
limitation of the US involvement while opening as much as we could in the ways that we could help,

25:11.040 --> 25:16.080
but that looming threat of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon, I think on the table right now

25:16.080 --> 25:19.520
is like it's going to be the annihilation of Russian seaforces and everything, but

25:20.400 --> 25:24.000
what happens if it continues to escalate? That's like a world that nobody wants to

25:25.520 --> 25:30.000
be in. Yeah. So we talked about difficult conversations, and again, thank you so much

25:30.000 --> 25:37.760
for reviewing the Yale conversation. Let me ask you about Putin. Speaking of difficult conversations,

25:37.760 --> 25:42.880
so if you sit down, if I sit down with somebody like Vladimir Putin or Vladimir Zelensky,

25:43.680 --> 25:47.440
what's the right way to have that conversation? Oh man. We can talk about that one or we could talk

25:47.440 --> 25:57.520
about somebody more well understood through history like Stalin or Hitler, something like that.

25:57.520 --> 26:04.080
Maybe that's an easier example to illustrate how to handle extremely difficult conversations.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.960
Yeah. I mean, I can handle really difficult conversations between like two people,

26:07.760 --> 26:12.560
leaders of countries though. There's so much that you are representing in that conversation.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.560
I guess the thing that would be interesting to me would be like, what is Vladimir Putin's

26:18.560 --> 26:24.400
interest? What is the genuine interest that he has in the conflict? Because I think finding out

26:24.400 --> 26:28.400
like what is your buy-in or what is the driving force keeping you here is probably the most

26:28.400 --> 26:32.480
important thing. I think for Zelensky, I think it's quite a bit more simpler because he's

26:33.440 --> 26:38.080
on the defense, so it's defending his country and his people. For Putin, I've heard all sorts of

26:38.080 --> 26:43.600
things. Dugan has his writings on like the East versus the West, the collapse of the West in the

26:43.600 --> 26:49.280
face of all of the liberalism and the weird LGBT stuff that they criticize. You've got the desire

26:49.280 --> 26:53.840
to return to this former Soviet Union-esque thing. You've got Putin's quotes that collapse of the

26:53.840 --> 26:59.680
Soviet Union was the biggest geopolitical disaster of 20th century. I guess figuring out what is

26:59.680 --> 27:02.080
Putin after. I'm not actually sure. I don't know the answer to that question. I know a lot of people

27:02.080 --> 27:05.760
write about it, but yeah. Well, there's a lot of answers to that question. There's a lot of answers

27:05.760 --> 27:09.520
that he can give to that question, so say I sit down with him for three hours and talk about it.

27:10.880 --> 27:17.040
I think this is a really interesting distinction because you do do difficult conversations

27:17.040 --> 27:22.720
in the space of ideas, but also in your stream, there's a bunch of drama going on. There's the

27:22.720 --> 27:31.200
human psychology is laid out in its full richness before you. To me with leaders, I think a part of

27:31.200 --> 27:36.800
the conversation has to be about the human psychology, not like a meta-conversation, but

27:38.400 --> 27:45.120
really understand what they feel, what they fear, who they are as a human being. As a family man,

27:45.920 --> 27:51.760
as a person proud of their country, as a person with an ego, as a person who's been

27:52.480 --> 27:59.520
affected, if not corrupted by powers, all of us can be and likely are. All of that,

27:59.520 --> 28:05.840
that gives context to then the answers about what do you want in this war, because the answers

28:05.840 --> 28:12.400
about what you want in this war will be political answers. It's a game that's being played again

28:12.400 --> 28:17.280
with words, and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game. I think the deeper truth

28:18.320 --> 28:24.000
comes from understanding the human being from which those words come, and I think that's what

28:24.000 --> 28:27.760
you do. I don't know if you do those kinds of conversations where- Never talked to any country

28:27.760 --> 28:33.040
leader, so- No, not a country leader, but say a controversial figure or somebody that represents

28:33.040 --> 28:38.880
a certain idea. Don't just talk in a space of ideas or challenge the ideas, but understand who

28:38.880 --> 28:43.360
is this person, how did you come to those ideas? Oh yeah, when I've had, there have been a couple

28:43.360 --> 28:48.960
of very controversial right-leaning figures. So the two, obviously the mainstream is made by

28:48.960 --> 28:55.200
Lauren Southern and Nick Fuentes. Those types of conversations initially aren't very political at

28:55.200 --> 29:00.240
all. Yeah, it's more like, obviously we believe in very, very, very different things that beliefs

29:00.240 --> 29:03.680
don't happen accidentally, so how did you get to where you are? Those are way more personal

29:03.680 --> 29:09.440
conversations, that's true. Is there things you regret about those conversations where you failed?

29:09.440 --> 29:14.960
Is there things you're proud of or you succeeded? For things that I'm proud of, I feel like I'm

29:14.960 --> 29:20.080
really good at attempting to understand people without judgment, that I think a lot of people

29:20.080 --> 29:23.440
feel like they can have conversations with me where they can share a lot, and I'm not going to jump

29:23.440 --> 29:28.880
down their throat for them having a politically incorrect observation, or for them being judgmental

29:28.880 --> 29:32.480
to somebody else or having a feeling that's maybe not something they should have something they're

29:32.480 --> 29:36.400
embarrassed about. So I think I do a really good job at that, and then by extension of that,

29:36.400 --> 29:39.840
I've gotten the ability to hear perspectives from so many different people that I think I can

29:39.840 --> 29:45.360
understand a lot of different perspectives. For failures of mine, I mean it's always going to be

29:46.720 --> 29:50.400
on stream, it'll be like I didn't push back hard enough or I didn't know a certain fact for a

29:50.400 --> 29:54.800
conversation. These are usually the they're going to be on these like very technical grounds

29:54.800 --> 29:58.160
generally. I'm pretty happy with like the direction my conversations have gone

29:58.800 --> 30:01.760
recently, especially over like the past six months. So your goal is to

30:02.800 --> 30:10.800
de-radicalize the audience of those folks. So that used to be my goal. My goal was de-radicalization.

30:10.800 --> 30:14.640
Now I'm kind of hoping that that's just the byproduct. So the goal I think is to talk to

30:14.640 --> 30:19.200
somebody and to show they believe this because of these reasons, and if you want to change

30:19.200 --> 30:22.640
people's beliefs, we have to talk about the underlying reasons for why they think the things

30:22.640 --> 30:26.400
they think. It's not enough to just say like that belief is bad because it's like, well,

30:26.400 --> 30:30.000
they believe it for a whole bunch of things that are true and real to them at least. So you have

30:30.000 --> 30:34.320
to address all of the underlying things that they believe before you can change the overlying

30:34.320 --> 30:38.560
belief. So if I'm having a conversation with somebody, it'll be like, okay, why do you feel

30:38.560 --> 30:42.960
this about that, that, and that? Okay, I understand that. Maybe like a better way to solve that would

30:42.960 --> 30:48.320
be like this or that instead of this thing. So to what degree do you have to empathize with the

30:48.320 --> 30:55.840
person's worldview versus pushback? That's always the hard one. When I'm talking to other people,

30:55.840 --> 31:00.560
it's almost always me stepping as much inside their bubble as I can. I have to like live and

31:00.560 --> 31:05.360
breathe their worldview and be able to speak their worldview in order to like navigate their thoughts.

31:05.360 --> 31:10.720
Because my worldview is, and I'm not even used as an insult. I don't know if I am a little bit

31:10.720 --> 31:14.320
autistic or something, but when I break apart things, I just want to see like study, study,

31:14.320 --> 31:18.000
study, fact, fact, fact. That's how my mind works for everything. That's what I like to see.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.760
Personal stories don't do much for me. Narratives don't do much for me. Just show me like the

31:21.760 --> 31:25.680
data and the studies or whatever. But for other people, I think most brains are more human than

31:25.680 --> 31:30.240
that and they tend to see things in more kind of like surreal pictures that are kind of painted

31:30.240 --> 31:34.240
and the brush strokes are way broader and they don't care about the itty-bitty tiny fact.

31:35.040 --> 31:38.400
So if I'm talking to somebody else and I'm trying to get into their head and I'm trying

31:38.400 --> 31:43.040
to change their mind on things, I'm going to be stepping into their world and I'm going to try

31:43.040 --> 31:48.400
to be working through that framework. Really good example might be, we'll say like when it comes

31:48.400 --> 31:53.360
to trans issues for minors, okay, 16 or 17-year-old needs to go on puberty blockers. The way that I

31:53.360 --> 31:58.720
want that debate to play out is let's look at all the data, let's see what are the outcomes,

31:58.720 --> 32:01.840
let's see what are the processes for getting a medication, and then we'll evaluate all of that

32:01.840 --> 32:05.920
and then we'll go in whatever like points more favorably. But that's wholly unconvincing to

32:05.920 --> 32:09.600
most people, right? So as a parent, if I'm having that conversation with another parent,

32:09.600 --> 32:13.280
the easiest way for me to have that conversation is like, hey, we both have kids.

32:13.280 --> 32:16.800
Imagine how horrible it would be if we felt like our kids needed help and the government

32:16.800 --> 32:21.120
was trying to get between us and their doctor in that conversation. That might be how that

32:21.120 --> 32:24.160
talk plays out, which I mean, I think that's a really good argument because I think there

32:24.160 --> 32:26.640
probably are times when the government should get in between it, but I'll have that conversation

32:26.640 --> 32:30.880
because now I'm in a world where they understand what I'm saying, I'm resonating with the way

32:30.880 --> 32:34.800
that they feel about things and then I can make progress with the way that they're kind of viewing

32:34.800 --> 32:39.120
the world because I'm talking in a language they understand. So on this particular topic of

32:39.120 --> 32:45.120
trans issues, is that the reason you were banned from Twitch? I'm not sure. I don't know. They just

32:45.120 --> 32:49.520
said hate speech, but I don't use like slurs or anything. So it's hard to know exactly. So I think

32:49.520 --> 32:54.480
you made the claim that trans women shouldn't compete with cis women in the women's athletics.

32:55.680 --> 33:01.680
Can you make this case and can you still man the case against it? I think in your community,

33:01.680 --> 33:07.920
there's a lot of trans folks who love you and there's a lot who hate you. Yeah. And so if you

33:07.920 --> 33:14.000
can walk the tightrope of this conversation to try to steal men both sides. One of the argumentative

33:14.000 --> 33:17.200
strategies I say is that like anytime you have a conversation, you should be able to argue both

33:17.200 --> 33:24.640
sides better than anybody else. So for the my side, the genuine belief side, it feels like

33:24.640 --> 33:32.960
overwhelmingly all of the data is showing that trans women, even after I think three years on

33:33.040 --> 33:39.680
some sort of like HRT or estrogen stuff, they're still maintaining these advantages from their

33:39.680 --> 33:45.680
male puberty over cisgender women. And if that is the case, if we are going to draw these distinctions

33:45.680 --> 33:51.040
around our sports between women and men, it feels unfair to have a category inside the women's

33:51.040 --> 33:56.320
sports that are maintaining advantages that are coming from a male puberty, regardless of the

33:56.320 --> 34:02.160
amount of time they've spent on hormone replacement therapy. So that would be my argument on that side.

34:02.160 --> 34:08.560
So it's unfair from a performance enhancement aspect. So the same way we ban performance

34:09.760 --> 34:15.680
enhancing drugs that involve increasing of testosterone in that same way would be unfair.

34:15.680 --> 34:22.800
Essentially, yeah. So what's the case against? So the case in favor of them competing together is

34:22.800 --> 34:29.360
that realistically, there's not going to be a trans sports category. Realistically, trans women

34:29.360 --> 34:32.240
aren't going to be competitive with cis men because they've gone through these huge,

34:32.960 --> 34:38.000
you know, like hormone changes by the medication they're taking. And that when we look at how

34:38.000 --> 34:43.440
sports are kind of done anyway, there's a whole bunch of biological differences between people

34:43.440 --> 34:47.920
within sports categories that are determining their placement in the professional world.

34:47.920 --> 34:52.320
So for instance, somebody like me is probably never going to go far in the NBA because I'm not

34:52.320 --> 34:56.320
tall enough. I think the average height in the NBA. Don't doubt yourself. Don't doubt myself yet.

34:56.320 --> 35:02.240
I want to say like six or something. They're huge people. Or, you know, you look at like Michael

35:02.240 --> 35:07.360
Phelps is a classic example of a guy whose torso is like so long his body is built for swimming.

35:07.360 --> 35:10.800
And I think there are some trans people that will look at that or somebody advocating for

35:10.800 --> 35:15.040
this position. They'll look at that and go, okay, realistically, the way that Michael Phelps body

35:15.040 --> 35:19.520
processes lactic acid, the shape physiologically of his body is going to put him in a level of

35:19.520 --> 35:24.240
competition that so many men are never going to reach just because of biology. How is it fair

35:24.240 --> 35:28.160
that you can have these biological outliers competing in these categories? But then when we

35:28.160 --> 35:31.840
come to like sports categories with trans and cis women, you're going to take trans women and say

35:31.840 --> 35:35.440
that they can't compete against cis women. Can't you also just say that they have some level of

35:35.440 --> 35:39.040
biological difference there? Like, is it really going to be that great of a difference than what

35:39.040 --> 35:43.360
Michael Phelps has versus the average swimmer or an NBA player has versus like the average height

35:43.360 --> 35:50.480
male? Yeah, do you think we're going to get into some tricky ethical territory as we start to be

35:50.480 --> 35:57.120
able to, through biology and genetics, modify the human body? Absolutely. I feel like those

35:57.120 --> 36:03.680
things are coming sooner than we wanted them to. Oh, man, dude, have you seen the AI art?

36:03.680 --> 36:09.840
Yes, of course. I'm an AI person. Oh, okay, then yeah, yeah. That's always been like,

36:09.840 --> 36:14.240
what's going to happen when robots can do art better than humans, lol? Like, well,

36:14.240 --> 36:18.800
we'll see you in 20 years and 20 years and 20 years. And now you have AI art winning competitions.

36:19.280 --> 36:25.280
And it's funny because robots are essentially... There's a robot behind you, by the way.

36:25.280 --> 36:30.880
A robot behind me. Oh, nice. Robots are really good at... Careful what you say. Yeah. Oh,

36:30.880 --> 36:34.800
god, I'll be careful. That's not like the one of the Chinese ones with a gun on it, right? Oh, okay.

36:36.080 --> 36:41.760
Hopefully not. We'll see, depending on what you say, yeah. Robots are really good at showing

36:41.760 --> 36:48.480
the limitations of the human mind in categories that we didn't believe we were limited before.

36:48.720 --> 36:56.400
I think that humans have this idea, intrinsically, that we have some type of innovative creative

36:56.400 --> 37:02.400
drive that is just outside of the bounds of physical understanding. And with a sophisticated

37:02.400 --> 37:06.880
enough program, we see that maybe that's not actually true. And that's a really scary thing

37:07.440 --> 37:11.440
philosophically to deal with because we feel like we're very special, right? We own the planet,

37:11.440 --> 37:15.280
we make computers, and the idea that you can start to get these robots that can do things that's

37:15.360 --> 37:20.160
like, okay, you can do math, fine. Okay, you can do calculations, fine. But you can't do art.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.840
That's the human stuff. And then when they start to do that, it's like, oh, shoot.

37:23.840 --> 37:29.520
And that terrifies you a little bit, like the human species losing control of our dominance?

37:30.800 --> 37:34.160
I don't think it's necessarily losing control of our dominance. I mean, I guess a Skynet thing

37:34.160 --> 37:40.320
could come in at some point. But I think it brings us to this really fundamental level of like,

37:40.320 --> 37:44.400
what does it mean to be human? What is it that we're good at? What should we be doing with

37:44.400 --> 37:48.960
technology? We never really asked that question in the Western world. It's always the technology is

37:48.960 --> 37:53.600
like normative in that technology equals good, and more technology equals better. That's been

37:53.600 --> 37:57.440
like the default assumption. In fact, if you ask a lot of people, how do you know if civilization

37:57.440 --> 38:01.680
has progressed over the past 100 or 200 years, they don't say we have better relationships,

38:01.680 --> 38:05.600
we, you know, have longer marriages, we blah, blah, blah, they'll say technology has improved.

38:05.600 --> 38:10.320
We've got crazy phones, we've got crazy computers. And the idea that more technology might be bad

38:10.320 --> 38:13.840
has never even crossed somebody's mind, unless it's used for like a really bad thing. So,

38:13.920 --> 38:18.000
well, it's interesting. We kind of think as more and more automation is happening,

38:18.000 --> 38:22.880
we're going to get more and more meaning from things like being artists and doing creative

38:22.880 --> 38:29.360
pursuits. And here's like, oh, shit, if the art, if the creative pursuits are also being automated,

38:29.360 --> 38:32.800
then what are we going to gain meaning from? What are the activities from which we'll gain

38:32.800 --> 38:37.120
meaning? You know, my whole life I've been working on artificial intelligence systems. There's been

38:37.120 --> 38:43.360
different revolutions. One of them is the machine learning revolution. And it's interesting to build

38:43.440 --> 38:51.120
up intuition and destroy that intuition about what is and isn't solvable by machines. I think

38:52.240 --> 38:56.800
for the longest time, I grew up thinking go is not, the game of go is not solvable.

38:58.480 --> 39:02.160
Because my understanding of AI systems is ultimately that it's

39:04.000 --> 39:09.360
fundamentally a search mechanism that is fundamentally going to be brute force. There's

39:09.360 --> 39:13.920
no shortcuts. Sure. Like if it can't solve the traveling salesman problem, it's not even

39:13.920 --> 39:18.240
going to be able to give you an approximation. So most interesting problems are giant travel

39:18.240 --> 39:21.920
salesman problem. And then, so of course, it's not going to be able to solve that. And then you,

39:22.560 --> 39:27.680
then the deep learning revolution made you realize, holy shit, these large neural networks with a

39:27.680 --> 39:38.080
giant number of knobs is able to actually somehow estimate functions that can do a pretty good job

39:38.080 --> 39:44.080
of understanding deep representation of a thing, whether that's a game of go, or whether it's the

39:44.080 --> 39:51.520
human natural language, or if it's images and video or audio and even actions and different

39:51.520 --> 39:57.280
video games and actions of robotics and so on. And then you realize with diffusion models and

39:58.400 --> 40:03.760
different generative models, you start to realize, holy shit, it can actually generate not just

40:04.720 --> 40:12.480
interesting representations or interesting manifestations of the representations and forms,

40:12.480 --> 40:17.600
but it's able to do something that impresses humans in its creativity. It's beautiful in

40:17.600 --> 40:22.000
the way we think of art is beautiful. Like it surprises us and makes us chuckle and makes us

40:22.800 --> 40:27.520
sit back and all and all those kinds of things. And yet the thing that it seems to struggle with

40:27.520 --> 40:32.880
the most is the physical world currently. So that's counterintuitive. We humans think that it's

40:33.920 --> 40:40.720
pretty trivial, being able to pick up a cup, being able to write with a pen in the physical

40:40.720 --> 40:45.440
space, we think that's trivial. We give ourselves respect for being great artists and great

40:46.080 --> 40:50.240
mathematicians and all that kind of stuff. And that seems to be much easier than the physical

40:50.240 --> 40:55.280
space. Our bodies are really cool. There is a, I don't know, it's probably Asimov or something,

40:55.280 --> 40:58.480
there was some science fiction writer that had a short story and it was like an alien that had

40:58.480 --> 41:02.720
landed on earth and it was describing our bodies from a totally alien perspective. And when you

41:02.720 --> 41:08.320
think about all the things we can do, it's pretty cool. We can climb through a whole multitude of

41:08.320 --> 41:13.920
environments. We can exist in a multitude of temperatures. We can manipulate things just

41:13.920 --> 41:18.240
with our hands and the way that we can interact with things around us. And yeah, we're very capable

41:18.240 --> 41:21.360
on a physical level. Even though, like you said, we think about ourselves like, oh, well, human

41:21.360 --> 41:25.040
beings have really big brains and we do. We're really intelligent as well, but our bodies are

41:25.040 --> 41:33.520
pretty cool too. And it's a fascinating hierarchical biological system. We're made up of a bunch of

41:33.520 --> 41:41.280
different living organisms that all don't know about the big picture of our body and it's all

41:41.280 --> 41:47.120
functioning its own little local world and it's doing its thing, but together as it forms a

41:47.120 --> 41:57.120
super resilient system, all of that comes from a very compressed encoding of what makes a human.

41:57.120 --> 42:04.640
You start with the DNA and it builds up from a single cell to a giant organism. And because of

42:04.640 --> 42:09.760
the DNA through the evolution process, you can constantly create new humans and new living

42:09.760 --> 42:14.160
organisms that adapt to the environment. Like that resilience to the physical world,

42:15.040 --> 42:20.960
it seems like running the whole earth over again, the whole evolutionary process over again,

42:21.600 --> 42:27.520
is might be the only way to do it. So to create a robot that actually adapts

42:28.800 --> 42:33.520
is as resilient to the dynamic world might be a really difficult problem.

42:34.240 --> 42:37.920
Possibly. Well, it's going to say like in a programming environment, you can do things on

42:37.920 --> 42:42.640
time scales that are impossible in the real world, right? Like the benefit to AI and computers is

42:42.720 --> 42:47.520
computationally, they can compute so much data so quickly. Whereas on human timetables, we have

42:47.520 --> 42:52.240
to wait. When you talk about evolution, you know, it's generation after generation after

42:52.240 --> 42:56.400
generation, you know, maybe in a virtual environment that could be simulated and then those changes

42:56.400 --> 43:00.160
could happen a lot quicker. Well, that's not a human time scale, but you have to look at earth

43:00.800 --> 43:06.320
as a quantum mechanical system, the computation is happening super fast. This is a giant computer

43:06.320 --> 43:11.760
doing a giant simulation. So just because for us humans, it's slow, there's like trillions of

43:11.840 --> 43:17.760
organisms involved in you, destiny being you. Sure. But the next iteration of like,

43:17.760 --> 43:21.840
from human to human, even if on the quantum level, there's a lot of stuff going on, you talk about

43:21.840 --> 43:26.720
like, like changes in DNA, for instance, right? Like, that's happening from a generation to

43:26.720 --> 43:30.160
generation time scale, like in a virtual environment that could theoretically happen.

43:30.160 --> 43:34.080
Well, it already is, there's like protein folding, like huge cloud computing,

43:34.080 --> 43:36.800
probably ML stuff that's like working on doing all that stuff, and it'll run like

43:36.800 --> 43:40.400
trillions and trillions of simulations, you know, every second and stuff, maybe not every second,

43:40.400 --> 43:46.800
but still slower than the actual protein folding, much slower. That's for the problem

43:46.800 --> 43:53.200
of solving protein folding to estimate the 3D structure, but the actual body does the actual

43:53.200 --> 43:58.960
protein folding way faster. So like we're, the question is, can we shortcut the simulation of

43:59.520 --> 44:03.360
human evolution, try to figure out how to build up an organism without

44:03.920 --> 44:08.240
simulating all the details? Because we have to simulate all the details of biology were

44:08.240 --> 44:12.160
screwed. We don't have- Oh, sure. We'd have to put something in a pond and then watch it for-

44:12.160 --> 44:14.320
That might be the most efficient way to do it. Sure.

44:14.320 --> 44:19.520
That's what the universe most likely is. It's a kind of simulation created by a teenager in

44:19.520 --> 44:25.200
their basement to try to see what happens. It's a computer game. That might be the most

44:25.200 --> 44:31.760
efficient way to create interesting organisms, but within the system is perhaps possible to create

44:31.760 --> 44:39.520
other robots that will be of use and will entertain us in the way that other humans

44:39.520 --> 44:44.880
entertain us. And that's a really interesting, of course, problem, but it's surprising how

44:44.880 --> 44:50.400
difficult it has been to create systems that operate in the physical world and operate in

44:50.400 --> 44:56.160
that physical world in a way that's safe to humans and interesting to humans. Because there's also

44:56.160 --> 45:00.560
the human factor, the human robot interaction. To me, that's like the most interesting problem,

45:00.560 --> 45:07.520
to figure out how to do that well. Elon Musk and others, Boston Dynamics have worked on

45:07.520 --> 45:13.280
legged robots, so I really care about legged robots. Those are super interesting, how to

45:13.280 --> 45:18.800
make them such that they're able to operate successfully in a dynamic environment. It's

45:18.800 --> 45:25.040
super tricky. They're like the dumbest of dogs, speaking of which is a dog barking outside.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.520
It's really tricky to create those kinds of organisms that live in the human world.

45:31.520 --> 45:39.760
Then again, if more and more of us move into the digital world, to you stream a lot,

45:39.760 --> 45:46.000
like part of who you are exists in the digital space. The fact that you have a physical

45:46.000 --> 45:51.280
representation also, maybe more and more will become not important.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.600
I hope that's the case, because I bought a lot of stock in Meta, and man, it's down

45:56.240 --> 46:02.240
a lot. Meta the company. Is there some degree? Can you look at yourself,

46:02.240 --> 46:07.200
like Steven, the physical meat vehicle, and then the destiny of this digital space,

46:07.760 --> 46:14.000
like digital avatar? Do you sense that in a certain way, you're the digital avatar?

46:14.560 --> 46:18.400
I've always tried to keep my on-stream personality as genuine as possible. They're

46:18.400 --> 46:21.920
one and the same to me. I don't really view them as two separate entities, but I mean,

46:21.920 --> 46:26.800
I always view myself as Steven, the real-life person. Destiny's my online name, but...

46:26.800 --> 46:31.440
No, but because so many, your social network has established the digital space. So many people

46:31.440 --> 46:36.240
know you through the digital space. Can we swap out another person that looks like you

46:37.040 --> 46:41.680
in the AI system, and then that entity known as Destiny will continue existing?

46:43.280 --> 46:47.680
There must be some level of sophistication that could emulate a human brain, I would imagine.

46:49.120 --> 46:53.760
Probably tech's not there yet, but... Well, the question is, what's the level of sophistication

46:53.760 --> 46:59.520
of the audience that would recognize that something has changed? Like, it's the Turing test.

47:00.240 --> 47:06.800
How hard is it to trick your audience, your large audience of fans that watch your streams,

47:07.360 --> 47:14.720
that when you swap out an AI that emulates you, that nothing has changed? And the question is,

47:14.720 --> 47:18.640
do you have to really simulate so much of the human brain for that? I don't think so.

47:19.280 --> 47:26.480
Probably not. So, I mean, like you said, a lot of political discourses are just walking down the

47:26.480 --> 47:31.280
tree together, so you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion. Yeah, it would depend on if

47:31.280 --> 47:35.200
you're doing old data sets, and you're training on that, and I'm having conversations about abortion

47:35.200 --> 47:38.400
and your crane and vaccines. I imagine it could do it for quite a while. The only thing that would

47:38.400 --> 47:43.280
be weird is when novel issues pop up, then you probably need a more sophisticated resemblance

47:43.280 --> 47:47.040
of the inner brain, right? You have to keep training on the internet, so how the language

47:47.040 --> 47:50.960
models, and that's the most incredible breakthroughs, is the language models. You just have to keep

47:50.960 --> 47:57.200
retraining the system on Reddit, which is actually what a lot of it is trained on, which is hilarious.

47:57.200 --> 48:01.040
I do think it's really interesting that kind of funny problems, like the trolley problem,

48:01.040 --> 48:05.680
that we can kind of work through our normative ethical systems are now real questions. Like,

48:05.680 --> 48:08.800
if you're driving a Tesla and it's an autopilot and you're going to hit somebody, but a conservative

48:08.880 --> 48:15.040
hit somebody else, what ought the system do? We went very quickly from fun kind of project in

48:15.040 --> 48:19.600
philosophy class to we need to solve this for insurance purposes as quickly as possible. It's

48:19.600 --> 48:24.480
kind of interesting to think about. Actually, I'll bring up the trolley problem with you later.

48:25.040 --> 48:30.800
There's a fascinating version of it that I find hilarious. Okay, let's return to your low point.

48:32.800 --> 48:37.760
You started playing video games. That was a lucky break. You did text-based ones. That was a lucky

48:37.760 --> 48:43.040
break because you got to be pretty good at learning. Then you started thinking about going to college

48:43.040 --> 48:47.520
and so on. What happened next? I went to like a prep school. You kind of have to go to college

48:47.520 --> 48:51.040
after. That's like the point, right? I was also millennial. All of us had to go to college. That's

48:51.040 --> 48:57.840
always what they told us. My life was kind of, it's hard to describe. I didn't really think

48:57.840 --> 49:01.040
much of the future. I was just kind of enjoying the day-to-day because everything in my life was

49:01.040 --> 49:06.160
pretty weird. Both my parents had moved to Florida by the time I was 16, 17. I was living with my

49:06.160 --> 49:11.200
grandma. I was working. I had a girlfriend. Moved out. We got a place. Did college.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.480
By the time I got into college, I had transitioned from working at McDonald's to,

49:16.480 --> 49:20.880
I was like working in a casino restaurant basically. I was really good at that job,

49:20.880 --> 49:26.480
so a high level of patience for drunk people and sane people. I was doing music in school

49:26.480 --> 49:32.720
because I've really grown to love music. My thought process was I can do music as a hobby,

49:32.720 --> 49:35.440
I guess, unless I get really good and maybe I can make money with that. Otherwise,

49:35.440 --> 49:38.800
I love music. I'm okay going to school for music, getting good at it, and then just doing that on

49:38.800 --> 49:45.360
the side. My main job would kind of be this career I was building at the casino. Basically,

49:45.360 --> 49:49.440
the trying to balance personal life plus graveyard shift, six-day hour weeks at a casino,

49:49.440 --> 49:54.080
and then a full-time music degree was not possible for me. Eventually, I had to drop school after,

49:54.080 --> 49:58.400
I think it was like three years. After I dropped school to maintain my casino job,

49:59.120 --> 50:03.840
after a few months, I got fired from my casino job. I'd essentially just thrown away the past

50:04.160 --> 50:08.480
three or four years of my life. Why did you get fired from the casino job? I heard there's a story

50:08.480 --> 50:12.160
behind that. Yeah, there's a story. Basically, I was just really dumb when it came to understanding

50:12.160 --> 50:16.320
corporate politics. This is funny because the same attitude kind of followed me into the streaming

50:16.320 --> 50:21.680
world. My thought process has kind of always been that as long as I'm really good at what I do,

50:21.680 --> 50:24.800
I should be untouchable. If I'm really good, you can't do anything to me. I don't have to play

50:24.800 --> 50:30.400
any dumb games or whatever. At the casino, I think I was the youngest, it was originally

50:30.720 --> 50:36.560
the supervisor position at the casino. When I started to get my own shifts, there were problems

50:36.560 --> 50:40.960
that I would run into on graveyard shift because of carryover from the swing shift. One of these

50:40.960 --> 50:44.480
problems was underneath the soda machine, they weren't cleaning it properly and fruit flies were

50:44.480 --> 50:50.640
showing up. The manager came in one morning and she was like, hey, what's going on with the machine?

50:50.640 --> 50:55.360
I told her, listen, I can't take everything from swing shift and do everything at grave shift.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.480
I can't do this. They need to figure out their stuff better or I need more employees. It's not

50:58.480 --> 51:01.760
possible for me. She's like, what did you tell anybody? I was like, yeah, I complained to the

51:01.760 --> 51:06.880
supervisor on the swing shift all the time. She told me, if you're not getting the answer that

51:06.880 --> 51:11.840
you like, then it's your responsibility to email the next person up. I was like, oh, okay, that's

51:11.840 --> 51:17.920
interesting. Some months went on and I ran into more problems because on graveyard, here's how,

51:17.920 --> 51:21.200
I don't know if it's everywhere, but morning shift is the easiest and that's when you're the

51:21.200 --> 51:24.560
most overstaffed because that's when all the VPs are in and that's when all the managers are there

51:24.560 --> 51:28.320
and everybody blah, blah, blah. Swing shift is the most challenging. It's where your highest

51:28.320 --> 51:31.920
flow of customers is. You're also decently staffed there, but there's a lot of stuff going on.

51:31.920 --> 51:36.640
In graveyard, nobody cares at all about you. They don't give you any employees. You might get swamped.

51:36.640 --> 51:39.680
You might not. Who cares? Make sure it's clean for day shift. That's the only thing that matters.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.040
A quick question for sort of clarification. So this is a 24 hour?

51:43.600 --> 51:47.520
24 hour dyno. Yeah, inside a casino. Yeah. So it's a dyno in a casino. Oh, by the way,

51:47.520 --> 51:52.560
I had an amazing moment at a dyno in a casino recently. It's a special place. A dyno in a casino

51:52.560 --> 51:56.800
is a place of magic. There's a lot of, I don't know if I'd say magic, but there's a lot of other

51:56.800 --> 52:02.000
worldly stuff going on. There's characters. There's, and I had an interaction with the waitress that

52:02.000 --> 52:06.560
was the sweetest waitress in the world. And it was just like, I don't know, made me feel less alone

52:06.560 --> 52:13.760
in this cruel world of ours. So graveyard begins when? For me, my shift was 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

52:13.760 --> 52:19.600
or sometimes I got called in early, so it'd be 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. That's no love for that shift.

52:19.600 --> 52:22.080
No, especially not trying to do school at the same time. Absolutely not.

52:22.960 --> 52:27.280
But yeah, basically, long story short, I ran into a problem where I didn't have enough employees on

52:27.280 --> 52:30.960
my shift. VPs were coming in in the morning. There's something like, hey, the diner's kind of dirty.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.480
And I'm like, you've cut all my employees past 4 a.m. Like on some nights, I'm literally cooking

52:34.480 --> 52:40.000
and doing front of house, like all on my own. Like I can't do this. And my manager, Pam, told me,

52:40.000 --> 52:44.400
well, you've got to figure it out. And so I remembered her advice. So I emailed the VP of

52:44.400 --> 52:47.920
food and beverage and I CC'd her and I said, I'm not getting the help I need in my restaurant.

52:47.920 --> 52:50.800
Now, I didn't know at the time that I was basically completely throwing her under the bus

52:51.360 --> 52:57.200
because of that email. But retroactively, when I look back on things or retrospectively, I see

52:57.200 --> 53:01.440
that was the moment that I got marked for deletion. And I didn't really understand it,

53:01.440 --> 53:05.200
even though I'd heard terminology for papering somebody out the door. But after that point,

53:05.200 --> 53:10.400
I started to get written up for a lot of little random things. I'd missed one day of work in my

53:10.400 --> 53:14.480
three years at the casino. And I started to get written up for showing up one or two minutes

53:14.480 --> 53:18.960
late. That's kind of weird. That's whatever. Or written up for random ways about filing paperwork.

53:18.960 --> 53:23.200
And then eventually there came a situation with another employee where they were,

53:23.200 --> 53:26.240
it's complicated, it has to be like call out stuff. But basically, they wanted to come or

53:26.240 --> 53:29.600
they wanted to call out. And I told them if they called out, they were going to get fired because

53:30.160 --> 53:33.600
they were at like 10 points, they were at nine points and 10 points is firing, blah, blah, blah.

53:33.600 --> 53:36.800
Pam told me, you can tell her that she's going to get a point, but you can't tell if she's going

53:36.800 --> 53:40.000
to get fired. I don't know what that meant. And then I told her that if you call out, you're going

53:40.000 --> 53:43.280
to get, you know, you're fucked, you're going to get fired, or you're going to be at 10 points.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.360
And then I got called in early, like three days later, and Pam was like, you inappropriately

53:47.360 --> 53:50.800
communicated with an employee because you said the F word and a text message. And I'm like,

53:50.800 --> 53:54.000
really? There's no shot. And she's like, well, you also tried to fire the employee. And I was

53:54.000 --> 53:56.880
like, no, I told her she was going to get 10 points. She's like, well, you use the F word.

53:56.880 --> 54:01.840
I'm like, this is insane. And just because I was such a high performing employee, there's no way

54:01.840 --> 54:06.240
I'm getting fired. And then I did. And I was like, yeah, cash shot my 401k and moped for like three

54:06.240 --> 54:11.120
months because I had thrown away school for this casino job. And then I got fired from this job

54:11.120 --> 54:15.360
that like, yeah, nobody believed I got fired. It was just insane. So if you look back, if you

54:15.360 --> 54:20.240
were allowed to not just look back to your own memory, but actually watch yourself like some

54:20.240 --> 54:25.360
of your court video that whole time, do you think you would be surprised you would notice some things

54:25.360 --> 54:32.160
like potentially of not having a self awareness, not having like social, like a civility and social

54:32.160 --> 54:38.080
etiquette that's played in the human relations? Yeah, absolutely. So is that is that at the core

54:38.080 --> 54:42.240
of it, essentially? Yeah, I think so. I mean, it follows me even to this day, there's a lot of,

54:43.280 --> 54:46.320
I don't know if you're recording or not, but when we spoke early about like meta conversations,

54:46.320 --> 54:49.280
I have to think a lot sometimes about meta conversations because the way that I want to

54:49.280 --> 54:53.200
drive a conversation will sometimes be way different than what is like the best way to

54:53.200 --> 54:58.000
have a conversation. Whereas I just want to like go really hard on like some itty bitty, like

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
some idiosyncrasy, some factor figure, whatever, but that's not like the human conversation I need

55:02.000 --> 55:09.920
to have, you know? So you got fired slash left that job, and that took you to the job that would

55:09.920 --> 55:16.400
be the lowest point? Yeah, because there was a huge downgrade in pay. I went from getting like,

55:16.400 --> 55:20.320
I think at the casino, because I worked so much overtime, I was like 22.50 an hour on all my

55:20.320 --> 55:26.080
overtime fifth, and this was back in 2008, 2009, as like a college student, like it's amazing pay.

55:27.360 --> 55:30.720
I had benefits, like everything was good. And then the carpet cleaning was like,

55:30.720 --> 55:36.880
I was probably getting my paycheck like every other week was maybe 1500 bucks or $1,000. And

55:36.880 --> 55:42.080
I'm working like 13 day stretches, like I have every other Sunday off, and it's so many hours,

55:42.080 --> 55:45.920
like I have to show up at the shop at like seven or six, and then I go home at like

55:45.920 --> 55:49.760
eight or nine, depending on when my jobs are throughout the day. You doing businesses or

55:49.760 --> 55:54.560
residential or what are you doing? Everything. Everything. Are you working for a company this

55:54.560 --> 55:59.120
company? Yeah. Okay. And so like there's a schedule thing, you have to go to it and so on.

55:59.120 --> 56:03.760
Yeah, but so like, this is why the schedule would suck is sometimes I'd show up at, I think we had

56:03.760 --> 56:08.400
to be in the shop at, I think it was 7am. We show up at the shop at 7am. First job might be at eight

56:08.400 --> 56:12.240
or nine, but that job might be like a one hour job. So I might show up at 7am and have a job from

56:12.240 --> 56:17.360
830 to 930. Then my next job might not be from, until like say 11. So from 830 to 930, I'll do

56:17.360 --> 56:22.640
one job. And then I'm going to drop from like 11 to 12 or something. Then I might have like a decent

56:22.640 --> 56:29.760
job from like five to eight, but like my whole day is destroyed and I'm doing like three smallish

56:29.760 --> 56:34.960
jobs. So I'm getting like 30 bucks maybe for being in the shop or you know, my job for like 10 or 11

56:34.960 --> 56:39.680
hours and it's just like horrible. So you're somebody that seems to be extremely good at

56:39.680 --> 56:46.400
thinking and conversation. And so I have a bit of an ego perhaps in both the negative and the

56:46.400 --> 56:51.040
positive sense of that word. Was there some aspect of working at McDonald's

56:52.160 --> 56:56.880
and then working at the casino and then working for the, as a carpet cleaner that was humbling?

56:57.680 --> 57:05.920
No, never. The ego burned bright through it all. Well, or no, you can pitch back in the ego.

57:05.920 --> 57:09.680
Yeah, no, I understand. I totally get what you mean. I had a really close friend growing up

57:09.680 --> 57:13.520
whose name was Chris. And I think we probably met when he was, we were like four or five,

57:13.520 --> 57:18.720
I think he lived behind me. And I grew up with him and I'd always been kind of an outsider to the

57:19.360 --> 57:24.480
world that I was in once I got to high school for sure. Because all of those kids were incredibly

57:24.480 --> 57:29.200
wealthy, you know, Corvettes and Mustangs when they turned 16, it was a prep school. And I was

57:29.200 --> 57:32.560
doing the, they had like a work study program there where you could stay after school from

57:32.560 --> 57:37.600
two 30 to five every day to kind of like work to pay for your tuition. So I've been working like

57:37.600 --> 57:41.760
throughout all of high school. I got another job at McDonald's when I was 18, worked at the casino.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.440
I'd always been doing that kind of work. I never really viewed it as like beneath me or anything.

57:45.440 --> 57:49.120
It's not like I don't have like a family of doctors or lawyers or anything. And then me and my other

57:49.120 --> 57:53.280
friend, Chris, we'd always make fun of everybody else for being kind of like, you know, like preppy

57:53.280 --> 57:59.760
kids and everything. So there is a, there's some pride to that sort of hard work. Yeah, I guess

57:59.760 --> 58:02.800
a little bit. Yeah. Because, you know, looking especially at my dad, like the solution to every

58:02.800 --> 58:07.200
problem was just throw more hours of work at it basically. So that was always my, yeah, go to.

58:08.080 --> 58:12.640
What was psychologically the low point? I think psychologically the low point was that

58:13.280 --> 58:19.600
as I'm doing this carpet cleaning job, driving around my city, there's like this feeling of,

58:21.760 --> 58:25.680
I guess for a lot of people it's probably college, but there's a feeling when you're in high school

58:25.680 --> 58:30.880
that everything is like so exciting and the whole world is kind of in front of you. And

58:30.880 --> 58:36.080
there are a trillion, trillion different branching paths of possibilities. And you know, even through

58:36.160 --> 58:39.920
high school, you're thinking like, am I going to be a doctor or a lawyer or can I join the

58:39.920 --> 58:45.520
MBA or can I do this or that? There's all these things in front of you. And when I especially

58:45.520 --> 58:49.920
felt it when I was doing these carpet cleaning jobs and I think it was in the fall, I'd be

58:49.920 --> 58:53.280
outside some of these houses and I just kind of look around and I'd recognize a lot of these

58:53.280 --> 58:57.200
neighborhoods that I'd drive around with friends in or I'd, you know, be walking through. I ran

58:57.200 --> 59:00.480
cross country, some of them I'd be running through these neighborhoods. And it was just kind of like

59:00.480 --> 59:04.960
this feeling of looking around. And it was like, when I was here in the past, this was like kind

59:05.040 --> 59:09.360
of like a transitionary phase of my life where I'm doing this and it's so fun and exciting. And

59:09.360 --> 59:12.480
then I'm going to move on to something else and it's going to be fun and exciting and awesome.

59:12.480 --> 59:17.680
And then like, you know, two years later, my whole life has collapsed. Like I'm in a house that I

59:17.680 --> 59:24.640
can't afford anymore. My ex that I hate is pregnant with my kid. And I have no money. I've got no

59:24.640 --> 59:31.520
upward mobility. I failed college. My job is horrible. Like just every single like this is like

59:31.920 --> 59:36.240
all of those, the wave function had collapsed into one thing and that one thing was the worst

59:36.240 --> 59:40.080
thing that could have possibly been at the time for me. Yeah. Like everything was gone and horrible.

59:40.080 --> 59:43.040
So yeah, that was the feeling I had at the time. Do you ever contemplate suicide?

59:43.680 --> 59:47.520
I thought about thinking about it, but I've just never been that kind of person. So

59:48.160 --> 59:53.280
I mean, basically as a way to escape from the hardship, something that I'm so incredibly lucky.

59:53.280 --> 59:58.080
I don't know why or how I'm just going to chalk it up to biology. I've always had really high

59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.480
mental baseline. I've like depression and all of that. There have been a few short stints of

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.440
debt with it past 30 because I did a lot of drugs. But other than that, my mental baseline is just

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.640
so high. And even in the carpet cleaning days, like if you, man, the videos might still be there.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.400
I think on my old YouTube channel channel where I'll be like playing Starcraft when I first started

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.440
to get into streaming and I'll be calling up customers like this is Steve from guaranteed

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.880
clean. We had to move your job back one hour. Is it okay if I show up instead of 230? And then

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.440
I hang up and it's like, all right, guys, we got three more games and it's like, let's go.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.640
Like stuff like that. So my, my baseline has always been like really high for mental function.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.800
So even in low point, there's that you had strength. Is there, is there anything you can give

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.680
by way of advice from people that for home to wave function collapses as it does for many of us?

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.640
Like, holy fuck, the world is not full of opportunity and you're kind of a failure.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.200
Like I've, I've been there. Yeah, I don't know. It's rough because like,

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.480
I usually ask for compassion from people that have it better off because like, once you're down

01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:00.320
there, like the only reason I say I got lucky, but it wasn't even really lucky. Like, or it was

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.760
lucky, but it was more lucky. It wasn't just lucky that I got into streaming. It was lucky that I

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.040
was into computers at an early age. It was lucky that I played video games at an early age. It

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.440
was lucky that all the tech came up at exactly that right point in time. Like I was a pretty smart

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.400
guy, but it was definitely a preparation meets opportunity and that opportunity was like at

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.640
the exact precise moment of my life. If anything had gone differently than I would just be cleaning

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.480
carpets today. So, so in the many worlds, interpretation of quantum mechanics,

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.360
this is like one out of like, there's many, many Stevens, they're just still carpet cleaning

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.960
and they're full of pain and resentment. Yeah. The one piece of advice that I give,

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.640
I hate that I have to push back against all these crypto bros and everybody online for

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.480
decently intelligent people that are successful. I've never heard anybody give a contradiction

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.600
to this. Maybe you will. You can tell me if you disagree. I always look at kids in high school

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.200
and I'm like, just try a little bit harder. Like 30 minutes a night, if you don't study,

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.160
just do 30 minutes, just do a little bit more. It is, you're laying the foundation for the rest

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.480
of your life and you can't appreciate it in high school and college. But oh my God, when you get

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.440
out, everything in your life is so much easier. You have probably more responsibility over the

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.400
direction of your life when you're like 13, 14 years old than you ever will once you're like 25

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.600
and older because this is like when you're determining the foundations that everything's

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:22.480
going to be built on. But yeah, 100%. So first of all, it does seem that the liberating aspect

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.760
of being young is like anything you learn. So working hard at learning something will pay off

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.880
in like nonlinear ways, like you said with video games. I feel like, so like people who are like,

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.880
I hate school. All right, well, fine. But find something where you're challenging yourself,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.400
you're growing, you're learning, you're learning a skill, you're learning about a thing.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.520
Of course, you know, you can push back and say, well, there's some trajectories that might not

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.760
be productive. Like if you spend the entirety of your teen years playing, I don't know,

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.840
League of Legends, a game you have love and hate relationship with.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.240
No, just a hate and hate relationship. Okay. Well, we'll talk about, I think you have a love,

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.320
hate relationship with hate in general. We'll just in love. We'll try to de-complexify that one.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.400
I think in general, just investing yourself fully with passion really does pay off. But that said,

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:23.440
also school, I feel like doesn't get enough credit, like high school in particular, middle

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:31.520
school and high school, because it's general education. I think if you're, especially if

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.120
you're lucky to have good teachers, but honestly, I haven't mostly the textbooks themselves with

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:44.080
good teachers. It's a one chance in life, you have to really explore a subject. Fuck grades.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:50.640
Like getting good grades is at tension, I would say, with actual learning. That is true. But

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.640
just get a biology textbook and to explore ideas and biology and allowing yourself to be

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:05.440
inspired by the beauty of it. Yeah, I don't know. I think that really, really, really pays off and

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.120
you never get a chance to do that again. And maybe not even textbooks, like reading, straight

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:17.680
up reading. I think if you read, this is one time in life, you get a chance to read, really read.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:25.200
Like read a book a day, read. You can really invest, you can really grow by reading. I mean,

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.680
I must, all those guys talk about it. It's very, very rare that you meet like a dumb person who

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.800
reads a lot. I don't know if that's ever happened in my life. Yeah. Dumb or not successful. And

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.560
the cool thing is, it seems like the reading, it's like investment, the reading you do early

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:48.000
on in high school pays off way more than the reading you do later. So like the really influential

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.040
reading is doing those high school years, because you're basically learning from others,

01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.400
the mistakes they've made, the solutions to problems, you're basically learning the

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.120
shortcuts to life. Like whatever the hell you want to do, music, read from the best people

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.760
that the music theory, like learn music theory, learn, read biographies about jazz musicians,

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.240
blues musicians, see their, like see all the mistakes, see what they did, see the shortcuts.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.600
If you want to do podcast and read about other podcasts, if you want to do streaming,

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.640
read about other streamers, physicists, and so on, I feel like you figure out all the mistakes

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.120
and get to shortcut through life, because most people show up to college without having done

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:36.480
that. And now you get a chance to shortcut your way past them. Yeah, 100%. But nobody really teaches

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:44.480
you that. They're like, go to school from this time to that time, shut up, this is just what you

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.920
do, eat your broccoli. I think I was like, there's two huge problems. One is, now that I'm older,

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.120
because you don't know anything as a kid, you can't really criticize as an adult as a kid,

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.600
because you're a kid. By the way, you're ageist, if I may say so. I am super ageist. As I get older,

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.760
I get even more ageist. There are a lot of people I argue with, I was like, man, dude,

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:07.120
you're really 22, aren't you? I can tell every word you say, just seeps of like 22-year-oldness,

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.400
but that's okay. I love that for you. I could just say, because you mentioned this,

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.760
your wife is a fellow streamer, Molina. You mentioned that this is a source of fights

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.520
for the two of you that, and I could just feel that. There is truth to what you're saying,

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.720
which is like, all right, you're saying that because you're 22. Just wait until you're 25,

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.280
and you won't be saying that anymore. Sure. No, that is the most annoying thing for people to hear.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.720
Yeah, you can't ever say that, of course. Because it's actually usually true,

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:42.160
because we do go through phases in life, and you can understand that most things are phases.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:49.040
So just in general, you can say, just wait. Just wait. You won't feel this way. Again,

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.960
I could say that to you. You could say that to yourself. Just wait. Whatever you're feeling

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.600
like, just wait. In five, 10 years, you'll be a different person, and you will laugh at the

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.400
things you take seriously now that are causing you pain now, all that kind of stuff. But people

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.680
hate hearing that. Absolutely. I think the joke that I always say is that if I could literally

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.320
step into a time machine, and I could come back out and see myself as a 17-year-old, and I could

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.560
say, hey, I am literally you from the future. You see the time machine, and I would look at me,

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.320
and I would see the time machine, and I would give myself the best advice in the world,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.160
to be the most successful person. I would ignore all of it. Even knowing it came from myself,

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.200
I'd be like, this guy sold out. This dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. I'll

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.520
figure it out better. He must have made some mistakes. That's what I would think is this

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.040
everything. Even I knew it was myself from the future, I would just 100% never believe it,

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.920
and knowing that is very frustrating. But I keep that in mind when I deal with younger people.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.480
That's why I always say on stream when I'm talking to, there's been stuff with Sneak-Os,

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.720
another girl on my stream called Lab. When I see the mistakes they're making, oftentimes,

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.000
because I've made all of these mistakes, sometimes in the most public and horrible

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.440
fashion ever. But I'm never like a mentor. I'm not going to sit there and tell you,

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.400
oh, do this or that or that or that, because I don't know if you're going to listen to me,

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.280
and I don't want to condescend to you. You figure your stuff out, and I'll be here if you want to

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:04.080
talk about it. There was a company that didn't work with me, because I was very adamant on

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.560
defending very radical notions about language and racial slurs and everything, when I was like

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.840
22 or whatever. There was a company, and they said, well, we don't want to work with this guy

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.080
for an event. After they had said that, I had written an article on my website called,

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.440
the company was Gigabyte. They make motherboards, and I said, fuck Gigabyte in the ass. That was

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.480
the title to my article. And it was like, well, if they don't want to work with me, I'm going to

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.040
blow them up and never do anything ever with them again. And it was just like, looking back at it

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.720
now, obviously, as an older person, like, hey, you need to pump the brakes and chill. You're

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.880
destroying yourself. But as a young person, it's like, yeah, you're 22. Of course, you think that

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.760
you can say whatever and do whatever. And as long as you're good at what you're doing, you've got

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.480
the whole world behind you. And yeah, geez. Well, let's go there. You have a history of using

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:51.280
offensive language, like the R word, the N word, including the N word with a hard R, calling women

01:08:51.280 --> 01:09:01.840
bitches, talking about rape in a nonchalant way. What part of that do you regret? And what part

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.520
of that do you not? Language is very complicated. When it comes to stuff relating to slurs,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:15.760
there's been a whole trajectory of feelings on everything related to language. For you personally

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.040
and for the internet as a whole. Yeah, I don't care about the internet, almost for me personally.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.440
In my early 20s, I'll say like 22, 23, I think probably when I first started streaming, my feeling

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.240
is that any word is just a word. And if it hurts you, that's your fault. Take responsibility for

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.240
yourself. This probably came from my background of being a really independent person. So that's

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.960
just kind of like the mind that I had for everything. And there were basically, they were like a

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.160
collection of experiences that I had that as I grew, I started to realize like, okay, well,

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.360
I feel differently about some of these words depending on the context. And I can see how

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.600
they can affect other people depending on the context. So as I've kind of like grown,

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.840
I think I've developed a more sophisticated understanding of how different words are used

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.120
and how they affect people, whether they like it or not. And more importantly, whether I like it

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:04.880
or not. And that words can, even if I don't want it to be, they can be a vehicle for emboldening

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.040
certain types of ideas that I don't want to embolden. And yeah, that's kind of been the whole

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.960
like growth. I've been lucky that in the time that I came up on the internet, I was able to learn

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.400
these lessons. Because if I was trying to learn those same lessons today, I would have been completely

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.040
destroyed because I had insane views on language like 10 years ago. We could talk about the past,

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.880
we could talk about the present, let's talk about the past first. So how do you deal with the fact

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.520
that there's videos of you in the past saying the N-word, including the N-word with a hard R?

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.440
So generally, and what's the context? Can you give me like, what would be the context usually?

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.240
When I lay out this defense, it's not because I wouldn't have used the N-word. Generally,

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.680
whenever I said the N-word, it was usually in an example of like, this is something that like a

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.320
racist person would say, I don't think I've ever, on the internet, I think I've ever called anybody

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.080
like the N-word with a hard R. Not because I wouldn't have, but just because it wasn't in

01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:00.640
my vocabulary. I played RTS, Real Time Strategy, and we use the F-slur for gay people. That's

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.520
what I use that one a ton. I've called people that a ton in the past. So I should actually just

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:13.360
as a small tangent, and this is what I'd like to explore with you. There's a ruthlessness to the

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:19.600
language in the gaming world. And there's different communities. They have different

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:27.600
flavors of language, of hate speech, essentially. And there's also a humor to it,

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.160
which really bothers me in a dark way that I haven't been able to really think through,

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:45.200
because humor seems to be a kind of catalyst for hate. It seems to normalize hate. Like you say,

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.400
basically, it's like Lucy Kay says a lot of edgy things, but you take something Lucy Kay says

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:58.480
and do it in a non-fine way and do it over and over and over and keep increasing the hatefulness

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.440
of it, the vitriol, and somehow you find yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a world full of hate

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:12.240
where there is no good and evil. It's all the same. In fact, the good is to be mocked, and the evil

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:18.880
is to be celebrated for the humor of it, basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously. And I

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.440
don't know what it, it reveals something about human nature that you can let go, the moral

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:30.000
relativism that can happen when you do that kind of stuff. At the same time, I'm a fan of dark humor

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.640
when done well. Anyway, for people who are not familiar, I just wanted to mention that

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.920
some of the worst hate speech that ends in LOL happens in gaming communities.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.120
And that's where you come from in a certain part.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.640
So a lot of people don't remember this or don't know this because they're younger, but

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:57.200
way back in the day, in the late 90s, early mid 2000s of the internet, the way that online kind

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:03.600
of like shit talk worked was you were just trying to ramp up to the most insanely edgy, crazy stuff

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.560
you could say to like provoke a reaction. Have you ever heard of something called the aristocrats?

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.200
That it's like a joke, the joke? Oh yeah, the joke. Yeah, there's a movie on it. Yeah.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.360
Okay. Basically, every single like shit talk back and forth on the internet was like that.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.920
Like what is the most increasingly depraved and back then you didn't get banned for slurs or

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.720
anything on any of these chat rooms. So it was just like insane world to walk into. And I was

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:32.560
fully 100% a part of a product of and a contributor to that world. So that probably still goes on

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.920
on the internet in some way and that probably still goes on the internet in a maybe more

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.400
pacified way. Only in darker parts of the internet. I'd say for the most part, most,

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.000
well, compared to back then compared to 20 years ago, the internet is way cleaned up now.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.120
There are still going to be boards you can go on or parts of the internet where you see that

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.200
type of humor, but not nowhere near as mainstream. Like back then you could open your mic on

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.840
Xbox Live and hear some insane stuff when that first started nowhere near what you hear today.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.160
Although there are still elements of escalation that happened that just seems to be part of

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.360
human nature on the internet. Because we don't get the feedback of actually hurting people

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:15.520
directly. So the trolling, like for the lulls, you'll do like you will still escalate within

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.600
the bounds. You're just saying that there's more bounds now. On Reddit, there's more bounds and

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:26.160
so on. There's moderators that kind of yell at you that ban you and so on if you cross those

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:33.040
bounds. But overall, that basic human instinct to escalate, especially under the veil of anonymity

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.960
is still there. I don't know. It's dark. It's dark. Yeah, just there's a lot of different ways to

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.000
look at it. And there's different ways you can break that art. Like for instance, like you mentioned

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.480
dark humor and you say that like sometimes dark humor is funny and sometimes it's not. I think

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.560
that it's really important to dig into and figure out like why certain things are funny and why

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.680
certain things. Yeah, go. It's from your subreddit. Oh boy. No, that made me laugh and I felt wrong

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:04.320
about it. Oh no. So this is, I already know what this is, yeah. Yeah. So this is a trolley

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.280
problem. To me, it connects because I think about the, it keeps, because I worked on autonomous

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.240
vehicles, the trolley problem, the philosophical thought experiment keeps brought up a lot.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.840
You know, when AI is part of making the decision, do I kill three people here or five people here?

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:26.640
In AI makes that decision, how do you do that calculus? And this particular, there's a deep

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.960
satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society. I feel like that's why- That's what dark humor

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.360
does? Successful dark humor does. And I don't know if this- It feels a flaw. Hmm. I feel like

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.000
certain, there's a certain brand of dark humor. And I think the reason, I think the reason someone

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.480
is why it's good, or why it is good humor, I think is because I don't think it necessarily

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.320
reveals a flaw. So sometimes I feel like it reveals like a kind of virtue, I think. Like,

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.760
if you look at this particular thing- Yeah, can I explain what we're- Yeah, go for it.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.400
Oh yeah, sure. We're just listening. The title of the Reddit post is, You Know What to Pick.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.920
And it says, five people are going to die either way, but if you flip the lever, the trolley will

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:15.280
do a sick fucking loop first. And also the top comment is a question saying, which I think is

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.000
also part of the dark humor that's successful. Can I get the gender and ethnic backgrounds

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.960
of the groups first? And the top answer is both groups are each comprised of five white orphaned

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:35.600
cis male heavy meth users who are consistently in and out of drug rehab, all who identify as

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.800
right wing extremists. Humor is such a sophisticated thing that we engage in. Humor is like really

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:47.280
complicated. But I would argue that hopefully the humor here shows the virtue of like, this is

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.280
obviously horrible, but that's kind of why it's funny. It's funny because it's such a horrible

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.280
question to ask. Like, do we kill five people in a boring way or in a really entertaining way? And

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.880
it's like, that's really, that's really- And then when you ask even more like, what are the ethnic

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.040
backgrounds? Like, that's even worse to say that, you know? So I feel like that's like the type of,

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.120
there's a way that you can engage with dark humor where it's like, oof, like, it's funny because

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.720
it's so wrong and so taboo. And we all know that it's wrong and taboo. And that's kind of where

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.840
the shared laugh comes from. So for me, the question that asking the diversity question

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.440
is a sophisticated way of revealing the absurdity of asking about diversity when it's talking about

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.360
human life. Oh, interesting. Because the way that I took that was, I think it reveals the absurdity

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.360
of how people will weigh different ethnic backgrounds so differently when it comes to value of human

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.600
life. Like, I'm actually thinking of that in terms of like a an immigration related question,

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.160
where people are really keen and quick to dehumanize like black or brown people. So like,

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.040
the question is like, well, if five of them are brown and five are white, well, I know which one

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.400
I'm going to, you know, pull the lever for. That's how I read that. But it's satirizing that.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:52.000
Yeah, exactly. Yes, of course. Yeah. But that's what I mean, that that's the flaw. To me, at least,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.800
it showed that humanity or social networks that are easy to be outraged and love the outrage

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:07.920
and the chaos, that Twitter and social networks will pull that lever. Like, they would,

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.960
they would always try to maximize the fun. And there's like a, there's a sick aspect to

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.920
all the atrocities, all the tragedies that happen in the world, that we kind of always

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:26.640
lean towards the, the outrageous narrative weaved around it. The, yeah, the, the one that leads

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:33.040
to sort of the most clicks, to the most attention, to the most outrage, to all that,

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.960
all that kind of stuff. So that, that's almost like a satire of society. When they are faced with

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:47.040
tragedy, they will maximize, trying to think of a word that's not fun, but entertainment,

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.760
maximize the entertainment. Yeah. This is a big criticism I give, especially to conservative

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.320
crowds. You know, left-leaning people, everybody doesn't. I don't like when people blame the media

01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.960
for the state of the media today. I very much believe that everything in society is a feedback

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.320
loop and that if you're really unhappy with the state of the media, I think that the media is

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.000
a good reflection for what people want to see because there is a room right now in the United

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.320
States where somebody could start a company where all they do is completely factual reporting.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.600
They don't have a political slant and they're not giving you these like sensationalist narratives

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.040
or stories and that media company would fail in two weeks because people don't want to see that.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.320
Generally, people really want to see the like, show me the guy that really believes in what I

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.680
say, that calls the other guy an idiot, the guy that are screaming on TV or on the radio,

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.000
like, this is what I really want. And people will engage in that and that feedback loop will

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.720
continue for generations. And then all of a sudden people are like, why is the media so bias? Why is

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.600
the media driving so many narratives? I was like, well, what do you mean? This is exactly what you

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.240
want to see. And that's frustrating for me. That's one of my big kind of when I defend

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:47.840
establishments or when I talk about like the interplay between citizen and all these institutions

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.880
we have, that the institutions are very much a reflection of the population, at least in

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.680
democratic societies. And I think that people very much try to elude the personal responsibility

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.440
or the country's responsibility to why some of them look the way that they do.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.720
But that takes us back to the N word with a hard R. Sure. Why?

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.760
For the particular examples that I was giving for the particular conversations that I was having,

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.720
if you're going to have challenging conversations around certain words,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.400
I think you should probably be able to say them otherwise it feels really ridiculous to me.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.680
That's like, do you still believe that?

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.440
Yes. Not like calling people those words, but in having conversations about those words,

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.040
I would say that I still believe that, yeah.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.320
But don't you think, as you said, that using those words

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:38.000
actually gives motivation and strength to people who have hate in their hearts?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.360
I think depending on the context of what's going on, I think that that's going to be a big driver

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.240
in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.760
So in a conversation about the N word, I don't think I would normally say the N word,

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.840
we would just talk about the word much the same way that like in a movie,

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.360
like in Django, people use the N word. Should that be censored in that movie?

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.960
Or in the context of that movie, is it being employed in a way where these aren't good people?

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.360
You're not supposed to like them. And that's what the audience walks away with.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.600
Yeah, but that context is different than conversation. It feels like in conversation,

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:15.200
you using that word normalizes it. And that normalizing that word is going to make it easier

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:22.320
for people who use that word in a hateful way to use it. Same with the F word, the F slur.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:31.280
If you use that casually and normalize it in a way that's not hateful, you use it in a way

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.960
that's not hateful, but the side effect is that it normalizes it than people who do use it in a

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:43.120
hateful way will be more likely to use it. Therefore, the mathematically looking at the

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.480
equation of the number of times the N word or the F word is used throughout the world,

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.640
it increases the number of times it's used in a hateful way.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.320
Yeah, I think that human beings-

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
And you're part of that problem, Steven.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:00.160
I don't agree. I understand the thought process. But I don't know if using certain words

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.840
within different contexts is going to necessarily normalize like the hateful use of that word.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.040
That is an argument that I've heard people use. Somebody will say like, okay, well, hold on.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.440
That should never be used ever because by virtue of you normalizing it, even in an

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.600
inoffensive environment, you increase the proclivity for people to use it in a potentially

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.960
more offensive environment. And my argument is always like, no, I don't think that crossover

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.320
exists. But if you did want to take that argument, and maybe you do feel this way,

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.680
I think that you get really problematic when you run into communities that do use certain

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.640
words that people would say, well, they should be allowed to do it. So for instance, if you think

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.400
that any utterance of the N word at all is highly problematic and might increase hatred,

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.440
then like the entire rap industry has to dramatically change the way that they engage

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.040
with the N word. And obviously a lot of people that criticize people's use of the N word

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.840
aren't going to turn to rappers and say, well, you guys can't say it either.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.960
No, it's who, I mean, it's who uses the N word. That's what it's not. So it's not just the word.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:23:01.600
It's the, it is context dependent. But I would say that you as a white person having conversations,

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.640
the context there is the kind that would lead to any increase in hate.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.880
Do you think the N word should be censored in the dictionary?

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.440
No. And I believe there's a Wikipedia page on it and it's not censored.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.320
Yeah, I don't, I think it should be in the dictionary. I think the context of casual

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:24.800
conversation, like I said, I just believe that on the internet, having humor,

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.120
having fun conversations as you have on your streams,

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.120
that leads to the normalization of the word without any educational value,

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.960
without significant educational value. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think I would,

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.920
I think I would agree with that. No, sorry. So there's a difference between

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:47.680
F slur and N word and both I think should not be used in a fun way, but the F word was used

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.560
in a fun way for the longest time. For sure. And I'll tell you something that bothers me about

01:23:52.560 --> 01:24:00.880
your streams, not your streams and basically every other stream is the casual use of the R word.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.800
Oh, the ableism, yeah. I don't know if it's about the able, I don't even know,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.720
listen, it's complicated. I'm not like virtue signaling here.

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:13.040
No, ableism isn't a virtue signal. I mean, it's a legitimate, yeah. Like I get emails

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.520
from fans that say like, Hey, like I deal with this particular issue. Every time you use this

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:21.440
word, it kind of feels like you're attacking me. Like just like, so it's not, it's a valid concept.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.600
It's just something cuts wrong for me. Like for example, I'm not bothered by,

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:33.680
I am bothered by the excessive use of the word fuck, but not in the same way that moderate use of

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.520
the word fuck. What is it? I'm curious. And when somebody calls somebody in R word,

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.040
what is it that, what is the feeling that you get that makes you feel bad about it?

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.280
It signals to me that you don't give a damn about

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:58.320
people who are struggling in ways that you are not struggling. Like that, that signals to me

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.320
like, about the experience of others. Do you think that there are other words also that could

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.920
convey like a similar feeling to your wife? Cause it feels like you've drawn a pretty special

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.240
circle around cause like, I imagine I call, oh, this guy's, you're an uneducated dumb fucker.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.760
You're a nitwicker. Like, do those words probably don't feel it? That circle keeps changing.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.200
Which it can, which is fine. I think that's the whole point with the culture.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.560
So I'm trying to feel my feeling is a kind of, you know, I'm a human being that exists in a

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.200
social context that we're all evolving that language together and just feels wrong. Like,

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.640
you know, the word bitch, for example, it really bought, like I've heard on your streams and in

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:44.320
general, calling a woman a stupid bitch really bothers me. But it's not just the word bitch,

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:49.680
it's context. Like for example, me personally, I'm speaking to me personally, like badass bitch,

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.360
is different than stupid bitch. Sure. Like a bad bitch or something is different. Yeah,

01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:01.840
of course. Way different. Sure. I think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility and respect for

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.680
human beings that are not like you. That's what, that's, that's the feeling that I'm bothering.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:15.760
So I guess what I'm trying to say here is just because people speak in this kind of way

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:23.600
in the gaming world and streams doesn't mean that you, like a lot of people look up to you.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.880
It doesn't mean young people especially, doesn't mean that you don't have the responsibility to

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.880
sort of stand alone from the crowd. Because you're somebody that values the power of affected discourse.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:42.960
And to be effective discourse, there's some level of civility. So you can be the sort of

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:50.960
the beacon of civility in that world versus giving in to the derogatory words. Because like

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:59.440
you have to, you have to lift people out of that world, out of the muck of what I would say is

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.200
like drama and effective discourse. Like I think that's one of your missions, right, is like to

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.840
inspire the world through conversation, through debate, through effective discourse. Yeah.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.480
So I guess I'm just calling you out that I think using our word, for me personally,

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:22.160
as a fan that believes in your mission, it just makes you look ineffective and bad and

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.040
uninspiring to young people that look up to you. Because those young people are going to use those

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:32.160
words that you're using and they'll do it much less effectively. That's the problem.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.720
Yeah, I guess the challenge is always just like finding the line. Like my, my book I really shifted

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.120
dramatically from, even from like two or three years ago, I think my vocabulary shifted quite a

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.880
bit as we've like, we've kind of gotten rid of some words and some things are kind of coming

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.600
out. The R word is one that has kind of gone out and come back and gone out and come back,

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.560
that one we've definitely gone back and forth on. I know there are different thoughts about it in

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.680
different communities on the internet. This is interesting. I mean, I'm just telling you,

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:02.800
for me, it cuts, and I'm not a social justice warrior type, it cuts pretty hard.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.520
So what you're saying is I'm going to lose a subscriber if I'm,

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.840
no, it's not a subscriber. I know, I just, I actually have to empathize harder because I'm

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:17.120
like, maybe this is not a very good person. That's what I feel. Like if you're so carelessly using

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:23.200
that word, then maybe you're not actually thinking deeply about the suffering in the world. Like

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.640
to be a student of human nature, you really have to think about other humans and other

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.640
experiences that are unlike your own. And so that's the sense I get. But at the same time,

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:37.760
you're also like the grandpa, the ages, who's trying to be cool with the young kids. A lot of

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.880
the reason young kids look up to you is like, you also know the language of the internet.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.560
Yeah. But I mean, it doesn't, that's not an excuse to use words that we think shouldn't be used.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.760
I guess the question that I would have, because it's always a struggle, and to some extent,

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.880
it's kind of happened, is let's say that like three years ago, I would have said I'm no longer

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.400
saying the artwork. That's just, I'm just going to get rid of that on my vocabulary. Like,

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.760
is there a chance that today we would be having a conversation about like,

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.200
why do you call people dumb fucks? Like, is that really appropriate? Like,

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.280
does this attack at the core of like somebody's like level of intelligence, education,

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.640
opportunities in life? Like, is that a worthy, you don't think so?

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:17.520
I think that's a, as the kids say, cope. You really think so? I think because the words have

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.680
definitely moved in a way where it's like, this was okay. Now it's not this. So you're

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:28.960
standing your ground by using, listen, you could, you could, you could, but I think it's better

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.960
to use those words. If you want to defend the ground word stand on, to use them rarely and

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:42.640
deliberately versus how you currently use them, which is to express an emotion. Like you,

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.040
I'm going to be honest, you use our word, not when you're at your best.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.160
True. And so that's not, that's generally, that could be true for a lot of swearing to that,

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.240
but yeah, I know what you mean. No, but like, you know that our word is offensive, you know,

01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:04.080
and there's part of it is like the, you tell yourself that like, you're still kind of fighting

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.560
political correctness by using it a little bit when you say it. No, I don't think so. I think,

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.160
I'm trying to think in terms of like, where is the virtue where, like, there's a whole bunch

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.680
of arguments for why some words are okay, some words aren't okay or whatever. And I try to,

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.760
like think more along those lines rather than, but like, there's going to be like a lot of

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:24.080
phrases where like, if the our word has come out, the conversation is over. I know that,

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.120
like things, my brain is shut down, the person I'm talking to is, but there's like,

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.480
there's a lot of words also in terms of like, it like, if you ever hear me say like,

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.840
fucking moron in a debate, it's like, it's done, like this conversation is over,

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.880
there's no way that anything productive is happening past that point.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.520
I think fucking moron is not, I think it's ineffective, it's not civil, but it's not,

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:48.400
it doesn't bother me in the way. It's basically when you speak in a way that I know there's

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.920
a group that's going to be heard by that. Not only do I think about the hurt that group experiences,

01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:00.400
I think of you as a lesser intellectual, like as a lesser person who's thinking about the world.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:07.680
What bothers me the most is just what kind of mindset that inspires in young people,

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:11.360
especially when you're a public figure and a lot of people look up to you.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:18.240
So I definitely don't think, sort of this idea, the R word is not the battleground of expanding

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:26.720
the Orton window of discourse. Okay. Like I don't think it'll lead to dumb fuck

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:34.880
being canceled two years later, unless that word is hurting people's experience,

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:43.040
which I don't foresee that happening. I think legitimately our word and F slur and calling

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:50.640
women bitches, context matters here too. Of course, but just the way I've heard you use it,

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:55.840
it is not, it's from emotion and it's from frustration and it ultimately is rooted in

01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:02.160
disrespect. I don't, I think it's ineffective. And of course, like who gets to say, I don't know,

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:10.720
but I'm saying somebody who would like, I admire effective conversations and I admire great humor,

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:19.600
dark humor, wit. To me, oftentimes the use of the R word in the way you've used in the way I see

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.320
the community use it is none of those things. It contributes not at all to the humor and so on.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.080
Now I could see it might contribute to the, to the camaraderie of that particular group,

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:36.080
especially when they normalize the use of that word. You kind of take some of the edge off,

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:43.360
but you forget that there's a large number of other people that don't have the chemistry,

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:47.840
that don't hear the music of the friendship that you have, the relationship you have.

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.640
And instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word and it ultimately has an impact

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:57.440
that's hateful. And then people like me who show up, you know, I haven't watched much of your stuff.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.440
It turns me off from like a couple of times your content came before me.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.120
And I listened to it a little bit, it turned me off completely. I didn't understand

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.640
how good your heart is. I didn't understand how your mission of actually

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:20.880
deradicalize people, help people like you're, and increase the level of good faith discourse

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:24.400
in the world. I didn't understand any of that because like what I was hearing is pretty rough,

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:30.880
like the R-word type of stuff. And I just feel like the benefit cost analysis is heavy on the cost.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:37.440
Gotcha. So I just have to sort of call this out. I think, and I straight up think it's wrong,

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.680
but that's my own. Why do you think it's wrong? Because it's hurting people without any benefit

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.200
to you whatsoever. When you say hurting people, do you mean the person I'm using it at? Or do

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:53.200
you think there's like the third group? It's good feedback, right? I always consider everything,

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.840
especially, I respect you a lot, you're a really smart guy. Something that I always kind of like

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.680
fight over in terms of like language or like who to attack or what to attack or what to do

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:10.960
is that it's very hard to draw like what boxes are okay to insult people on versus what aren't.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:17.600
So for instance, if I call somebody like a Nazi with a lot of vitriol, I'm okay with every single

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:24.080
Nazi being negatively affected by that because that category intrinsically calls upon it some

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.560
level of more condemnation for me, right? Whereas like if I'm out there, I try not to do like image

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.840
related jokes, right? I don't want to call you like, oh, you're a fat fucking loser because there's a

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.960
lot of people that are fat that are overweight where I don't want them to feel bad. I don't want

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.680
them, I'm not trying to call you out or like insult you. So there's like a lot of, you say cost

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.440
benefit, I look at like a lot of collateral damage from a word like that where there's no purpose

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:49.120
in doing that. So certain words are easy to get rid of, they're off the table, right? Epsilon

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.560
and word like these are not words you call people because you're there's so much collateral,

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.760
it's not worth it. We've got some words where it's like if you have some form of like mental

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.240
thing, it is a bad thing, you're not a bad person, but just using that word could feel like a

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.640
collateral damage to those people. And then there's other categories of words. So like if I say that

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:12.480
like this person is like there is a stupid fucking Republican, right? There's probably some Republicans

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:17.440
that aren't dumb that I don't want to feel called out by that. Like are those types of phrases that

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:22.000
you think should be completely removed as well? Or I'm kind of curious. So this completely removed

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:27.280
just so we're clear. Yeah. I'm not referring to censorship. Oh no, I'm not even talking about

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.160
this. I'm just a person like emotionally like removed is the wrong word though. Like I care about

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.280
like I'm not trying to listen to people on the internet saying like you shouldn't say that word,

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:44.160
that's not good. I mean, I'm trying to look to your mind and heart. And the reason we're talking

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:51.200
today is you're betraying your gift. You're better than this. You think it's indicative of like a more

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.800
flip of thought process where it's like the only way you can say that word is if you're ignoring

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.120
the hurt and suffering of those people. And if you're somebody that says those people, you're

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:05.440
ignoring the state of language. Because I think you're getting to the point because it's not about

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:12.160
a single word. It's about like it's music. And I just feel like there is a very strong note.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.840
It's a strong note that ruins the melody. Gotcha. And I don't think I can say, you know,

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:22.480
you shouldn't use the R word or whatever. I'm just speaking to it. I'm just listening to music

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:28.560
and reviewing the final result. It's not necessarily because maybe one use of the word, the R word

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:35.600
strategically or part of an actual like, or when you've built up a camaraderie that's

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.600
sandwiched in like some love, but then you try to reveal there. Because you're talking about

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.720
a lot of, there's a bunch of drama. You have friends with whom you're worrying and stuff.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.640
And they're all a little bit beautifully insane. And you've said that you are becoming more and

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.800
more insane. It's beautiful to watch. It's the human condition laid before us. Wonderful. And

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:04.720
some of that is swearing and so on. So it's a tricky thing. But the whole skill of discourse,

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:11.200
just like it is with dark humor is walking that line. I just feel like it's overuse of the R

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.440
word. And I don't want to die in that grog because I don't think it's that that represent. Like,

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.200
there's certain things like that. It feels like it ruins the music. Gotcha. And I don't, you know,

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.080
it's just saying like a dumb Republican or dumb Democrat. I don't, yeah, that ruins it too a little

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:32.000
bit. Depends on how you use it. You can be lazy with that. You know, like even overuse of the

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.240
word, I think bots is what's used for people who don't think or something. I don't actually know

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:42.320
the definition. I'm offended on behalf of robots. That might be a compliment soon.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.560
Exactly. But I guess bot means you don't think. Yeah, you're like an NPC. You just copy.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.680
Again, I'm a friend on behalf of NPCs. I come myself as one. But there's a sense if you say

01:37:53.680 --> 01:38:00.480
bots too much, that you're just dismissing people. Like everything I say is right.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:07.120
And anyone that disagrees with me needs a bot. That's lazy too. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.760
it's effective. Basically saying a lot of people in the mainstream media or something like that are

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:18.080
bots. Okay, that's a little bit of that is effective. But too much, it becomes ineffective.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.160
And I'm trying to speak to that. And I'm just the reason we're highlighting

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:30.240
clear examples like the N word. Joe Rogan had to contend with that. I think it's

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.360
ineffective. It makes you less effective at discourse. But like you've talked about many

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.840
times, language is a tricky one. It's always hard because you talk about constructing a melody.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.080
There's not one melody that sounds good to everyone. But there are probably certain notes

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:48.160
that like if you got rid of them, everybody's still going to like it about as much and you

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.040
don't really lose anything. There's a whole other part of an audience that might be more

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:55.120
willing to listen. Yeah, of course. And it's not about losing the magic of that melody. Like you

01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.160
don't want to be vanilla. I just feel like there's stuff that doesn't need to be there.

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.120
Yeah, for sure. It's fat. But then again, the other thing that people should understand

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.680
that might be listening to this, you're streaming many hours a day for many years. I don't know

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.480
11 or 12, I think. Yeah, started in 2010. And so one of the things that people can do is just

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:22.320
clip out anything. You're going through the full human experience of emotion, anger,

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:28.400
fear, frustration, all of it. So of course there's going to be moments when you're not the best

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.960
version of yourself. Anything else to say about the language? It's complicated. I'm still always

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.800
trying to figure it out. There are opinions that I have that have changed throughout the years.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.400
It's possible that the R word has always been the next one on the chopping block that we're all

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.840
kind of looking at, but people are always worried about that treadmill. But it's possible in a year

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.520
or two, I'll have a different view on it or all have changed away some of the words I use.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.160
It's always like a work in progress. There's always different communities that feel different

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.000
ways about different words. Yeah, but do you acknowledge that there's people out there

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:06.080
that are never going to talk to you? They're never going to think of you as a good man because

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.440
you used the N word with the hard R publicly. In the past, I mean, yeah, those people exist.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.840
There are some people that are beyond my reach, which I'm okay with. There's going to be some

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.920
people because of things that have been involved or even ideas that I have now that might make them

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.200
beyond my reach. Something you said earlier is very true. I think the goal is to identify what

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.920
are the elements that you can cut out that aren't integral to your message, but could be alienating

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.040
to more people. And those are probably the things that you identify. But I think that you can get

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.880
lost in yourself or lost in the internet or lost in the outside of yourself if you're trying to

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:48.880
appeal to every single person. It's just never going to be the case. I like that I've had the

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.720
journey that I've had on the internet that you can find me saying and defending a lot of insane

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.640
stuff 10 years ago, because I think it shows a level of progress. And I think I do get a lot

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:00.960
of respect and buy into certain communities where it's like, I'm not just some random dude telling

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.800
you that, oh, you shouldn't say the F word or the N word. I'm a guy that's been there,

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:08.480
that's done it, that's defended it. And you can see my whole past, my whole history is laid bare

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.760
for you to watch every thousands of hours of it. But I can show that there's growth and evolution

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:19.360
and change that can happen in a person. And you're honest about that growth. It's a tricky thing

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:26.960
because people just bring up stuff from your past. I hope we figure out as a civilization,

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:33.760
a mechanism to clearly say, this was me two years ago. This is me five years ago. I'm a

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:40.160
different person. Because Twitter doesn't care about that. These social mechanisms that bring

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.680
stuff out doesn't care about that. It's like one stupid thing you say, it becomes like a scarlet

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.920
letter. And I don't know how to fight that. It's tricky to fight that. Have you ever seen men in

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:55.440
black? Yes. When K and J are on the bench and he says a person is smart, but people are stupid,

01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.000
dumb, finicky animals or whatever. There's something that changes for human dynamics when

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.040
there is a group of people that make it so hard to control. I think one-on-one, anybody can

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:12.240
sit across on somebody and admit to some horrible stuff. I abused my husband when I was 20 and

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.160
35 and I see what's wrong or I did this. I was addicted to whatever and I made these mistakes.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:21.520
One-on-one, it's always easy. But in group environments that in group, out group, tribalistic

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.200
thing of identifying one thing and then coming to destroy a person's life is such a huge impulse

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.840
we have. And I think probably when we were hunter-gatherers in the forest, it's probably good

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:35.840
because you really want to push weird people out or anything like that. But now on the internet,

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.960
when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion and just with ruthless precision, destroy somebody's

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.640
life over it, it's pretty scary dynamic. I think one of the mechanisms that could fix it is make

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.840
it super easy for each individual person to analyze all the stupid shit they themselves have said

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:59.040
in the past. Like a full recording because I think people are just honestly paying a very

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:05.600
rosy picture to their own brain of who they have been in the past. If we can have empathy for the

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.960
fact that we've said stupid shit or we're drunk, the ridiculous things you say, the offensive

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.680
things you might have said, the offensive things you might have done, I just feel like that would

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:22.560
give us the ammunition to have empathy for others that are like, okay, yeah, this guy five years

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:28.640
ago said this, maybe that doesn't represent them, who doesn't represent who they are anymore than

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:33.920
stuff I said five years ago represents who I am today. I feel like technology can actually enable

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.400
that. Maybe, although you're talking about more recording and more stuff, which people already

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.400
worry about. It's a double edged sword. I think there is going to be more and more recording,

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.160
we have to figure out how to do that in a way that respects people's privacy and gives them

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.720
ownership of their data and so on. I've looked at the search history I've done on Google,

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.960
which for most people is available, like your Google search history, and it's fascinating to

01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:02.320
watch the evolution of a human being. It doesn't seem like the same person, like a different person.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.200
For sure. It's weird. It's also hard to with the internet today. I'm going to be agist again,

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.480
but like now all of the people are thrown together, whereas like, I don't want a 27-year-old

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:17.280
judging the age of like a 15 or 16-year-old. Obviously, he's in high school. There was that

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.040
story that came out of the... There was a kid that saved the recording of... I think it was like

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.760
some white girl. I think that she got her driver's license and she's like, I can drive now and words

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.120
with the A or whatever. It was dumb. She shouldn't have said it, but I think she was like 15 or 16

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:33.120
when she ticked off this or whatever. He held on to that recording until she applied and got

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.120
accepted to college three years later, and then he released it to get her kicked out of college.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:43.520
And I'm like, damn. Everything that I had ever said as like a 15, 16-year-old was like immortalized

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:49.600
on the internet. My life wouldn't have even begun. And those are insanely high standards to hold

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:54.160
people to. Not that like, obviously you shouldn't be saying those... You shouldn't be saying certain

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.480
words or whatever, but you have to be able to make mistakes in adolescence like everybody does.

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.400
We all did. Everybody did it growing up, you know?

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:07.520
Why do you think there's so much misogyny in the streaming community? And how can you fight it?

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:14.640
Because you've shown a lot of interest in fighting it. Trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny from

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:19.440
your community. I think it's really difficult. I think that eliminating racism is easier than

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.200
eliminating misogyny. On the internet, you mean? On anywhere. Because I think fundamentally,

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.240
I don't think there's that much difference between like white people and black people and brown

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.680
people and Asian people or whatever. We have different cultures and stuff, but at the end of

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:37.120
the day, we're all people. But I think there are differences between men and women throughout all

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.880
of history and time and then even today in every culture. And when real differences do exist,

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:46.880
it's harder to account for them in a way that can we have conversations with each other without it

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.880
becoming very gendered in a negative way, right? Negative way of gendering something,

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:57.520
be like a misogynistic way of doing it. Of course, it's unclear to me that it's so difficult to

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:04.160
to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive. Because there's a lot of positive to the

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.000
tension, the dance between the different genders and so on. Maybe in this particular moment in

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.080
history, it's not. But it's not trivial to me that racism is easier to eliminate. It's an interesting

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.880
hypothesis just because there's more biological difference between men and women. That means

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.640
it's harder to eliminate. But I don't know if this is true. I hear this a lot. I feel like I read

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.120
this somewhere, but I need to get a better source of it. I repeated it everywhere. But I've heard

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:31.520
that in the US military, for instance, they do an exceedingly good job at getting different

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:36.480
people of different races to integrate. And it's not a huge problem once you're through basic

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.240
training, all the training, everything. But for a different sex, it still represents a

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.680
significant problem that the military hasn't figured out. And as you look to, well, what's the

01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.680
military doing? Because if something was solvable, can we sleep for four hours a night and be healthy?

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:50.640
If we could, I bet the military would know. So I kind of look sometimes at them to see their

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.440
integration. But it might be that there are other issues there that make it ironic.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:58.800
Yeah, it feels like the military is a very particular kind of thing. The actual task at hand

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:05.680
might bias the difficulty of the process. Potentially, yeah. There's been a lot of interesting

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:13.440
talk about women integrating into male groups. And how do you do this in a way where everybody

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:19.680
is happy with the outcome? And there's not issues. I think Jordan Peterson spoke about this a little

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:24.480
bit and then Workplace Culture speaks about this a bit. Would you happen to remember, I want to say

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.040
it was like five or 10 years ago, there was a big tech conference and there were two guys behind a

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:34.320
woman and they made a joke about like a USB dongle, like dongle was a dick. And this woman turned

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:39.440
around, she tweeted pictures of them, spoke about like misogyny and then that blew up into a huge

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:47.760
ordeal that like, yeah. There was this interesting phenomenon that in a less misogynistic and more

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.920
inclusive workplace environment, some women might end up feeling worse because in a more

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:57.520
misogynistic environment, you're thinking like, okay, that's a woman. She doesn't get our humor.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:02.400
I'm going to treat her in a very indifferent, very dispassionate, cold way and whatever. And then

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.680
I'm going to have my boys over here. And then you've got like these environments where they're

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.880
a little bit more warmer. And it's like, oh, cool, we're going to bring this woman into our environment

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.560
and we're going to make all the same types of like crash jokes we did before. And it's actually

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.680
worse now. Another woman feels even more otherwise because like, oh my God, why do you talk like

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.480
this? I think that internet communities, especially online ones that do like political debate and

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.920
video games are very much like big boys clubs. So it's not enough to just say you can't be

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.920
misogynistic to get rid of misogyny. There's always going to be an othering effect on women.

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.600
There's a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive that you have to account for and you've

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.000
got to try to like push that back. And that's just a very, very, very challenging thing to do.

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.560
So like, I like to deal with concrete examples more. So here's a concrete example. And this is

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.840
like a recent initiative in my community because I'm trying to like be, because misogyny hasn't

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.240
been fixed anywhere on the internet. And I'm curious, well, there are ways that I can push my

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:52.960
community to do this. I don't think you should almost ever make a comment on a woman's appearance

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.200
ever if they're appearing in like some political or professional manner. Even if it's a positive

01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:01.360
comment, I think it's equally bad to a negative comment. It's just never good to do. And that's

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:05.120
kind of an unintuitive thing because it's like, well, a woman appears, wow, she's really cute.

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.840
It seems like a nice comment. You're being nice, you know, she looks cute or whatever. But it's

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.280
like, it's not at all the point of why she's there. And just by saying that, you're kind of like

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.600
otherizing her as like a person to like think she looks good rather than listening to anything she

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.080
has to say, you know? Well, there's a lot of stuff that you're saying and

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.600
that is a part of misogyny. It's almost like obvious, like any woman will tell you that.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.400
Woman, well, yeah, but they're not in these spaces and a lot of the guys don't know.

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:37.120
But I think what that requires is just empathy. You don't need, you don't need, you need to

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:44.160
consider the female experience. That's it. Like you have to either read about or talk with women.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.040
You learn like the low hanging food is very easy to learn. It feels like just the level of social

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:56.080
skill oftentimes in internet communities is quite low. I disagree. I don't like to say,

01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.800
here's the problem with empathy is it's very hard to have empathy for experiences that are so

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.400
outside of your own. Well, maybe some people, there might be some people that can do it,

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.640
I can't. There's a lot of stuff that I had to learn. Women are half the population.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:14.000
But they're women. They're totally different. They're totally different.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:19.760
We'll talk about, they're not totally different. So here's an example, okay? So

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:27.920
especially for me, my archetype makes up a lot of the internet. White man. There's never been a

01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:32.640
point. The name of a beautiful woman. Who might be a dancer. What's the backstory from New Orleans

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.360
I haven't thought that through yet. It's ambiguous. Like an open world.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.120
Open world. I want you to project wherever you want destiny, the dancer to be from.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.000
That's in your mind. I'll see that for later tonight.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:50.240
As a white guy, I don't know if there's ever been a spot that I've been in

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:53.760
where I've been made to feel like I don't belong there just by virtue of who I am.

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.120
It's impossible for me to empathize that because I don't even have that experience.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.080
If you go back eight, nine years, one of the big issues that came up was harassment and

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.280
gaming against women. And I was one of the big debaters against that saying that like,

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.520
sure, women might get harassment, but everybody gets harassment. If you're a woman and you're

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:17.120
in gaming and you get harassed, congratulations, you're being treated like a man. What you're

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:20.880
actually asking for is for us to actually treat you differently. You don't want to be insulted.

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:24.240
You don't want to be treated like a man. And that's actually misogyny is women making that

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:28.400
argument. You still stand by that? Is that a problem if I do? No, I'm just kidding.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.360
Okay, hold on. So a little while after. I disagree with it. Sure. Okay. That's good.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.280
You should. A little while later, I had a friend, Jessica, super cool girl. We go to play games.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.640
She was between jobs. She's like, I've got like two months and we're going to grind CS go.

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.480
And I'm like, okay, this is awesome. Let's do it. CS go, Counter-Strike,

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:51.360
Global Offensive, Shooter Game, FPS, microphones. First day we start playing. Okay. Hop into our

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.200
first game. Obviously she talks. Everybody's making, is that a 12 year old boy? Why aren't

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:58.240
you making sandwiches? Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, okay, whatever. Play our first game.

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:02.480
Play our second game. Same jokes. Third game, fourth game. By like the fourth or fifth game,

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.080
I was actually starting to feel triggered. Like every time the game started, I was like,

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:10.400
can you just like talk so we can get over like the stupid fucking jokes? It's so fucking stupid.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:16.000
And you hear the same fucking joke every single time. And it took one day of that experience

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.720
for me to realize it's not about being insulted. It's like this othering feeling that you don't

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:24.480
belong. And I've never felt that because I'm a white guy. Like it's not to be like virtue

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.200
singular. So like there's just, there's no places where it's like, you're white, you don't belong

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.360
here. You're a guy, you don't belong here. Like I've never felt that not inclusion. And playing

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:37.040
with her, there's a different feeling when it's the same types of jokes coming from a group of

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:41.120
people to make you feel like you don't belong there. Where I was like, damn, this actually

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:46.400
feels really bad. And it feels bad in a different way where it's like, if you call me like NF Slur

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.400
or any other type of swear word or insult, like, yeah, you can call me that. But at the end of

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.520
the day, like we're all kind of the same, we're all white dudes and we call each other names.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.120
But like this is a woman and this is not her place and she doesn't belong here.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.760
Kind of the analogy that I would make because I after getting these experiences, I would learn

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:06.880
this afterwards. If I tell you that there's another guy in a room and you need to think of the worst

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.640
insults ever for that person without ever knowing anything about them or meeting them.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.040
If I tell you that it's like a white straight guy and you have to write insults, you're fucked.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:19.200
Maybe you can do like school shooter. There's not really much you can say at the end of the day.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:22.960
But if I tell you it's a woman, whoo, there are so many different jokes you can write.

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:25.760
If it's a black person, so many different racist things we can say.

01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.720
Are you sure? I can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.680
In terms of stuff that is just intrinsic to him being a white guy?

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.840
Yeah, like there's really?

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:39.440
Wait a minute. What are you talking about? There's a lot. The internet has sharpened that sword.

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:42.640
In terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex or targets?

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:46.560
Incel, virgin, weak.

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:50.080
Some of the incel, virgin, maybe. Yeah, that's getting there, sure. That's for sure.

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.920
That's recent though. Sorry, I'm older on the internet. We didn't have those words way back

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:56.960
then. When I was making these analogies that incel and virgin.

01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.560
Back in my day, we didn't have gender. There were no incels back then. None of us had sex.

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:04.000
We just accept it. We were all computer gamers. Nobody had sex to play video games back then,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.200
okay? People don't remember that. There wasn't the big bang theory. You were just a loser that

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.400
was stuck in zero. You guys didn't even know sex exists as we can use this as an insult.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.360
We had to download sexual pictures and they took two minutes and you didn't even know if

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:16.480
you were going to get the right thing by the time it finished loading. But what I'm saying is that,

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.280
okay, I think you agree that if somebody gives you a race, like a black person who's a woman,

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:26.160
we can write very cutting, scathing insults for that person that are very otherizing.

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:31.280
Or words that would really hurt. Yeah, that are very cutting to the person. But for a white guy,

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.080
it's kind of hard because that's the default. There's not as much otherizing of those people.

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.600
Yeah. So the insults you have from white guy to white guy, the insults are much harsher.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.640
So when you start to apply the same kind of harshness to other groups,

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.280
you can make them feel like they really don't belong. And that otherizing effect is something

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:52.720
that's very hard for me. I can't really empathize with it because I never felt it. So I have to

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.080
intellectualize it and then sympathize with it. It's like a whole process I have to go through.

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:59.440
And then I try to walk other people through that because if you're a white guy on the internet,

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.080
which is a lot of the internet, you really don't know what that feels like. You've never felt

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:08.960
like that before. Well, so you're now in a leadership position, grandpa destiny. So that's

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.320
a lot of people look up to you for that. For that sort of pathway to empathy. Yeah.

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:20.400
How not to otherize. I mean, you have felt otherizing. You mentioned high school people

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.760
like not being... Yeah, but those are always for things that like it's different to insult somebody

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.920
for a non-immutable characteristic. Like, okay, you think poorly about me because I'm like not

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:32.880
enough money or what? I don't have money, but I could get more money and I could change that.

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:36.960
But it's different for somebody to really attack you for like your gender or attack you for like

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:44.160
your race. A lot of the attacks that hit the hardest is not about gender. I do think that

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.920
the way women are attacked on the internet, it's the same kind of attacks you would do

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.320
towards other guys, but you'd go harsher. I feel like they're fundamentally different.

01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:00.880
I feel like when we're attacking guys, I'm not usually attacking you on like the virtue of you

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.440
being a guy. But like, if it's a woman and she's typing something like, oh, did your boyfriend

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:08.960
type that for you? Or like, what are you even doing here? Like, shouldn't you be trying to find a

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:12.560
husband? Or like, oh, you're like a stupid kind of like ghost type and only fans? No, but the

01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:16.240
stupidity, the intelligence aspect is what's attacked. Yeah, but it's so much different. Like,

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:19.840
you can call a guy stupid, but that's because he's a guy that's being stupid. But when you call

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.080
a woman stupid, she's stupid because she's a woman. Yeah, but I honestly think that women

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.840
are called stupid more than men on the internet. But it's nothing to do, like the attack

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:38.080
is not gendered. It's the gender inspires an increased level of attack. I feel like it is

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.360
gendered. I wish we had data on this. Have you ever heard of the XKCD comics? Yes. It's a really

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:47.760
good comic where, and this is something that I've dealt with a lot in my community, okay? There's

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:53.120
a guy at a board and he fucks up a math equation. And it's like, wow, you suck at math. And then

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:56.640
the next panelist, there's a girl that does it and she fucks it up. And it's like, wow, women

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:02.560
suck at math. And there's like that feeling that happens where when I bring on, I won't use names,

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:06.720
but they're like YouTube people that are brought on that have crazy opinions. And when they're men,

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.760
that person is crazy. Oh my God, he said the crazy stuff. He's so dumb. He's so crazy, so stupid.

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.680
But when it's a woman, it's like, oh my God, why do you always bring dumb women here? Why do so

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:19.120
many women on the internet have crazy opinions? There's a different like minority character

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.240
that has to like stand it and like represent like they're a whole group where like white men

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.920
don't typically have to. Speaking of group sources, individuals, yes. But then what I feel happens is

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:36.080
then another person from that group comes, another woman comes and people before she says anything

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:42.400
will already feel like they're ready with that attack. For sure. But they're ready for the attack

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:45.920
because she's a woman. They're going to call her she's stupid because she's not because she says

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:53.360
something to them or just because she's a woman. So like the group in their brain accumulates all

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.680
the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met, not the positive, the negative,

01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:03.200
and it becomes like this ball of stickiness. And then that becomes the bias for their judgment of

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.480
a new person that comes with white men. There's more of a blank slate in terms of bias of how

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:15.280
they analyze the person with any of the minority group, they basically make a judgment based on

01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.080
the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met in the past. That leads to a system

01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:25.440
where you're just harsher towards minority groups and towards women. How do you solve that?

01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:29.920
The most important thing for any problem ever is step one is to be aware of it. If you're not aware

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.640
of it, then you're hopelessly lost at sea. But yeah, the first thing I like to say is she's like

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:38.240
be aware of it. Like I've had, there's a girl that I've had on recently and she says a lot of,

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:42.240
in my opinion, kind of crazy things, but people will use her as like this is why women shouldn't

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.760
be here. This is like she's crazy and she's a woman and blah, blah, blah. But I can bring on a guy

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:51.280
who's has similarly done things and he's evaluated on his own merits because it's a guy. There's never,

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:54.560
ever, ever been a case where I brought a stupid guy on stream and everybody's like,

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:58.480
this guy makes me hate men. This guy makes me hate white people. That has never happened.

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.920
But then there's like other women that come on and it's like, now I know why incels exist.

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:05.760
Or I totally understand where red pill ideology comes from. And even if the statements are kind

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:10.400
of true, when you're making these observations over and over and over and over again, it damages

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.480
your ability to individually perceive somebody. And then two people that make the same statements,

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.240
one can be perceived more harshly just because of that like group bias you've got built up.

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:21.280
I think there's something about streaming that just brings that out of people. Like because

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:26.080
you have to talk for like seven hours. So you're like, all right, well, whatever psychological

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.560
issues and complexities I have, I'm going to explore that for some magnified magnified.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:37.920
And then it's the, as you talked about the memetic theories or Gerardian, like whatever

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:43.280
the things that are very similar and you're going to magnify the conflicts that you have and you're

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:47.360
going to explore the, all the different perspectives on those different conflicts.

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:52.960
And I mean, I don't know if it's just anecdotal, but it's nice to have women on stream. And I think

01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:00.400
the dynamic that you guys have is wonderful. It's really interesting. So it's just the female

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:06.160
voice in general. I love having women on the podcast. The female voice, I feel like is under

02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:11.600
heard on the internet and I would love the internet to be a place where women feel safe to

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:18.560
speak. All right, given that you're, like we talked about a progressive with non-standard

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:25.600
progressive views. So you're very pro free speech, pro capitalism. So given that it's very

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:32.240
interesting that you're also pro establishment and pro institutions. So right now if you look

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.680
at the world, there's a significant distrust of institutions, at least in sort of public

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.720
intellectual discourse. What is the nature of your support for government and institutions?

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:51.520
Can you make the case for and against them? Broadly speaking, there is a synergistic effect

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:57.920
when two humans come together. If I can speak very broadly in terms of, we'll say utility,

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:05.600
my happiness with one person might be 10. When they come together, it's like 50

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.360
between the two of them. There's like the synergistic effect when humans work together

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:13.520
that the sum is greater than all the individual parts or whatever. There's like an emergent

02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:18.080
thing that happens there. There's a capacity, there's a possibility of that. Yeah, a possibility,

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:21.280
sure. Things could go really wrong. There could be a cannibalistic tribe that all eats each other,

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:24.960
but for the purpose of this. There's all their failure modes, but yes.

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:30.080
Okay, sure. Yeah. But I think broadly speaking, are you going to be the well actually guy?

02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:36.000
Okay, if you want to well, okay. Well, actually. Sometimes cannibalism is actually good for both.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.680
True. Yeah, sometimes things do go wrong. But I think broadly speaking, the fact that

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:42.880
you're sitting here in clothing that you didn't make and I'm sitting here on an airplane that

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:46.480
I don't know how to fly or build, like right, there's a lot of cool stuff that happens when

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.960
people come together and they make civilizations. And part of that civilization building is the

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.720
fact that we can specialize. And it's the fact that we can offload a bunch of trust onto third

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:03.840
parties that we delegate the power to make important decisions about our lives, right?

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:08.800
I don't know anything about how to like build like a combustion engine, but I know that when I

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.080
push the button in my car, it's going to drive around and the fumes aren't going to kill me

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:15.760
and I can park it in garages and the building's not going to collapse. And the only reason all

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:19.440
of this works is because I've offloaded a lot of trust onto these third party things.

02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:22.720
And I would say that the pillars of these third party things that society is built on

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.160
are roughly speaking institutions. So that might be the institution of peer review for

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:35.200
scientific articles. It might be the institution of voting for government, right? Or the ability

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:39.360
for us to vote in that whole process. It might, yeah, all the FDA, like all of the institutions

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:43.840
and things that they need to exist because we don't have the time or the capability to

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:48.080
individually sort through all of these things individually. We have to rely on some third

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:56.000
party to do it. Okay. So you believe at scale, when we're together, we're greater than the

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.360
sum of our parts. That's the case for institutions. Absolutely. What about the inefficiencies of

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:08.400
bureaucracy? Is there some aspect when at scale, different dynamics come into play than they do

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:12.480
when there's two people together, two people that love each other, the birds and the bees?

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.320
Is there some aspect that leads more to cannibalism at scale? So like corruption

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:24.080
inefficiencies that due to bureaucracy and so on. Bureaucracy, which is not, I hate it when people

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.400
try to say bureaucracy is government because bureaucracy exists a ton in private environments

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.360
as well, right? In businesses and everything. Bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems.

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.080
But I mean, a bureaucracy is necessary because it's coordinating all of the underlying things

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:43.280
in order to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts, right? Like all of the

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:46.640
software developers in the world are useless without being paired with good designers in

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.320
order to make their products usable by a person. And the coordination of those people and the

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.320
coordination of increasingly more and more things necessitates some level of bureaucracy.

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.480
I think we always say bureaucracy when it's like a bad, it's like a slur on us. Like you're

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:01.520
a bureaucrat, you're bureaucratic. The bureaucracy is slowing everything down. It's like,

02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.200
sure, the bureaucracy slows things down, but bureaucracy also gives us things like, you know,

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.840
safe medicine and safe water to drink for most of the US or safe buildings to live in or safe

02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:15.200
cars to drive. So the managers in institution versus like the software developers and the

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:22.320
designers, the managers is the bureaucracy. The reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is that

02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:30.960
something about human nature leads to bureaucracy often growing, growing indefinitely and becoming

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:37.280
less and less efficient. I mean, this is where capitalism can come in, that capitalism puts

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:43.760
a pressure on the bureaucracy not to grow too much because you want the bureaucracy to be useful,

02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:53.040
but not large. To be a certain size, of course. To be the minimum size to get the job done.

02:04:53.040 --> 02:05:01.280
And so capitalism provides that mechanism. Government does not always. And so that's

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.800
the criticism of government of institutions where it can grow without a significant mechanism that says

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:12.480
there's a cost to bureaucracy that's not being accounted for here. We're just paying for the

02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:19.120
increasing size of government without the benefit. Yeah, government is a special institution because

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:23.600
it doesn't have to show itself to be financially viable. And we kind of live in a capitalist economy

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.680
where that's generally the case. So government gets its powers from votes from the people,

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:32.800
which introduces a whole new set of possible positives and possible negatives. Having something,

02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:36.800
for instance, that gives food or shelter to homeless people, maybe you don't want that to

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:42.480
have to run at a profit. But giving an organization that can self-justify its budgets perpetually

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:46.320
and indefinitely growing, maybe that's not the best thing. Yeah, we always have to figure out

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:53.120
how to do the constraints there. What about the corrupting nature of power? That comes with

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:58.720
institutions as well. Absolutely. So then you better pick your style of institution very carefully.

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:02.000
I think that the democratic institution we have in the United States today,

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.360
I think works very well. But I mean, there are other styles of government that have been tried

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:08.800
in the past that I think lend themselves more to corruption. Not to say that, by the way,

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:11.920
there's not corruption in the United States. Of course, there's going to be varying levels of

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:19.520
corruption at all levels. But you run into this interesting problem where authoritarian regimes

02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:23.920
can act with ruthless precision and swiftness because they don't have to ask any questions.

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:28.720
They just do, do, do, do, do. And that's it. But the problem is, it's an authoritarian regime.

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:33.680
They're prone to missteps. They're slow to respond to changing or evolving needs. There was an

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.280
interesting study that was put out a while ago that showed that every single famine that happened

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:42.320
around the world, almost 98% of them happen under authoritarian regimes where freedom of

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:46.640
speech is very limited. It's very rare for a famine to happen under democracy because

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:49.760
press and everything makes the government more responsive to the needs of the people.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:53.280
Power can corrupt. Their level is of corruption. But you have to have a system of checks and

02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:56.880
balances on all of those different levels to make sure it doesn't run off the rails, I guess,

02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:02.960
and do a sick loop-de-loop and half the population gets nice callback. There's a lot of people that

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:07.520
will listen to you say that the democracy in the United States is working pretty damn well

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:14.080
and they will spit out the drink if they're drinking a drink and be very upset. Can you make the case

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:17.680
that they're right and you're wrong? Can I make the case that- Can you steal man?

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.160
They're right. Yeah. Well, the steal man for them is that people have a lot of problems on the day

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:27.680
to day. And when they look and they see what government is doing, they might see potholes

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:33.040
outside their house, homeless people all over their downtown, and the United States just approved

02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:38.640
another X billion amount of dollars for Ukraine. Or they might be living in a city where half

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:43.200
the factors are shut down. A lot of their people are out of work, but the president is on the TV

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.280
talking about how to find jobs for immigrants coming in from Mexico. And for these people,

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:52.160
they have problems that exist in their lives. Some of them are paying taxes to alleviate these

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:56.080
problems. And then when they listen to the government talk, it feels like the government is

02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:00.400
not responding to the needs that they have. And then that's one problem. Then on top of that,

02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:02.960
you've got all of these people working in alternative media that can show you, well,

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:06.960
look at this politician wasting this much money. Or look at him double speaking here or there.

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:10.960
Look at Hillary Clinton saying she's got a private position and a public position. Look at how

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.240
all of these politicians have family members that are getting rich because of their relationships

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:19.280
with people in Congress. Look at the revolving door between capitalist companies and the government.

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:22.480
How can you look at all of that, take into account that the government's not responding

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:26.160
to your needs and then really feel like it's a government by the people and for the people?

02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:31.920
Yeah, this was a very good, good steelman and good question. How can you, how can you,

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:35.120
how can you tell that they're not just politicians that care more about

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:40.560
continuously winning the elections versus being running government effectively?

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:43.360
They should care about winning the elections. That's the first misconception. A lot of people

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:48.640
say this guy only cares about getting voted in. This guy, like, he doesn't even believe in fracking

02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:52.240
or abortion. He just changed his opinion to get voted in. Anytime somebody says that,

02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:55.680
you say, that's really good. You want them to change their opinions so they get voted in.

02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:58.720
That's the whole point of the democracy. You don't want them to remain obstinate. You don't

02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:01.600
want them to say, I'm not changing my opinion no matter what the people want. You want them to

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.360
evolve and adopt new opinions based on what the population, their constituents are voting for.

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:10.080
Yeah, but the cynical take is that on the surface they're changing their opinion,

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:16.800
but that there's a boys club or boys means the elite that under in the smoke filled rooms

02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.920
in secret, they're actually have their own agenda and they're following that agenda and they're

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:28.800
just saying anything publicly to placate the public based on whatever the new trends are.

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.840
So here's the cynical take a poll.

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:37.680
Yeah, I understand. Somebody asked me this question and it flipped. I won 80 completely.

02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:43.840
I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016 and my single issue voting thing was lobbying.

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.560
I thought that lobbying, the government was corrupt, they weren't responding to these people.

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.840
It was completely destroyed my faith in government and everything. And I had one question post me

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.680
by a conservative that used to come on my stream and shout at me and he said, I think he asked me,

02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.760
can you think of any popular opinion that the American public has that the government is

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:05.360
unresponsive to? Is there some big piece of legislation or policy or whatever that people

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:10.800
want that the government isn't doing? They asked me that. I couldn't think of a single good answer.

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:17.600
And I'm like, oh, geez, there's good. There's drugs. There's not. Legalization or drug. Hold on.

02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:20.800
Yeah, go for it. Oh, shoot. You're doing the Joe Rogan thing. You're pushing back because I brought

02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:30.720
up weed. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I have become meme. I don't even, I don't want to interrupt your quote

02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.440
because there's memes upon memes upon memes I can go with here. But no, because people bring up,

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:40.800
okay, there's no issues. There's no issues that the government is not representing of the public.

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.480
So here's the issue. So somebody will bring up like, well, what about the legalization of drugs?

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.360
Okay. The first issue people have is one, they look at national polling. Very few things are

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:54.640
decided on a national level. So that's the first huge mistake. Arguably, a lot of BLM made mistakes

02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:58.560
in this arena where they're saying like, why isn't the government doing anything about policing?

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:00.960
Federal government can't do anything about policing. That's going to be your, sometimes

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.840
not even your state government, sometimes your local city government, the people that like elect

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:08.800
like your chief of police, your police commissioner, that's coming from your mayor, right? So you've

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:12.400
got people looking, one, at the wrong parts of the government to even figure out the solutions to

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.440
the problem. Two, oftentimes for polling, the questions are vague enough that you can pull

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.240
very high. But when you get into the weeds on things, no pun intended, you start to realize

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:25.840
like, oh, shoot, this is more complicated than I thought. I don't know the numbers in particular

02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:30.160
for legalization of marijuana, but this is what I'm going to guess is the case. If you poll and you

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:36.720
say, should we legalize marijuana, that number might pull at like 65, 70%. But that's including

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:41.040
people that are in favor of medical marijuana. If you were to poll, like, should we legalize,

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.040
should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana, that number might drop to like

02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:49.120
52%. And then if you poll, like, should we completely legalize, not just decriminalize,

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.240
but completely legalize recreational use of marijuana, that number might drop to like 40%.

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.280
There's like all these different ways you can pull around issues where people are like, oh,

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.960
no, we broadly agree on this topic. But when you really figure out, well, do you,

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:01.920
do we really agree? Or is it just like broad consensus around a thing that's never going

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.920
to show up like in a piece of legislation? A really good example, one example I do know is

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.320
socialized health care. I think if you poll, there was a time a few years ago where if you

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:15.760
poll America, do you think every American citizen should have access to like free health care?

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:21.760
I think that answer, that poll like 74% yes. But when you asked, should the government be the sole

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:27.280
provider of health care, it dropped to like 26%, dropped 50 points. And you could see it was both

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:30.960
asking questions about single payer, but the way that it was asked was so different that even if

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:34.960
you all, it looks like there's consensus, there's not nearly as much consensus as people think

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.600
around certain ideas. Yeah, go. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right.

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:45.920
That polls, the way you ask the polls really matters. But when you ask, should the government

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:52.480
be in charge of a thing, that also biases the answer, right? Like, because there's such a negative

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.680
experience with government creating a dog gov site that runs the thing. But sometimes,

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.440
sometimes, I think if you dig in, if you have a one hour conversation with each individual

02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.040
citizen, I think you will understand that, yes, there is support for socialized medicine.

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.920
The argument has to be made though, yeah. What do you mean with the argument has to be made?

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.040
Like, if you just ask a conservative, like what about single payer, they're going to tell you,

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:20.240
no, you might be able to build up to an argument for it, but you're going to have to make the case

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:25.680
for it. No, but I thought we're talking about the feeling deep inside your mind and heart.

02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:32.240
Does the government represent that? Oh. So it's not like some shallow surface layer

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:39.600
public opinion. Does the government effectively represent what the people want? Not a shallow

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.320
survey, but deeply what they want. I'm not actually that familiar with the debates over

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:49.600
healthcare, but let's maybe look at an easier one. Sure. Maybe you'll say it's harder. War.

02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.960
War is a really good example where the government was very responsive, I think, to the people.

02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:01.840
You think so. So, Iraq, Afghanistan, the government didn't manipulate public opinion.

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:06.080
There is an argument to be made that they did in terms of like WMD and everything,

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:11.040
but after 9-11, were you in the United States after 9-11? After 9-11, I legit.

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.600
That seems accusatory. Like, where were you in 9-11?

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.560
Just checking, okay. All right, cool. I have evidence and witnesses. No, okay,

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:24.800
I'm very defensive right now. That's very strange. Look into it.

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:30.000
I think after 9-11, we could have gone to war with any country in the world.

02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:36.000
We were ready because all of America was like, oh my God. And they pointed to Iraq and, you know,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.840
the reasons for the WMDs was kind of dumb, but I don't think we even needed WMDs to go to Iraq.

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.760
We could have just said, you know, Saddam Hussein was giving medical aid to Taliban,

02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:49.680
al-Qaeda, Iraq, let's go, and we would have gone for it. But post Iraq, Iraq was for a while

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.000
popular and then became obviously deeply unpopular, Iraq and Afghanistan. And I think you could see

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.160
that influence other foreign policy that the United States had. For instance, we opted more

02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:02.400
towards like drone warfare than troops on the ground for places like Yemen. We opted more

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:05.440
towards like kind of like sending money and help instead of boots on the ground for places like

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.880
Syria. And I think that a lot of that was kind of in response to how unpopular the Iraq stuff

02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:14.880
had become. And when you looked at a lot of elections afterwards, even for Obama, like one

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:18.480
of the defining characteristics of a lot of campaigns were like, I'm going to close Guantanamo

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:22.640
Bay. I'm going to get us out of foreign wars. Even up to Trump, I'm going to, you know, I'm not

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:26.320
going to stop doing all this weird stuff in the Middle East. But they didn't still withdraw from

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:30.080
Afghanistan. They didn't withdraw, but they definitely like tapered off and weren't like as

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.840
aggressively pushing those types of conflicts because they knew it was unpopular. But I think

02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:39.600
if you also consider perfect information or good information, if you ask a lot of people,

02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:47.120
are you okay spending this amount of money for this purpose? So military conflict in

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:50.800
Iraq and Afghanistan, I think almost from the very beginning, they would say no.

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.880
After 9-11? I feel like maybe like a few days after 9-11, like,

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.160
I remember Freedom Prize.

02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:02.080
What was the nature? Well, there's some memes and so on, yes. But the nature of the public support

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:08.160
for the war, was there public support in 2003, which is when the invasion happened?

02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:12.080
I feel like initially there was a lot, I remember seeing it on, but then I also lived in a republican

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:15.520
household and I was not very like media savvy at that. And I don't know if the nature of that

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:20.080
public support had to do with WMDs or with 9-11. Because the weird-

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:21.520
It came about WMDs.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:26.240
But I wonder what is the, if you were to poll people and let's say hypothetically,

02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:30.640
there was above 50% support for the war, what would be the nature of that support?

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:37.600
And to what degrees the government actually representing the will of the people versus

02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:44.560
some complex mechanism like the military industrial complex is manipulating the narrative

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:51.280
that's controlling public opinion. And then there's the media that gets a lot of attention

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:56.480
by being divided and how they're shaping the narrative through the mechanism of division.

02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:01.600
There's a lot of complicated things out there. It's not just like the people and then the

02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:04.400
government. And that's, yeah, for sure, I agree that there are going to be different

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:05.520
elements at play.

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:12.000
And how much of those elements that lead us astray can be attributed to the

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:19.440
largeness of the different systems and the different institutions, like the media institutions

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:24.640
and government, the institutions that have a monopoly on violence. Let's put it this way,

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:26.880
which is one way to define government.

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:30.880
Sure. It's complicated. There's definitely going to be different institutions at play.

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.560
But I think that like, all I would say is like in reference to my original point,

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.400
when there becomes like broad consensus around a thing, I think the government will usually

02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:41.120
follow. It's not going to fight. It's going to follow more often than not.

02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:45.360
But I think that a lot of times I think Americans think that there's more consensus

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:49.440
around certain issues than there actually are. So like a really good example, we're on that war

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:56.080
point too. What caused like the lowest dip in Biden's approval rating? I'm pretty sure it was

02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.120
right after we pulled out of Afghanistan, which I think if I would have asked people like a year

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.440
before, like, let's assume that we could pull out of Afghanistan, the government's probably

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.240
going to collapse after we leave because they just don't have the will to fight, they don't have

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:11.920
the support, whatever, it's just not going to work. But like no Americans are going to die.

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:13.760
There might be a couple other people who are like, no Americans are going to die,

02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:16.960
we're going to get out of Afghanistan. Would you support that? I think broadly speaking,

02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.040
I think more than 60 or 70% of Americans are like, yeah, that would be fine.

02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:24.080
But then when it actually plays on TV, when we see the people hanging onto the planes,

02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:27.280
when we see like helicopter embassies, some of the courts and politicians,

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:30.080
well now it's like, oh my God, this was horrible and it was so botched.

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.640
And it could have gone so much better. It's like, well, could it have gone better?

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.520
Maybe, maybe not. But I mean, it seems like you can have consensus around a certain opinion.

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:40.880
But the way that things play out and the way that people actually feel,

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.880
it's actually way, way, way more complicated. And there's not usually this broad consensus

02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:51.360
opinion. All right, yeah, go ahead. I'd like to believe that. I mean, just to lay my cards on the

02:18:51.360 --> 02:19:04.480
table, I have faith in the power of effective government. I just have a lot of concern about

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:10.000
what happens as institutions grow in size. For sure. And I just have a lot of worry about the

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:17.200
natural corrupting influence on the individuals and on the system as a whole, like the boys' club

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:22.320
nature of it. I don't know, there must be a better term. But basically, they, they agree to the game

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:28.800
and they play the game and there's a generational aspect momentum to the game. And they more and

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.840
more stop being responsive to the people that they represent. I just feel like there is that

02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:41.200
mechanism. And I think the nice thing, democracy elections are a resistance to that natural human

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:46.880
mechanism. Also, the balances of power is a resistance to that mechanism. In some ways,

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:52.560
the media that reveals the bullshit of politicians is also a resistance to that mechanism. It's hard

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:58.160
to be full of shit as a politician because people will try to catch you on it. So there's a honesty

02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:04.080
method there that keeps you honest. It's to some degree, but it still feels like

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:11.520
it still feels like politicians are going to politician. Yeah, they definitely play their

02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:16.240
games. That is true. There's probably always going to be that meta narrative over like

02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:20.880
governance that just develops as like, you have to form relationships and play games to

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:24.880
like get legislation passed and everything. The only, the only reason why I don't like it when

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:29.280
people attack institutions is because one, institutions are incredibly important, arguably

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:34.080
paramount. No, they are to keeping society running. And two, I think sometimes when we shift the

02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:38.480
blame onto institutions too much, I think that we lose sight of what the real problems are.

02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:42.640
So for instance, in the United States today, people might be very critical of the government not

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.120
getting much done, but then everybody turns their eyes to the government for being ineffective.

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.360
What I would argue is I would say the government is actually incredibly effective and it's

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:55.680
showcasing the will of the American people really well right now, which is we are historically

02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:00.160
more divided than we have ever been. And if I were to just look at the people and I would say

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:05.040
we have a historic divide that is getting like rapidly blown apart by things like the internet

02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.560
and the media, right? If that exists, well, what would I expect that government to look like?

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:11.440
I wouldn't expect the government to be governing very effective. I would expect that government

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:16.720
to show that legitimate divide in people. Do you think that divide, we have a perception of a

02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:22.160
large divide between left and right. Do you think that's a real divide that's in this country?

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:27.520
Narrow the language. What do you mean by real divide? Do you think there is that divide in

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:31.520
ideology, that there's a large number of people that believe a certain set of policies and the

02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:36.320
different set of policies? Or is it just the perception on Twitter? No, I think there is a

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:39.600
large divide in terms of belief. I don't think there's very much divide between any people

02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:43.840
in terms of like what they like on the most fundamental levels want in terms of like human

02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:48.000
beings. But in terms of like Democrat versus Republican right now, I think there is a huge

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.520
divide in terms of the direction they want to see the country go and what they believe

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.720
really and what they even believe is reality, right? Unfortunately, that's who we've gotten to.

02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:59.520
Can I just speak about the mechanism of the left and right here, maybe on the

02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:05.440
memetic-roverly aspect? Is there some aspect to the left on which you're a part of that attacks

02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:12.080
their own for ideological impurity more than the right does? Is it the bigotry of small differences?

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:18.560
There's a concept where when you're near somebody who is very slightly different than you,

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:22.160
you want to destroy it, but when you're with somebody that's way different than you, you don't.

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:26.320
I think the left does it, but I think the right does it too. I didn't realize it until

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:29.920
I started dipping more into conservative communities, but oh my god, the people from the

02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:34.960
Daily Wire and the people from Turning Point and the America First, all these different groups

02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:39.040
of people hate each other and they fight each other so much. They hire and fire sometimes,

02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:43.120
employs, they talk smack about each other. I think there's a lot of political division between

02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:46.320
both sides. I think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more because it's like the

02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:49.520
internet and a lot of the internet spaces have a lot of left-leaning people, so you see like

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:54.080
the crazy communists and the crazy progressives and the crazy center-left liberals and the crazy

02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:57.680
blah blah blah, whereas a lot of the right-leaning people have kind of been pushed off of the main

02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:02.960
areas of the internet now. Interesting. My sense was that it's hard to exist on the center-left,

02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:08.800
but maybe because I just don't have the full spectrum view of the political divide. It felt

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:12.720
like center-left is a difficult position to occupy. Yeah, I would definitely say so, yeah.

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:17.120
I don't know if it's that difficult to be center-right. It's very difficult to be center-right.

02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:21.040
I think actually maybe even more difficult, because a center-right person might be somebody

02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:26.960
who's like conservative, but not a fan of Trump and you're like over, like looking like Liz Cheney,

02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:30.160
right? You've had politicians that are just like, they didn't back the Trump stuff and now they're

02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:33.760
gone, or you might be like center-right, but like you don't think the election was stolen

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:37.280
and now you're like half the Republican party is looking at you like you're crazy, you know?

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:44.400
That's true. That's true. I think there's a Ben Shapiro I'm talking with. I think he publicly

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:48.400
spoke against Trump, right? He did initially, but I feel like he softened his language up on

02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:52.640
him pretty significantly, but... So there's a significant pressure to kind of count how to

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:56.160
a certain kind of messaging. Which the whole Republican party is feeling right now. Geez,

02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:58.320
that two years from now, that election is going to be insane.

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:02.880
It's just hard. Okay. So to generalize, it's hard to be in the center, it feels like.

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.440
For sure.

02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:10.800
To center and then like do like a random walk among the policies around that. I don't know

02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:17.360
what that mechanism is. I mean, it makes people like me not feel good being in the center. It

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:24.160
seems like people are just not nice to people in the center. Like the public, the Twitter machine

02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:29.360
is not nice to people who are open-minded in the center. Is there some truth to that?

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:33.360
Two reasons for that. One is because I think a lot of people that market themselves as center

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:38.800
are legitimately spineless cowards and deserve to be called out. I've never killed the man,

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:46.080
but today might be my first. Oh no. Like I told you, I'll take over your stream with the AI.

02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:48.880
Yeah, we'll see. Is that guy going to be streaming in the background?

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:56.400
Hey fellas. Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Lots of gotchas, lots of gotchas. Okay, gotcha.

02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:02.560
And decrease them up, which already is a pretty low level of emotion. Just decrease it completely.

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:07.200
When people are screaming at you and accusing stuff, just remain calm.

02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:09.680
Absolutely. Emotionless. The gaslighter strategy.

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:16.240
Okay, so what we're talking about. So I don't. I don't even, I don't ever identify a center

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.400
anything because it's got such a bad reputation because so many.

02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:24.080
Fuck that. I stand center with a spine. It's called being open-minded and it's not

02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.080
center left and right, those are just labels. Here's a really good quote my mom said to me

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:32.000
when I was really young. She said, Stevie, don't ever let your mind be so open that your brain

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.520
falls out. And that's what I find that a lot of center people do. That's not what she told me

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:42.720
last night. Why are you like this? I'm sorry. Okay, I'm glad I can, glad I can bring that. I'm glad

02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:45.920
you feel like this is safe space. Like I said, people, not judgmental. If you want to talk about

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:49.120
fucking my mom, you know what? You're totally within your rights. I didn't say that. You said

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:52.720
that. I didn't say that. I support that. She's a beautiful woman. Her husband probably wouldn't

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:57.680
be too happy about it, but you know, I didn't say those any sexual relations. It was just that

02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:02.480
having a conversation with her, you projected that that says more by you than me. Anyway,

02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:09.280
go ahead about spineless center. There is some aspect to that, which is like amorphous. To me,

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:16.240
center means you think freely about each individual policy without being stuck to a king.

02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:19.520
Some ideal, yeah, but a lot of people don't do that. They call them so centrist, but then they

02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:23.440
just, they're anti-establishment essentially on everything. I don't know your position on

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:27.600
like the vaccines or anything, but like, I've met a lot of like free and open thinkers who are like,

02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:31.920
you know what? I'm open to everything and it's an experimental vaccine and I'm going to eat hydroxy

02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.600
chloroquine and ivermectin because that's what the institutions are telling me not to take. And I

02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:39.920
think Fauci got too much money from that company and these are, but I'm an open thinker. And they,

02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:44.400
what open thinker becomes- I'm an MIT. What do you think my position of vaccines is exactly?

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:47.120
I hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people. Okay. You might be from MIT,

02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:50.080
but I know you're from the internet. Okay. And people from the internet are weird and crazy.

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:58.400
So yeah. Well, I- Who knows? I don't like arrogance. And I have criticized scientists during COVID,

02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:02.720
a lot of people, but scientists included having arrogance. Which is fair. But- And that's, and I

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:08.400
think there's a lot of good criticism to be made of different scientific and medical establishments

02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:14.160
over a lot of stuff. But nobody can make those good criticisms because they're too like obsessed

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:18.880
over like just trying to have the anti-establishment answer. And that is what is upsetting me the most.

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:24.640
Like I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handled

02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:28.480
the coronavirus. You know, were lockdowns effective? Was there enough data to support the

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:34.240
huge measures we took? You know, why didn't we have the option to show I was infected a month ago?

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:37.040
Why do I need to be vaccinated? Why did, why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:41.760
States? I don't think it was. There are really good questions to be asked there. But all the people

02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:45.520
asking the questions are also trying to tell you that ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the

02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.040
way to go for everything. And the vaccine is evil. And they're just going to turn you gay like the

02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:54.080
frogs. And it's like, Jesus, like you get, there's like no place to reasonably criticize from

02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:58.160
because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or, you know,

02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:01.600
they're not reading studies or do anything. They're saying like, I do my own research, which means

02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:04.960
they listen to whatever the last guy on Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion 100%.

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.040
Easy no. Easy no, gross. The last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan. Okay. That Robert Malone

02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.280
guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. That's one guest. People see him as like the father of

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:18.960
mRNA technology. He published one paper. Okay. What do you mean people? Which people think that?

02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:22.080
Joe Rogan fans. I get like, I run into these people. I start arguing with people and they

02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:26.400
start studying me. But what about- I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine.

02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:28.480
That's good. I'm glad you do. But there's definitely-

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:32.960
Sorry, but you said there's a type. There's a type. What's the type of Joe Rogan fan?

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:38.240
Anti-establishment. I think that's not Joe Rogan. That's a general public discourse. There's a

02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:44.960
default anti-establishment on the right and the left. That's the default easy thing to go to.

02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:48.160
I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though.

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:52.480
Like I could guess the Joe Rogan fan. Like if I were to do general population versus Joe

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.720
Rogan fan, who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine?

02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:57.920
Do you have data on this? Are you just guessing?

02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:01.600
Just guessing. Yeah. I think you are actually judging.

02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:04.400
I am. Yeah. I think you're judging. Because I think you're also-

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.400
The beautiful thing about podcasting, this could be similar to streaming, is there's a large

02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:15.440
number of people that just listen. Like what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan?

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:19.280
I don't think you just listen. I think people listen and absorb the information.

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:24.480
I would say that Joe Rogan fan base is as divided in the vaccine as the general public.

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.000
Gotcha. Man, I'm going to look for polling data on that. I'm sure somebody's got to have done it

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.120
out there. But you're basically revealing the fact they have no data. You're using your own judgment.

02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:37.600
For sure. Based on how he's had conversations about his experience with the coronavirus,

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:41.120
and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like

02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:44.640
anti-vax talking points and been completely unchallenged. And then based on statements

02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:47.840
he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well. Yeah.

02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:50.720
So that it's the level of challenge or not that he's doing.

02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:53.920
Well, yeah. And then what his true positions are. And then the types of guests he typically

02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:56.000
chooses to bring on to talk about the vaccines. Yeah.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:02.560
Okay. But that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:07.440
I mean, I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people.

02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:11.920
They seem to- All the coronavirus, that whole one or two years broke. A lot of people.

02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:16.960
Because there's a lot of emotion and their emotion quickly solidified into an opinion

02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:22.720
that almost had nothing to do with like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on.

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:26.480
You just made up your mind. Yeah. But I think a lot of it comes from that anti-establishment

02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:32.960
place. Like the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment. It was a huge private company

02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:39.920
backed by a huge public government. And there's Fauci, and there's Biden, and there's Pfizer,

02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:43.200
and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing.

02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:48.720
Like the vaccine was like the ultimate submission tool to show you that the government owns you.

02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:52.320
Not only do you have to get injected once, it's a series. And then you got to get boosters,

02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:54.960
and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb, and that's the control.

02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:58.320
I feel like that vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like,

02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:01.440
do you support, are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government

02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.120
tells the sheep to take? Or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:08.640
and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the

02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:12.960
evil Fauci medicine jab them in the arm? And the funny thing is the crowd that stands

02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:19.360
against the institution is now larger than the crowd of sheep. There's like one sheep standing

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:24.960
there. Sure. Or it feels that way sometimes. One vaccinated sheep. Well, okay. What's the

02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:29.760
defense of institutions? How do you regain the trust of institutions? Like, for first of all,

02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:36.640
do you think that there's ways in which WHO, CDC failed? And do you think there's criticism

02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:41.360
towards Pfizer and the big pharma companies that's deserved? Damn, there's the pharma companies,

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:47.360
I'm not sure. For CDC and WHO, so here's a criticism that I have of all of academia and I

02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:53.120
feel it's stronger, stronger every day. I don't think it's enough to be a researcher or to be

02:31:53.120 --> 02:32:01.760
correct about issues. Academia needs to increase its ability to communicate. It is just an unbelievable,

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:07.600
unmitigated failure that academics are unwilling to wade into the complicated topics

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:12.640
that exist today because other people are, you know? First, you call me spineless and then you

02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:16.320
call me a bad communicator. But no, look, you're here, you're doing it. So you get props from me,

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:21.200
okay? Good job. That motherfu- But there are like so many, but I'm sure you've, I'm sure that you

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:28.080
must have heard another fellow academic, a fellow colleague express some amount of frustration about

02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:32.320
like in their specific discipline, they know something to be true and they know that like,

02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:35.600
a lot of the messaging is like wrong or bad and the public about it, but they're never going to

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:38.960
step out and say anything because either one, they're very measured and careful with their

02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:43.120
take, which they feel is incompatible with what people want to hear or two, they're really worried

02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:46.400
that they might be incorrect. So they're going to be cautious while everybody else is going out in

02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:50.480
like hardcore. And they also don't have the support of institutions for them to go out on a limb.

02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:55.760
Yeah, that too. So like to take risks. For example, I've heard that with lab leak theory.

02:32:55.760 --> 02:33:00.640
I've had a lot of biologists, virologist friends that are like, yeah, it's obviously leaked from

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:07.120
lab early on. Oh, maybe. Okay. We can fight over this one. But sorry, go ahead. We can fight over

02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:13.040
this. But like they, okay, I should sort of back step and say like, that's like, you talk about

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:16.720
shooting the shit you haven't really investigated, but it's your gut. Like, this doesn't make any

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:22.400
sense. There would never say that publicly. Of course. Mostly because you're saying like what

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:26.720
they would all say is like, we want to see data. Yeah, which would be good, which is fine. So

02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:31.360
they're going with like, this is too many coincidence in the same place. That's the logic,

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:34.720
but they don't want to say anything because there's no data. You need to have evidence.

02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:39.440
You need to have actual evidence to say one way or the other. There's that. But there's also just

02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:44.240
like you said, I mean, effective, effective communication. You're a fan of Sean Carroll.

02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:49.360
Oh, yes. He's like one of the only people in this whole planet that I like besides you. I love

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:55.520
Sean Carroll. Anytime Sean Carroll is brought up as evidenced, there's a smile that comes over your

02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:00.480
face. I love it. Of like joy. Yeah. Of like a little kid thinking about Santa Claus. Okay,

02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:07.200
I love Sean Carroll too. I love Sean Carroll because I hate this divide between like you're

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:10.800
either STEM or you're like philosophy, arts and all that other stuff. And the two worlds kind of

02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:14.880
across. And I love that it was so good at physics, but like explorers and pays attention to all of

02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:19.440
the like sociological stuff too. It's so rare to find that quality in a person. He's legit. One of

02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:22.880
the really, really, really specialized, but you don't have to be a Sean Carroll. You can be just

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:28.560
a little better at educating. Another person in the medical and the health space is somebody

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:34.000
named Andrew Huberman, a friend of mine from Stanford. He's an incredible educator. There's

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.360
the kind of process and science they usually call like review or survey papers where you basically

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:45.440
summarize all that's going on, integrate it and like draw wisdom from it and also project like

02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:49.840
where's the discipline headed. And Andrew does that basically on all these subcomponents of

02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:54.800
the different stuff going on in neuroscience and biology and neurobiology, all of that. He's able

02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:00.800
to, he does a podcast called Huberman Lab where he just summarizes all and is able to explain

02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:06.000
like what does that actually mean for your, for your life in terms of protocols of how to make

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.480
your life better. I feel like people should be able to do that more and more, but with viral,

02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:17.120
virology and boy, that's a tricky one. That's a really tricky one. I wish that people could have

02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:21.040
honest conversations. Like I attack a lot of people that do the lab leak theory stuff, but

02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:25.120
truly we should be able to have that conversation publicly. It just, it always feels like the

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:28.000
people that are having the conversation don't ever really want to have the conversation. They're

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:34.240
not being honest. Like I'm a guy that like does his own research and it's so boring reading studies

02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:39.680
and a lot of it, I can only do abstracts and like, it's so much work, but I'll never ever say that

02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:43.120
about myself. I'm a guy that does his own research because every time I hear somebody say that,

02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:45.920
they don't do any research. When they say they do their own research where they mean is they've

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.600
seen one podcast and their opinion on his computer podcast is that definitely not mine

02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.680
because it was mine. I wouldn't be criticizing anything they say. But yeah, so like lab leak

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:57.520
is another one where it's like, well, how do you know it's lab leak? How do I know it's lab leak?

02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:01.760
Because Fauci lied and Hunter Biden laptop and it's like, okay, come on, you haven't engaged with

02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:05.840
it at all. There's really interesting research that shows us a really strong study that shows

02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:10.800
that there's like a high degree of certainty that it came from the wet markets, very, very high

02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.080
degree of certainty. And there was an article that came out recently where it's like, Senate

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:20.000
concludes that virus actually came from the Wuhan virology lab or whatever. And that whole article,

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.720
if you actually read it, it never says that in the article. I don't know why they tweeted it

02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:28.480
with that headline. But yeah, to back up, I'm sorry, I think we should have good, you should be

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:33.520
sorry. Yeah, I'm not sorry, actually, I get to ramble here. Okay, I'm here for a long time. I

02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:38.800
rescind my apology. Okay, I actually rescind my apology. We should be able to have challenging

02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:42.640
conversations about things, but you gotta man, be well read on both sides, not this like, I do

02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:45.920
my own research. So I don't believe anything that Fauci says, like, come on, dude, do you think

02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:50.320
you can do better than that? Not you personally, but gotcha. How does that feel?

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:58.880
So for people who don't know, that's the catchphrase. Gotcha. Through all tragedy and triumph,

02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:05.920
through all the roller coaster of life, your response to it is gotcha. It's election. Let me

02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:13.920
jump to that before I continue with political discourse. Psychologically, you are in a lot

02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:19.040
of heated debates. And you're usually super calm under fire until you're not. Sometimes you lose

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:24.160
your temper completely. Very rarely. But that's like your opinion, man. Let me ask you about

02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:27.760
your psychology. What are psychologically your strengths and weaknesses that you're

02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.480
self aware about? I think I'm very non judgmental. So I can entertain a lot of different thoughts

02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.320
without agreeing with them or condoning them. I think that's a really big benefit to me.

02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:43.520
For whatever reason, I seem to be like pretty calm and dealing with annoying people. It's why

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:47.120
I got promoted at the casino so fast, I could deal with like drunks or whatever, like it just didn't

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:53.120
affect me that much. What percent of the population is annoying? Depends on how you're engaging with

02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:56.080
them. Most people aren't really annoying ever. That's why I mean that. But if you're doing like

02:37:56.080 --> 02:38:00.400
political debate, what percentage is annoying? I guess it depends on who I'm debating and what

02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:05.200
the topic is. I guess I'm trying to point out the fact that sometimes you can say

02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:10.000
that reveals something about you if you think a large percent of people are annoying.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:13.760
Well, I would say working graveyard shift when alcohol is involved, that percentage of people

02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:18.400
goes very, very, very high. Or to be more fair, actually, it's not a high percentage truly.

02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:22.880
But if you're a server, one bad customer can ruin the rest of your shift. So you only need like

02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:27.200
one or two people acting in that manner to just like totally throw you off. And you're able to,

02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:32.720
at least these days, not allow that one customer to throw you off, quote unquote.

02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.920
Yeah, very much like a, I noticed this especially after having a son, there's something about like

02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:41.120
six year old kids or whatever, where it's like, if they get mad, they're never going to be mad

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:44.640
for that long. Like they'll move on. Like that's my mentality. I'm like a six year old kid. Like

02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:46.800
I might be mad about something, but I'll get over it in like 30 minutes or an hour.

02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:51.600
I'm pretty good about not carrying that through. It's very rare that I'll like hold a grudge

02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:56.240
against anybody or like be angry about something or really disaffected by something over the

02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:00.400
long term that almost never happens to me. What are your weaknesses psychologically,

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.120
would you say? I still have a problem with projecting. I think we all probably do,

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:08.480
but like my mind onto others, it's like, if I understand this and I've said this,

02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:12.400
you should understand it. And if you're not, you're dumb. That's like an issue that I,

02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:16.640
I still have that where I project too much. What about like holding grudges and stuff like that?

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:20.160
I'd never hold grudges. I'm like the least grudgy person ever. It's kind of a meme in my

02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:24.000
community because anybody can always like come back as long as they're acting different. Yeah.

02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:27.120
What about the, as long as they're acting different?

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.880
As long as they're acting different. I mean, all right.

02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:32.880
The reason why I say that is because so friends, nobody likes this, but I have a strong stance

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.560
on apologies and then I hate them. I don't ever want to hear an apology. I don't care about them

02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:40.400
ever. They don't mean anything to me. If you did something bad, as long as you've like fixed the

02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:43.120
behavior and you're not doing that thing, then we're generally chill. It's like there's been a

02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.920
lot of people that have been involved in weird stuff with me, but then like they, they go off,

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:48.800
they do the thing and they come back and it's like, okay, cool. As long as you don't do it again,

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:55.280
like we're fine. Like it's all good. I'm sorry. You feel that way. It's not your fault, Steven.

02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:00.720
It's not your fault. Okay. Gotcha. You said plenty of negative stuff, positive stuff and

02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:06.160
negative stuff about Hassan. Yeah. This is my podcast. I get to get you to force you to say

02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:11.440
positive things. What do you love? I'm all about love. Let's go back to grilling me on the R word

02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:14.800
stuff. You're going to make me compliment Hassan. This is going to be a harder conversation than

02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:22.480
that. All right. We're going to get you to feel emotions. Okay. For people who don't know,

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:28.800
he's another popular political streamer. I think you had, as the kids call it, a bridge burning

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:34.720
over Bernie Sanders. I don't know. My research is very limited on this, but what do you respect

02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:40.400
and love most about Hassan? He puts in a lot of work when he was like growing his stream from

02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:44.720
2,000 concrete viewers to 15,000. He was streaming like, it was like 12 hours a day,

02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:50.240
like every single day. So that was, I remember I did a lot of work. He does seem to be pretty good

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:54.160
at networking and socializing and making the correct friends and connections to continue

02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:57.680
to build his business. What about him as a political thinker? I know you don't think

02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:04.640
I leave him in that regard, but I think that's unfair. I honestly want to push back on that because

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:10.240
I have zero respect for him as a political thinker. There's not going to be almost anything.

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:17.040
So I will say, I admire the fact that through no actual capability or ability of his own,

02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:20.240
he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers just because he's towing the line.

02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:24.400
Good job for him on that. He's got a lot of correct opinions, just he has no idea why.

02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:28.640
I think that's undeserved. I think that's too harsh, man. The reason I bring that up,

02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:35.200
because I feel like there is a deep grudge in there somehow. So you're the father now,

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:41.120
so since you're so old, the grandfather of the political debate on stream,

02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:46.240
on live stream political debater. So there could be some grudge about that

02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:52.400
split that happened or not enough credit given all that kind of stuff. I just think he's somebody

02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:58.320
that has a left-leaning ideology that's different than yours. He was a Bernie supporter,

02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:02.880
and I guess you were not. Can you explain to me where the division is?

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:08.960
He exemplifies everything that I absolutely hate about politics, which is shallow engagement,

02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:13.440
heavily ideologically driven, and you're not ideologically different.

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:18.320
Absolutely not. That's what we're talking about, like the free thinker in the real

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:25.120
meaning of that word. Let me qualify what I mean when I say that. I spent a lot of time,

02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:28.880
unfortunate time, delving into the boring world of philosophy. I spent a lot of time

02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:34.720
thinking about what are my ethical positions? How do I feel about myself, the people around me,

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:37.920
and how that relates to the world around me? And then from all of these positions,

02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:41.840
I think you might have used the phrase first principles earlier. From these kind of first

02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:47.360
principles, out of that is where all of my political positions are built out of, like full stop. So

02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:51.200
if you ask me a question, how do you feel about the right to own a firearm, or how do you feel

02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:55.520
about social health care? We can walk through, well, this is how I feel about it is like a

02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:59.520
thing from the government. This is where the government gets its power. This is ethically how

02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:03.040
groups of people are supposed to function. This is morally how we relate to each other. And

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:06.320
personally, this is how I feel. I'll be able to do every single political belief back there.

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:11.200
It's not like I'm telling you, if I were to ask Hassan, what do you feel about this political

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.320
topic, he's going to tell me what progressives are supposed to say. I don't know what he thinks

02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:17.440
about it. I don't know if he thinks so. Don't you think that's a cynical take? Why is he,

02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:22.720
just because his views coincide with the mainstream narrative, mainstream viewpoints

02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:28.400
of progressive thinkers? I mean, why does that mean he's not thinking? Because his engagement with

02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:34.160
every subject is incredibly shallow, 100% predictable. Like I could write like a, I could

02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:37.840
probably program a script to like give you every single potential answer you could have to any

02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.760
single question you could give him. Again, I think that's pretty cynical take. Okay, it could be the

02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:45.440
case that his brain perfectly aligns with every single mainstream. But I don't know if you know

02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.080
it is perfectly aligns, because I think you're just taking a very select, just extremers do of

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:56.960
each other, a very select slice that represents the perfect alignment, as opposed to looking at a

02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:01.600
person struggling with ideas and thinking through ideas, and then giving him a pass like a lot of

02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:08.000
people, like I give you a pass on just the fact that you say a lot of crazy shit on streamed for

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:13.600
drama, like, which is why I don't say things for drama. That might be dramatic, but I mean,

02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:20.480
you've evolved as a fish evolves legs, you've evolved a mechanism which creates controversy.

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:26.080
Sure. You could say it's not intention, but it happens. I think the extremists kind of learn

02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:31.680
that kind of thing. And so I'm sure Hassan does the same kind of stuff. And so like underneath it,

02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:36.800
there's still thinking being that's contending with political ideas. You don't think so.

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:40.640
He does a really good job at hiding it. There are other political figures that I really don't

02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:43.520
like that I wouldn't say the same thing about. So like, I don't know if you have Vosch written in

02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:48.560
there. Like, okay, that's a person that he also split out of my community and grew up to something

02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:51.760
and now he hates me and he's an anti fan community and they all have him. Okay, tell me something

02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:55.680
you love about Vosch. I can tell you a lot of things about Vosch. I think Vosch legitimately

02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:00.800
thinks through a lot of his political positions. I admire or did admire that he has like his own

02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:04.800
like positions that we take sometimes contrary to people further left than him. He's got some

02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:08.560
positions that don't fit his ideology kind of at all, like he's his own independent thinker.

02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:13.040
Rhetorically, he's very effective. He was willing to sit down and do research for like his debates

02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:17.120
and everything. He would spend a lot of time practicing like his rhetorical effectiveness

02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.360
and navigating conversations. He intentionally and purposefully built like a community that

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:26.800
exemplified his values. Yeah, I've got a lot. I don't, we are completely split and hate each other

02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:31.440
now, but like I have a lot. Why? Why? Why? First of all, hate is a strong, why the hate?

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.120
Okay, I don't hate him, but he hates me because we had a couple of really big debates.

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:38.880
What happened? Well, one had to do with whether or not you should live your values.

02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:42.640
And can you give me the story that's a charitable interpretation? I always

02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.160
give charitable interpretation. You don't. I absolutely do. You don't. Wait,

02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:49.440
name one time it happened. Five minutes ago, you talking about Hassan.

02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:52.800
Everything I said about Hassan is true. There is no steel man there. Okay. That's not charitable.

02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.760
That's, I'm sorry. If you can, if you can prove me wrong, I would love for you to do it. Okay.

02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:04.080
I'm using my gut instinct. Usually when somebody feels strongly about another person in that way,

02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:09.040
it's not coming from a place of data and reason. It's coming from a place of emotion.

02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:13.040
It's coming from a place of resentment and grudge and all that kind of stuff.

02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.800
Yeah, I understand. There's deep, there's emotions deep in there. So the gacha is hiding,

02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:23.680
the gacha is a surface of an iceberg and there's a deep ocean underneath that you yourself have

02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:25.840
not explored. I disagree, but I understand why-

02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:31.680
And Lav is actually a doorway. The young Lav is a doorway for you to explore the depths of-

02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:34.240
Get into that ocean to find my fish, my pre-vol form.

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:39.040
I understand why you think the way you do and you should, you shouldn't believe me and I understand

02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:42.000
that because if somebody told me the same thing, I think you probably just really don't like this

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:45.920
person for a reason or two. I understand what you think that way. Okay. The reality is though,

02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:49.440
for any political person that I disagree with, like I can give them a fair shake. It's one of the

02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:53.520
few things I think I do exceedingly well on my stream. Even with Hassan, there's been drama that

02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:57.680
he's been involved in and I've like very, when I'm involved in drama, he'll always throw me out of

02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:00.480
the bus, but when he's involved in stuff, I'll always say like, oh, like I think Hassan was

02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:05.600
right here or I think that he meant this. There was a thing that came up once we're on

02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:09.600
live stream fail. He was getting roasted because he referred to somebody, he used the expression

02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:15.760
shit skin to refer to somebody's like the way they looked. And I have only ever heard that in

02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.400
the context of 4chan people talking about like Indians or like black people. Like it's a racial

02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:25.760
thing, but I could tell the context and everything that he was saying. He was insulting some guy.

02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:28.800
I think it was kind of like incel virgin or whatever. He was going for like acne skin.

02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:31.280
I think that's what he meant when he said it. And there were a whole bunch of people that were

02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.920
insulting like, oh my God, did he just say racist term? And I was like, no, I don't think he was

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:37.760
racist. I think he was like, he was just reaching for words. And that's what came out. So like that's

02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:43.040
an example of me being charitable. Okay, but didn't you criticize him for something? I was trying to,

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:46.720
I like Googled why the hell you guys split out because I thought you're friends or you should be

02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:50.320
like, it's a little bit more common Harris video, but go ahead. Is that why is that the

02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:56.960
I feel like you criticize them over something. And I'm okay, this is very vague memory, but

02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:00.800
you criticize them over something. And I felt that criticism wasn't charitable.

02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:03.920
Was it Pete Buttigieg stuff? Yeah, Pete Buttigieg. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:08.240
Yeah. So I've said this a million times, but there's no amount of context or no amount of nuances

02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:12.720
is ever accessible to people. I don't think Hassan is homophobic, but I think the comments

02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:17.680
made about Pete Buttigieg were really homophobic. That's what he said. Yeah. And there were a lot

02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:23.200
of people making a lot of comments that made me really uncomfortable about Pete Buttigieg.

02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:26.960
That was insane to me. Spurred by the comments of Hassan?

02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:32.400
No, but it was an environment of progressives. All the progressives were attacking Pete,

02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:38.240
and I felt like his gayness became like the subject. Yeah, but why, why throw Hassan under

02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.560
the bus for that? He was jumping along with all of those types of like insults. You don't think

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:46.080
you've done the same kind of stuff? If I do, call me on it and I'll probably say I shouldn't have.

02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:49.120
That's what the R word was about. That's a good call out.

02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:52.880
But like your friend, like you should privately tell him, right? Well, no,

02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:57.200
by then we were sworn enemies. So that wasn't the reason. No, no, no. It was over a Kamala Harris

02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:02.000
video. Sworn enemies. He hates me. What am I supposed to, listen, for all of these people,

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.880
I will accept them back into my life if they ever want to come back in at any point in time,

02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:07.840
but usually they're the ones that would say. If they correct themselves, right?

02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.640
No, I'm not expecting anybody to. So here's the deal with Vosh and Hassan. These are like the three,

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:16.880
we're the three guys on line. None of us will talk to each other. Hassan, because he won't give

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:21.440
clout to anybody and Vosh because he thinks I'm bad faith. And then neither of them will talk to me

02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.760
because they both hate me. You guys should go on a camping trip together. It's like broke back

02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:31.520
modern, but three way and just like rejoin, refine, refine the vision for each other. Honestly,

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:37.760
just from the internet perspective for me as a, just stepping into this world. There's some aspect

02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:45.120
to which you have a responsibility. I hate that word. You have an opportunity. I wish you guys

02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:50.560
would kind of be the beacon of like forgiveness and friendship and like camaraderie and that kind

02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:53.760
of stuff. Yeah, I agree. And even if we disagree, it would be really good content for us to argue.

02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:59.840
Shit talk, like friends shit talk versus not, like the fact that you guys don't talk to each other.

02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:05.120
Like I would love for you to shit talk publicly with the camaraderie always there. Like there's

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:09.040
love in the beginning, love in the end, but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle.

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:13.200
And that's what live streaming is for, the political discourses. That's great political

02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:20.400
discourse versus I think what underlines some jealousy and so on. You get this many followers.

02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:25.280
I just want to make sure you're clear to your audience. Everybody has to your audience.

02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.640
I'm sure you have flaws and I'm just not in this dynamic. Hard to find, you know, because I'm,

02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:36.000
your only flaws, you're too modest. Yeah. So why did you guys split up? Because I would love it

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:41.920
honestly. Just let me just put that idea out there for you guys to make up. Yeah, it's out there,

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:45.840
of course, as everybody talks, me, Vash and Hasan, it's crazy that like the three largest like

02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:51.200
political debate left leading people online, like can't do any type of content or collaboration

02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:55.920
at all. It's so stupid. Yeah. What was the reason you guys split up? The Kamala Harris?

02:50:55.920 --> 02:51:01.760
So Hasan's entry into kind of like the Twitch political debate world was in, I think 2018,

02:51:01.760 --> 02:51:06.320
I think he did a debate with Charlie Kirk and he reached out to me to kind of like review that

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:10.720
debate to like go on, to go over it on stream. And he came on, we went over it and then we kind

02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:14.080
of friendship developed. We hung out in real life. I think when I came to LA, I think I saw

02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:20.000
it on his couch, we played with his dog, we were like kind of friends. And as time went on, and

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:26.240
then he was a little bit more, he was farther left than he led on. So like I was a social Democrat,

02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:30.400
he was a social Democrat. But back in those days, like 2018, when people said they were a social

02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:33.360
Democrat, they really met socialists, but they just didn't want to say it. So he was farther

02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:39.200
left than me. And we had a lot of deep divides in our approach to politics. Whereas like I was

02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:43.440
very much like a first principles, this is my whole political position. And he was very much kind

02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:46.880
of like a, this is like the political ideology I'm involved in. And this is kind of like the

02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:51.440
field that I kind of like navigate in. So there were a couple instances where these divides would

02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:57.360
be laid very bare. One was when it was either him or the young Turks, I think it was him.

02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:02.720
There was a shooting in a neighborhood where a very young black child gets killed by a white

02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:07.600
shooter. And they did a video about like hate crimes and how hate crimes are on the rise

02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:11.040
between races and white people are evil and blah, blah, blah. Not that, but like white people,

02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:14.240
community hate crimes against black people. And I remember saying to him, I was like,

02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:20.000
hey, we don't have all the data yet for this. It feels really bad to make videos about this

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:24.400
beforehand, because it's the same type of shit that happens at airports. Is there a thing going

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:28.480
on? Was it a brown person? Are they Muslim? It's Islamic extremism. We see this played out so many

02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:32.480
times in recent history, probably not a good idea to jump to conclusions. And he's like, well,

02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:36.240
no, you don't understand, like it's not that big a deal, whatever. And obviously, as the story goes,

02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:40.720
tale as old as time, the data comes out, it was just an errant shot. There was like gang violence,

02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:43.680
shot goes out of nowhere, hits a kid in the car. It wasn't like a hate crime. The guy was trying to

02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:48.320
kill a kid. But yeah, we basically, we bump up against a few kind of political disagreements like

02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:52.960
this. And an annoying thing is happening in my community where Hassan is like the serious political

02:52:52.960 --> 02:52:56.320
figure because he's from the young Turks. And I'm just kind of like, I do politics, but I also

02:52:56.320 --> 02:53:00.400
game. And anytime I criticize Hassan, people like destiny, you need to be more respectful. He does

02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:03.920
this full time. If you're going to bring criticisms, you need to be like really well read and researched

02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:06.880
because he's got a, you know, more serious, whatever, which I thought was ridiculous.

02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:11.120
So by the way, if people don't know, he worked at the young Turks, which is

02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:14.240
like the largest left-leaning YouTube channel probably, or at least at the time. Yeah.

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:20.480
So finally, he did a video on, we skip ahead to some more minor disagreements. He does a video on

02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:24.640
Kamala Harris. It's called the Kamala Harris. And it's like seven or eight horrible things about

02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:28.400
Kamala Harris. And I'm like, okay, I know at least one or two of these things are not fully accurate.

02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:31.920
So I'm going to do all the research. I'm going to have all the sources and we're going to have a

02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:35.600
long conversation about it so that now when I provide criticism to him, it's not going to be

02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:39.680
like this horrible, like just me saying something flippantly or whatever, it's going to be like

02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:47.120
substantial criticism. So I was on a plane ride, JFK to Orlando, whatever, flying to Sweden to visit

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:52.240
my wife. And on the plane, I review all of the video, all the data, do all the research and I

02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:59.440
write everything. I'm just like, okay, I get to my, my wife's dad's house and I'm at the table,

02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:03.840
we're having a conversation like, hey, we should talk about the Kamala Harris stuff. And he's like,

02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:09.920
okay, well, let's do it. And we go over it and I'll leave to the audience to watch the video.

02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:13.200
Enough people have said this. I feel pretty common to say this. I was pretty reasonable,

02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:17.040
pretty measured, pretty calm the whole time. And I think he started to get increasingly irritated

02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:21.440
that I was levying like more and more serious criticisms at like the quality of work that he

02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:26.080
did. Probably because he felt a little bit intimidated, I think by my willingness to like

02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:29.600
dive through political stuff, there'd been a couple of awkward blobs where like on,

02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:34.400
there was like a show called the Raj Royale, where sometimes politics would come up and

02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:37.440
Hassan would kind of try to explain something. And there was another person one time on the

02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:40.240
show that made the joke was like, instead of Hassan taking 10 minutes to explain this

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:44.160
condesity, just come here and explain it in 30 seconds. And he like exploded that he got so

02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:48.640
fucking mad at that. So yeah, I think that when I made that kind of call out or critique of him

02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:52.240
over the Kamala Harris stuff, he's probably feeling like increasingly irritated, threatened,

02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:55.920
agitated. And then that's kind of what began the huge split from ours.

02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:59.200
So you don't think you were a dick at all? I don't think so in that conversation,

02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:05.920
especially given that like, at that point, because this is still 2018 or 20, this might be 2019,

02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:10.960
I'm still known at that point as being very aggressive towards conservatives or all writers.

02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:15.680
Yeah. So and with lefties is what I call them. I think I'm being like very gentle,

02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:19.440
like my conversation with conservatives is like, you're so dumb. Like that's how I'm

02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:22.720
like doing it. So like with him, I'm like, well, don't you think that like this is like a little

02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:26.640
bit of like an inconsistent presentation of how like I feel gonna be nice. But I always leave

02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:30.720
to the audience so they can go and watch that Kamala Harris video, Destiny Hassan, if they

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:33.680
think that I was being a dick or not. But a lot of people watch and said I was being pretty gentle.

02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:40.320
Well, let me say as a new fan of this space, I hope you guys make up and I hope you guys fight it

02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:45.280
out in the space of discourse and ideas. Me too. And also with empathy, understanding what the

02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:50.320
strength of the other person is, what their buttons are. And, you know, there's like an

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.600
unspoken rule that you don't press the buttons that you don't need to, unless you're doing it

02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:00.160
mutually and it's fun because, you know, it's fun to piece each other off. So that's kind of

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:04.720
like what friends do. You don't cross a certain line. But then other than that, you fight it out.

02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:11.440
Okay, let's step back. One other super interesting aspect of your worldview is your big supporter

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:17.280
of Biden. Can you explain what you love about Biden? Do you love Biden more than Sean Carroll

02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:23.760
or less? Sean Carroll is just like in another world of admiration. I feel like I'm culturally

02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:29.280
appropriating you by saying gotcha now. But it's so convenient. It's an easy word. You just, I know

02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:33.200
we're on the same wavelength. Okay, we're synchronizing. That's good. I mean, it is really

02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:37.840
interesting because even people that support Biden usually don't say they love sort of,

02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:42.160
they don't support it strongly, you know? Ideologically, philosophically, the reason

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:46.560
why I like Biden is because he's really committed to this bringing the left and right together,

02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:51.280
which is something we so desperately need in the country. And his, you know, statements over and over

02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:55.440
again of like, I'm not the Democrat president or the Republican president. I'm the president of

02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:00.480
the United States. His desire to bring Republicans together to work on things like the infrastructure

02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:06.400
bill, that's so incredibly needed. And I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for him

02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:10.960
for trying to push through on that message. Do you think then it's unfortunate that he made

02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:15.040
that comment about MAGA? MAGA Republicans? Yeah. I mean, I figured what the comment was,

02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:20.720
but it's MAGA Republicans are not good people kind of there. I watched the full video and

02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:25.280
he's right. There is this toxic aspect. And it's hard to call out because they're always going to

02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.560
spend like, oh, he hits our Republicans. He's not. If you watch the quote, he's very specifically

02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:33.040
calling out like this group of people that think that the election was fraudulent.

02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:36.240
Is it clear? That's what he meant by... We can bring it up.

02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:40.320
All right. This is... Oh, no. Uh-oh. Did I remember watching it on stream? It was like,

02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:43.760
if you said it, yeah, that's bad. You can probably like YouTube MAGA Republicans Biden.

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:46.480
But like, it feels like it's pretty clear he's talking about the people that are like election

02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:54.960
denying. Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA

02:57:54.960 --> 02:58:01.920
Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.

02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:10.080
Now I want to be very clear, very clear up front. Not every Republican,

02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:15.760
not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces

02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:22.320
their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.

02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:29.360
But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated

02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:35.680
by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.

02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:42.480
I disagree with that, man. He didn't clearly say extremist ideology. He didn't say the

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:46.480
people that doubt the validity of the election. I mean, that's Donald Trump.

02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:50.720
No, but there's... That's all the candidates that Donald Trump is supporting. How many,

02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:54.880
what is it like, 40, 50, how many candidates right now that are MAGA candidates are election

02:58:54.960 --> 02:58:59.440
Democrats? No, but there's 80 million or whatever people voted for Donald Trump.

02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:06.480
You could say that's the MAGA Republicans. So to me, it sounded like he was referring to

02:59:07.360 --> 02:59:13.440
not even the majority. I mean, that's one nice helpful clarifying statement. But basically,

02:59:13.440 --> 02:59:17.280
there's the mainstream Republicans and then there's those that voted for Donald Trump.

02:59:17.280 --> 02:59:18.960
That's the way I heard it. Okay.

02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:21.520
And so maybe you should have done a better job at clarifying, but...

02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:27.120
Yeah, I feel like there's a clear, there is a huge problem with this group of Americans.

02:59:27.120 --> 02:59:29.280
I think the election is stolen. I feel like that's what he's trying to call.

02:59:29.280 --> 02:59:37.680
No matter if that's what he meant, even flirting with that line is not a person who's bringing

02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:43.040
people together. I feel like the extending a hand to the most... I've worked with Republicans in

02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:48.560
Congress, not even a majority of Republicans are like this. No, but why say not the majority of

02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:56.320
Republicans that like to say, we're one country. We believe the same thing. So focus on the uniting

02:59:56.320 --> 02:59:58.960
part versus saying... Maybe he does before and after. That was 50 seconds, okay.

03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:05.440
The point is you never say something like that. Listen, you've spoken about the Bosnian speech,

03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:09.200
which is your favorite of his. I went back to it and listened to it.

03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:13.360
Before I move to that, just on this, it's really hard for him to call out that group of election

03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:16.000
deniers, I think, without it always feeling like... Well, why call them out?

03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:20.240
Because it's arguably one of the most destructive forces that exist in this country today.

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:24.240
Did it destroy anything? They were trying to.

03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:27.120
Did it though? It didn't, did it?

03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:29.600
So does that mean we don't call it out? We wait till next time?

03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:36.880
Because calling it out is giving fuel to the division. The people that doubted the validity

03:00:36.880 --> 03:00:42.800
of the election, that's anger, that's frustration with the other side. You heal that as opposed to

03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:49.040
saying all those people that believed that at any time are idiots. They're un-American.

03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:51.840
I mean, they don't think the election was real. I don't know if Biden has the

03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:54.080
ears of these people at all. I don't know what he can do for...

03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:59.440
There's people that believe the same thing in 2016 with the Russian hacking, right?

03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:01.600
There's this... Hold on. Yes.

03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:08.880
That is a super not fair comparison. There were definitely the mainstream Democrat opinion

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:15.360
was that Russian intrusion in terms of social media and stuff happened, but there was never

03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:19.760
a claim that the election was stolen. Or at least I don't know of any mainstream Democrat

03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:23.040
that supported that. Donald Trump is not just saying there was interference and blah, blah,

03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:28.160
blah, blah. Donald Trump is literally saying the election was literally stolen, that ballot boxes

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:32.640
were hidden, that vote tallies were manipulated. I think the claim is there's a huge gulf of

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.320
difference in the two. You can attack Donald Trump for that.

03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:43.600
I believe it's not the words of a uniter to attack people that believe that.

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:49.840
You could argue maybe it's okay, but especially not being super clear about that,

03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:55.840
about who you're referring to when you say MAGA Republicans, because MAGA is a hat

03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:04.960
and a slogan that refers to whatever the number is, 70 million people who voted for Donald Trump.

03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:09.360
Of all the Republicans that consider themselves MAGA Republicans, what percentage of them do

03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:15.120
you think believe the election was stolen? I feel like that number is probably more than 70%.

03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:19.600
What's a MAGA Republican? Maybe I'm not familiar...

03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:22.240
Like a Trump supporting Republican, a MAGA Republican. They're there for Trump.

03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:27.760
What's the difference between somebody that voted for Trump and a MAGA Republican?

03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:33.680
My mom is a MAGA Republican. If Trump ran independently and DeSantis ran under the

03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:37.600
Republican ticket, my mom would vote for Trump. She'll follow him to the end of the earth. That's

03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:42.720
like a MAGA Republican. I think it's easy to mistake that distinction in these kinds of

03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:49.120
political speeches. As to me, anybody who voted for Trump can easily in the context of the speech

03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:56.240
be interpreted as a MAGA Republican. I understand what you're saying. Maybe you

03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:00.560
could have been more clear, but I think in listening to that, I think it's pretty obvious who

03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:03.680
he's talking about, but I guess if you have an emotional response to it, I can understand

03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:09.360
the emotional response. I don't have an emotional response. I just don't like... I think I'm with

03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:16.800
what is it? Michelle Obama, they go low, we go high. Meaning like, to me, a uniter doesn't

03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:21.120
participate in derision. Sure, a uniter might not, but a leader has to be able to accurately

03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:24.960
assess the situation before him and make people aware of what's going on. You mean all the

03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:30.240
impeachment trials, all the censoring from social media, all of that didn't do the job?

03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:35.200
That's not his job. I don't know about censoring. That mechanism, his job is to inspire a nation

03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:39.120
to unite a nation. How can he do that when half the people don't believe that he was even legitimately

03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:43.200
elected? I think he's done a good job at working on legislation and doing stuff that hopefully

03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:47.040
benefits all Americans, but I think it's important to recognize that there is a contingent of

03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:50.880
Americans that don't even believe that this is really crazy. There are plenty of people that

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:55.120
recognize that and are fighting that and are constantly screaming that from the rooftops.

03:03:55.120 --> 03:04:02.800
His job is to be the inspiring figure that makes the majority of Americans be proud for him to

03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:10.960
be a president of the nation they love. That's what the uniting aspect is. You remind people

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:14.800
that we are one and we love this country. We love the ideas that it represents.

03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:17.360
He does that in other parts of that speech. It's like a 20-minute speech, isn't it?

03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:24.640
But that's a fuck-up. You just don't participate in that division. Anyway, I understand. I just

03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:31.920
wanted to push back on the saying one of his strengths is that he's uniting. But yes, that

03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:40.000
is an ideal. That is a goal, is a great one, and he is one that espoused that goal for a long time.

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:44.400
Do you think, what else? From policy perspective and so on.

03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:47.360
I thought the way he's handled Ukraine and everything thus far has been almost perfect.

03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:51.440
I think he did a really good job at the political maneuvering and bringing other

03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:55.360
countries into the fold at establishing clearly what our mission was in relation to Ukraine.

03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:59.360
I thought he did a good job there. I admire him for pulling out of Afghanistan. Even it was a

03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:03.120
little bit rough around the edges. We got out and we're gone. No American lives are lost.

03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:09.360
The domestic policy, he's passed more major legislation than I think anybody thought possible.

03:05:10.080 --> 03:05:14.480
The green energy stuff with the last bill, the infrastructure bill, a lot of the coronavirus

03:05:14.480 --> 03:05:17.200
relief I thought was really good, especially the expansion of the child tax credit.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:21.520
So from a policy perspective, foreign and domestic, I think he's been successful.

03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:25.200
Rhetorically, I think he's generally been above board in terms of not attacking people,

03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:28.720
being too divisive. He's trying to bring people together and work on them.

03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:34.160
What do you think about the popular in the media criticism of his mental decline?

03:05:34.160 --> 03:05:36.080
Do you think he's experiencing mental decline? He's an old guy.

03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:42.000
But do you think, I mean, yeah, maybe a little bit, but he's still doing a good job.

03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:45.600
Not from a speech perspective, you mean from a policy perspective?

03:05:45.600 --> 03:05:49.280
Yeah, I'm analyzing it as a job. Yeah, from a speech perspective, maybe not the greatest,

03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:52.320
but yeah, I mean, he's definitely, what is he, like 80, 81? How old is he?

03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:59.440
I lose track after so many years. But you did say that he's probably going to run in 2024

03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:03.040
and he's probably going to win. Did I say that? That he's probably going to win? No way did I

03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:07.600
say that? He's probably going to run. Who knows who will win? But I think,

03:06:07.600 --> 03:06:10.320
I feel like the incumbent advantage is so strong. You're really going to throw that away.

03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:13.280
Like, I think it's been like one or two times in history in the US, right, where like,

03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:15.520
the non-incumbent, the parties put somebody else up.

03:06:16.160 --> 03:06:22.320
Yeah, I mean, the concern is like the, just the age and the mental decline, just the

03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:28.000
wear and tear of the campaign, all of that kind of stuff, all the speech you have to make,

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.400
the debates and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I guess we'll see what happens.

03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:37.600
What? The least excited, I mean, two years from now is a long time. And his current mental state,

03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:42.400
yeah, he could run and do it. He could do a passable job in two years. Man, I don't know.

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:46.240
I've seen videos of Bill Clinton recently, he's looking pretty rough. You know,

03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:50.480
if Biden is looking a lot more rough, worse for wearing two years, then maybe they actually

03:06:50.480 --> 03:06:54.320
do have to dig out another person for running. Who knows?

03:06:54.320 --> 03:07:04.400
What do you think about Trump when he won in 2016, I think is when you came to fruition,

03:07:04.400 --> 03:07:10.080
politically speaking. So what do you think his winning the 2016 election represents?

03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:17.840
So for me, Trump, the reason why I got into politics was Trump was like this new

03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:25.440
epistemic force in American politics that you'd kind of have to flirt with facts before,

03:07:25.440 --> 03:07:30.480
even if you wanted to be nonfactual. He super didn't care. Lying was like a first language to him,

03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:35.920
just like in speaking in terms of the way that he used language to just say to you what he felt

03:07:35.920 --> 03:07:40.560
like you needed to hear, to support him and not care at all about what is going on about,

03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:46.400
yeah, that's what Trump represented to me in terms of things that I cared about. He also

03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:50.080
represents a lot more, obviously, that there was this undercurrent of American opinion that a lot

03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:54.640
of people didn't know still existed, and it did, he got elected, that the Overton window was

03:07:54.640 --> 03:07:58.800
misidentified by even a large amount of the Republican Party, that populism was a lot more

03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:02.880
popular than a lot of people figured, you know, yeah, there's a lot that I guess he represented.

03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:07.600
Do you think Trump should have been banned from Twitter? Can you make the case foreign against

03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:12.880
it? So you're a big supporter of free speech. Yeah, so the case in favor of-

03:08:12.880 --> 03:08:16.720
Do you think he should be brought back as Elon-

03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:19.040
Yeah, because if he gets brought back, there's a higher chance that I'll be brought back,

03:08:19.040 --> 03:08:22.400
so I'm supporting that all the way. Thank you, Elon. Unban my account.

03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:28.080
So because you called me weak spine, I'm gonna have to message Elon.

03:08:28.080 --> 03:08:30.800
Okay, at Omni Destiny, it was a verified Twitter account.

03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:32.640
Omni Destiny. No, no, I'm just kidding.

03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:34.480
Why'd you get banned from Twitter, Destiny?

03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:35.120
I don't know.

03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:40.000
I'll add that to Elon. I saw that there was a screenshot of you

03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:43.760
referring to the rape of somebody.

03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:46.480
Okay, that was on an older Twitter account, and that was a bad tweet.

03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:52.240
You have multiple Twitter accounts, so you're trying to go around the bands that you keep getting.

03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:55.360
Okay, hold on. You're slandering me a lot right now, okay?

03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:58.880
Let's get the facts straight, okay? And I don't even remember why my first time I got banned,

03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:02.240
but it was a wild account. I tweeted some wildly inappropriate things.

03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:03.120
You regret?

03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:04.720
I don't like that word. I'm gonna give the answer to most people.

03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:06.640
They're just like, I don't regret it because I learned a lot,

03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:08.160
so I'm glad I had the bad experiences that I did.

03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:09.440
Why don't you like the word regret?

03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:14.720
I think if we look at where we are, how do you feel about determinism?

03:09:17.920 --> 03:09:20.880
I believe in hard, the hardest of determinism. That's who I am.

03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:25.360
Okay, so who I am today is the culmination of everything that's occurred in the past.

03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:35.280
I believe you, speaking about regret is a nice way to communicate that in this deterministic

03:09:35.280 --> 03:09:39.680
world, you've analyzed the acts of the past, and you're no longer that person.

03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:40.800
Yeah, of course, for sure.

03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:43.040
That's what regret usually means.

03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:45.200
Okay, thanks for giving me the human explanation. Okay, true.

03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:47.840
So in that sense, there's a lot of things I've done that I regret.

03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:50.080
Oh, you're, what are you? You're not human, you're a bot.

03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:52.320
NPC is my preferred term.

03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:52.960
Okay, all right.

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:58.480
I wish I would have been smart enough at the time to not have to have had made those mistakes.

03:09:58.480 --> 03:09:58.880
Okay.

03:09:58.880 --> 03:09:59.600
There you go.

03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:00.640
Good job.

03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:03.520
But yeah, obviously really dumb, really crazy off the wall tweets,

03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:08.640
but that account got banned, but then I made another account called,

03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:09.920
I can't believe I'm giving you a history-made Twitter account.

03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:11.440
So I made another account called OmniDestiny.

03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:12.400
It's an honor.

03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:16.080
And that was my, I got verified, I was cool, they let me have that account

03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:17.920
because originally they banned it and I said appeal and I was like,

03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:18.880
oh, let me have one more.

03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:21.440
And the back then Twitter was cool and they're like, okay, go for it.

03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:22.960
And that account lasts for a long time.

03:10:22.960 --> 03:10:27.280
And I don't actually know 100% why that account got banned.

03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:33.280
I believe that the tweet that showed up in the final, I got banned for hate speech.

03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:36.320
And it was because I was, there was a picture that I tweeted

03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:39.360
with three different alt writers that are kind of like neo-Nazi people.

03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:41.840
And they were all like mixed race people.

03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:44.960
And I said, like the new alt right looks like a Disney channel original movie

03:10:44.960 --> 03:10:46.480
in terms of racial composition.

03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:51.280
And somehow they got flagged for instigating violence against minorities, I think.

03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:53.120
And I think that's the tweet that got me banned

03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:54.720
because I think that's what showed up in the final report.

03:10:54.720 --> 03:10:56.320
But I don't know, maybe there were other reasons

03:10:56.320 --> 03:10:59.280
because nobody ever communicates, but ever since that account went under,

03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:00.720
it's just been ban evading ever since.

03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:00.960
So.

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
Oh, ban evading ever since.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:05.520
So all my new accounts that have been banned just get banned

03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:07.360
because they finally figured out it's me and then they ban evade.

03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:12.080
There's like one dude at Twitter HQ who's like constantly looking for my new accounts

03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:12.640
and they get me.

03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:13.120
Yeah.

03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:13.360
Yeah.

03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:14.800
Anyway, yeah.

03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:18.080
So post Trump world.

03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:20.480
Do you think, okay, I mean this.

03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:21.280
Oh, should he be banned?

03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:22.720
Oh, you asked me to make both cases.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:25.120
Should he be banned?

03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:26.800
I mean, damn, dude, when you're tweeting out shit

03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:30.640
that's arguably leading stuff like January 6th, I can understand why.

03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:32.640
Because it's like, what else is this wild dude going to tweet out?

03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:34.640
Like, is he going to start instigating other violent events?

03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:36.000
So I'm sympathetic towards the like, okay.

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.240
Well, he can't just be here saying stuff like this.

03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:38.960
That's insane.

03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:40.000
We're going to ban him.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:40.560
I'm sympathetic.

03:11:40.560 --> 03:11:41.840
Because it's instigating.

03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:42.800
Yeah, you're instigating.

03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:45.440
Physical violence in the physical world.

03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:45.600
Yeah.

03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:48.000
Like if I would tweet stuff like that, I would get banned probably.

03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:51.280
On the flip side, this is the president of the United States.

03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:55.040
It seems like he's like doing presidential decree by social media sometimes.

03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:58.640
Like is it really right that one public or private, I should say,

03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:03.520
one private company can like erase the president of the United States words from

03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:06.000
the eyes of a lot of Americans that are using these social media feeds.

03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:12.000
And one big one, which I for sure am against, is the permanent ban.

03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:13.440
Yeah, I don't like that.

03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:13.920
I hate that.

03:12:13.920 --> 03:12:17.440
Even in my community, if somebody comes back over like a year, like, I mean-

03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:19.840
Did you just compare yourself to the president of the United States?

03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:22.000
No, I compare myself to Twitter banning the president of the United States.

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:22.560
Let me put it this way.

03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:25.120
If I ban Donald Trump in my chat room, I don't ban him in a year.

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:26.720
A year?

03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:27.200
Yeah.

03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:29.680
What's the process for unbanning Donald Trump?

03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:30.880
What would he have to do?

03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:32.320
Usually people send me an email and they're like,

03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:33.360
listen, I did this stuff.

03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:34.400
I'm sorry, I was dumb.

03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:35.520
I'll give them another chance.

03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:37.920
But a year, what if they send an email a month later?

03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:39.600
Usually I'll unban him.

03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:40.320
That's usually my problem.

03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:42.160
I ban pretty quickly in my community, but if you ever ask-

03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:43.360
You're big, softy.

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:44.400
Yeah, I usually let him back.

03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:44.960
I'm very-

03:12:44.960 --> 03:12:47.920
Well, because I used to be the worst type of internet person,

03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:50.080
and I think I'm a little bit better than I used to be.

03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:50.320
So-

03:12:50.320 --> 03:12:51.280
Now that you're older.

03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:52.640
Yeah, now that I've matured.

03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:53.600
Yeah, of course.

03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:56.640
Age bestows a wisdom that just can't be gotten any other way.

03:12:56.640 --> 03:12:57.760
What's your sense in general?

03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:01.120
Is there something interesting you could say about your view on free speech?

03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:04.240
It seems like one of those terms, it's also overused

03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:05.600
to mean a lot of different things.

03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:06.800
What does it mean to you?

03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:09.920
If you have a democratic style of governance,

03:13:09.920 --> 03:13:13.440
you are entrusting people with one of the most awesome

03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:15.120
and radical of responsibilities.

03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:17.120
And that's saying that you're going to pick the people

03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:18.720
that are going to make some of the hardest decisions

03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:19.920
in all of human history.

03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:22.720
If you're going to trust people to vote correctly,

03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:23.920
you have to be able to trust them,

03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:25.760
have open and honest dialogue with each other.

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:28.800
Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,

03:13:29.520 --> 03:13:32.880
you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above

03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:34.320
and make the correct determinations

03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:36.080
when they hear these types of speeches.

03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:38.720
And if you're so worried that somebody's going to hear

03:13:38.720 --> 03:13:39.840
a certain political figure

03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.920
and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly,

03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:44.800
then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans

03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:46.720
for democracy to be a viable institution,

03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:47.680
which is fine.

03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:49.040
You can be anti-democratic,

03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:52.080
but I don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech.

03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:53.200
Within reason.

03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:55.360
So what's the within reason?

03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:55.600
So-

03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:57.920
I mean, you can't post like Child porn or something on Twitter

03:13:58.160 --> 03:13:59.360
where people try to get you on that stuff

03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:01.360
or like direct calls to violence or probably not.

03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:02.080
You shouldn't be tweeting out like,

03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:03.840
we're going to meet up tomorrow and go bomb, blah, blah, blah.

03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:04.160
Probably not.

03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:09.280
So do you think it's okay to allow racism and anti-Semitism and hate speech?

03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:14.640
Hate speech, yes, because that can be very broadly defined.

03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:20.160
I can understand there being some basic rules of like no slurs on like a platform

03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:22.480
that gets into like acceptable forms of moderation

03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:25.040
or like excessive harassment and bullying, I can understand.

03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:29.760
But past that, when the moderation becomes ideological,

03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:32.400
I get a little bit nervous because, you know, for,

03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:33.520
there's a whole other-

03:14:33.520 --> 03:14:36.000
Yeah, there's, of course, it's all a gray area,

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:40.240
but when it feels like ideology has seeped into the censorship.

03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:40.800
Not good.

03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:41.440
Yeah.

03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:43.760
Which it's so fascinating to think,

03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:45.520
especially now that Elon bought Twitter,

03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:52.080
how do you engineer a system that prevents ideology from seeping in

03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:57.280
and nevertheless is able to create a platform that has healthy conversations?

03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:00.400
Because if you have one guy who's just screaming nonsense, nonstop,

03:15:01.440 --> 03:15:05.760
it has this effect where the quiet voices at the back of the room are silenced.

03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:06.400
Yeah.

03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:08.880
So like that's what you usually don't talk about.

03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:12.080
Like if you let one annoying loud person in,

03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:14.240
that's actually censoring the voice of a lot of people

03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:16.240
that would like to speak, but they don't get a chance.

03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:18.800
That's one of the things, especially around like trans discourse,

03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:21.760
I have to constantly do that like reminder for my audiences.

03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:24.080
So like when I'm dealing with these types of people on the internet,

03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:25.360
a lot of them might seem really crazy.

03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:26.880
A lot of these types of people might seem insane,

03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:30.240
but like in the real world, outside of like the crazy Twitter activist world,

03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:33.440
like the vast majority of people you're meeting from LGBT communities

03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:35.120
are like the coolest, normalist people.

03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:37.520
All they want us to like write to live their life in the way they want to

03:15:37.520 --> 03:15:39.840
and to be like unobstructed and like, yeah.

03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:42.560
But people will get this impression of like an online activist,

03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:45.120
like a vegan or LGBT person or whatever.

03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:47.440
And then they think that every single person in real life is like that.

03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:49.840
And it's a really negative stereotype.

03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:51.600
And then even the other people in that group.

03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:53.520
Oh, is Malina coming over?

03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:54.720
Oh yeah, actually, I don't know if that's her.

03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:57.280
Okay, Malina just joined us.

03:15:57.280 --> 03:15:58.640
What were we talking about?

03:15:58.640 --> 03:15:59.600
Was it interesting?

03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:03.920
You were saying that you were going to talk to Elon about getting at Omni Destiny,

03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:05.200
the verified Twitter account on band.

03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:06.720
I said, that sounds like a lot.

03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:07.680
That's so gracious of you.

03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:09.520
I can't even believe you would do that for me.

03:16:09.520 --> 03:16:12.960
And then you admitted that you tried to evade the band multiple times,

03:16:12.960 --> 03:16:15.200
which I'm sure would be very looked upon.

03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:17.360
You know, I heard that in Norway, in their prison system,

03:16:17.360 --> 03:16:19.200
they don't actually punish you for trying to escape jail

03:16:19.200 --> 03:16:20.800
because that's like the natural human thing to do.

03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:21.440
Hug you?

03:16:21.440 --> 03:16:21.840
What are they doing?

03:16:21.840 --> 03:16:23.200
I don't know, but they don't punish you.

03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:24.400
Because of course you're trying to be free.

03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:25.520
That's all I'm trying to be on Twitter.

03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:26.320
I'm just trying to be free.

03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:27.600
Oh, that's the natural humanistic.

03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:30.000
Yeah, that's the natural human course, is to ban even.

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:31.200
You're not a destructive force.

03:16:31.200 --> 03:16:32.960
No, I'm a force, I'm a force for good.

03:16:32.960 --> 03:16:34.720
That's why all my accounts only get banned for banning and banning.

03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:36.240
I don't get banned for doing bad things.

03:16:36.240 --> 03:16:37.360
And I'm a progressive shill.

03:16:37.360 --> 03:16:38.640
I'm like far left.

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:40.720
I love like progressive causes.

03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:42.720
This is what you criticize us on for being.

03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:45.520
I show them from a place of first principles,

03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:48.480
not from a mindless AI echoing kind of thing, you know.

03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:50.720
Okay, so you're a free thinking bot.

03:16:50.720 --> 03:16:51.840
Yeah, exactly.

03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:52.800
All right, cool.

03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:54.400
Well, I'm sure we'll return to some politics.

03:16:54.400 --> 03:16:55.120
That was beautiful.

03:16:56.480 --> 03:16:59.120
William, can you tell us about yourself?

03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:00.720
You're also a fellow streamer.

03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:03.920
Yes, I stream and I started streaming because I am at him,

03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:06.640
basically, kind of, but I don't do the politics.

03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:09.280
I do like travels or talk about relationships,

03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:11.760
talk to my audience, basically.

03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:14.240
You're from that part of the world, right, Sweden?

03:17:14.240 --> 03:17:14.640
Yeah, exactly.

03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:16.960
So did you escape from prison and they didn't?

03:17:16.960 --> 03:17:18.000
That was Norway.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:19.040
You just mentioned Norway.

03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:19.520
That's different.

03:17:20.240 --> 03:17:22.720
I actually really, I've been to Sweden a bunch of times.

03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:23.520
I love it.

03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:26.640
There's a tech sector there that's really like flourishing.

03:17:26.640 --> 03:17:27.520
Where did you go?

03:17:27.520 --> 03:17:28.080
Which city?

03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:29.280
I went to Stockholm.

03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:30.720
I think I gave a few lectures there.

03:17:30.720 --> 03:17:34.000
There's a vibrant tech sector in school and people are super nice.

03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:36.560
Yeah, we're friendly.

03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:37.840
We're not like very deep.

03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:39.600
Like we don't really have much deep conversation.

03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:40.640
It's like a meta conversation.

03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:43.360
Oh, there's not many intellectuals that come from Sweden.

03:17:43.360 --> 03:17:44.960
We don't really speak very highly of ourselves.

03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:46.800
We're kind of like just chill all the time.

03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:47.760
We don't make a scene.

03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:50.400
We don't, we're just like talking, you know.

03:17:50.400 --> 03:17:51.440
Do you know what the name for that is?

03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:52.800
There's a specific name for it.

03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:53.680
Jantelagen.

03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:55.680
Yeah, Jantelagen, yeah.

03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:57.200
Oh, there's a philosophy behind it.

03:17:57.200 --> 03:17:58.800
When you're part of like Sweden or Norway,

03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:00.560
you don't talk too highly of yourself

03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:01.840
because it's seen as kind of like rude.

03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:04.160
Like think of like America as the exact opposite.

03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:05.040
You'd even really want to like,

03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:06.960
you don't want to make yourself into a victim too much.

03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:08.320
You don't want to be too much of anything.

03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:10.400
You're just like sticking to the, to the group

03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:12.160
to make big scene about yourself.

03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:16.080
But that said, you came here and you were,

03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:18.560
you put yourself in front of a camera and became a streamer.

03:18:18.560 --> 03:18:20.960
Do you understand how weird that is for my friends in Sweden?

03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:22.000
Do you have anxiety?

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:23.760
I just didn't talk about myself

03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:26.480
and just like make a big deal about myself for hours every day.

03:18:26.480 --> 03:18:27.440
Was that like terrifying?

03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:28.720
Did you have anxiety about that?

03:18:28.720 --> 03:18:29.920
No, because I don't see them.

03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:31.360
But then I come back and I'm like, ooh.

03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:34.640
Also, what do you feel like when you're actually streaming?

03:18:34.640 --> 03:18:36.240
You feel like you're just alone in a room?

03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:38.000
One-on-one type thing?

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:39.920
No, I see, I see Chad and I'm thinking,

03:18:39.920 --> 03:18:40.960
oh, they're like a little fairies.

03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:41.680
They're not really real.

03:18:41.680 --> 03:18:42.640
They're just like out there.

03:18:42.640 --> 03:18:43.600
I don't know what they look like.

03:18:43.600 --> 03:18:46.400
I just see little names and they're just cute and just some colors.

03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:48.640
So you're talking to little fairies inside your head?

03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:49.280
Yes, I do.

03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:50.560
Is that how you feel about Chad?

03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:51.520
They're demons for me.

03:18:51.520 --> 03:18:52.160
They're demons?

03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:53.360
Okay, my kind of fairies.

03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.320
Are they, so is Chad a source of stress or happiness?

03:18:56.320 --> 03:18:57.040
Like is there a...

03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:58.800
No, for me, that's a source of happiness.

03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:00.960
I've been very intentional with like the construction

03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:01.600
of my community.

03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:02.720
So I'm really happy with where it's at.

03:19:03.280 --> 03:19:05.920
How are you able to actually have deep political discourse

03:19:05.920 --> 03:19:07.520
while playing a video game at the same time?

03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:10.720
I have a really good chat room in terms of like the way

03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:12.080
that people engage in conversations.

03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:16.000
Like I was one of the earliest people to embrace the philosophy

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:19.520
of like I am in total control of what people watch me think,

03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:22.080
that like I have a high level of responsibility

03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:23.520
for how they conduct themselves.

03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:25.040
And that if I conduct myself in a certain way,

03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:26.720
I can expect a certain level of conduct from them.

03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:28.160
And for the most part, it's like worked pretty well

03:19:28.160 --> 03:19:30.320
for the past, you know, nine or 10 years, yeah.

03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:32.640
What about the actual playing of the game?

03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:35.520
Like you're able to parallelize the brain like...

03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:39.040
Like it seems like Factory seems like a super complex game.

03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:40.400
Yeah, I don't actually think that's possible.

03:19:40.400 --> 03:19:42.240
I don't think multitasking for human brain is possible.

03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:44.560
If you see me playing a game,

03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:46.880
usually what's happening is the conversation is like,

03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:48.720
I've had it a million times, so I'm not thinking about it.

03:19:48.720 --> 03:19:49.760
I've automated that.

03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:51.520
Or if the conversation is very challenging,

03:19:52.160 --> 03:19:54.160
then if you watch me, if you really watch what's happening again,

03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:55.200
I'm probably just running around in circles

03:19:55.200 --> 03:19:56.720
because I have to think about the conversation.

03:19:56.720 --> 03:19:57.200
Okay.

03:19:57.200 --> 03:19:59.680
Because with Factory, it looks like a lot of stuff is going on.

03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:00.480
Sometimes, yeah.

03:20:00.480 --> 03:20:03.840
So I guess it's hard for a person who hasn't played the game

03:20:03.840 --> 03:20:04.800
to detect that you're not actually...

03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:07.360
Is that come off as like you're super intelligent in multitasking?

03:20:07.360 --> 03:20:10.160
Or does it come off as like he's not interested in this conversation at all?

03:20:11.200 --> 03:20:12.480
Yeah, there's a coolness to it.

03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:13.840
Like when you're not paying attention,

03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:18.080
if you're looking elsewhere, like you're checking your phone,

03:20:18.080 --> 03:20:19.440
you're too cool for this conversation.

03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:20.240
There's a sense like that.

03:20:20.240 --> 03:20:20.560
Yeah.

03:20:20.560 --> 03:20:22.160
The reality is though is if you watch,

03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:23.600
it was easier to see in Minecraft

03:20:23.600 --> 03:20:25.520
because in Minecraft, when there was a challenging conversation,

03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:26.240
if you watch me play,

03:20:26.240 --> 03:20:28.080
I'm literally just running around and jumping in circles

03:20:28.080 --> 03:20:29.920
because I have to think about the conversation 100%.

03:20:29.920 --> 03:20:32.640
I can't do a complicated task and think about the conversation.

03:20:32.640 --> 03:20:34.320
Or like the people will always joke in my chat,

03:20:34.320 --> 03:20:35.840
like, oh no, the notepad came out.

03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:37.360
If it's a really challenging conversation,

03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:39.120
I'll get rid of the game and I'll bring out a notepad

03:20:39.120 --> 03:20:41.200
and I'll start writing stuff down to keep track of what's going on.

03:20:42.080 --> 03:20:43.920
So what kind of stuff do you stream?

03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:44.880
So advice?

03:20:44.880 --> 03:20:45.440
You talk about...

03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:48.800
Yeah, like either I talk to chatter, I travel around, basically.

03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:52.800
Like have a conversation or we like go to countries.

03:20:52.800 --> 03:20:53.920
I've been to like Italy.

03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:56.320
I was in Italy for like one and a half months,

03:20:56.320 --> 03:20:59.360
just like traveling around the loan, going to cities,

03:20:59.360 --> 03:21:02.960
like having like my camera with me and like streaming for hours.

03:21:03.680 --> 03:21:05.520
Where's the coolest place you've been to?

03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:06.800
Ever.

03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:08.000
It's probably New Zealand.

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:08.560
New Zealand?

03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:09.760
I think so.

03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:11.440
After it is probably going to be Italy, I think.

03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:13.200
Because I like history and...

03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:15.600
Also both history because New Zealand is also beautiful.

03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:19.760
So it's both natural beauty and historical beauty.

03:21:19.760 --> 03:21:20.960
Yeah, for sure.

03:21:20.960 --> 03:21:23.680
I think it's just really like the Polynesian sort of culture.

03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:24.960
I think it's very interesting.

03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:27.600
Like the ocean people and it's just really beautiful.

03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.800
People are very relaxed, chill.

03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:31.680
They're very far away, which is interesting as well.

03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:36.560
Because whenever they talk about politics or they talk about the world,

03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:37.600
it feels really far away.

03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:39.520
So where's home for you?

03:21:39.520 --> 03:21:40.400
Is Austin home?

03:21:41.520 --> 03:21:42.000
Did you...

03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:42.720
Home for me.

03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:44.960
A human being is home.

03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:45.360
Yeah.

03:21:45.360 --> 03:21:47.680
We travel, we've lived in a lot of places and traveled around.

03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:50.000
So that's what you think of home is like humans.

03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:51.360
I think so, yeah.

03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.680
I mean, if they're going to be a place,

03:21:53.680 --> 03:21:56.560
it's probably going to be like my childhood places probably.

03:21:57.440 --> 03:21:59.440
Like my old country house or something like that.

03:21:59.440 --> 03:22:00.320
We don't have it anymore.

03:22:00.320 --> 03:22:03.120
But that's like home for me, I guess.

03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:04.240
So how'd you guys meet each other?

03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:06.480
You're currently married.

03:22:06.480 --> 03:22:07.360
Yes.

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:08.240
To each other, yeah.

03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:09.040
Yeah.

03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:09.600
To each other.

03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:14.480
All right, cool.

03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:15.120
How'd you guys meet?

03:22:15.760 --> 03:22:19.760
I was watching his YouTube stuff like 2018, I think.

03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.840
Like because it was the Swedish election around that time

03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:23.040
and I was interested in politics.

03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:28.800
And then I think he said in one of his videos that he had an Instagram

03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:31.280
and that he needed people to stop DMing him.

03:22:31.280 --> 03:22:32.560
That wasn't cutie pies.

03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:35.200
And then I messaged him and said, am I a cutie pie?

03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:36.720
And then you're pie in like two minutes.

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.400
And then that's when I was in New Zealand.

03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:45.440
And I guess you wanted to escape America or like LA for a little bit.

03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:48.160
And that included New Zealand.

03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:49.520
What were you mentally there?

03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:52.480
Because we've talked to his timeline.

03:22:52.480 --> 03:22:54.000
Where's 2018?

03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:55.120
Was it 18, 19?

03:22:55.760 --> 03:22:56.720
Where was the low point?

03:22:57.360 --> 03:22:58.480
Or is that as that was way earlier?

03:22:58.480 --> 03:22:59.280
Low point, carbiclaning.

03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:01.920
That was like 2009, 2010.

03:23:01.920 --> 03:23:02.400
Oh, okay.

03:23:02.400 --> 03:23:03.840
2018 was probably your peak.

03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:06.400
Every day, now was my peak.

03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:06.960
What do you mean?

03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:07.680
That was my peak.

03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:08.480
Why would you say that?

03:23:08.480 --> 03:23:11.760
No, nobody ever had missed being past their prime.

03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:12.400
Just see.

03:23:12.960 --> 03:23:14.880
Well, I mean, my prime is still coming out.

03:23:14.880 --> 03:23:17.120
It was probably around the time where you were getting a lot

03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:19.920
of lefties to your community and you were really like thinking

03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:21.280
about that they would go too far.

03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:21.600
Maybe.

03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:23.760
That was, I think that was still when Hasan and Vash were both

03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:24.400
in my community.

03:23:24.400 --> 03:23:24.880
Exactly.

03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:28.160
So I would say it feels like there was not really like much issues

03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:31.520
when it come to your stuff or like your work stuff back then.

03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:33.840
Oh, something we didn't talk about is that like there were no

03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:34.720
politics on Twitch.

03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:37.440
I exclusively inhabited that place for like two years

03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:39.120
because nobody else did it because it was a really toxic

03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:40.000
environment for politics.

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:43.360
So for a couple of years as it grew, I kind of grew the whole

03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:44.080
space because it wasn't.

03:23:44.080 --> 03:23:44.800
Nobody was doing that yet.

03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:45.680
What did that look like?

03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:49.680
You're having like political debates, political discourse.

03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:52.240
Yeah, mainly like going into YouTube people to try to argue

03:23:52.240 --> 03:23:54.720
with them or just doing politics on stream like reading stories,

03:23:54.720 --> 03:23:56.320
researching stuff, talking about stuff.

03:23:56.320 --> 03:23:58.800
But there's not like other people on Twitch to debate about politics

03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:00.000
because there was no politics.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:00.800
It was, yeah.

03:24:00.800 --> 03:24:04.560
Was there a debate in the space of communism, socialism,

03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:07.280
social democrats, kind of like this?

03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:09.760
Are you trying to outline your own position during that time?

03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:11.840
I think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives

03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:13.120
because it was like Trump stuff.

03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:15.120
And then it was coming off the back of like there was this

03:24:15.120 --> 03:24:18.160
movement called Gamergate and there was all this anti-SJW stuff

03:24:18.160 --> 03:24:18.640
on the internet.

03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:21.680
And I was like the SJW, like the progressive that was fighting

03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:22.800
on the progressive side of things.

03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:23.920
So I think that's what I was known for.

03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:25.440
But I was fighting with people off of Twitch

03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:28.160
because on Twitch there weren't very many political discussions happening.

03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:34.240
So you were holding the SJW flag to what degree do you still hold it?

03:24:34.240 --> 03:24:34.960
Like what's the best?

03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:37.040
What's the steelman case for SJW?

03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:40.560
I mean like I'm still very much that SJW from 2018-2019

03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:43.200
but the positions have moved so much farther left that

03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:44.960
I don't know, some people might not call me that anymore.

03:24:44.960 --> 03:24:45.520
I'm not sure.

03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:46.560
It depends on who I'm talking to.

03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:48.640
Because basically what is social justice?

03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:51.760
Were you like being sensitive to the experience of others?

03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:54.080
Yeah, being sensitive and empathetic towards the experience of others

03:24:54.080 --> 03:24:56.560
and then trying to build a better world that like suits as many different types

03:24:56.560 --> 03:24:59.760
of people as possible while being like aware of like their names.

03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:00.000
Okay.

03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:04.080
So you guys met, what's from your perspective?

03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:06.320
Is the, did she, she, she telling lies?

03:25:06.320 --> 03:25:07.200
Is it accurate?

03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:08.000
No, it's pretty accurate.

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:08.800
It's pretty accurate.

03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:09.120
Okay.

03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:10.240
When did you guys actually meet?

03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:13.680
I flew out in 2019.

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:15.280
19 in like in February.

03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:15.760
Yeah.

03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:17.600
Basically there was like weird stuff happening in LA.

03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:20.880
I just come off of kind of a weird not kind of sort of relationship

03:25:20.880 --> 03:25:23.040
and I just wanted to like go away for a while.

03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:25.680
Another company reached out to me and they had like a fun streaming device

03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:27.280
and they said they'd sponsor a trip if I went somewhere.

03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:28.480
And I was like, oh, well, I know this person.

03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:29.920
I know a couple of people in New Zealand.

03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:30.720
And Malina was one of them.

03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:31.600
It's like, I'll go to New Zealand.

03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:32.000
New Zealand.

03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:32.880
It'll be fun.

03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:34.480
And yeah, I did that for two weeks.

03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:35.920
Do you guys believe in love?

03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:41.280
I feel like you lack the gotcha got us into this.

03:25:41.280 --> 03:25:43.920
I'm not sure to the degree to which you have human emotions.

03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:44.640
I have quite a few.

03:25:46.240 --> 03:25:49.360
From your perspective, when did you, when did you fall in love with Malina?

03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:50.480
When you fall in love with Malima.

03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:52.240
Malima.

03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:53.360
The minute I saw her.

03:25:54.800 --> 03:25:55.200
I don't know.

03:25:55.200 --> 03:25:57.840
We, our first two weeks together were a lot of fun.

03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:59.040
We had a lot of chemistry in person.

03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:02.400
I was kind of shocked that I wasn't thinking about it

03:26:02.400 --> 03:26:04.960
because it was like, we spent like a week together and you said,

03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:06.160
I really want to tell you something.

03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:09.040
And you were like, you were like stalling that for the longest time.

03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:12.240
I think she was, oh, he said that like, I love you.

03:26:12.240 --> 03:26:14.240
No, he basically just said like,

03:26:14.240 --> 03:26:15.920
I really like you and it never really happens.

03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:16.720
That's what he said.

03:26:16.720 --> 03:26:19.520
And I was like, oh, and I thought, hey, I thought.

03:26:21.280 --> 03:26:22.400
So let's still run.

03:26:22.400 --> 03:26:23.680
We said Trump getting banned from Twitter.

03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:24.720
Is that what we were talking about before?

03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:26.240
Oh yeah.

03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:27.920
Hey, you agreed to me coming on here.

03:26:27.920 --> 03:26:29.600
Of course I'm going to be doing those to you.

03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:31.120
How long, so how long did that take?

03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:31.920
Two weeks, you said?

03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:32.960
That took like a week.

03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:33.520
No, I don't know.

03:26:33.520 --> 03:26:34.560
I think it was just like.

03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:37.120
Thing is, my mind process is like information so quickly.

03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:39.520
Two weeks to somebody like you is actually like years for me.

03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:40.160
So.

03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:41.200
Oh, like me.

03:26:41.200 --> 03:26:41.360
Yeah.

03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:45.120
There was like a lot of like factorial type of strategic thinking.

03:26:45.120 --> 03:26:46.080
Yeah, going on.

03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:49.360
I was seeing like all the events, like Dr. Strange or whatever

03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:51.680
and the Avengers when he's like seeing into all the future.

03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:53.440
Oh, so when you saw me, you just saw the future.

03:26:53.440 --> 03:26:55.120
Yeah, I was looking at all of them, yeah.

03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:57.520
So you're doing like some game theoretic simulation

03:26:57.520 --> 03:26:58.880
of all the possible outcomes?

03:26:58.880 --> 03:26:59.840
Yeah, exactly.

03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:00.160
Okay.

03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:02.720
But no, yeah, it was probably pretty soon I realized

03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:03.840
that we had a lot of chemistry.

03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:05.760
I think before I left after my two weeks there,

03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:07.360
I was like, we need to make sure you got like a ticket

03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:08.560
to come visit me in the United States

03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:09.600
because it'll be fun and everything.

03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:09.920
And then.

03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:11.840
I kind of decided that last minute too.

03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:14.480
It was like really like five hours before your flight back.

03:27:14.480 --> 03:27:17.040
We kind of realized because it was kind of like men

03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:18.080
is just like a one type thing.

03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:19.440
And then that was it.

03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:20.800
But we're like, oh, no, this is a lot of fun.

03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:21.760
We should probably hang out again.

03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:24.480
Oh, so you realized you would miss each other.

03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:24.880
Yeah, yeah.

03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:26.320
This was one time thing.

03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:27.600
The melancholy side of love.

03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:29.040
Okay, when did you fall in love with Stephen?

03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:30.880
I thought he like hated me.

03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:31.200
I don't know.

03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:32.640
I thought not hated me.

03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:33.440
She still thinks I hated her.

03:27:33.440 --> 03:27:37.280
But no, no, I remember like what he said

03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:38.000
that he really liked me.

03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:41.280
I was kind of a little shocked about that because I don't know.

03:27:41.280 --> 03:27:43.680
It was a lot of like random things happening in New Zealand.

03:27:43.680 --> 03:27:45.600
It was a lot of fun, but it was definitely like

03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:47.200
very interesting like things that happened.

03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:50.720
Because I was like around a lot of other people as well.

03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:52.640
So I thought he might have had like a really bad time.

03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:55.200
But when he said that I was thinking about it more

03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:57.440
and then we spent like more time together

03:27:57.440 --> 03:27:58.320
like a week after that.

03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:00.720
And then I felt like that was more like real.

03:28:00.720 --> 03:28:02.480
And I think when he was about to leave,

03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:04.000
I kind of realized like, no, I really like him.

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:07.360
Do you guys ever say love to each other?

03:28:07.360 --> 03:28:08.480
Like I love you?

03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:08.960
Yeah, of course.

03:28:08.960 --> 03:28:09.200
Yeah.

03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:10.400
Okay, right.

03:28:10.400 --> 03:28:10.880
I wasn't sure.

03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:11.920
Why would you ask that?

03:28:11.920 --> 03:28:12.880
What has he said before?

03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:16.000
Because I haven't, I don't think I've heard you speak.

03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:18.880
The only time I've heard you talk about love is when you're like

03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:21.360
criticizing the Red Pill community,

03:28:21.360 --> 03:28:23.520
saying they don't ever talk about love in relationships.

03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:26.080
Almost all the time I'm giving criticism to people,

03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:27.440
like I said, I'm kind of stepping in.

03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:29.360
I'm very disconnected from my own emotional experience

03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:31.200
because I'm trying to talk with them there.

03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:32.560
So it's pretty rare that I'll talk about my own.

03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:35.200
What is your own emotional experience exactly?

03:28:35.200 --> 03:28:36.480
Highly blunted, I guess.

03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:37.120
There's a lot.

03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:37.680
Okay.

03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:38.400
What does that mean?

03:28:39.280 --> 03:28:41.280
I mean, what's the, what's deep in there?

03:28:41.280 --> 03:28:43.600
Are you, are you, is this just who you are genetically

03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:44.720
or are you running for something?

03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:46.880
I think I have a pretty good understanding of myself.

03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:48.400
A lot of people make that accusation of me,

03:28:48.400 --> 03:28:49.520
but I don't think I am.

03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:50.000
Okay.

03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:51.040
This is just who you are.

03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:52.160
It's just who I am, yeah.

03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:52.560
Okay.

03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:54.640
There's not childhood stuff like trauma.

03:28:55.200 --> 03:28:56.480
It's all sorted and done.

03:28:57.360 --> 03:28:58.320
You figured it all out?

03:28:58.320 --> 03:28:58.880
Yeah.

03:28:58.880 --> 03:29:00.240
In your old age?

03:29:00.240 --> 03:29:02.080
As I grow, every year I figure out more and more.

03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:04.080
He did mention, I think I heard this somewhere,

03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:07.440
that this is a source of fights for the two of you, the age thing.

03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:10.000
I felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation.

03:29:11.280 --> 03:29:14.160
He's basically, he's saying that he gambles like with time.

03:29:14.160 --> 03:29:16.400
He's just like, I think she will be good later.

03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:17.120
And then just like,

03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:17.840
It's like an investment.

03:29:17.840 --> 03:29:18.160
Yeah.

03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:18.880
Yeah.

03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:19.840
It's like what he's doing.

03:29:19.840 --> 03:29:21.840
And when this treasury bond matures,

03:29:21.840 --> 03:29:22.480
I'm going to be able to cash out for a good.

03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:23.520
What do you think so far?

03:29:23.520 --> 03:29:24.880
Is the stock's growing up or?

03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:26.720
It's tumultuous.

03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:27.760
What's that mean?

03:29:27.760 --> 03:29:28.720
It's like Bitcoin.

03:29:28.720 --> 03:29:29.760
Oh my God.

03:29:29.760 --> 03:29:31.840
Like Bitcoin, crypto mill.

03:29:31.840 --> 03:29:32.400
All right.

03:29:32.400 --> 03:29:34.000
If you guys don't mind,

03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:36.000
one interesting aspect of your relationship

03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:37.680
is you're in an open relationship.

03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:39.040
What's that like?

03:29:39.600 --> 03:29:41.840
From a game theoretic simulation perspective,

03:29:41.840 --> 03:29:43.360
what went into that calculation?

03:29:43.840 --> 03:29:45.040
And like, how does that?

03:29:45.040 --> 03:29:46.160
Like how that started or?

03:29:46.160 --> 03:29:46.240
Yeah.

03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:46.960
How did that start?

03:29:46.960 --> 03:29:47.680
Sure.

03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:49.280
The only relationships I've ever done

03:29:49.280 --> 03:29:52.080
has been open relationships since I was like in high school

03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:53.760
because I didn't really understand

03:29:53.760 --> 03:29:55.200
like why wouldn't you be able to like

03:29:55.920 --> 03:29:57.280
do other things with other people,

03:29:57.280 --> 03:29:59.440
but then just like have your main partner basically.

03:29:59.440 --> 03:30:01.360
So what is an open relationship?

03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:02.320
Generally speaking,

03:30:02.320 --> 03:30:04.000
that means you have one main partner?

03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:05.360
Not a monogamous relationship.

03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:08.160
Like you're somehow allowed like in different ways.

03:30:08.960 --> 03:30:10.400
You can see other people sexually.

03:30:10.880 --> 03:30:11.440
Sexually.

03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:14.480
But like there's one main station.

03:30:14.480 --> 03:30:16.080
It doesn't have to be there for some people,

03:30:16.080 --> 03:30:18.080
but like I think it's probably easier

03:30:18.080 --> 03:30:19.600
and we probably don't really have time

03:30:19.600 --> 03:30:21.440
or the energy for like more than

03:30:22.240 --> 03:30:24.560
like one person to like really like.

03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:25.920
What about like emotional?

03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:27.600
It's really complicated.

03:30:27.600 --> 03:30:29.200
There's a lot of complicated stuff going on

03:30:29.200 --> 03:30:30.320
under the hood there.

03:30:30.320 --> 03:30:30.800
Yeah.

03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:32.960
I think broadly speaking,

03:30:32.960 --> 03:30:35.040
you've got like polyamorous relationships

03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:36.480
and you've got like open relationships

03:30:36.480 --> 03:30:38.000
where polyamorous is like,

03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:39.920
oh, I've got like three different girlfriends

03:30:39.920 --> 03:30:41.840
and we all hang out or sometimes even live together

03:30:41.840 --> 03:30:42.960
or three boyfriends or whatever.

03:30:42.960 --> 03:30:44.240
And then you've got like open relationships

03:30:44.240 --> 03:30:45.360
which is like, oh, you know, like,

03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:46.960
you can basically hook up with other people

03:30:46.960 --> 03:30:48.560
and then you've got like your main relationship

03:30:48.560 --> 03:30:49.200
and that's it.

03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:52.000
I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that

03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:53.680
to where like we've got like long-term friends,

03:30:53.680 --> 03:30:54.800
some of them we hook up with

03:30:54.800 --> 03:30:56.320
and that's kind of how we, yeah.

03:30:56.320 --> 03:30:59.360
It's a delicate dance that explodes

03:30:59.360 --> 03:31:00.480
every six months on itself.

03:31:00.480 --> 03:31:02.320
So it does explode, you guys fight over?

03:31:02.320 --> 03:31:03.760
We fight over some things, yeah.

03:31:04.320 --> 03:31:05.200
It things happen, yeah.

03:31:05.200 --> 03:31:08.080
I think it's mostly because a lot of people can handle it

03:31:08.080 --> 03:31:09.520
and they, they agree to something

03:31:09.520 --> 03:31:11.360
and then they realize that we're way too cool

03:31:11.360 --> 03:31:12.880
and then they get really obsessed

03:31:12.880 --> 03:31:14.800
and they think that they can like get in there

03:31:14.800 --> 03:31:15.760
and then it gets really dramatic.

03:31:16.400 --> 03:31:17.360
Have you figured it out?

03:31:19.440 --> 03:31:21.920
I feel like we figure out things more and more

03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:22.880
like when it comes to like,

03:31:22.880 --> 03:31:24.480
what's a good person for us to hang out

03:31:24.480 --> 03:31:26.960
and what's not a good person for us to hang out with

03:31:26.960 --> 03:31:29.120
or like, I probably have more opinions

03:31:29.120 --> 03:31:30.480
than like who he hangs out with

03:31:30.480 --> 03:31:32.000
because he likes the fucking psychos.

03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:34.960
Yeah, so you like this or not?

03:31:34.960 --> 03:31:37.040
He likes the not like the crazy ones,

03:31:37.040 --> 03:31:38.640
like the baby trap sort of women.

03:31:39.200 --> 03:31:40.800
That's the ones and I don't like that

03:31:40.800 --> 03:31:41.600
because that affects me.

03:31:43.440 --> 03:31:45.120
That affects your game theory at a calculation.

03:31:45.120 --> 03:31:45.920
Yeah, obviously, yeah.

03:31:45.920 --> 03:31:48.320
Right, you like to surround yourself

03:31:48.320 --> 03:31:50.880
like in general you've talked about with crazy people.

03:31:51.600 --> 03:31:53.040
I say crazy and I really shouldn't.

03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:53.920
It's a humorous way.

03:31:53.920 --> 03:31:54.480
It's like, yeah.

03:31:54.480 --> 03:31:55.760
They're very unstable.

03:31:55.760 --> 03:31:57.360
Very, can be unstable,

03:31:57.360 --> 03:31:58.720
but people that are very unique.

03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:00.560
Like when I meet this person, that's like.

03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:01.280
Not boring.

03:32:01.280 --> 03:32:02.480
Yeah, not boring, yeah.

03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:05.360
And you said that you're progressively becoming

03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:07.360
not boring yourself.

03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:08.560
No, I think I'm pretty stable.

03:32:08.560 --> 03:32:10.160
I don't love them affect me much, but.

03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:11.760
So you don't think they affect your.

03:32:11.760 --> 03:32:13.280
No, if I've said that, I said a joke.

03:32:13.280 --> 03:32:14.720
And I think I've like, I've got my stuff

03:32:14.720 --> 03:32:15.680
like really well figured out.

03:32:15.680 --> 03:32:17.120
It's what allows me to engage with people

03:32:17.120 --> 03:32:19.040
like this so easily because I can engage.

03:32:19.040 --> 03:32:20.320
I can make them feel seen and heard.

03:32:20.320 --> 03:32:21.920
And then if it gets insane, I can cut off

03:32:21.920 --> 03:32:22.960
and I can be chill.

03:32:22.960 --> 03:32:24.960
Like very few things affect me in the long term.

03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:26.320
Do you guys experience jealousy?

03:32:27.440 --> 03:32:30.000
Usually like whenever I feel like he's not spending

03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:32.080
the like the amount of time that I'm asking for

03:32:32.080 --> 03:32:35.040
and he spends it on his video games or his stream

03:32:35.120 --> 03:32:37.600
or like he sees someone else like more than

03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:38.800
he sees me or something like that.

03:32:38.800 --> 03:32:40.160
That would like not be good

03:32:40.160 --> 03:32:41.840
because then it affects like our relationship.

03:32:42.400 --> 03:32:45.680
Do you have a good sense of like, is it literally time

03:32:45.680 --> 03:32:49.120
or is it the energy put into the.

03:32:49.120 --> 03:32:52.240
It's probably like if like if he's with me

03:32:52.240 --> 03:32:53.680
that like the attention in the time

03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:54.720
like when he hangs out with me

03:32:54.720 --> 03:32:56.080
and then there's also probably the time.

03:32:56.080 --> 03:32:58.560
So if I feel like something else is distracting too much

03:32:58.560 --> 03:33:00.240
like it could be work or it could be a friend

03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:01.520
or it could be anything.

03:33:01.520 --> 03:33:04.720
Like if I feel like it starts to take away from like me

03:33:04.720 --> 03:33:06.320
then I'm having an issue with it.

03:33:06.320 --> 03:33:08.000
I don't think he really cares much.

03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:09.760
I guess the only jealousy you experience is probably

03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:15.120
when you feel like if I get upset about him seeing someone too much

03:33:15.680 --> 03:33:17.360
and then I go see someone more

03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:19.600
and then he's like why can I go see my friend more

03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:20.480
like as much as you.

03:33:20.480 --> 03:33:22.240
So like that's the sort of like thing

03:33:22.240 --> 03:33:23.680
that we're trying to navigate on I guess.

03:33:25.440 --> 03:33:28.560
I think we are like diametrically opposed sometimes

03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:30.480
in terms of how we view like engagement with people

03:33:30.480 --> 03:33:32.160
or engagement with the world sometimes.

03:33:32.160 --> 03:33:34.000
So like on her end of the spectrum

03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:38.960
like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin

03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:41.520
watching like fireflies at night

03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:42.800
going hiking every morning

03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:44.000
going swimming at the beach

03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:46.560
because it's like you're taking in like the grandeur of nature

03:33:46.560 --> 03:33:47.840
you're like connected with yourself

03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:48.880
you're like very at peace

03:33:48.880 --> 03:33:50.080
everything is like chill and cool

03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:51.760
there's the wind the feeling of nature everything

03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:53.440
that's like her peak living experience.

03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:54.560
I like being present.

03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:56.960
Yeah and like my peak experiences are like

03:33:56.960 --> 03:33:58.320
people trying to destroy my life

03:33:58.320 --> 03:33:59.680
like the challenge of like navigating

03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:00.880
a really complicated discussion

03:34:01.600 --> 03:34:03.680
like you know several different dramatic events

03:34:03.680 --> 03:34:04.880
unfolding that might end my career

03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:05.840
like these things are like very

03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:07.440
I like the stress and the action

03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:08.160
and the entertainment

03:34:08.160 --> 03:34:09.760
and everything's like very cool for me.

03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:10.880
So when we're together

03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:12.800
she generally wants me to be like more chill

03:34:12.800 --> 03:34:14.160
but if I don't feel like I'm being like

03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:15.120
stimulated a lot

03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:16.720
then it's easy for like my mind to wonder

03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:18.320
to wonder somewhere else or yeah

03:34:18.320 --> 03:34:19.040
that's kind of the issue.

03:34:19.040 --> 03:34:20.640
We have a very different way of like engaging with the world.

03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:24.000
So how can you find happiness and stillness?

03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:26.240
I feel like if we're just like aware of it

03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:27.280
and we're trying our best

03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:29.280
like whenever we like we're supposed to do this one thing

03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:30.880
so let's say that we want to go to New York

03:34:30.880 --> 03:34:32.320
and I'm like we should just like go out

03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:33.680
and do this one specific thing

03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:35.840
we try to find something that he enjoys doing

03:34:35.840 --> 03:34:38.480
like now that we're in Texas we can go shooting

03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:40.160
or do something fun that he enjoys

03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:40.960
then we can do it.

03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:43.040
And then I think like

03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:45.600
just like for me also to be aware

03:34:46.480 --> 03:34:48.560
that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people

03:34:48.560 --> 03:34:49.920
it's not because he like loves them

03:34:49.920 --> 03:34:50.800
or wants to be with them

03:34:50.800 --> 03:34:52.080
it's just because he likes being

03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:53.840
like having his life destroyed.

03:34:54.400 --> 03:34:55.440
Like you said

03:34:55.440 --> 03:34:56.320
which I don't really do

03:34:56.320 --> 03:34:57.520
this is a completely different thing.

03:34:57.520 --> 03:34:59.600
So like for me to like understand more

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:00.640
like how he's thinking

03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:01.920
because it's so different from mine

03:35:02.320 --> 03:35:03.440
and for him to understand

03:35:03.440 --> 03:35:04.480
how I'm thinking about things

03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:06.720
and like what I prioritize in my life

03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:08.240
I think that's like how we navigate

03:35:08.240 --> 03:35:09.040
but I think it's good

03:35:09.040 --> 03:35:10.640
I think the differences can be good

03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:11.840
like when we're finding a way.

03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:12.400
Yeah.

03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:15.440
Well I think you're relatable.

03:35:17.120 --> 03:35:17.920
I'm more of a human.

03:35:17.920 --> 03:35:19.680
No I'm definitely very difficult to get along with

03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:20.560
like I always tell people that

03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:21.440
that like if you're dating me

03:35:21.440 --> 03:35:22.480
for like more than a few years

03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:23.760
like you get like an award for that.

03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:25.920
It's like a war zone that you've survived.

03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:26.960
Absolutely.

03:35:26.960 --> 03:35:29.280
You're like a veteran you get medals and stuff

03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:30.240
and it's always like I think

03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:31.520
there's probably been like six different

03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:32.640
I don't think she says it anymore

03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:33.600
but there are like six different times

03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:34.560
in our relationship where she's like

03:35:34.560 --> 03:35:35.600
is it always like this?

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:36.720
Is this actually right?

03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:36.880
Yeah.

03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:38.320
And like every next year it's like

03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:39.520
You're lying in the beginning of about like

03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:40.640
you were lying about that.

03:35:40.640 --> 03:35:42.240
Well it got more and more.

03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:43.840
You were like no it's just like right now

03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:46.080
I'm having a huge argument online

03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:47.520
about seeing the end word in private

03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:48.480
and it's just going to be like this

03:35:48.480 --> 03:35:50.320
and I'm going to be streaming 24 hours a day

03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:51.920
and I'm like we're like

03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:52.880
when are you going to come to bed?

03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:53.520
It's been a week.

03:35:55.520 --> 03:35:58.400
I did playing League come into this.

03:35:58.400 --> 03:35:59.520
A little bit but I'm clean.

03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:01.120
I'm clean of League like six months right now.

03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:03.360
What do you hate about League of Legends?

03:36:03.360 --> 03:36:03.760
I never got.

03:36:03.760 --> 03:36:04.240
The humans.

03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:07.440
Well speaking of which

03:36:07.440 --> 03:36:09.360
I my participation in League

03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:10.720
involved on the robot side.

03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:11.120
Good.

03:36:11.120 --> 03:36:13.200
Because that's an improvement.

03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:16.400
Because both the Starcraft 2

03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:18.080
and and League of Legends

03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:19.760
because OpenAI and DeepMind

03:36:20.480 --> 03:36:21.760
both participated in creating bots

03:36:21.760 --> 03:36:22.240
and those.

03:36:22.240 --> 03:36:23.760
I was a professional Starcraft 2 player

03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:25.760
so I remember when the AI started to play

03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:27.600
it's interesting the types of restrictions

03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:28.800
that you would have to put on like a

03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:30.640
gaming robot to make it like functional

03:36:30.720 --> 03:36:32.800
and not totally unfair to the other side.

03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:34.560
Yeah to make it human like.

03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:35.840
Yeah was that interesting to you

03:36:35.840 --> 03:36:38.560
to see AI be able to play those video games?

03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:39.360
I think in some ways

03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:40.560
people think things are more complicated

03:36:40.560 --> 03:36:41.680
than they actually are

03:36:41.680 --> 03:36:43.200
and I think video games is one of those things

03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:44.000
are really oh my god

03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:45.520
there's like a million possibilities

03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:46.960
at every second and who knows

03:36:46.960 --> 03:36:47.520
and it's like no

03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:48.480
there's like three or four things

03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:49.520
going at any point in time

03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:50.400
and I'm willing to bet that like

03:36:50.400 --> 03:36:51.760
an AI could probably solve some of these

03:36:51.760 --> 03:36:52.880
games like pretty easily

03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:54.960
especially if there are no constraints

03:36:54.960 --> 03:36:55.680
on how they can learn.

03:36:55.680 --> 03:36:58.480
Yeah can I talk to you about relationships?

03:36:59.120 --> 03:37:00.160
Yeah you already have so.

03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:02.080
Yeah I know but more generally speaking

03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:04.160
we didn't get a chance to talk about

03:37:04.160 --> 03:37:05.600
the the red pill community.

03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:06.240
Oh sure.

03:37:06.240 --> 03:37:08.240
Well first of all what is the red pill community

03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:09.600
the manosphere in general?

03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.680
I'd love to get both your opinions on this.

03:37:11.680 --> 03:37:11.920
Sure.

03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:15.040
I know I know you're probably not as

03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:17.920
opinionated on that whole thing.

03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:18.960
Do you think I am that?

03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:20.080
Like probably not as you

03:37:20.080 --> 03:37:20.960
like as much as you

03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:22.480
but I do have opinions.

03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:23.200
You do okay.

03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:24.880
I usually don't like speak out too much

03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:26.080
on it because I feel like

03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:27.200
there's like a language barrier

03:37:27.920 --> 03:37:29.280
that's why I don't really do politics

03:37:29.280 --> 03:37:30.800
because this is my second language.

03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:31.120
Yeah.

03:37:31.120 --> 03:37:33.200
That's right you have to know the.

03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:33.920
A lot of it like.

03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:34.640
You know how to use

03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:37.040
have to use derogatory terms

03:37:37.040 --> 03:37:37.920
every other sentence

03:37:38.640 --> 03:37:39.760
so they understand you right.

03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:40.240
Exactly.

03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:41.600
I don't know anything about that.

03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:43.440
But you need like a good like you need

03:37:43.440 --> 03:37:45.680
to be able to like speak really well

03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:46.960
for people to take your seriously

03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:48.240
I think.

03:37:48.240 --> 03:37:49.760
And like that's a thing like if I

03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:51.120
if I don't have like the words

03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:52.080
and I don't have the

03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:53.920
like I can't pronounce things correctly.

03:37:53.920 --> 03:37:55.200
Yeah and you're a self person

03:37:55.200 --> 03:37:56.640
searching for words looks stupid

03:37:56.640 --> 03:37:58.160
essentially that's how people view it.

03:37:58.240 --> 03:38:00.160
Tell me about it I have a podcast

03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:01.920
that people listen to

03:38:01.920 --> 03:38:04.160
and I mumble and they yeah.

03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:05.600
Wait is here what's your first language.

03:38:06.160 --> 03:38:06.800
Russian.

03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:07.360
Oh okay.

03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:09.440
But I speak both languages horribly.

03:38:09.440 --> 03:38:12.240
I just not I'm not like

03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:14.320
there is definitely a big disconnect

03:38:14.320 --> 03:38:16.640
between my brain and my mouth module.

03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:19.120
Like I'm not able to generate

03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:20.640
the thoughts efficiently

03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:21.840
like the things you're able to do

03:38:21.840 --> 03:38:23.600
like to like speak like that.

03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:26.080
I'm not it's very very tough.

03:38:26.080 --> 03:38:27.840
Plus there's a huge amount of anxiety

03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:29.360
and social interaction that I have

03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:30.800
which makes speaking even harder.

03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:34.160
Yeah yeah yeah it's tough.

03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:34.800
I understand I mean.

03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:35.200
Gotcha.

03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:37.280
Makes sense.

03:38:37.280 --> 03:38:39.440
Yeah the the gacha is both

03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:41.680
a symbol of compassion

03:38:42.320 --> 03:38:43.840
and derision at once.

03:38:43.840 --> 03:38:44.640
It's I'm just letting you know

03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:45.360
I understand what you say.

03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:46.160
I'm just going to sit there

03:38:46.160 --> 03:38:46.560
and stare at you.

03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:47.040
Confirm.

03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:48.720
No you can just say like yeah get it.

03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:49.600
Like yeah I get it.

03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:50.160
I get it.

03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:50.720
Gotcha.

03:38:50.720 --> 03:38:51.680
I got you.

03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:52.560
Gotcha sounds.

03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:53.200
I got you.

03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:54.960
No it's so it's so short.

03:38:54.960 --> 03:38:55.600
I got you.

03:38:56.080 --> 03:38:57.760
Say it's a longer sentence

03:38:57.760 --> 03:38:59.200
but that means the same thing.

03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:00.480
I understand you.

03:39:00.480 --> 03:39:02.400
Yeah that's good that's like

03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:04.160
not chills you know.

03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:06.240
You get chills all like you understand me.

03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:07.200
Yeah it feels good.

03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:07.600
Yeah.

03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:08.400
I hear you.

03:39:08.400 --> 03:39:09.200
I hear you.

03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:10.160
And like if you just like

03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:11.200
hold the other person's hand

03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:11.760
that's even better.

03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:13.120
Maybe you gotta put in some emotion there

03:39:13.120 --> 03:39:14.320
okay show that you have some.

03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:18.400
Gotcha.

03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:19.600
What do you think about Red Pill?

03:39:20.880 --> 03:39:22.240
Sorry what is it first of all

03:39:22.240 --> 03:39:23.360
for people I don't know?

03:39:23.360 --> 03:39:24.960
Yeah the Red Pill community

03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:26.400
obviously it's the matrix reference.

03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:27.440
The Red Pill that you take

03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:28.560
is when you realize

03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:30.080
what dating standards and norms

03:39:30.080 --> 03:39:31.440
really are in the world

03:39:31.440 --> 03:39:32.960
that men are providers

03:39:32.960 --> 03:39:34.560
and have to become some great thing

03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:36.240
to hunt and attract you know

03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:37.360
the woman who are just kind of

03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:38.080
there floating around

03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:38.800
looking for people

03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:40.080
to give them the most resources

03:39:40.080 --> 03:39:42.160
and it's like coming to a realization

03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:43.680
of what the world of dating really is

03:39:43.680 --> 03:39:45.040
broken away from the Hollywood

03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:46.320
standards and the romantic stuff

03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:47.120
that they try to sell you

03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:48.080
and you know stories.

03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:49.040
So there was kind of

03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:51.760
maybe you can kind of educate me on this

03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:53.680
but Red Pill used to be associated with

03:39:54.960 --> 03:39:58.640
just maybe anti-establishment views

03:39:58.640 --> 03:39:59.680
I don't know maybe

03:39:59.680 --> 03:40:01.360
maybe Republican conservative viewpoints

03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:02.240
would be all right.

03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:03.680
Yeah they use Red Pill a lot

03:40:03.680 --> 03:40:04.640
in like different communities

03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:06.400
like when you say the Red Pill community

03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:07.840
yeah that usually means dating.

03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:08.400
The dating thing

03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:09.040
but a lot of people say

03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:10.240
oh Trump voters they're Red Pill

03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:11.520
are you Red Pilled on like politics

03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:13.120
or whatever people say stuff like that yeah.

03:40:13.120 --> 03:40:13.760
Okay cool.

03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:15.440
And then there's like the manosphere

03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:17.120
that's all the similar type of stuff

03:40:17.120 --> 03:40:18.720
and Andrew Tate is somebody

03:40:18.720 --> 03:40:19.680
that represents kind of

03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:21.520
the figurehead

03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:22.320
of the manosphere

03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:23.280
of like the Red Pill stuff

03:40:23.280 --> 03:40:24.080
yeah I would say so

03:40:24.080 --> 03:40:24.880
I'm pretty sure yeah.

03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:26.160
Okay all right cool.

03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:28.800
So what are some ideas

03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:29.520
that they represent

03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:30.640
and what do you think about them?

03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:32.160
I think they do a good job

03:40:32.160 --> 03:40:34.160
at speaking to disaffected young men

03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:35.520
who feel like the rest of the world

03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:36.560
is kind of left them behind

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:38.320
or isn't willing to speak to them

03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:39.600
and they do identify

03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:41.440
some true and real problems.

03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:42.240
Feels like on the left

03:40:42.240 --> 03:40:43.360
we have a really hard time

03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:44.800
doing like self-improvement

03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:46.400
or telling people how to better themselves.

03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:47.200
We focus too much on

03:40:47.200 --> 03:40:48.800
like structural or systemic issues

03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:50.320
rather than what can an individual do

03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:52.080
to uplift or empower themselves

03:40:52.080 --> 03:40:52.960
and it also feels like

03:40:52.960 --> 03:40:53.920
they do a good job

03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:56.160
at speaking to some of the positive aspects

03:40:56.160 --> 03:40:57.040
of masculinity

03:40:57.040 --> 03:40:58.880
that it's okay to be like strong

03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:00.800
and brave and a soldier

03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:01.360
and a warrior

03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:02.320
and provide for your family

03:41:02.320 --> 03:41:03.040
and blah blah blah.

03:41:03.680 --> 03:41:04.560
So I would say like those are like

03:41:04.560 --> 03:41:05.360
positive messages

03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:06.160
like self-improvement

03:41:06.160 --> 03:41:06.640
and everything

03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:08.000
that come from the Red Pill community.

03:41:08.640 --> 03:41:09.520
What's the negative?

03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:11.840
I think the analysis

03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:13.920
on how men and women interact

03:41:13.920 --> 03:41:16.000
is a way too transactional.

03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:17.440
All of like the romanticism

03:41:17.440 --> 03:41:18.240
and love and chemistry

03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:19.680
is totally sucked out of it.

03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:20.720
Everything is very like

03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:21.920
sex-based

03:41:21.920 --> 03:41:23.360
like how do you basically have sex

03:41:23.360 --> 03:41:24.720
with the most amount of women possible

03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:25.680
and that's going to make you happy.

03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:28.000
And then I think people's motivation

03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:29.680
sometimes are just spoken about

03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:31.440
in such a shallow derogatory way

03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:32.000
that I don't think

03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:33.520
is always reflective of reality.

03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:34.720
Like women only wants you

03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:35.760
because you make six figures

03:41:35.760 --> 03:41:36.480
and you're tall

03:41:36.480 --> 03:41:37.280
and a guy only wants you

03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:38.240
because he wants to have sex with you

03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:38.720
and blah blah.

03:41:38.720 --> 03:41:39.200
Like it feels like

03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:40.400
there's a lot of that going on a lot.

03:41:41.280 --> 03:41:42.720
Yeah and that misses

03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:43.840
some fundamental aspect

03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:44.880
about relationships

03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:46.880
about meaningful relationships and so on.

03:41:46.880 --> 03:41:47.920
I don't think I've never heard

03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:49.360
Red Pill people ever ever

03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:50.800
talk about like meaningful relationships.

03:41:50.800 --> 03:41:51.840
It's always just how to get in one

03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:52.880
or how to have sex really.

03:41:53.760 --> 03:41:55.360
Mel, what bothers you about

03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:57.200
some of that philosophy?

03:41:57.200 --> 03:41:58.080
I feel like the people

03:41:58.080 --> 03:41:59.520
that are like the Red Pill people

03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:01.040
I feel like their solution

03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:03.200
is something that doesn't actually work out.

03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:05.840
Like where it works out

03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:06.560
for some people

03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:07.680
people that makes a lot of money

03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:08.720
is like really successful

03:42:08.720 --> 03:42:09.440
in that sort of way.

03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:11.360
But it's not going to help

03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:12.880
most men out there

03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:14.320
so I feel like it's just like a pointless

03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:16.080
like speech to give

03:42:16.080 --> 03:42:18.080
to these like really lost guys

03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:18.960
and they really do believe

03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:19.760
that they can like

03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:20.960
they can become successful

03:42:20.960 --> 03:42:22.640
they can get money

03:42:23.200 --> 03:42:24.560
and when they get all these things

03:42:24.560 --> 03:42:25.520
they can get girls

03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:26.400
but most of them

03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:27.840
is not going to achieve that ever.

03:42:28.400 --> 03:42:29.280
To get the money part

03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:30.320
or become successful.

03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:31.280
Just become a billionaire

03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:31.920
you know like

03:42:31.920 --> 03:42:32.880
and you will get all the girls

03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:33.520
and which is true

03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:34.640
but not everyone can do that.

03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:36.000
So I feel like

03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:37.200
when these guys are speaking

03:42:37.200 --> 03:42:37.840
to these men

03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:38.240
and there's like

03:42:38.240 --> 03:42:40.080
we just care about these men out there

03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:41.520
you know they need to hear this

03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:42.880
it doesn't really help a lot of them.

03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:46.640
And it doesn't inspire them

03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:47.840
to develop compassion

03:42:48.640 --> 03:42:49.760
towards the opposite sex

03:42:49.760 --> 03:42:51.280
which is probably something required

03:42:51.360 --> 03:42:52.800
to have money for relationship.

03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:53.840
And also like

03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:55.680
they seem to complain a lot about women

03:42:56.640 --> 03:42:57.920
like only wanting men

03:42:57.920 --> 03:42:58.640
that have money

03:42:58.640 --> 03:42:59.280
and that's tall

03:42:59.280 --> 03:43:00.080
and that's muscular

03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:00.800
whatever you know

03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:01.440
all those things

03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:04.480
and but they complain about that

03:43:04.480 --> 03:43:05.120
but that's like

03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:06.480
also kind of what they're trying to

03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:10.160
make the men try to do for themselves

03:43:10.160 --> 03:43:11.120
so they kind of like

03:43:11.120 --> 03:43:12.800
fall into the same sort of behavior

03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:13.360
and it seems like

03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:14.720
they're kind of unaware of that as well.

03:43:15.920 --> 03:43:17.280
They're just playing a part of the game

03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:18.640
instead of trying to find

03:43:18.640 --> 03:43:20.800
a woman that doesn't look for those things

03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:21.760
and that are looking for

03:43:22.720 --> 03:43:23.440
not those things.

03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:24.160
Yeah.

03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:25.360
I actually would love to have

03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:26.720
like straight up data

03:43:27.680 --> 03:43:30.720
on people in that world

03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:31.840
versus not in that world

03:43:31.840 --> 03:43:32.880
how often they get laid.

03:43:33.440 --> 03:43:33.680
Yeah.

03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:36.080
Like literally so

03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:38.240
I think for sure

03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:40.080
people in that world

03:43:40.720 --> 03:43:43.760
have fewer meaningful long-term

03:43:43.760 --> 03:43:45.280
relationships that are fulfilling

03:43:45.280 --> 03:43:47.360
that actually helped them succeed in life

03:43:47.360 --> 03:43:48.480
that helped them be happy

03:43:48.480 --> 03:43:49.600
and content and all that kind of stuff

03:43:50.240 --> 03:43:51.840
but just even the straight up

03:43:51.840 --> 03:43:53.360
the shallow goal of getting laid

03:43:54.880 --> 03:43:55.520
I wonder

03:43:56.480 --> 03:43:57.760
because it's very possible

03:43:57.760 --> 03:43:59.360
that like just the roughness

03:43:59.360 --> 03:44:02.560
with which they treat intellectually

03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:04.160
women that might lead to

03:44:04.720 --> 03:44:05.440
lower success

03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:06.560
not higher success.

03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:07.920
It's very adversarial

03:44:07.920 --> 03:44:09.120
which I think is always disappointing

03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:10.400
anything that talks about men and women

03:44:10.400 --> 03:44:12.160
I think it's good to acknowledge differences

03:44:12.160 --> 03:44:13.920
but when it becomes like adversarial

03:44:13.920 --> 03:44:15.280
especially when you talk about sex

03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:16.720
sex is something that men are getting

03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:18.160
and it's something that women are giving

03:44:18.160 --> 03:44:19.200
and that type of like trade-off

03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:20.560
and the way they talk about it is like

03:44:20.560 --> 03:44:22.160
yeah it sets people against each other

03:44:22.160 --> 03:44:23.280
in a really toxic way I think.

03:44:24.960 --> 03:44:27.040
How do you talk to people from that world

03:44:27.040 --> 03:44:28.320
from the red pill world

03:44:28.320 --> 03:44:29.600
like would you would you ever talk to

03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:30.880
like somebody like Andrew Tate?

03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:32.080
Oh yeah if I had the chance to

03:44:32.080 --> 03:44:33.680
I've been on the Fresh and Fit podcast

03:44:33.680 --> 03:44:34.160
a few times

03:44:34.160 --> 03:44:35.440
and then I've got a friend Sneeko

03:44:35.440 --> 03:44:37.440
who's like very red pill that stuff

03:44:39.280 --> 03:44:40.400
if I'm trying to talk to them

03:44:40.400 --> 03:44:41.120
usually the

03:44:42.080 --> 03:44:42.960
it's kind of like approaching it

03:44:42.960 --> 03:44:43.920
like a scared cat

03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:44.960
the first thing you have to do is like

03:44:44.960 --> 03:44:46.160
be very gentle and say like

03:44:46.160 --> 03:44:47.040
I understand your issues

03:44:47.040 --> 03:44:47.920
I understand your complaints

03:44:47.920 --> 03:44:49.040
I know that you're I'm scary

03:44:49.040 --> 03:44:50.080
because you think I'm going to say like

03:44:50.080 --> 03:44:51.760
toxic masculinity and feminism

03:44:51.760 --> 03:44:53.280
and all these scary words at you

03:44:53.840 --> 03:44:55.440
so the first thing is always to recognize it

03:44:55.440 --> 03:44:56.880
like a lot of what they talk about

03:44:56.880 --> 03:44:58.320
there are like true aspects

03:44:58.320 --> 03:44:59.200
to what they're talking about

03:44:59.200 --> 03:45:00.960
that people on the left won't recognize

03:45:00.960 --> 03:45:03.760
so I think it's good to acknowledge those things

03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:05.680
that like men and women are kind of different

03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:07.040
we do look for different things in general

03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:08.000
when it comes to relationships

03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:08.800
it's okay to say that

03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:10.320
it's not there's nothing bad there

03:45:10.320 --> 03:45:11.280
and then it'll usually be like

03:45:11.280 --> 03:45:12.320
once I've got your trust

03:45:12.320 --> 03:45:13.520
and I'm in your bubble

03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:15.600
like let's talk about the things that you want

03:45:15.600 --> 03:45:17.120
and maybe some of the strategies

03:45:17.200 --> 03:45:18.560
that you're employing aren't necessarily

03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:20.160
going to get you some of the things that you want

03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:21.440
so for instance if you're really worried

03:45:21.440 --> 03:45:22.800
about like shallow girls

03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:23.680
like ruining your life

03:45:23.680 --> 03:45:24.400
like Molina said

03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:26.960
it's probably not best to build your entire world view

03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:28.160
around trying to get shallow girls

03:45:28.160 --> 03:45:29.360
that are going to ruin your life

03:45:29.360 --> 03:45:30.720
like if your way of attracting a girl

03:45:30.720 --> 03:45:31.440
is to go to the gym

03:45:31.440 --> 03:45:32.400
get a whole bunch of money

03:45:32.400 --> 03:45:33.840
and try to like flaunt your wealth

03:45:33.840 --> 03:45:34.560
as much as possible

03:45:34.560 --> 03:45:36.240
you're going to be attracting the very same type of women

03:45:36.240 --> 03:45:37.120
that you're here like

03:45:37.120 --> 03:45:38.480
decrying on your stream

03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:40.000
I think we talked about that on the podcast

03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:41.520
like you probably want to have a woman

03:45:41.520 --> 03:45:42.240
that's going to be there

03:45:42.240 --> 03:45:43.200
if you lose your job

03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:44.080
it's still there

03:45:44.080 --> 03:45:45.520
like that cares about the things

03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:46.800
that's not just your job

03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:48.800
it's more stable

03:45:48.800 --> 03:45:51.760
and also I don't help you become a great man

03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:54.160
or a great like grow

03:45:54.160 --> 03:45:55.680
like I feel like a great friendship

03:45:55.680 --> 03:45:56.320
and a partnership

03:45:56.880 --> 03:45:58.800
like it helps you make you a better person

03:45:58.800 --> 03:46:00.240
some of the most successful people I know

03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:01.360
I mean they have families

03:46:01.360 --> 03:46:03.040
and there's clearly a dynamic there

03:46:03.040 --> 03:46:04.880
that's like that makes them

03:46:04.880 --> 03:46:06.320
they wouldn't be that without

03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:07.440
they're not an island yeah

03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:10.080
yeah and the kids actually are a big part of that too

03:46:10.080 --> 03:46:11.120
like for most people

03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:12.800
if you're like a good parent

03:46:12.800 --> 03:46:15.120
they make you step up somehow in life

03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:16.720
you have to take responsibility for

03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:18.560
getting your shit together

03:46:18.560 --> 03:46:20.000
and excelling

03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:20.720
in ways that

03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:24.000
I guess the philosophy of the Red Bull

03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:25.040
does not quite get to

03:46:25.040 --> 03:46:26.000
that's always an interesting

03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:27.120
I think I've asked that a couple of times

03:46:27.120 --> 03:46:27.920
where it's like

03:46:27.920 --> 03:46:31.680
would you let your daughter date Andrew Tate

03:46:31.680 --> 03:46:32.720
and it's always funny to watch them

03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:34.080
kind of like squirm around

03:46:34.080 --> 03:46:35.200
those answers sometimes

03:46:35.200 --> 03:46:37.120
but see if they if they don't have a daughter

03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:39.280
like I you know I don't have a daughter

03:46:39.280 --> 03:46:41.280
I think your whole philosophy changes

03:46:41.280 --> 03:46:42.320
once you have a daughter

03:46:42.320 --> 03:46:42.960
sure

03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:44.320
but even at that like they can

03:46:44.320 --> 03:46:45.600
they know that what they're answering

03:46:45.600 --> 03:46:46.720
they feel a little bit weird about it

03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:47.440
it's funny to watch them

03:46:47.440 --> 03:46:48.480
like they even they know it's like

03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:49.760
ah fuck you know

03:46:49.760 --> 03:46:51.040
well they might say like

03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:52.480
I want my daughter to date

03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:53.680
like a high value male

03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:56.240
to the degree that he's a high value male

03:46:56.240 --> 03:46:56.480
yes

03:46:57.120 --> 03:46:58.960
but like I don't think you'll feel that way

03:46:58.960 --> 03:47:00.800
the definition of high value changes

03:47:00.800 --> 03:47:02.240
completely for sure

03:47:02.240 --> 03:47:03.440
certainly the stereotypical

03:47:04.320 --> 03:47:05.840
measures of value contribute to the

03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:06.400
calculation

03:47:06.400 --> 03:47:07.760
but it's so much more than that

03:47:07.760 --> 03:47:09.920
I think the chemistry of the whole thing is

03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:11.040
is bigger

03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:13.680
you've also mentioned about body count

03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:16.560
you guys both have a high body count

03:47:16.560 --> 03:47:17.920
this body count matter

03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:18.960
or it depends

03:47:18.960 --> 03:47:19.680
like like you said

03:47:19.680 --> 03:47:21.520
it's low in some people's eyes

03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:23.040
it's high in other people's eyes

03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:24.800
does body count matter in relationships

03:47:24.800 --> 03:47:25.760
it's the past matter

03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:27.840
well the past matters

03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:28.800
I don't think body count

03:47:28.800 --> 03:47:29.840
not to me I don't really care

03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:30.960
not just as it is no

03:47:32.240 --> 03:47:33.040
I mean it could be

03:47:33.040 --> 03:47:33.760
the past does

03:47:33.760 --> 03:47:34.320
yeah

03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:35.920
well the past is who you are right

03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:36.800
like somebody tells me like

03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:38.160
they have a 200 body count

03:47:38.160 --> 03:47:39.200
and they're 16

03:47:39.200 --> 03:47:40.400
something's probably going on there

03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:41.120
that's not good

03:47:41.120 --> 03:47:42.240
I was thinking about that too like

03:47:42.320 --> 03:47:43.840
because it could be like really young people

03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:45.440
that are having some sort of

03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:47.120
like mental problems going on

03:47:47.120 --> 03:47:48.880
or somebody's like 45

03:47:48.880 --> 03:47:50.240
and they've like never had sex before

03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:51.520
there's probably something going on right

03:47:51.520 --> 03:47:52.320
so it could be indicative

03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:53.520
but if somebody's like in their 20s

03:47:53.520 --> 03:47:54.640
and they've had sex with you know

03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:56.080
100 people or 50 people or whatever

03:47:56.080 --> 03:47:56.960
it's you know whatever

03:47:56.960 --> 03:47:58.320
there's more experience

03:47:58.320 --> 03:47:59.360
which can be good

03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:00.000
sure

03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:01.520
okay so that just represents

03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:03.360
your like sexually open

03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:05.760
and so it doesn't really necessarily mean any kind of

03:48:06.320 --> 03:48:07.040
not necessarily

03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:07.840
it could though

03:48:07.840 --> 03:48:09.280
the number alone doesn't mean anything

03:48:09.840 --> 03:48:10.400
yeah

03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:11.280
okay

03:48:11.280 --> 03:48:12.720
well you could meet a guy that's like

03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:13.680
I just really really like

03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:14.800
want to fuck a lot of people

03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:16.160
because it makes me so cool

03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:17.680
like you're gonna be someone like that

03:48:17.680 --> 03:48:18.160
which is like

03:48:18.720 --> 03:48:19.760
so the body count doesn't matter

03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:20.880
but like where it comes from

03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:21.920
like yeah like why

03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:23.840
why have you slept with the people you slept with

03:48:23.840 --> 03:48:24.480
yes

03:48:24.480 --> 03:48:26.000
does it hurt like the romantic aspect

03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:26.800
of the relationship

03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:28.720
knowing that there's a lot of people in the past

03:48:29.280 --> 03:48:29.600
I don't know

03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:30.240
not for us

03:48:30.240 --> 03:48:31.040
no

03:48:31.040 --> 03:48:33.200
is the part of the relationship fundamentally romantic

03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:34.320
for us?

03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:34.960
for us yeah

03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:35.520
yeah

03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:36.320
okay

03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:38.080
what?

03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:40.800
you come out for such a cold person

03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:42.080
no I was just in my head thinking

03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:44.080
I wanted to just say gotcha right there

03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:46.960
it's so judgmental

03:48:46.960 --> 03:48:48.320
I think when it comes to the sex thing

03:48:48.320 --> 03:48:49.920
there's always like the way that I explain it is

03:48:49.920 --> 03:48:50.640
and I understand like

03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:52.400
I have to say this

03:48:52.400 --> 03:48:54.640
because I don't advocate for what I do for everybody

03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:55.680
or what she does for everybody

03:48:55.680 --> 03:48:57.360
because obviously there's a whole bunch of

03:48:57.360 --> 03:48:58.480
natural feelings of jealousy

03:48:58.480 --> 03:48:59.680
that pop up for a lot of people

03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:01.040
but when people ask me

03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:01.760
you know it's always like

03:49:01.760 --> 03:49:02.960
oh like isn't this like horrible

03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:04.080
that you guys are doing this

03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:04.880
and you don't love each other

03:49:05.440 --> 03:49:06.560
from my perspective

03:49:06.560 --> 03:49:08.480
I can have sex with like any person

03:49:08.480 --> 03:49:09.200
and it can be sex

03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:10.560
like that's not like a special thing

03:49:10.560 --> 03:49:11.360
between two people

03:49:11.360 --> 03:49:11.920
in my eyes

03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:13.360
it's like anybody can have sex

03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:15.440
but there are like certain activities

03:49:15.440 --> 03:49:17.280
and ways that you can spend time with each other

03:49:17.280 --> 03:49:18.560
where you're like carving out these like

03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:19.680
precious little moments in time

03:49:19.680 --> 03:49:20.480
with a certain person

03:49:20.480 --> 03:49:22.640
that can do things that are special to that person

03:49:22.640 --> 03:49:24.160
and those are the kind of like events

03:49:24.160 --> 03:49:26.320
that I remember more than anything else

03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:28.160
so like the idea of like

03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:29.520
like oh wow I had sex with a person

03:49:29.520 --> 03:49:30.480
that was so special

03:49:30.480 --> 03:49:32.320
doesn't mean as much as like you know

03:49:32.320 --> 03:49:34.160
us traveling to like New Zealand

03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:35.360
or sharing some special moment

03:49:35.360 --> 03:49:36.720
doing like some really fun activity

03:49:36.720 --> 03:49:37.680
or event or whatever

03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:38.800
that's usually how I like it I am

03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:41.200
so a shared intimate moment

03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:41.840
yeah

03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:42.720
I kind of agree

03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:44.720
but I can definitely connect the romance with sex

03:49:44.720 --> 03:49:45.120
boring

03:49:46.240 --> 03:49:47.440
I'm curious why you can't do it

03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:48.400
see that's where the red pill's right

03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:50.080
that's exactly

03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:51.840
we've also talked about misogyny

03:49:51.840 --> 03:49:54.400
which is you're clearly the embodiment of that

03:49:54.400 --> 03:49:55.440
what were you saying

03:49:55.440 --> 03:49:57.920
so there's some there's a connection between romance and

03:49:57.920 --> 03:49:59.280
yeah I think it is

03:49:59.280 --> 03:50:01.360
because I think sex could be a lot of things

03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:01.600
right

03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:04.640
it's it's some sort of bonding

03:50:04.640 --> 03:50:05.920
I'd say in some way

03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:08.400
they say that you really like BDSM

03:50:08.800 --> 03:50:11.280
you kind of like you become submissive to someone

03:50:11.280 --> 03:50:12.560
or you take control over someone

03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:15.200
it's like a very bonding like intimate moment

03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:15.600
I'd say

03:50:16.240 --> 03:50:17.040
and that's romantic

03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:17.920
the intimacy is romantic

03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:18.960
I think it is

03:50:18.960 --> 03:50:20.880
if you can show yourself as really submissive

03:50:20.880 --> 03:50:21.680
or like weak

03:50:21.680 --> 03:50:23.840
or you have like absolutely no control over yourself

03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:25.280
and you let someone else do it

03:50:25.280 --> 03:50:27.040
or you are the one being that like

03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:28.400
you are the dominant for someone

03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:30.320
I think that's a really like intimate thing

03:50:30.320 --> 03:50:33.040
because you show like the weakest part of yourself

03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:33.920
kind of

03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:35.360
I just feel like I personally

03:50:35.600 --> 03:50:39.680
to me some component romantic but to me

03:50:39.680 --> 03:50:40.880
this is not judging to others

03:50:40.880 --> 03:50:41.520
to me

03:50:41.520 --> 03:50:42.720
maybe his haul is brought up

03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:45.840
the romance increases

03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:49.280
if the number of intimate interactions

03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:51.280
are limited to one person

03:50:52.160 --> 03:50:54.080
like for me for some reason

03:50:55.040 --> 03:50:56.000
spreading it out

03:50:57.680 --> 03:50:58.480
decreases

03:50:59.280 --> 03:51:01.920
like exponentially

03:51:01.920 --> 03:51:03.920
the the feeling of romance you feel

03:51:04.240 --> 03:51:06.240
I don't know what that that could be just like

03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:09.040
sort of having grown up in the Soviet Union

03:51:09.040 --> 03:51:11.520
there's a kind of there's the fairy tale stories

03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:13.680
and you're kind of maybe living through them

03:51:14.640 --> 03:51:16.400
yeah I mean I think what you're saying is like really normal

03:51:16.400 --> 03:51:17.760
like most people probably show that way

03:51:17.760 --> 03:51:18.160
yeah

03:51:18.160 --> 03:51:21.120
but but because you guys are able to successfully not do that

03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:24.160
I just want to question my own understanding of it

03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:24.640
you know

03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:25.120
like

03:51:25.120 --> 03:51:26.320
like why is that

03:51:26.320 --> 03:51:26.880
why is that

03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:30.240
like am I being very jealous for no reason

03:51:30.240 --> 03:51:33.760
like maybe you can maximize the number of intimate experiences

03:51:33.760 --> 03:51:36.480
if you just open up and let go of the jealousy essentially

03:51:36.480 --> 03:51:38.000
I think I feel like in Sweden

03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:38.960
and like in Scandinavia

03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:41.120
we're extremely just sexually open

03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:42.000
like in general

03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:44.080
we're not like super religious either

03:51:44.080 --> 03:51:45.680
we're very like relaxed

03:51:45.680 --> 03:51:48.080
we don't like we don't feel bad about ourselves

03:51:48.080 --> 03:51:49.840
like it's just like a different sort of thing

03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:51.840
and I would say like it's we're more progressive

03:51:51.840 --> 03:51:53.680
when it comes to feminism and stuff

03:51:53.680 --> 03:51:55.040
so it's more common

03:51:55.040 --> 03:51:56.960
they will meet women with a higher body count

03:51:56.960 --> 03:51:58.960
than like when I meet like American girls

03:51:58.960 --> 03:52:00.480
all of them I have like vaginisma

03:52:00.480 --> 03:52:02.480
like super suppressed like sexually and

03:52:03.200 --> 03:52:04.240
where did you just use

03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:06.240
they have like issues to like

03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:07.600
they can't relax during sex

03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:08.560
so it just hurts for them

03:52:08.560 --> 03:52:09.120
vaginismus

03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:09.680
so they get really nervous

03:52:09.680 --> 03:52:10.240
vaginismus

03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:11.040
is that what it's called yeah

03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:13.680
so like I meet so many girls

03:52:13.680 --> 03:52:15.760
that are having like a lot of issues

03:52:15.760 --> 03:52:16.640
with sex

03:52:16.640 --> 03:52:18.160
and they have like a very low body count

03:52:18.160 --> 03:52:19.760
because they just can't relax

03:52:19.760 --> 03:52:21.200
or they yeah

03:52:21.200 --> 03:52:21.760
and it's probably

03:52:21.760 --> 03:52:23.920
and usually they come from like a very religious background

03:52:24.560 --> 03:52:25.680
so they have just been told

03:52:25.680 --> 03:52:26.720
like you cannot wear that

03:52:26.720 --> 03:52:27.840
you cannot be like that

03:52:27.840 --> 03:52:29.280
you can't like you know

03:52:29.280 --> 03:52:31.200
and like where I grew up

03:52:31.200 --> 03:52:32.160
it wasn't like that at all

03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:34.160
but you see it as more like a casual thing

03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:36.560
so then you can just maximize

03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:39.760
the awesomeness of the experience

03:52:39.760 --> 03:52:41.360
yeah I guess I don't have trouble with it

03:52:41.360 --> 03:52:41.840
exactly

03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:43.600
I think the important thing I think

03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:44.560
for everybody to realize

03:52:44.560 --> 03:52:46.640
is there's always pros and cons to everything

03:52:46.640 --> 03:52:48.640
like my lifestyle like

03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:50.080
obviously I get to have a lot of fun experiences

03:52:50.080 --> 03:52:51.120
that's like a huge pro

03:52:51.120 --> 03:52:52.080
and that's super cool

03:52:52.080 --> 03:52:53.600
and if you're like a more monogamy

03:52:53.600 --> 03:52:54.160
brain person

03:52:54.160 --> 03:52:55.600
you're not going to get those experiences

03:52:55.600 --> 03:52:57.200
but if you're a monogamy brain person

03:52:57.200 --> 03:52:58.400
like when you're sharing that special

03:52:58.400 --> 03:52:59.680
woman at home with somebody else

03:52:59.680 --> 03:53:01.840
like that moment could be really really really special

03:53:01.840 --> 03:53:03.840
because now it's the thing that you're showing yourself

03:53:03.840 --> 03:53:05.120
and open yourself up to another person

03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:06.640
and they're only trusting you to do that

03:53:06.640 --> 03:53:07.840
and that's like a really special thing

03:53:07.840 --> 03:53:09.840
that only the two of you are showing with each other

03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:11.760
so I mean like there's always like pros and cons to everything

03:53:11.760 --> 03:53:13.440
like I think we both would say like

03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:15.520
like doing an open relationship is probably not

03:53:15.520 --> 03:53:16.960
like we would not recommend it

03:53:17.520 --> 03:53:18.800
yeah I don't think we would no

03:53:19.920 --> 03:53:22.160
yeah I recently fasted for three days

03:53:22.160 --> 03:53:24.320
and I ate a chicken breast at the end of that

03:53:24.320 --> 03:53:26.800
and it was like the most delicious food I've ever eaten

03:53:27.920 --> 03:53:29.600
so like there's some aspect of fasting

03:53:29.600 --> 03:53:31.280
and scarcity and so on that

03:53:31.280 --> 03:53:33.600
like you have to figure out what for your own psyche

03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:34.400
what works the best

03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:35.920
it's good to be a little bored or like

03:53:35.920 --> 03:53:37.920
not do something or like work

03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:39.360
because you can just enjoy the time

03:53:39.360 --> 03:53:40.880
when you're doing something really fun

03:53:40.880 --> 03:53:42.880
it's more fun otherwise you're just going to get numb

03:53:42.880 --> 03:53:44.080
in general with everything

03:53:44.080 --> 03:53:44.720
yeah

03:53:44.720 --> 03:53:46.640
yeah I personally just never get bored

03:53:46.640 --> 03:53:48.960
like I guess the the boring thing is exciting to me

03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:50.880
the just like

03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:53.920
you're like me because you say everything I like is boring

03:53:54.800 --> 03:53:56.880
I gotta ask you we talked about misogyny

03:53:56.880 --> 03:53:59.120
in the he's trying to battle it out on the internet

03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:02.880
what's your what's your sense as a woman

03:54:03.680 --> 03:54:06.160
about the level of misogyny on the internet

03:54:06.160 --> 03:54:07.920
in the streaming community and how to fight it

03:54:08.880 --> 03:54:12.080
for me because I get I guess I get it every single day

03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:14.240
somehow like because I haven't online

03:54:14.240 --> 03:54:16.560
like I have a chat that goes that's live right

03:54:16.560 --> 03:54:18.960
and but I have like mods moderating that all the time

03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:20.480
so I don't really need to see much of it

03:54:20.480 --> 03:54:22.000
I think it's just pretty annoying

03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:24.720
because you get to like see it all the time

03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:27.520
so it's become like background noise

03:54:28.240 --> 03:54:31.840
yeah a little bit and it's like the same commons over and over again

03:54:31.840 --> 03:54:34.880
but it's usually for me I don't personally care that much

03:54:34.880 --> 03:54:36.080
I understand that other people do

03:54:36.080 --> 03:54:37.760
especially when it comes into like

03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:39.440
when there's like a lot of sexism and stuff

03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:43.360
and when there's a lot of like men not taking women seriously

03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:44.480
like I definitely get that

03:54:44.480 --> 03:54:46.400
and I used to get that even more like a few years ago

03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:48.240
with my accent and everything

03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:50.320
and like I used to be blonde as well like a few months ago

03:54:50.320 --> 03:54:52.640
so I feel like people wouldn't take me seriously because of that

03:54:53.280 --> 03:54:54.640
that's a bit annoying

03:54:54.640 --> 03:54:57.760
but I feel like it's pretty easy to like see through

03:54:57.760 --> 03:54:58.960
when someone acts that way

03:54:58.960 --> 03:55:00.560
and for me personally I don't really care

03:55:00.560 --> 03:55:03.600
but it's a bit annoying like being online

03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:05.280
and like getting stuff every single day

03:55:05.840 --> 03:55:07.600
it would say like the probably the worst thing is

03:55:08.480 --> 03:55:11.440
when you feel like you put in a lot of effort into some sort of work

03:55:12.160 --> 03:55:13.520
everyone is just going to say

03:55:13.520 --> 03:55:16.240
you just got that because you're a woman and you're attractive

03:55:16.240 --> 03:55:18.720
and that's that's probably like the worst thing

03:55:18.720 --> 03:55:20.400
is there a way to fight that you think

03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:21.360
yeah I don't think you can

03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:22.800
I think it just comes up all the time

03:55:23.680 --> 03:55:24.800
it is what it is I guess

03:55:24.800 --> 03:55:26.240
you're just gonna keep doing whatever you do

03:55:26.240 --> 03:55:28.800
and like not let it like emotionally control you somehow

03:55:28.800 --> 03:55:30.880
I think having more women in those spaces is always good

03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:31.680
it's probably good yeah

03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:33.760
like a lot of the guys you can tell online that they don't ever

03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:35.360
don't bring on the worst ones then

03:55:35.360 --> 03:55:36.320
see she's being this

03:55:36.320 --> 03:55:37.600
did you see she just did it

03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:38.720
she did the misogyny thing

03:55:39.520 --> 03:55:40.720
by having some bad women on

03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:42.320
she's saying all women see you

03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:44.000
well you you know it's true

03:55:45.280 --> 03:55:46.000
right

03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:47.520
see but I just agree with you

03:55:47.520 --> 03:55:50.320
and I'm older than both of you and therefore wiser right

03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:50.880
so

03:55:50.880 --> 03:55:52.000
well combined we're older than you

03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:52.720
I think we're wonderful

03:55:53.520 --> 03:55:54.960
we're one fully matronomy

03:55:54.960 --> 03:55:56.160
yeah we've got combined age

03:55:57.280 --> 03:55:58.720
or it could be it could be the same thing

03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:00.240
it was like also the age thing

03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:01.200
and like the woman thing

03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:02.640
a lot of people think that I'm just copying

03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:04.000
every single thing that he says

03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:05.280
which I think is a bit annoying as well

03:56:05.280 --> 03:56:06.400
so I can never really like

03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:07.600
a sonic user of that one

03:56:07.600 --> 03:56:09.120
yeah which has been annoying

03:56:09.120 --> 03:56:09.680
so much you know

03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:11.840
it was about the defunding police

03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:12.880
like my dad is a cop

03:56:12.880 --> 03:56:16.160
friendship camaraderie and love and respect

03:56:16.160 --> 03:56:19.280
which you both have had for a time

03:56:19.280 --> 03:56:21.360
and have lost and I would like you to regain it

03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:23.120
let's try to increase

03:56:23.120 --> 03:56:25.040
not decrease the amount of love in this space

03:56:25.040 --> 03:56:26.000
what do you think about

03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:27.360
some of the harshness of this

03:56:27.360 --> 03:56:29.120
of his language which we talked about

03:56:30.480 --> 03:56:31.840
our word in the past

03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:32.960
when you used n word

03:56:33.760 --> 03:56:34.720
all of that kind of stuff

03:56:34.720 --> 03:56:36.000
when he what he used to do

03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:36.320
I mean

03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:38.000
no like what do you think about it

03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:39.200
like do you give him advice

03:56:39.200 --> 03:56:41.200
to not speak a certain way

03:56:41.200 --> 03:56:42.960
no like a little more civility

03:56:42.960 --> 03:56:44.880
I'm just trying to get a second opinion on this

03:56:44.880 --> 03:56:45.680
second opinion about

03:56:45.680 --> 03:56:47.120
nor many people not internet people

03:56:47.120 --> 03:56:48.720
are way more extreme than

03:56:48.720 --> 03:56:49.520
yeah

03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:50.560
she's way more extreme

03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:52.000
no that's not true

03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:53.840
okay so okay so here's thing for me okay

03:56:54.400 --> 03:56:57.040
I was not online until three years ago

03:56:57.040 --> 03:56:57.600
at all

03:56:57.600 --> 03:56:58.880
like I would watch youtube

03:56:58.880 --> 03:57:00.480
that's pretty much all I would do

03:57:00.480 --> 03:57:01.680
I wouldn't do anything else

03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:02.720
really I didn't

03:57:02.720 --> 03:57:04.080
grew up playing video games or anything

03:57:04.640 --> 03:57:06.240
so I'm like extremely new to everything

03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:10.240
so when I came into this world

03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:12.640
and I started seeing clips from him in the past

03:57:12.640 --> 03:57:14.320
I don't think I really had much of an opinion

03:57:14.320 --> 03:57:15.360
because it just sounded like

03:57:15.360 --> 03:57:17.200
it was just a different like words that we were using

03:57:17.200 --> 03:57:18.480
but it didn't mean anything

03:57:18.480 --> 03:57:19.120
that's what it feels like

03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:19.920
it was just like

03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:21.520
if you're saying the R word

03:57:21.520 --> 03:57:23.120
it's because you just want to call someone stupid

03:57:23.120 --> 03:57:24.960
but you want to like do it a little bit more

03:57:24.960 --> 03:57:26.080
like but it's not like

03:57:26.080 --> 03:57:27.200
it didn't feel like it was like a

03:57:27.840 --> 03:57:28.960
it's not like racist more like

03:57:28.960 --> 03:57:29.600
yeah I'm not

03:57:29.600 --> 03:57:30.400
you know it's not

03:57:30.400 --> 03:57:32.000
agreement on this side here right

03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:34.400
so like if he was saying the F word

03:57:34.400 --> 03:57:36.640
because it was just like a word to like

03:57:36.640 --> 03:57:37.680
insult someone

03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:39.520
and he was like I don't think he was ever

03:57:39.520 --> 03:57:41.040
I don't think you were ever homophobic

03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:42.080
back in the day or anything like that

03:57:42.080 --> 03:57:43.680
but I think it was just like a way

03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:45.840
to express yourself maybe back then

03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:46.880
I don't know I didn't do it

03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:48.160
there's no videos of me or anything

03:57:48.160 --> 03:57:49.440
because I wasn't even online back then

03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:50.880
yeah so my case was

03:57:50.880 --> 03:57:52.800
I definitely don't think

03:57:52.800 --> 03:57:54.800
Stephen is homophobic or racer

03:57:54.800 --> 03:57:55.680
any of those obviously

03:57:55.680 --> 03:57:56.400
so the

03:57:56.400 --> 03:57:57.520
there's a good heart there

03:57:58.160 --> 03:57:59.200
and a good mind

03:57:59.200 --> 03:58:00.160
I was just saying

03:58:00.160 --> 03:58:01.200
he just likes being mean

03:58:02.080 --> 03:58:03.120
well there is some

03:58:03.120 --> 03:58:04.160
you lose yourself

03:58:04.160 --> 03:58:05.760
and forget the bigger picture that

03:58:06.320 --> 03:58:07.280
he's pushing for

03:58:07.920 --> 03:58:09.680
more effective discourse on the internet

03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:11.280
he's like an inspiration to a lot of people

03:58:11.280 --> 03:58:12.000
especially now

03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:14.160
of like how you can use effective

03:58:14.160 --> 03:58:16.160
conversation to make for a better world

03:58:16.160 --> 03:58:18.080
to derive a variety of glass people

03:58:18.080 --> 03:58:20.320
and so on and then you lose some of that power

03:58:21.040 --> 03:58:22.320
by losing yourself

03:58:23.120 --> 03:58:24.880
in like the language

03:58:24.880 --> 03:58:26.400
just more language of emotion

03:58:26.400 --> 03:58:28.400
versus effective communication

03:58:28.400 --> 03:58:28.800
I would say

03:58:28.800 --> 03:58:30.400
but it's a gray area

03:58:30.400 --> 03:58:31.200
I would say like something

03:58:31.200 --> 03:58:32.960
that is probably recently done in that case

03:58:32.960 --> 03:58:34.800
because it's been joking about women a lot

03:58:35.520 --> 03:58:36.880
like it's women's fault they're bad

03:58:36.880 --> 03:58:38.640
like it's just it's been like

03:58:38.640 --> 03:58:40.240
a lot of jokes when it comes to misogyny

03:58:40.240 --> 03:58:41.600
I guess in your community

03:58:41.600 --> 03:58:42.720
and I think it's actually

03:58:42.720 --> 03:58:44.000
turned people a little bit that way

03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:45.280
that's why we've done the recent

03:58:45.280 --> 03:58:45.440
misogyny

03:58:45.440 --> 03:58:47.440
yes so that I guess that's actually

03:58:47.440 --> 03:58:49.280
true because I don't think it was pretty

03:58:49.280 --> 03:58:50.800
I don't think it was clear enough

03:58:50.800 --> 03:58:51.760
I don't think it actually was

03:58:51.760 --> 03:58:53.200
I think you did that mistake

03:58:54.400 --> 03:58:55.920
but I think back then I was even saying

03:58:55.920 --> 03:58:57.120
like hey you should probably not

03:58:57.120 --> 03:58:59.200
like you probably should not do that

03:59:00.080 --> 03:59:01.440
because it actually is pretty hard for me

03:59:01.440 --> 03:59:02.960
because whenever I come into his community

03:59:02.960 --> 03:59:04.000
like his chat

03:59:04.000 --> 03:59:04.960
people are just going to spam

03:59:04.960 --> 03:59:05.840
it's like a woman moment

03:59:05.840 --> 03:59:07.440
it's a woman moment whenever I say something

03:59:07.440 --> 03:59:08.400
and it's kind of like

03:59:08.400 --> 03:59:10.400
yeah it's getting pretty annoying as I said

03:59:10.400 --> 03:59:12.320
it's just annoying when you see it every single day

03:59:13.200 --> 03:59:13.600
yeah

03:59:13.600 --> 03:59:14.080
there you go

03:59:14.640 --> 03:59:16.240
wisdom from somebody younger than you

03:59:16.960 --> 03:59:17.760
wisdom can come from

03:59:18.400 --> 03:59:19.200
all kind of people

03:59:19.200 --> 03:59:19.840
yeah of course

03:59:19.840 --> 03:59:21.440
just sometimes at very limited quantities

03:59:21.440 --> 03:59:22.240
depends on the age

03:59:23.600 --> 03:59:25.120
and learn something from anybody

03:59:25.120 --> 03:59:27.360
what advice would you give to young people

03:59:27.360 --> 03:59:28.160
the both of you

03:59:29.280 --> 03:59:31.440
that you have both audiences

03:59:31.440 --> 03:59:32.800
where young people look up to you

03:59:33.360 --> 03:59:34.080
in general

03:59:34.080 --> 03:59:36.320
if you were to give advice to somebody in high school

03:59:36.320 --> 03:59:37.360
like how to

03:59:38.720 --> 03:59:40.480
create a life that can be proud of

03:59:40.480 --> 03:59:41.120
what would you say

03:59:42.720 --> 03:59:44.800
the most important thing that I've learned

03:59:44.880 --> 03:59:47.120
is to view people as different

03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:48.560
and not better or worse

03:59:48.560 --> 03:59:49.680
and when you view people as different

03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:50.880
instead of better or worse

03:59:50.880 --> 03:59:52.800
you learn that there's almost something

03:59:52.800 --> 03:59:53.920
that you can learn from anybody

03:59:54.640 --> 03:59:55.760
like be open and empathetic

03:59:55.760 --> 03:59:57.440
towards other people's experiences

03:59:57.440 --> 03:59:59.920
nobody does anything by random choice

03:59:59.920 --> 04:00:02.240
like there's always reasons why people act the way they do

04:00:02.240 --> 04:00:04.000
and as long as you're willing to kind of like

04:00:04.000 --> 04:00:07.200
be open and receptive to the lived experiences of other people

04:00:07.200 --> 04:00:08.960
you're going to be able to gather information

04:00:08.960 --> 04:00:11.360
and create like a more cohesive and better view of the world

04:00:11.360 --> 04:00:12.400
than any of your peers will

04:00:13.360 --> 04:00:16.080
Do you have any kind of advice you can give to young folks?

04:00:16.080 --> 04:00:18.080
I feel like something that I see

04:00:18.080 --> 04:00:19.520
especially in America a lot

04:00:19.520 --> 04:00:21.120
is that a lot of people

04:00:21.120 --> 04:00:23.440
kind of get told what to do early on

04:00:23.440 --> 04:00:24.480
like in high school

04:00:24.480 --> 04:00:25.920
they're supposed to become this thing

04:00:26.800 --> 04:00:27.760
like education wise

04:00:27.760 --> 04:00:29.360
like they're supposed to like become a doctor

04:00:29.360 --> 04:00:30.480
or this thing or whatever

04:00:30.480 --> 04:00:31.840
and then they kind of just like give up on things

04:00:31.840 --> 04:00:33.280
that they're actually passionate about

04:00:33.280 --> 04:00:35.760
so I think a lot of teenagers get really confused

04:00:35.760 --> 04:00:37.120
they get an education

04:00:37.120 --> 04:00:38.240
and then they get that job

04:00:38.240 --> 04:00:39.200
and they hate everything

04:00:39.200 --> 04:00:40.080
and they think that

04:00:40.640 --> 04:00:42.080
when they're reaching the job

04:00:42.160 --> 04:00:43.280
when they're reaching like the journey

04:00:43.280 --> 04:00:44.160
they're going to get happy

04:00:44.160 --> 04:00:45.600
that's like where the happiness is going to be

04:00:45.600 --> 04:00:47.440
but then when they get to there

04:00:47.440 --> 04:00:48.640
they just hate everything

04:00:48.640 --> 04:00:50.400
and then they become really depressed

04:00:50.400 --> 04:00:51.840
and I've seen this so much

04:00:51.840 --> 04:00:53.440
like I see this all the time

04:00:53.440 --> 04:00:56.320
and it's pretty sad to me to see

04:00:56.320 --> 04:00:58.160
so many people that are just wasting time

04:00:58.160 --> 04:01:00.000
and then they just get really confused

04:01:00.000 --> 04:01:01.680
and I don't know

04:01:01.680 --> 04:01:03.200
it's the same thing with relationships too

04:01:03.200 --> 04:01:04.960
no one really knows what they want anymore

04:01:04.960 --> 04:01:07.040
I feel like everyone is just kind of doing whatever

04:01:07.040 --> 04:01:07.920
like society is saying

04:01:07.920 --> 04:01:08.720
or the parents are saying

04:01:08.720 --> 04:01:09.600
or their friends are saying

04:01:10.560 --> 04:01:12.960
and they're never really doing anything

04:01:12.960 --> 04:01:14.480
that's super meaningful anymore

04:01:14.480 --> 04:01:16.000
and like they don't

04:01:16.000 --> 04:01:16.960
so what I would say is

04:01:16.960 --> 04:01:18.160
like try to find something

04:01:18.160 --> 04:01:19.840
that is important to you

04:01:19.840 --> 04:01:20.880
it could be anything really

04:01:20.880 --> 04:01:22.560
like some sort of passion

04:01:22.560 --> 04:01:23.840
maybe like your friends

04:01:23.840 --> 04:01:25.920
maybe like what matters to you

04:01:25.920 --> 04:01:27.360
like figuring those things out

04:01:27.360 --> 04:01:28.400
I think is really important

04:01:28.400 --> 04:01:30.240
and that comes from being able to listen to

04:01:30.240 --> 04:01:31.360
like some inner voice

04:01:31.360 --> 04:01:32.640
so it's not gonna come from elsewhere

04:01:32.640 --> 04:01:34.000
it's really hard because

04:01:34.000 --> 04:01:34.960
you're living the life

04:01:34.960 --> 04:01:36.480
and like there's things happening around you

04:01:36.480 --> 04:01:37.360
and people tell you what to do

04:01:37.360 --> 04:01:39.040
and what not to do and all you know

04:01:39.040 --> 04:01:40.640
no one really has like their own opinions

04:01:40.640 --> 04:01:41.600
everyone is just kind of like

04:01:42.320 --> 04:01:44.320
listening to the cooler thing

04:01:44.320 --> 04:01:45.280
or you know

04:01:45.280 --> 04:01:46.080
except Steven

04:01:46.080 --> 04:01:47.440
he seems to stand on his own

04:01:47.440 --> 04:01:47.920
travel

04:01:47.920 --> 04:01:48.400
if we think

04:01:48.400 --> 04:01:49.280
yeah I'd say so

04:01:49.280 --> 04:01:49.600
and like

04:01:49.600 --> 04:01:50.240
on hashtag

04:01:50.240 --> 04:01:51.360
like something I realized too

04:01:51.360 --> 04:01:52.880
like because we just went to TwitchCon

04:01:52.880 --> 04:01:54.640
and we were talking to a lot of streamers

04:01:54.640 --> 04:01:55.040
what was that

04:01:56.000 --> 04:01:56.720
it was interesting

04:01:56.720 --> 04:01:57.840
I thought it was interesting

04:01:57.840 --> 04:02:00.960
because the few people that I feel like I

04:02:00.960 --> 04:02:01.840
that seem really cool

04:02:01.840 --> 04:02:04.240
and that I look up to like in the streaming world

04:02:04.240 --> 04:02:05.680
all of them wants to quit streaming

04:02:06.320 --> 04:02:07.280
all of them wants to do it

04:02:07.280 --> 04:02:07.760
no one wants

04:02:07.760 --> 04:02:08.960
like no one likes it

04:02:08.960 --> 04:02:10.640
and they're so successful

04:02:10.640 --> 04:02:13.200
like they are around successful people

04:02:13.200 --> 04:02:15.280
they they're working every single day

04:02:15.280 --> 04:02:15.840
they're working hard

04:02:15.840 --> 04:02:17.520
they're making so much money

04:02:17.520 --> 04:02:19.520
and everyone is just complaining

04:02:19.520 --> 04:02:20.960
and like they're complaining about

04:02:22.240 --> 04:02:25.040
like not being able to see their partner

04:02:25.040 --> 04:02:25.760
or you know

04:02:25.760 --> 04:02:27.200
because they need to live somewhere else

04:02:27.200 --> 04:02:28.880
because I see these things

04:02:28.880 --> 04:02:30.720
and they seem extremely unhappy

04:02:30.720 --> 04:02:33.040
and but it's so hard for them to just cut

04:02:33.040 --> 04:02:35.040
all this successful stuff off

04:02:35.040 --> 04:02:36.320
because that's like what you

04:02:36.320 --> 04:02:37.840
you know learn to do

04:02:38.480 --> 04:02:40.400
and that's like supposed to be like your happiness

04:02:40.400 --> 04:02:40.880
but it isn't

04:02:40.880 --> 04:02:42.240
everyone is really unhappy

04:02:42.240 --> 04:02:43.520
yeah there's something about

04:02:43.520 --> 04:02:44.880
maybe streaming is different

04:02:44.880 --> 04:02:46.320
but YouTube folks too

04:02:46.320 --> 04:02:47.680
I've interacted with a few and

04:02:49.200 --> 04:02:50.400
even in podcasting space

04:02:50.960 --> 04:02:52.960
people become obsessed about the views

04:02:52.960 --> 04:02:53.520
and numbers

04:02:53.520 --> 04:02:55.040
and subscribers and stuff like that

04:02:56.400 --> 04:02:57.280
so I turn

04:02:57.280 --> 04:02:58.960
I never talk about that

04:02:58.960 --> 04:03:00.480
I don't pay attention to that

04:03:01.920 --> 04:03:04.720
I feel like that's a drug that destroys

04:03:05.520 --> 04:03:06.160
your mind

04:03:06.880 --> 04:03:08.400
your your mind is an artist

04:03:08.400 --> 04:03:09.600
ability to create

04:03:09.600 --> 04:03:10.880
surely unique things

04:03:11.920 --> 04:03:12.960
also your mind

04:03:12.960 --> 04:03:13.920
in terms of the anxiety

04:03:13.920 --> 04:03:15.280
the ups and downs of the

04:03:16.640 --> 04:03:17.760
attention mechanism

04:03:18.800 --> 04:03:19.680
and then also being

04:03:20.240 --> 04:03:22.560
just if something that you make

04:03:22.560 --> 04:03:23.440
is not popular

04:03:23.440 --> 04:03:24.880
but it meant a lot to you

04:03:24.880 --> 04:03:26.000
you will think of it less

04:03:26.800 --> 04:03:28.000
because it's not popular

04:03:28.000 --> 04:03:29.520
yeah that's a really dangerous thing

04:03:29.520 --> 04:03:31.440
and because everyone around you

04:03:31.440 --> 04:03:32.640
is reinforcing

04:03:32.640 --> 04:03:34.080
like I'll get messages like

04:03:34.720 --> 04:03:35.520
wow

04:03:35.520 --> 04:03:37.360
this thing got this many views

04:03:37.360 --> 04:03:37.920
or something

04:03:38.480 --> 04:03:39.600
great job

04:03:39.600 --> 04:03:40.880
it's like no

04:03:40.880 --> 04:03:41.920
you don't get it

04:03:41.920 --> 04:03:42.640
like that's not

04:03:42.640 --> 04:03:43.120
that's not

04:03:44.080 --> 04:03:45.520
everyone is enforcing this

04:03:45.520 --> 04:03:46.800
like this language

04:03:46.800 --> 04:03:48.960
of views and likes and so on

04:03:48.960 --> 04:03:49.760
and it's

04:03:49.760 --> 04:03:50.960
it's correlated of course

04:03:50.960 --> 04:03:52.240
because truly impactful things

04:03:52.240 --> 04:03:53.360
will get a lot of attention

04:03:53.920 --> 04:03:54.240
often

04:03:55.040 --> 04:03:55.280
but

04:03:56.000 --> 04:03:56.560
it's not

04:03:57.280 --> 04:03:59.200
on the individual local scale

04:03:59.200 --> 04:04:00.480
like temporarily is

04:04:01.760 --> 04:04:02.400
it's uh

04:04:02.400 --> 04:04:03.600
it can really fuck with your mind

04:04:03.600 --> 04:04:04.800
and I see that

04:04:04.880 --> 04:04:05.600
in the creators

04:04:05.600 --> 04:04:06.080
they become

04:04:07.920 --> 04:04:09.600
addicts to the algorithm

04:04:09.600 --> 04:04:10.800
lost in chasing views

04:04:10.800 --> 04:04:11.840
like we know friends that

04:04:11.840 --> 04:04:12.080
yes

04:04:12.080 --> 04:04:12.800
we know cool people

04:04:12.800 --> 04:04:13.760
and then they start streaming

04:04:13.760 --> 04:04:14.480
and eventually they got

04:04:14.480 --> 04:04:16.000
they're like chasing the dragon of like

04:04:16.800 --> 04:04:17.760
and they change like

04:04:17.760 --> 04:04:18.400
they're

04:04:18.400 --> 04:04:18.880
yeah

04:04:18.880 --> 04:04:19.200
it's like

04:04:21.200 --> 04:04:22.000
this is something I've always said

04:04:22.000 --> 04:04:22.480
that like

04:04:22.480 --> 04:04:23.920
one of the biggest blessings

04:04:23.920 --> 04:04:25.280
and biggest curses of humanity

04:04:25.280 --> 04:04:26.960
is we are very good at acclimating

04:04:26.960 --> 04:04:28.240
like you can become paralyzed

04:04:28.240 --> 04:04:29.200
you can have all sorts of horrible

04:04:29.200 --> 04:04:29.680
things happen to you

04:04:29.680 --> 04:04:30.400
and you'll get used to it

04:04:30.400 --> 04:04:31.040
and you'll be okay

04:04:31.040 --> 04:04:32.400
you're gonna have like a good baseline

04:04:32.400 --> 04:04:33.440
but it works the other way too

04:04:33.440 --> 04:04:34.400
and that you can get more and more

04:04:35.200 --> 04:04:36.080
and you acclimate to it

04:04:36.080 --> 04:04:37.200
almost immediately

04:04:37.200 --> 04:04:37.840
there's like

04:04:37.840 --> 04:04:38.880
this is a phenomenon that

04:04:38.880 --> 04:04:40.000
I bet it happens in the youtube world

04:04:40.000 --> 04:04:41.200
but I know it happens in the streaming world

04:04:41.200 --> 04:04:42.400
where you're streaming

04:04:42.400 --> 04:04:44.160
1,000 viewers every day

04:04:44.160 --> 04:04:44.960
huge event happens

04:04:44.960 --> 04:04:45.760
and you blow up

04:04:45.760 --> 04:04:47.440
and you got like 15,000 viewers

04:04:47.440 --> 04:04:48.400
for a day or two

04:04:48.400 --> 04:04:49.520
and then it starts to go down

04:04:49.520 --> 04:04:50.720
and down and down and down and down

04:04:50.720 --> 04:04:52.400
and then after all the drama started off

04:04:52.400 --> 04:04:53.120
you're at like

04:04:53.120 --> 04:04:54.800
3,000 concurrent viewers

04:04:54.800 --> 04:04:55.920
now in the macro

04:04:55.920 --> 04:04:57.520
you went from 1,000 to 3,000

04:04:57.520 --> 04:04:58.560
that feels awesome

04:04:58.560 --> 04:04:59.600
but you actually feel like

04:04:59.600 --> 04:05:00.240
shit the whole time

04:05:00.240 --> 04:05:00.880
because you're remembering

04:05:00.880 --> 04:05:02.160
when you had 10 or 15,000

04:05:02.160 --> 04:05:03.680
and now everything feels horrible

04:05:03.680 --> 04:05:05.280
and you'll see people climb over time

04:05:05.280 --> 04:05:05.680
and like

04:05:05.680 --> 04:05:05.920
fuck

04:05:05.920 --> 04:05:07.120
like but whatever that one huge stream

04:05:07.120 --> 04:05:07.360
I had like

04:05:07.360 --> 04:05:08.640
I've never like been able to

04:05:08.640 --> 04:05:09.040
and it's like

04:05:09.040 --> 04:05:09.920
dude you're doing great

04:05:09.920 --> 04:05:10.640
what's yeah

04:05:10.640 --> 04:05:11.520
that happens a lot

04:05:11.520 --> 04:05:12.640
there's so many people that we know

04:05:12.640 --> 04:05:14.160
that we find super super cool

04:05:14.160 --> 04:05:15.520
they're passionate about things

04:05:15.520 --> 04:05:17.120
they have so much interest

04:05:17.120 --> 04:05:18.080
and then they just get like

04:05:18.080 --> 04:05:19.440
so addicted to these numbers

04:05:19.440 --> 04:05:20.240
and like all the

04:05:20.800 --> 04:05:21.760
everything is just ruined

04:05:21.760 --> 04:05:22.960
like all the cool things about them

04:05:22.960 --> 04:05:23.280
is ruined

04:05:23.280 --> 04:05:24.480
because they stop doing the things

04:05:24.480 --> 04:05:25.360
that they actually like

04:05:26.320 --> 04:05:27.120
to do something else

04:05:27.120 --> 04:05:28.000
that gives them more viewers

04:05:28.000 --> 04:05:28.720
and more money

04:05:28.720 --> 04:05:30.560
and it's really sad to see

04:05:30.560 --> 04:05:31.200
you know that

04:05:31.200 --> 04:05:32.640
that temporary sacrifice

04:05:32.640 --> 04:05:35.600
that seems temporary is

04:05:35.600 --> 04:05:36.560
that it

04:05:36.560 --> 04:05:37.600
it actually destroys you

04:05:37.600 --> 04:05:38.480
like for one time

04:05:38.480 --> 04:05:39.360
making a choice

04:05:39.360 --> 04:05:41.360
because I come across those choices often

04:05:41.360 --> 04:05:42.480
like I can do this

04:05:42.480 --> 04:05:43.680
you can kind of know

04:05:43.680 --> 04:05:45.360
what's going to be popular and not

04:05:46.240 --> 04:05:47.680
and you have to ask yourself the question

04:05:47.680 --> 04:05:49.040
like is this going to sacrifice

04:05:49.680 --> 04:05:51.360
because if people are sacrificing

04:05:51.360 --> 04:05:53.200
like intimate relationships

04:05:53.200 --> 04:05:54.480
they're sacrificing time

04:05:54.480 --> 04:05:55.120
with their family

04:05:55.120 --> 04:05:56.000
they're like

04:05:56.000 --> 04:05:56.880
sacrificing time

04:05:56.880 --> 04:05:57.840
with the things that they

04:05:57.840 --> 04:05:58.480
feel good about

04:05:58.480 --> 04:05:59.200
and that they like

04:06:00.160 --> 04:06:01.760
and that's something I kind of

04:06:01.760 --> 04:06:02.960
realized last year

04:06:02.960 --> 04:06:04.320
because I was working so much

04:06:04.320 --> 04:06:05.120
and I was just grinding

04:06:05.120 --> 04:06:05.840
and grinding and grinding

04:06:05.840 --> 04:06:07.200
because it was kind of new for me

04:06:07.200 --> 04:06:08.960
and then new years came by

04:06:08.960 --> 04:06:09.440
and I was like

04:06:09.440 --> 04:06:10.560
wait what did I even do

04:06:10.560 --> 04:06:11.760
like the entire year

04:06:11.760 --> 04:06:13.680
like I traveled to a bunch of places

04:06:13.680 --> 04:06:14.480
but nothing actually

04:06:14.480 --> 04:06:15.440
really meant anything to me

04:06:15.440 --> 04:06:16.400
because I felt like I was just

04:06:16.400 --> 04:06:17.440
working the entire time

04:06:17.440 --> 04:06:18.400
I felt like I was just numb

04:06:18.400 --> 04:06:18.880
through the

04:06:18.880 --> 04:06:19.600
through the entire year

04:06:19.600 --> 04:06:20.560
and I was really scary

04:06:22.640 --> 04:06:23.760
like I rented a

04:06:24.320 --> 04:06:25.520
like a super pretty house

04:06:25.520 --> 04:06:26.320
like for a week

04:06:26.320 --> 04:06:27.600
with my dad and my sister

04:06:27.600 --> 04:06:29.440
because I wanted to spend time with them

04:06:29.440 --> 04:06:30.800
but the entire time

04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:32.400
I was just streaming

04:06:32.400 --> 04:06:33.520
and I actually

04:06:33.520 --> 04:06:34.640
didn't ever like calm down

04:06:34.640 --> 04:06:35.360
and just like

04:06:35.360 --> 04:06:36.080
chill with them

04:06:36.080 --> 04:06:36.640
and I

04:06:36.640 --> 04:06:37.440
like that's like time

04:06:37.440 --> 04:06:38.640
I'll never get back

04:06:38.640 --> 04:06:39.040
I don't

04:06:39.040 --> 04:06:40.240
I don't give a shit about the money

04:06:40.240 --> 04:06:41.040
that I made that week

04:06:41.040 --> 04:06:42.240
but I lost the time

04:06:43.040 --> 04:06:43.920
and like

04:06:43.920 --> 04:06:45.360
that is really important to me

04:06:45.360 --> 04:06:45.760
and I

04:06:45.760 --> 04:06:47.200
yeah and a lot of people are doing that

04:06:47.760 --> 04:06:48.480
and I feel like

04:06:48.480 --> 04:06:48.960
as you said

04:06:48.960 --> 04:06:49.920
like you can definitely see that

04:06:49.920 --> 04:06:50.640
in like artists

04:06:51.280 --> 04:06:51.760
for sure

04:06:51.760 --> 04:06:52.240
I feel like

04:06:52.240 --> 04:06:53.440
if you look at like artists

04:06:53.440 --> 04:06:55.360
like back in the 60s or 70s

04:06:55.360 --> 04:06:56.400
I feel like things were just

04:06:56.400 --> 04:06:57.680
so much better back then

04:06:57.680 --> 04:06:58.240
and it feels like

04:06:58.240 --> 04:07:00.160
they were actually making music

04:07:00.240 --> 04:07:01.600
that meant something to them

04:07:01.600 --> 04:07:02.800
they were actually making art

04:07:03.360 --> 04:07:04.320
and I feel like today

04:07:04.320 --> 04:07:05.680
everything is just kind of like

04:07:05.680 --> 04:07:06.480
whatever is cool

04:07:06.480 --> 04:07:07.280
whatever sells

04:07:07.280 --> 04:07:08.000
whatever you know

04:07:08.000 --> 04:07:08.960
sounds in a certain way

04:07:08.960 --> 04:07:09.920
everything is kind of

04:07:09.920 --> 04:07:10.960
the same thing

04:07:10.960 --> 04:07:12.640
and everything that is very artistic

04:07:12.640 --> 04:07:13.360
and very cool

04:07:13.360 --> 04:07:15.040
is actually not that popular

04:07:15.040 --> 04:07:15.440
at all

04:07:16.080 --> 04:07:17.200
and that's kind of sad

04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:19.040
yeah of course there's now

04:07:19.040 --> 04:07:20.720
bigger mechanisms and platforms

04:07:20.720 --> 04:07:21.200
to spread

04:07:21.920 --> 04:07:22.480
stuff

04:07:22.480 --> 04:07:22.880
music

04:07:23.760 --> 04:07:25.600
so as long as you could be content

04:07:25.600 --> 04:07:27.120
with not being popular

04:07:27.120 --> 04:07:28.560
I think you can still create good art

04:07:28.560 --> 04:07:29.360
but not like

04:07:29.360 --> 04:07:30.560
when people get a little popular

04:07:30.560 --> 04:07:32.080
they get addicted to that so fast

04:07:32.080 --> 04:07:33.200
yeah it's weird

04:07:33.200 --> 04:07:33.680
yeah

04:07:33.680 --> 04:07:35.760
you have been somewhat good

04:07:35.760 --> 04:07:37.120
at least from my outside of perspective

04:07:37.680 --> 04:07:38.800
because I think you

04:07:39.600 --> 04:07:40.960
I can at least imagine

04:07:40.960 --> 04:07:41.760
you making choices

04:07:41.760 --> 04:07:43.520
that could make you more popular

04:07:43.520 --> 04:07:45.520
and you don't seem to make those choices

04:07:46.960 --> 04:07:48.080
sabotage my career

04:07:49.520 --> 04:07:50.640
but it is very intentional

04:07:50.640 --> 04:07:51.120
like you said

04:07:51.120 --> 04:07:52.160
like and I made that choice

04:07:52.160 --> 04:07:54.400
at every single stage of my life

04:07:54.400 --> 04:07:55.200
one is because

04:07:55.200 --> 04:07:55.920
from the perspective

04:07:55.920 --> 04:07:56.720
of being a carpet cleaner

04:07:56.720 --> 04:07:57.840
my life is way better

04:07:57.840 --> 04:07:58.560
than that

04:07:58.560 --> 04:07:59.840
was or ever would have been

04:07:59.840 --> 04:08:01.440
so I'm already doing way better than I ever thought

04:08:01.440 --> 04:08:02.560
somebody like me ever could be

04:08:03.200 --> 04:08:04.320
but then two

04:08:04.320 --> 04:08:06.240
I super love my job

04:08:06.240 --> 04:08:07.120
every time I wake up

04:08:07.120 --> 04:08:08.720
every time I fly to a place to do a podcast

04:08:08.720 --> 04:08:09.840
every time I get to talk to really cool people

04:08:09.840 --> 04:08:11.280
like every single part of my job

04:08:11.280 --> 04:08:11.840
I super like

04:08:11.840 --> 04:08:12.880
if there's something I don't like

04:08:12.880 --> 04:08:13.520
I just cut it off

04:08:13.520 --> 04:08:14.080
because I don't care

04:08:14.080 --> 04:08:15.120
because I'm already making plenty of money

04:08:15.120 --> 04:08:15.920
doing what I do

04:08:15.920 --> 04:08:17.040
and why would I ever wake up

04:08:17.040 --> 04:08:18.080
and not like what I'm doing

04:08:18.080 --> 04:08:19.440
when I can't like what I'm doing

04:08:19.440 --> 04:08:20.480
how do you guys find

04:08:20.480 --> 04:08:21.200
through that

04:08:21.200 --> 04:08:21.680
given that

04:08:22.720 --> 04:08:23.520
you love it

04:08:23.520 --> 04:08:25.920
and sometimes maybe lose yourself in the drug of it

04:08:25.920 --> 04:08:27.520
how do you find

04:08:27.600 --> 04:08:28.720
like work-life balance

04:08:28.720 --> 04:08:30.080
together inside a relationship

04:08:30.800 --> 04:08:31.760
like time for each other

04:08:32.560 --> 04:08:33.520
I don't at all so

04:08:33.520 --> 04:08:34.880
I'm not a good person to ask

04:08:34.880 --> 04:08:35.760
what do you love more

04:08:36.320 --> 04:08:37.920
Mel or Faktor

04:08:38.960 --> 04:08:40.400
Faktor is a really good game

04:08:40.400 --> 04:08:41.680
that's like not a fair comparison

04:08:41.680 --> 04:08:42.320
okay you're talking about

04:08:42.320 --> 04:08:43.920
one of the best cleanest games

04:08:43.920 --> 04:08:45.600
best support ever made

04:08:45.600 --> 04:08:46.800
cleanest code base

04:08:46.800 --> 04:08:47.520
like this is

04:08:47.520 --> 04:08:48.640
I think it's Thanos brother

04:08:48.640 --> 04:08:50.400
yeah it's more Faktor time for me

04:08:51.920 --> 04:08:52.560
starting to understand

04:08:52.560 --> 04:08:53.760
where the massaging comes from

04:08:53.760 --> 04:08:54.160
by the way

04:08:54.720 --> 04:08:57.120
is Faktor a legit really good game

04:08:57.120 --> 04:08:57.840
yeah of course yeah

04:08:57.840 --> 04:08:58.320
I'm cool

04:08:58.320 --> 04:08:59.040
if you're like

04:08:59.040 --> 04:09:00.160
do you enjoy programming

04:09:00.800 --> 04:09:01.680
of course that's all I do

04:09:01.680 --> 04:09:02.960
that's all that's okay

04:09:02.960 --> 04:09:04.560
to me programming is

04:09:05.120 --> 04:09:06.080
is the game in itself

04:09:06.080 --> 04:09:07.760
that I enjoy probably more than anything else

04:09:07.760 --> 04:09:08.240
but yeah

04:09:08.240 --> 04:09:09.520
it's very much a game like that

04:09:09.520 --> 04:09:10.720
of like if you're into stuff like that

04:09:10.720 --> 04:09:12.240
like you can lose hundreds of hours

04:09:12.240 --> 04:09:13.760
like very quickly to

04:09:13.760 --> 04:09:14.880
like you have a problem

04:09:14.880 --> 04:09:16.160
and then you think of a solution

04:09:16.160 --> 04:09:17.040
and then you iterate on that

04:09:17.040 --> 04:09:18.080
over and over and over again

04:09:18.080 --> 04:09:19.120
in larger larger schemes

04:09:19.120 --> 04:09:20.320
sometimes you got to redesign stuff

04:09:20.320 --> 04:09:20.880
sometimes you got like

04:09:20.880 --> 04:09:22.000
it's a very much like that kind of game

04:09:22.000 --> 04:09:23.520
this year essentially building a factory

04:09:23.520 --> 04:09:24.800
like what on a foreign planet

04:09:24.800 --> 04:09:25.520
or something like that

04:09:25.520 --> 04:09:26.720
it's basically it's like

04:09:26.720 --> 04:09:27.920
a bunch of you're trying to automate

04:09:27.920 --> 04:09:28.720
different problems

04:09:28.720 --> 04:09:30.160
so that you can build bigger things

04:09:30.160 --> 04:09:31.600
so that you can automate bigger problems

04:09:31.600 --> 04:09:32.400
so you can build bigger things

04:09:32.400 --> 04:09:33.360
and automate bigger problems

04:09:33.360 --> 04:09:34.480
so it's more complicated

04:09:34.480 --> 04:09:36.240
than like a city building game

04:09:36.240 --> 04:09:37.600
like some city type of thing

04:09:38.160 --> 04:09:39.600
I wouldn't say it's more complicated

04:09:39.600 --> 04:09:40.960
it's more it's like

04:09:40.960 --> 04:09:43.040
Faktor is like a game of like logic

04:09:43.040 --> 04:09:44.560
like strictly like logic

04:09:44.560 --> 04:09:45.760
like it's almost like a building

04:09:45.760 --> 04:09:46.720
a circuit or something

04:09:46.720 --> 04:09:47.280
yes yeah

04:09:47.280 --> 04:09:48.320
there's like their circuitry

04:09:48.320 --> 04:09:49.280
and you've got your and orgs

04:09:49.280 --> 04:09:49.840
or against you

04:09:49.840 --> 04:09:50.800
like there's stuff like that

04:09:50.800 --> 04:09:51.520
it's very much like that

04:09:51.520 --> 04:09:53.120
like what are the enemies in the game

04:09:53.120 --> 04:09:54.240
like what they're like

04:09:54.240 --> 04:09:55.920
so I try to bite you

04:09:55.920 --> 04:09:57.440
and you can get guns and shoot and kill them

04:09:57.440 --> 04:09:59.440
but I saw there's like shooting going on

04:09:59.440 --> 04:09:59.680
yeah

04:09:59.680 --> 04:10:00.320
but that's like a mind

04:10:00.320 --> 04:10:01.040
it's just like another problem

04:10:01.040 --> 04:10:02.080
to solve in the game basically

04:10:02.080 --> 04:10:02.400
yeah

04:10:02.400 --> 04:10:02.960
okay

04:10:02.960 --> 04:10:03.680
all right

04:10:03.680 --> 04:10:04.720
see see what we did there

04:10:04.720 --> 04:10:06.320
we just started talking about the game

04:10:06.320 --> 04:10:07.520
as we're trying

04:10:07.520 --> 04:10:08.560
oh my god that's like

04:10:08.560 --> 04:10:09.040
like a game

04:10:09.040 --> 04:10:09.680
okay

04:10:09.680 --> 04:10:10.560
that's horrible

04:10:10.560 --> 04:10:11.840
anyway is there

04:10:11.840 --> 04:10:13.360
is that basically the struggle

04:10:13.360 --> 04:10:14.240
not stop struggle

04:10:14.240 --> 04:10:15.760
how to get human

04:10:16.880 --> 04:10:18.320
like intimate human time

04:10:19.200 --> 04:10:20.080
I feel like it was like that

04:10:20.080 --> 04:10:21.680
a little bit more in the past

04:10:21.680 --> 04:10:22.800
I feel like it's been better

04:10:23.760 --> 04:10:24.640
lately

04:10:24.720 --> 04:10:25.760
but I think it's because

04:10:26.480 --> 04:10:27.520
when we started dating

04:10:27.520 --> 04:10:28.560
I wasn't streaming

04:10:28.560 --> 04:10:29.840
and I kind of just like

04:10:29.840 --> 04:10:32.080
gave up like my trip in New Zealand

04:10:32.080 --> 04:10:33.120
I give up like

04:10:33.120 --> 04:10:35.440
like I left Sweden

04:10:35.440 --> 04:10:36.640
so I was just like

04:10:36.640 --> 04:10:37.600
in LA

04:10:37.600 --> 04:10:38.240
which I hate

04:10:38.240 --> 04:10:38.720
I hate LA

04:10:38.720 --> 04:10:39.680
I don't like LA at all

04:10:40.480 --> 04:10:42.480
it's hard to make friends

04:10:42.480 --> 04:10:43.440
that are like real

04:10:43.440 --> 04:10:45.120
that are into the same stuff as you

04:10:45.120 --> 04:10:46.400
it was just really hard for me

04:10:46.400 --> 04:10:47.520
to connect with anyone

04:10:47.520 --> 04:10:49.680
especially also like being a European

04:10:49.680 --> 04:10:50.880
and like being around Americans

04:10:50.880 --> 04:10:52.160
was very strange

04:10:52.160 --> 04:10:53.680
so the only thing I had

04:10:53.680 --> 04:10:54.800
when I came here

04:10:54.800 --> 04:10:55.280
was him

04:10:56.000 --> 04:10:58.240
and I didn't expect

04:10:58.240 --> 04:10:58.960
that situation

04:10:58.960 --> 04:10:59.600
because yeah

04:10:59.600 --> 04:11:00.560
because we had

04:11:00.560 --> 04:11:02.480
we had like two weeks of hanging out

04:11:02.480 --> 04:11:03.520
and like he would be on his computer

04:11:03.520 --> 04:11:04.080
sometimes

04:11:04.080 --> 04:11:05.120
and like do emails and stuff

04:11:05.120 --> 04:11:06.400
but I wasn't thinking

04:11:06.400 --> 04:11:07.920
that he would stream like 12 hours a day

04:11:07.920 --> 04:11:08.560
and it was pretty

04:11:08.560 --> 04:11:09.440
like it was pretty intense

04:11:09.440 --> 04:11:10.640
like in the beginning of it as well

04:11:10.640 --> 04:11:12.480
and I realized it was really hard

04:11:12.480 --> 04:11:13.600
to like get attention

04:11:13.600 --> 04:11:14.160
and get time

04:11:14.160 --> 04:11:16.480
because his like love meter

04:11:16.480 --> 04:11:17.840
would be like full

04:11:17.840 --> 04:11:19.120
if I was just in the house

04:11:19.120 --> 04:11:20.000
and that's just kind of like

04:11:20.000 --> 04:11:20.720
the way he is

04:11:20.720 --> 04:11:21.680
and for me back then

04:11:21.680 --> 04:11:23.120
when I didn't have anything else to do

04:11:23.840 --> 04:11:26.000
it was kind of like a

04:11:26.000 --> 04:11:28.000
it was kind of crazy for me

04:11:28.000 --> 04:11:28.880
I feel like right now

04:11:28.880 --> 04:11:30.400
because I do work as well

04:11:30.400 --> 04:11:32.800
and I have things going for me

04:11:32.800 --> 04:11:34.000
and I have other friends

04:11:34.640 --> 04:11:35.680
now that I made

04:11:35.680 --> 04:11:37.120
I feel like it's a lot easier

04:11:37.120 --> 04:11:38.480
because and I can definitely like

04:11:38.480 --> 04:11:40.560
enjoy just like being in separate rooms

04:11:40.560 --> 04:11:41.840
and just like hear him in the background

04:11:41.840 --> 04:11:42.400
is really nice

04:11:42.400 --> 04:11:42.960
so I can like

04:11:42.960 --> 04:11:44.240
I can sit in paint

04:11:44.240 --> 04:11:45.200
and like in my room

04:11:45.200 --> 04:11:46.240
and I will do that for hours

04:11:46.240 --> 04:11:47.360
while I'm just like hearing a scream

04:11:47.360 --> 04:11:47.840
in the background

04:11:47.840 --> 04:11:49.280
it's kind of like comforting

04:11:49.280 --> 04:11:50.400
that he's he's just there

04:11:50.400 --> 04:11:51.120
it feels nice

04:11:51.120 --> 04:11:51.440
I like it

04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:53.680
to you that's the sound of happiness

04:11:53.680 --> 04:11:55.200
yes because I know he's right there

04:11:55.200 --> 04:11:55.760
yeah it's nice

04:11:55.760 --> 04:11:56.320
and they will come in

04:11:56.320 --> 04:11:57.280
and check on me sometimes

04:11:57.280 --> 04:11:58.240
and it's it's kind of like

04:11:58.240 --> 04:11:59.280
it's actually very comforting

04:11:59.280 --> 04:11:59.840
it's very nice

04:11:59.840 --> 04:12:00.320
I like it

04:12:01.120 --> 04:12:01.760
yeah

04:12:01.760 --> 04:12:03.520
I think that's kind of what a relationship is

04:12:03.520 --> 04:12:04.880
like you do fun things together

04:12:04.880 --> 04:12:06.560
you know you share moments together

04:12:06.560 --> 04:12:07.440
but also just like

04:12:07.440 --> 04:12:08.640
having someone like around

04:12:08.640 --> 04:12:09.680
you's really really nice

04:12:10.640 --> 04:12:11.680
and I think that's probably

04:12:12.240 --> 04:12:13.440
maybe it's me growing up

04:12:14.640 --> 04:12:15.680
maybe that's what it is

04:12:15.680 --> 04:12:17.680
and like I start liking like the kind of

04:12:17.680 --> 04:12:19.040
I feel like we're like an old couple

04:12:19.040 --> 04:12:19.920
like we're like 80

04:12:19.920 --> 04:12:20.800
and we're just like around

04:12:21.200 --> 04:12:22.720
we don't really have to talk much

04:12:22.720 --> 04:12:24.160
it's it's nice to just do that

04:12:24.160 --> 04:12:26.080
that fills your love meter

04:12:26.080 --> 04:12:27.040
that person

04:12:27.040 --> 04:12:28.400
I like this terminology

04:12:28.400 --> 04:12:28.720
love me

04:12:28.720 --> 04:12:29.360
I need both

04:12:29.360 --> 04:12:30.080
I mean okay

04:12:30.640 --> 04:12:32.320
you're making it sound like

04:12:32.320 --> 04:12:33.520
that I'm like craving like

04:12:33.520 --> 04:12:34.480
I haven't said anything

04:12:34.480 --> 04:12:35.280
I'm not saying anything

04:12:35.280 --> 04:12:36.160
I haven't said a single thing at all

04:12:36.160 --> 04:12:37.200
you're making face right now

04:12:37.200 --> 04:12:38.480
I know exactly what you're thinking so

04:12:38.480 --> 04:12:39.840
there's so much judging going on

04:12:39.840 --> 04:12:41.040
there's no judging at all

04:12:41.040 --> 04:12:41.760
no but like we

04:12:41.760 --> 04:12:42.320
I think

04:12:42.320 --> 04:12:44.480
I think whenever we do plan something out

04:12:44.480 --> 04:12:46.080
like if we if we go on a trip

04:12:46.080 --> 04:12:47.600
like every other month or once a month

04:12:48.240 --> 04:12:49.520
I feel like usually like

04:12:49.520 --> 04:12:50.320
that's enough

04:12:51.040 --> 04:12:52.640
as long as he's not playing

04:12:52.640 --> 04:12:54.000
factorial the entire time

04:12:54.000 --> 04:12:55.360
like if he if I feel like

04:12:55.360 --> 04:12:56.480
he's going on these trips with me

04:12:56.480 --> 04:12:56.960
and he's not

04:12:57.840 --> 04:12:58.800
like doing things with me

04:12:58.800 --> 04:13:00.160
or he's not he's not interested

04:13:00.160 --> 04:13:01.120
in like spending time

04:13:01.120 --> 04:13:02.560
or like being present with me

04:13:02.560 --> 04:13:03.280
then I'll feel like

04:13:03.280 --> 04:13:04.640
I just feel like I'm just wasting time

04:13:04.640 --> 04:13:04.960
right now

04:13:04.960 --> 04:13:06.480
and then I get kind of disappointed

04:13:06.480 --> 04:13:08.160
but otherwise I think this

04:13:08.160 --> 04:13:08.880
like this is fun

04:13:08.880 --> 04:13:09.840
I think this is like spending time

04:13:09.840 --> 04:13:10.640
together

04:13:10.640 --> 04:13:11.840
because we're like doing something together

04:13:11.840 --> 04:13:13.280
yeah it's fun yeah

04:13:14.160 --> 04:13:15.360
my love meter is

04:13:15.760 --> 04:13:17.280
your love meter is full

04:13:17.280 --> 04:13:18.320
it's my social life

04:13:18.320 --> 04:13:19.200
otherwise we like to

04:13:19.200 --> 04:13:20.560
we like to think about it that way

04:13:20.800 --> 04:13:22.160
like I need like a little bit more of

04:13:22.160 --> 04:13:23.120
like this one thing

04:13:23.120 --> 04:13:24.160
like quality time

04:13:24.160 --> 04:13:24.960
and he needs like

04:13:24.960 --> 04:13:26.160
almost zero quality time

04:13:26.880 --> 04:13:27.760
but like let's say that I

04:13:27.760 --> 04:13:29.200
we took away like physical touch

04:13:29.200 --> 04:13:30.400
you would probably not be very happy

04:13:31.520 --> 04:13:32.720
so you need physical touch

04:13:32.720 --> 04:13:34.080
so it's not just back to me huh

04:13:34.080 --> 04:13:35.200
no I'm a very cuddly person

04:13:35.200 --> 04:13:36.400
yeah like cuddly

04:13:36.400 --> 04:13:37.120
and then you're like

04:13:37.120 --> 04:13:38.320
I guess like acts of service

04:13:38.320 --> 04:13:39.440
like if I do something for you

04:13:39.440 --> 04:13:40.160
get really happy

04:13:40.160 --> 04:13:40.960
like hot chocolate

04:13:40.960 --> 04:13:41.680
yeah

04:13:41.680 --> 04:13:42.800
like if I give him hot chocolate

04:13:42.800 --> 04:13:44.080
in the morning he gets really happy

04:13:44.080 --> 04:13:44.640
so

04:13:44.640 --> 04:13:45.600
the actual

04:13:45.600 --> 04:13:46.640
it's not the hot chocolate

04:13:46.640 --> 04:13:48.000
it's the giving of the hot chocolate

04:13:48.000 --> 04:13:48.960
no it's just the hot chocolate

04:13:49.520 --> 04:13:50.400
but if she gives it to me

04:13:50.560 --> 04:13:51.520
I didn't have to get it myself

04:13:51.520 --> 04:13:52.000
it was just physical touch

04:13:52.000 --> 04:13:53.040
that's really nice

04:13:54.240 --> 04:13:55.440
all right well if you have to choose

04:13:55.440 --> 04:13:57.200
between Factorio and the drama

04:13:58.080 --> 04:13:59.200
or political discourse

04:13:59.920 --> 04:14:01.200
which probably political discourse

04:14:01.200 --> 04:14:02.320
probably my calling

04:14:02.320 --> 04:14:04.000
but I am a good Factorio player

04:14:05.360 --> 04:14:07.840
like what role exactly does Factorio play

04:14:07.840 --> 04:14:09.280
in your streaming life

04:14:09.840 --> 04:14:11.040
oh well right now it's just

04:14:11.040 --> 04:14:12.240
usually there are like these games

04:14:12.240 --> 04:14:13.040
that I play in the background

04:14:13.040 --> 04:14:13.920
as I have conversation

04:14:13.920 --> 04:14:15.280
because it's hard for me to just sit on the computer

04:14:15.280 --> 04:14:15.760
just talk

04:14:16.320 --> 04:14:17.840
and not like be playing a game at the same time

04:14:17.840 --> 04:14:19.760
so it's just something to keep me kind of like occupied

04:14:19.760 --> 04:14:20.960
you know I was going to buy like those little like

04:14:20.960 --> 04:14:21.840
widget things I guess

04:14:21.840 --> 04:14:22.720
yeah that's what yours is

04:14:22.720 --> 04:14:23.440
yeah basically yeah

04:14:23.440 --> 04:14:25.040
it's like minecraft or Factorio for me

04:14:25.920 --> 04:14:26.240
all right

04:14:27.120 --> 04:14:29.360
well my love meter is full from this

04:14:30.320 --> 04:14:31.920

04:14:55.760 --> 04:14:56.880

04:14:58.960 --> 04:15:01.520
