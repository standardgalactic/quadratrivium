0	5360	The following is a conversation with Sam Harris, his second time in the podcast. As I said two
5360	10960	years ago, when I first met and spoke with Sam, he's one of the most influential pioneering thinkers
10960	17120	of our time. As the host of the Making Sense podcast, creator of the Waking Up app, and the
17120	23200	author of many seminal books on human nature and the human mind, including The End of Faith,
23200	30640	The More Landscape, Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up. In this conversation, besides our mutual
30640	37200	fascination with AGI and Free Will, we do also go deep into controversial, challenging topics
37200	44160	of Donald Trump, Hunter Biden, January 6th, Vaccines, Lab Leak, Kanye West, and several
44160	50640	key figures at the Center of Public Discourse, including Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, both of whom
50640	57280	have been friends of Sam and have become friends of mine. Somehow, an amazing life trajectory
57280	63280	that I do not deserve in any way and, in fact, believe is probably a figment of my imagination.
64480	68640	And if it's alright, please allow me to say a few words about this personal aspect of the
68640	75520	conversation of discussing Joe, Elon, and others. What's been weighing heavy on my heart since
75520	80640	the beginning of the pandemic, now three years ago, is that many people I look to for wisdom
80640	86400	in public discourse stop talking to each other as often, with respect, humility, and love,
86400	93040	when the world needed those kinds of conversations the most. My hope is that they start talking again,
93040	97280	they start being friends again, they start noticing the humanity that connects them,
97280	103360	that is much deeper than the disagreements that divide them. So let me take this moment to say,
103360	109520	with humility and honesty, why I look up to and am inspired by Joe, Elon, and Sam.
110560	116320	I think Joe Rogan is important to the world, as a voice of compassion and curiosity, and open
116320	121600	mindedness to ideas both radical and mainstream, sometimes with humor, sometimes with brutal
121600	128640	honesty, always pushing for more kindness in the world. I think Elon Musk is important to the world
128640	133520	as an engineer, leader, entrepreneur, and human being who takes on the hardest problems that
133520	139040	face humanity and refuses to accept the constraints of conventional thinking that made the solutions
139040	146000	to these problems seem impossible. I think Sam Harris is important to the world as a fearless
146000	152960	voice who fights for the pursuit of truth against growing forces of echo chambers and audience capture,
152960	160320	taking unpopular perspectives and defending them with rigor and resilience. I both celebrate
160320	165600	and criticize all three privately, and they criticize me, usually more effectively,
165600	170640	from which I always learn a lot and always appreciate. Most importantly, there is respect
170640	175920	and love for each other as human beings, the very thing that I think the world needs most now,
175920	182640	in a time of division and chaos. I will continue to try to mend divisions, to try to understand,
182640	189840	not to ride, to turn the other cheek if needed, to return hate with love. Sometimes people criticize
189840	198480	me for being naive, cheesy, simplistic, all of that. I know, I agree, but I really am speaking
198480	205360	from the heart, and I'm trying. This world is too fucking beautiful not to try, in whatever way I know
205440	212080	how. I love you all. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our
212080	217520	sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sam Harris.
235680	241680	I would argue, even a species of reason, it's just understanding another person's point of view.
241680	248160	You understand why they're suffering or why they're happy, or you have a theory of mind
248960	256800	about another human being that is accurate, and so you can navigate in relationship to them
256800	262480	more effectively. And then there's another layer entirely, not incompatible with that,
262480	270160	but just distinct, which is what people often mean by empathy, which is more a kind of emotional
270160	278400	contagion. You feel depressed, and I begin to feel depressed along with you because it's just
278400	283520	it's contagious. We're so close, and I'm so concerned about you, and your problems become
283520	291600	my problems, and it bleeds through right now. I think both of those capacities are very important,
291680	301600	but the emotional contagion piece, and this is not really my thesis, this is something I have
301600	309120	more or less learned from Paul Bloom, the psychologist who wrote a book on this topic titled
309120	318480	Against Empathy. The emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide, rather often for ethical
318480	324880	behavior and ethical intuitions. So I'll give you the clear example of this, which is
327520	337040	we find stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly empathize with
337920	345280	far more compelling than data. So if I tell you, this is the classic case of the little girl who
345280	352000	falls down a well, right? This is somebody's daughter, you see the parents distraught on
352000	357440	television, you hear her cries from the bottom of the well, the whole country stops. I mean,
357440	362720	this was an example of this 20, 25 years ago, I think, where it was just wall-to-wall on CNN.
362720	368480	This is just the perfect use of CNN. It was 72 hours or whatever it was of continuous coverage
369040	374400	just extracting this girl from a well. So we effortlessly pay attention to that,
374400	379440	we care about it, we will donate money toward it. I mean, it's just, it marshals 100% of our
379440	386320	compassion and altruistic impulse. Whereas if you hear that there's a genocide raging in some
386320	391040	country you've never been to and never attended to go to, and the numbers don't make a dent,
391040	397440	and we find the story boring, right? And we'll change the channel in the face of a genocide,
397440	403520	right? It doesn't matter. And it literally, perversely, it could be 500,000 little girls
403520	409200	have fallen down wells in that country, and we still don't care, right? So it's,
410320	413840	you know, many of us have come to believe that this is a bug rather than a feature of our
413840	419680	moral psychology. And so empathy plays an unhelpful role there. So ultimately, I think
420720	426240	when we're making big decisions about what we should do and how to mitigate human suffering and
426240	433760	what's worth valuing and how we should protect those values, I think reason is the better tool.
433760	437280	But it's not that I would want to dispense with any part of empathy either.
437280	441520	Well, there's a lot of danger to go on there. But briefly to mention, you've recently talked about
442240	448960	effective altruism on your podcast. I think you mentioned some interesting statement. I'm going
448960	455360	to horribly misquote you, but that you'd rather live in a world like it doesn't really make sense,
455360	459360	but you'd rather live in a world where you care about maybe your daughter and son
460000	465840	more than 100 people that live across the world, something like this. Where the calculus is not
465840	471200	always perfect, but somehow it makes sense to live in a world where it's irrational in this way.
471760	474640	And yet empathetic in the way you've been discussing.
474640	479120	Right. I'm not sure what the right answer is there, or even whether there is one right answer.
479120	485280	There could be multiple peaks on this part of the moral landscape. But so the opposition is
486080	492080	between an ethic that's articulated by someone like the Dalai Lama or really any exponent of
494000	501520	classic Buddhism would say that the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect
501520	509360	to friends and strangers. The mind of the Buddha would be truly dispassionate. You would love
509440	517120	and care about all people equally. And by that light, it seems some kind of ethical failing,
517120	524400	or at least a failure to fully actualize compassion in the limit, or enlightened wisdom in the limit,
525600	532880	to care more or even much more about your kids than the kids of other people, and to prioritize
532880	537840	your energy in that way. So you spend all this time trying to figure out how to keep your kids
537840	543280	healthy and happy, and you'll attend to their minutest concerns and however superficial.
545200	552160	Again, there's a genocide raging in Sudan or wherever, and it takes up less than 1% of your
552160	558320	bandwidth. I'm not sure it would be a better world if everyone was running the Dalai Lama program
558320	567280	there. I think some prioritization of one's nearest and dearest ethically might be optimal
568000	573920	because we'll all be doing that, and we'll all be doing that in a circumstance where
574800	583520	we have certain norms and laws and other structures that force us to be dispassionate
583520	590240	where that matters. When my daughter gets sick, and I have to take her to a hospital,
591680	596160	I really want her to get attention, and I'm worried about her more than I'm worried about
596160	601200	everyone else in the lobby. But the truth is, I actually don't want a totally corrupt hospital.
601200	605920	I don't want a hospital that treats my daughter better than anyone else in the lobby because
605920	611360	she's my daughter, and I've bribed the guy at the door, or the guy's a fan of my podcast,
611360	616880	or whatever the thing is. You don't want starkly corrupt, unfair situations,
618320	625680	and when you get pressed down the hierarchy of Maslow's needs individually and
625680	631520	societally, a bunch of those variables change, and they change for the worse,
631520	637280	understandably. But yeah, when everyone's corrupt and you're in a state of
638960	643520	collective emergency, you've got a lifeboat problem, you're scrambling to get into the
643520	652720	lifeboat, yeah, then fairness and norms and the other vestiges of civilization
653680	660800	begin to get stripped off. We can't reason from those emergencies to normal life. I mean,
660800	666640	in normal life, we want justice, we want fairness, we're all better off for it, even when
667440	672720	the spotlight of our concern is focused on the people we know, the people who are friends,
672720	678320	the people who are family, people we have good reason to care about. We still, by default,
678320	683920	want a system that protects the interests of strangers too, and we know that generally speaking,
683920	688560	and just in game theoretic terms, we're all going to tend to be better off in a fair system
689120	697920	than a corrupt one. One of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data,
698720	705680	just a good story will get us to not think clearly. But what about empathy in the context of just
705680	710160	discussing ideas with other people? And then there's a large number of people like in this country,
711280	716960	you know, red and blue, half the population believes certain things on immigration or on
717920	723120	the response to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue, even if the election was
723120	731440	fairly executed. Having an empathy for their worldview, trying to understand where they're
731520	736880	coming from, not just in the explicit statement of their idea, but the entirety of the roots
736880	742240	from which their ideas stems, that kind of empathy while you're discussing ideas, what is
742960	749200	in your pursuit of truth, having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other people
751040	757840	versus raw mathematical reason. I think it's important, but it only takes you so far. It
757840	767200	doesn't get you to truth, right? Truth is not decided by democratic principles. And
769040	773280	certain people believe things for understandable reasons, but those reasons are nonetheless
773280	777520	bad reasons, right? They don't scale, they don't generalize. They're not reasons anyone
777520	786000	should adopt for themselves or respect epistemologically. And yet their circumstance
786000	793040	is understandable and it's something you can care about, right? I think there's many examples
793040	799360	of this you might be thinking of, but one that comes to mind is I've been super critical of
799360	807600	Trump, obviously, and I've been super critical of certain people for endorsing him or not
807600	814400	criticizing him when he really made it patently obvious who he was, you know, if there had been
814400	821840	any doubt initially, there was no doubt when we have a sitting president who's not agreeing
821840	831200	to a peaceful transfer of power, right? So I'm critical of all of that, and yet the fact that
832640	839600	many millions of Americans didn't see what was wrong with Trump or bought into the,
840320	844400	didn't see through his con, right? I mean, they bought into the idea that he was a brilliant
844400	848960	businessman who might just be able to change things because he's so unconventional and so,
849600	852960	you know, his heart is in the right place, you know, he's really a man of the people,
852960	859360	even though he's a, you know, gold-plated everything in his life. They bought the myth
859360	867200	somehow of, you know, largely because they had seen him on television for almost a decade and a
867200	874480	half pretending to be this genius businessman who could get things done. It's understandable to
874480	880720	me that many very frustrated people who have not had their hopes and dreams actualized,
881840	889280	who have been the victims of globalism and many other, you know, current trends,
890000	900080	it's understandable that they would be confused and not see the liability of electing a grossly
900080	908960	incompetent, morbidly narcissistic person into the presidency. So I don't, so which is to say
908960	914080	that I don't blame, there are many, many millions of people who I don't necessarily blame for the
914080	920880	Trump phenomenon, but I can nonetheless bemoan the phenomenon as indicative of, you know, very bad
922320	926400	state of affairs in our society, right? So it's two levels to it. I mean, one is,
926400	931280	I think you have to call a spade a spade when you're talking about how things actually work and what
931280	938880	things are likely to happen or not, but then you can recognize that people have very different life
938880	944560	experiences. And yeah, I mean, I think empathy and, you know, probably the better word for what I
945360	949520	would hope to embody there is compassion, right? Like really, you know,
951760	956480	to really wish people well, you know, and to really wish, you know, strangers well,
956480	960560	effortlessly wish them well. I mean, to realize that there is no opposition between,
961120	965840	at bottom, there's no real opposition between selfishness and selflessness because
966720	972880	wise selfishness really takes into account other people's happiness. I mean, you know,
972880	978320	which do you want to live in a society where you have everything, but most other people have nothing?
979440	984000	Or do you want to live in a society where you're surrounded by happy, creative,
984000	988080	self-actualized people who are having their hopes and dreams realized? I think it's
988080	994720	obvious that the second society is much better, however much you can guard your good luck.
996240	1002240	But what about having empathy for certain principles that people believe? For example,
1003520	1008400	the pushback, the other perspective on this, because you said bought the myth of Trump as
1008400	1013520	the great businessman. There could be a lot of people that are supporters of Trump who could say
1014560	1020880	that Sam Harris bought the myth that we have this government of the people by the people that
1020960	1026800	actually represents the people as opposed to a bunch of elites who are running a giant bureaucracy
1026800	1031760	that is corrupt, that is feeding themselves, and they're actually not representing the people.
1031760	1037680	And then here's this chaos agent, Trump, who speaks off the top of his head. Yeah, he's flawed in
1037680	1044320	all this number of ways. He's a more comedian than he is a presidential type of figure. And
1044960	1048720	he's actually creating the kind of chaos that's going to shake up this bureaucracy,
1049440	1054480	shake up the elites that are so uncomfortable because they don't want the world to know about
1054480	1060080	the game that got running on everybody else. So that's the kind of perspective that they would
1060080	1065600	take and say, yeah, there's these flaws that Trump has, but this is necessary.
1065600	1074640	I agree with the first part. So I haven't bought the myth that it's a truly representative democracy
1074720	1082320	in the way that we might idealize. On some level, I mean, this is a different conversation,
1082320	1086560	but on some level, I'm not even sure how much I think it should be. I'm not sure
1088720	1096640	we want, in the end, everyone's opinion given equal weight about just what we should do about
1096640	1099600	anything. And I include myself in that. I mean, there are many topics around which
1100400	1105680	I don't deserve to have a strong opinion because I don't know what I'm talking about or what I
1105680	1112080	would be talking about if I had a strong opinion. And I think we'll probably get to that,
1113680	1117360	to some of those topics because I've declined to have certain conversations on my podcast just
1117360	1123360	because I think I'm the wrong person to have that conversation. And I think it's important to see
1123360	1131280	those bright lines in one's life and in the moment politically and ethically. So yeah, I think
1133280	1141680	so leave aside the viability of democracy, I'm under no illusions that all of our institutions
1142560	1148400	are worth preserving precisely as they have been up until the moment. This great orange
1148400	1155920	wrecking ball came swinging through our lives. But it was a very bad bet to elect someone who is
1156720	1167040	grossly incompetent. And worse than incompetent, genuinely malevolent in his selfishness.
1167840	1173760	And this is something we know based on literally decades of him being in the public eye. He's
1173840	1183280	not a public servant in any normal sense of that term. And he couldn't possibly give an honest
1183280	1190080	or sane answer to the question you asked me about empathy and reason and what should guide us.
1192320	1201040	I genuinely think he is missing some necessary moral and psychological tools. I can feel
1201040	1206240	compassion for him as a human being because I think having those things is incredibly important.
1206240	1210640	And genuinely loving other people is incredibly important. And knowing what all that's about
1210640	1219360	is really the good stuff in life. And I think he's missing a lot of that. But I think we don't
1219360	1226880	want to promote people to the highest positions of power in our society who are far outliers in
1226880	1236080	pathological terms. We want them to be far outliers in the best case, in wisdom and compassion
1236080	1241280	and some of the topics you've brought up. I mean, we want someone to be deeply informed. We want
1241280	1250320	someone to be unusually curious, unusually alert to how they may be wrong or getting things wrong
1250320	1256400	consequentially. He's none of those things. And so far as we're going to get normal mediocrities
1256400	1262080	in that role, which I think is often the best we could expect, let's get normal mediocrities
1262080	1272240	in that role, not once in a generation narcissists and frauds. I mean, it's like
1273280	1277920	we just take honesty as a single variable. I think you want, yes, it's possible that
1278640	1283600	most politicians lie at least some of the time. I don't think that's a good thing.
1284640	1292480	I think people should be generally honest, even to a fault. Yes, there are certain circumstances
1292480	1297520	where lying I think is necessary. It's kind of on a continuum of self-defense and violence.
1298080	1303280	So it's like if Nazis come to your door and ask you if you've got Anne Frank in the attic,
1303280	1314080	I think it's okay to lie to them. But I arguably there's never been a person that anyone could
1314080	1321600	name in human history who's lied with that kind of velocity. I mean, it's just, it was just a
1321600	1335440	blizzard of lies, great and small, pointless and effective. But it says something
1338560	1345200	fairly alarming about our society that a person of that character got promoted. And so, yes,
1345200	1349440	I have compassion and concern for half of the society who didn't see it that way,
1349440	1356160	and that's going to sound elitist and smug or something for anyone who's on that side
1356160	1363280	listening to me. But it's genuine. I understand that I barely have the, I'm one of the luckiest
1363280	1367600	people in the world, and I barely have the bandwidth to pay attention to half the things
1367600	1371040	I should pay attention to in order to have an opinion about half the things we're going to
1371040	1377680	talk about. So how much less bandwidth does somebody who's working two jobs or a single mom
1377680	1387200	who's raising multiple kids, even a single kid, it's just unimaginable to me that people have
1387200	1393200	the bandwidth to really track this stuff. And so then they jump on social media and they see,
1393200	1397840	they get inundated by misinformation and they see what their favorite influencer just said.
1399360	1406320	And now they're worried about vaccines and it's just, we're living in an environment where the
1406320	1413120	information space becomes so corrupted and we've built machines to further corrupt it.
1413120	1421200	We've built a business model for the internet that further corrupts it. So it's chaos in
1421200	1430400	informational terms, and I don't fault people for being confused and impatient at their wit's end.
1431040	1440160	And yes, Trump was an enormous fuck you to the establishment. And that was understandable
1440160	1445840	for many reasons. To me, Sam Harris, the great Sam Harris, is somebody I've looked up to for a
1445840	1452640	long time as a beacon of voice of reason. And there's this meme on the internet, and I would
1452640	1457680	love you to steal me on the case for it and against that Trump broke Sam Harris' brain.
1458640	1464560	That there is something is disproportionately to the actual impact that Trump had on our society.
1464560	1475760	He had an impact on the ability of balanced, calm, rational minds to see the world clearly,
1475760	1482560	to think clearly. You being one of the beacons of that. Is there a degree to which he broke your
1482640	1489840	brain? Otherwise known as Trump derangement syndrome, medical condition.
1489840	1495040	Yeah, I think Trump derangement syndrome is a very clever meme because it just
1496240	1501760	throws the problem back on the person who's criticizing Trump. But in truth, the true
1503040	1509600	Trump derangement syndrome was not to have seen how dangerous and divisive it would be to promote
1509600	1519920	someone like Trump to that position of power. And in the final moment, not to see how untenable it
1519920	1526880	was to still support someone sitting president who was not committing to a peaceful transfer
1526880	1532480	of power. If that wasn't a bright line for you, you have been deranged by something.
1533040	1540080	Because that was one minute to midnight for our democracy as far as I'm concerned. And I think
1540720	1551120	it really was but for the integrity of a few people that we didn't suffer some real constitutional
1551120	1557840	crisis and real emergency after January 6th. I mean, if Mike Pence had caved in
1558480	1564000	and decided to not certify the election, literally you can count on two hands,
1564000	1570560	a number of people who held things together at that moment. And so it wasn't for want of
1570560	1581440	trying on Trump's part that we didn't succumb to some truly uncharted catastrophe with our
1581440	1588320	democracy. So the fact that that didn't happen is not a sign that those of us who were worried that
1588320	1593840	it was so close to happening were exaggerating the problem. I mean, it's like you almost got
1593840	1600000	run over by a car, but you didn't. And so the fact that you're adrenalized and you're thinking,
1600000	1604000	oh boy, that was dangerous, I probably shouldn't wander in the middle of the street
1604800	1609440	with my eyes closed, you weren't wrong to feel that you really had a problem.
1612080	1617680	And came very close to something truly terrible. So I think that's where we were,
1617680	1622000	and I think we shouldn't do that again. So the fact that he's still, he's coming back around
1622000	1626320	as potentially a viable candidate, I'm not spending much time thinking about it, frankly,
1626320	1634560	because I'm waiting for the moment where it requires some thought. I mean, it took up,
1634560	1644400	I don't know how many podcasts I devoted to the topic. It wasn't that many in the end against
1644400	1651120	the number of podcasts I devoted to other topics, but there are people who look at Trump and just
1651120	1660160	find him funny, entertaining, not especially threatening. It's just good fun to see somebody
1660720	1667600	who's just not taking anything seriously, and it's just putting a stick in the wheel of business
1667600	1675680	as usual again and again and again and again. And they don't really see anything much at stake.
1676720	1681520	It doesn't really matter if we don't support NATO. It doesn't really matter if he says he trusts
1681520	1688160	Putin more than our intelligence services. It doesn't matter if he's on the one hand
1688160	1696320	saying that he loves the leader of North Korea and on the other, threatening to bomb them back
1696320	1702800	to the Stone Age on Twitter. It all can be taken in the spirit of reality television. This is
1702800	1709600	the part of the movie that's just fun to watch. And I understand that. I can even inhabit that
1709600	1716720	space for a few minutes at a time, but there's a deeper concern that we're in the process of
1716800	1722400	entertaining ourselves to death, that we're just not taking things seriously. And this is a problem
1722400	1729760	I've had with several other people we might name who just appear to me to be goofing around at scale,
1730560	1735360	and they lack a kind of moral seriousness. I mean, they're touching big problems
1735360	1741200	where lives hang in the balance, but they're just fucking around. And I think there are really
1741200	1747920	important problems that we have to get our heads straight around. And it's not to say that
1747920	1754240	institutions don't become corrupt. I think they do. And I'm quite worried that both about the
1754240	1761040	loss of trust in our institutions and the fact that trust has eroded for good reason,
1761040	1767120	right? That they have become less trustworthy. They've become infected by political ideologies
1767120	1774480	that are not truth tracking. I mean, I worry about all of that. But I just think we need
1774480	1780960	institutions. We need to rebuild them. We need experts who are real experts. We need to value
1780960	1789280	expertise over amateurish speculation and conspiracy thinking and bullshit.
1789280	1792240	The kind of amateur speculation we're doing on this very podcast?
1793040	1800080	I'm usually alert to the moments where I'm just guessing or where I actually
1800080	1805440	feel like I'm talking from within my wheelhouse. And I try to telegraph that a fair amount with
1805440	1816640	people. But it's different. I mean, you can invite someone onto your podcast who's an expert
1816720	1824400	about something that you're not an expert about. And then you, in the process of getting
1824400	1829120	more informed yourself, your audience is getting more informed. So you're asking smart questions,
1829120	1834240	and you might be pushing back at the margins. But you know that when push comes to shove,
1834240	1841840	on that topic, you really don't have a basis to have a strong opinion. And if you were going to
1841840	1846800	form a strong opinion that was this counter to the expert you have in front of you,
1846800	1851040	it's going to be by deference to some other expert who you've brought in or who you've
1851040	1855440	heard about or whose work you've read or whatever. But there's a paradox to
1856400	1861440	how we value authority in science that most people don't understand. And I think we should,
1862160	1867920	at some point, unravel that because it's the basis for a lot of public confusion. And frankly,
1867920	1872880	it's the basis for a lot of criticism I've received on these topics where people think that
1875680	1883280	I'm against free speech or I'm an establishment shill or it's like I'm a credentialist,
1883280	1887760	I just think people with PhDs from Ivy League universities should run everything.
1888560	1894480	It's not true, but there's a lot to cut through to get to daylight there because people are
1894720	1901920	very confused about how we value authority in the service of rationality generally.
1901920	1905760	You've talked about it, but it's just interesting the intensity of feeling you have.
1905760	1912880	You've had this famous phrase about Hunter Biden and children in the basement.
1912880	1920160	Can you just revisit this case? So let me give another perspective on the situation of January
1920160	1928320	6th and Trump in general. It's possible that January 6th and things of that nature revealed
1928320	1934800	that our democracy is actually pretty fragile. And then Trump is not a malevolent and ultra
1934800	1943040	competent malevolent figure, but is simply a jokester. And he just by creating the chaos revealed
1943040	1947440	that it's all pretty fragile because you're a student in history and there's a lot of people
1947440	1955760	like Vladimir Lenin, Hitler, who are exceptionally competent at controlling power, at being executives
1955760	1961360	and taking that power, controlling the generals, controlling all the figures involved and certainly
1961360	1968560	not tweeting but working in the shadows behind the scenes to gain power. And they did so extremely
1968560	1973520	competently and that is how they were able to gain power. The pushback with Trump is he was doing
1973520	1982400	none of that. He's very good at creating drama, sometimes for humor's sake, sometimes for drama's
1982400	1990400	sake and simply revealed that our democracy is fragile. And so he's not this once in a generation
1990400	2002480	horrible figure. Once in a generation narcissist. I don't think he's a truly scary sinister Putin-like
2002480	2007120	or much less Hitler-like figure, not at all. I mean, he's not ideological. He doesn't care
2007120	2016480	about anything beyond himself. So it's not... No, no, he's much less scary than any really scary
2017520	2022720	totalitarian. And he's... He's more brave in your world than 1984.
2022720	2030080	This is what Eric Weinstein never stops badgering me about, but he's still wrong, Eric.
2030480	2036960	My analogy for Trump was that he's an evil Chauncey Gardner. I don't know if you remember
2036960	2045360	the book or the film Being There with Peter Sellers. But Peter Sellers is this Gardner who
2045360	2051360	really doesn't know anything, but he gets recognized as this wise man and he gets promoted to immense
2051360	2059040	power in Washington because he's speaking in a semblance of wisdom. He's got these very simple
2059040	2064080	aphorisms or it would seem to be aphorisms. All he cares about is gardening. He's just talking
2064080	2069040	about his garden all the time. But he'll say something, but in the spring, the new shoots
2069040	2075520	will bloom and people read into that some kind of genius insight politically. And so he gets
2075520	2080800	promoted and says that's the joke of the film. For me, Trump has always been someone like an
2080800	2087280	evil Chauncey Gardner. It's not to say he's totally... Yes, he has a certain kind of genius.
2087280	2093680	He's got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself. He's got a genius for getting the eye of
2093680	2104160	the media always coming back to him. But it's a kind of self-promotion that only works if you
2104160	2110800	actually are truly shameless and don't care about having a reputation for anything that I or you
2110800	2116880	would want to have a reputation for. It's like the pure pornography of attention. And he just
2116880	2124800	wants more of it. I think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a
2124800	2133280	country that at least half of the country, given how broken our society is in many ways,
2133840	2141200	we have a country that didn't see anything wrong with that, bringing someone who obviously
2141200	2147600	doesn't know what he should know to be president and who's obviously not a good person, who obviously
2147600	2153040	doesn't care about people, can't even pretend to care about people really, in a credible way.
2155120	2161760	And so if there's a silver lining to this, it's along the lines you just sketched,
2161760	2170560	it shows us how vulnerable our system is to a truly brilliant and sinister figure. I think
2170560	2181760	we really dodged a bullet. Someone far more competent and conniving and ideological could have
2181760	2191200	exploited our system in a way that Trump didn't. So if we plug those holes eventually,
2192480	2195200	that would be a good thing and he would have done a good thing for our society.
2196080	2201120	One of the things we realized, and I think nobody knew, I certainly didn't know it and I
2201120	2208640	didn't hear anyone talk about it, is how much our system relies on norms rather than laws.
2208640	2210080	Yeah, civility almost.
2210080	2218800	Yeah, it's quite possible that he never did anything illegal, truly illegal. I think he
2218800	2223920	probably did a few illegal things, but illegal such that he really should be thrown in jail for it.
2226080	2233840	At least that remains to be seen. So all of the chaos, all of the
2234960	2239920	diminishment of our stature in the world, all of the just the opportunity costs of
2239920	2249120	spending years focused on nonsense, all of that was just norm violations. All that was just all
2249120	2254320	a matter of not saying the thing you should say, but that doesn't mean they're insignificant, right?
2254320	2258720	It's not that it's like, it's not illegal for a sitting president to say,
2260080	2264560	no, I'm not going to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, right? We'll wait and see
2264560	2272960	whether I win. If I win, the election was valid. If I lose, it was fraudulent, right?
2272960	2279760	But aren't those humorous perturbations to our system of civility such that we know where the
2279760	2283840	limits are and now we start to think that and have these kinds of discussions?
2284160	2290480	That wasn't a humorous perturbation because he did everything he could, granted he wasn't very
2290480	2297120	competent, but he did everything he could to try to steal the election. I mean, the irony is he
2297120	2302400	claimed to have an election stolen from him all the while doing everything he could to steal it,
2302400	2308800	declaring it fraudulent in advance, trying to get the votes to not be counted as the evening
2308800	2313200	war on, knowing that they were going to be disproportionately Democrat votes
2314400	2320320	because of the position he took on mail-in ballots. I mean, all of it was fairly calculated,
2321360	2330720	the whole circus of the clown car that crashed into four seasons landscaping, right? And you got
2330720	2336000	Rudy Giuliani with his hair dye, and you got Sidney Powell and all these grossly incompetent
2336000	2342480	people lying as freely as they could breathe about election fraud, right? And all of these
2342480	2348000	things are getting thrown out by largely Republican election officials and Republican judges.
2349520	2355040	It wasn't for want of trying that he didn't maintain his power in this country. He really
2355040	2360000	tried to steal the presidency. He just was not competent, and the people around him weren't
2360000	2365360	competent. So that's a good thing, and it's worth not letting that happen again.
2365360	2367760	But he wasn't competent so he didn't do everything he could.
2368400	2371840	Well, no, he did everything he could. He didn't do everything that could have been
2371840	2377760	done by someone more competent. Right. But the tools you have as a president,
2377760	2381040	you could do a lot of things. You can declare emergencies, especially during COVID,
2381040	2385840	you could postpone the election, you can create military conflict that, you know,
2385840	2388480	any kind of reason to postpone the election, there's a lot of...
2388480	2392880	Well, he tried to do things, and he would have to have done those things through other people,
2392880	2396800	and there are people who refuse to do those things. There are people who said they would
2396800	2403120	quit. They would quit publicly. Again, there are multiple books written about
2404640	2411920	the last hours of this presidency, and the details are shocking in what he tried to do
2411920	2417680	and tried to get others to do, and it's awful, right? I mean, it's just awful that we were that
2417680	2427680	close to something, to a true unraveling of our political process. I mean, it's the only time
2427680	2434160	in our lifetime that anything like this has happened, and it's deeply embarrassing, right?
2435200	2439120	On the world stage, it's just like we looked like a banana republic there for a while,
2439760	2449120	and we're the lone superpower. It's not good, and so we shouldn't... There's no...
2450320	2454880	The people who thought, well, we just need to shake things up, and this is a great way to
2454880	2460160	shake things up, and having people storm our capital and smear shit on the walls,
2460160	2464000	that's just more shaking things up, right? It's all just for the lulls.
2464640	2470960	There's a nihilism and cynicism to all of that, which, again, in certain people, it's
2470960	2477200	understandable. Frankly, it's not understandable if you've got a billion dollars and you have a
2477200	2481520	compound in Menlo Park or wherever. There are people who are cheerleading this stuff,
2481520	2484800	who shouldn't be cheerleading this stuff, and who know that they can get on their
2485360	2490000	Gulf Stream and fly to their compound in New Zealand if everything goes to shit, right?
2490960	2494960	There's a cynicism to all of that that I think we should be deeply critical of.
2494960	2502000	What I'm trying to understand is not the behavior of this particular human being,
2502000	2510320	but the effect it had in part on the division between people. To me, the degree, the meme
2511200	2514160	of Sam Harris's brain being broken by Trump represents...
2514640	2519440	You're like the person I would look to to bridge the division.
2519440	2528320	Well, I don't think there is something profitably to be said to someone who's truly
2529280	2534880	captivated by the personality cult of Trumpism, right? There's nothing that I'm going to say to...
2535760	2539280	There's no conversation I'm going to have with Candace Owens, say, about Trump
2539280	2541840	that's going to converge on something reasonable, right?
2541840	2542800	You don't think so?
2542800	2546160	No. I haven't tried with Candace, but I've tried with many people who
2547360	2551840	are in that particular orbit. I mean, I've had conversations with people who
2553360	2557600	won't admit that there's anything wrong with Trump, anything.
2557600	2561360	So I'd like to push for the empathy versus reason, because when you operate in the
2561360	2568640	space of reason, yes. But I think there's a lot of power in you showing, in you, Sam Harris,
2568640	2573760	showing that you're willing to see the good qualities of Trump, publicly showing that.
2574560	2576480	I think that's the way to win over the Candace Owens.
2576480	2581600	But he has so few of them. He has fewer good qualities than virtually anyone I can name,
2581600	2588000	right? So he's funny. I'll grant you that he's funny. He's a good entertainer.
2588000	2591360	Does others look at just policies and actual impacts he had?
2591360	2596080	I've admitted that. No, no. So I've admitted that many of his policies I agree with,
2596960	2603120	many, many of his policies. So probably more often than not, at least on balance, I agree.
2604000	2609120	I agreed with his policy that we should take China seriously as an adversary, right?
2609680	2616160	And I think, I mean, again, there's a lot of fine print to a lot of this, because
2616880	2622000	the way he talks about these things and many of his motives that are obvious are things that I
2622720	2629120	don't support, but we take immigration. I think it's obvious that we should have control of our
2629120	2635440	borders. I don't see the argument for not having control of our borders. We should let in who we
2635440	2639680	want to let in, and we should keep out who we want to keep out, and we should have a sane
2639680	2645120	immigration policy. So I didn't necessarily think it was a priority to build the wall,
2645120	2651360	but I never criticized the impulse to build the wall, because if tens of thousands, hundreds
2651360	2655040	of thousands of people are coming across that border and we are not in a position to know who's
2655040	2662000	coming, that seems untenable to me. And I can recognize that many people in our society
2663200	2670160	are on balance the victims of immigration. And there is, in many cases, a zero-sum contest
2670160	2675440	between the interests of actual citizens and the interests of immigrants, right? So I think we
2675440	2680560	should have control of our borders. We should have a sane and compassionate immigration policy.
2681040	2691600	We should let in refugees, right? So Trump on refugees was terrible. But I would say 80% of
2691600	2704320	the policy concerns people celebrated in him are concerns that I either share entirely or
2704320	2709840	certainly sympathize with, right? So that's not the issue. The issue is...
2710640	2712880	A threat to democracy in some fundamental way.
2712880	2718320	The issue is largely what you said it was. It's not so much the person, it's the effect on
2718320	2726480	everything he touches, right? He has this superpower of deranging and destabilizing
2728400	2733120	almost everything he touches and sullying and compromising the integrity of almost anyone who
2733120	2738400	comes into his orbit. I mean, so you looked at these people who served as chief of staff or in
2738400	2745680	various cabinet positions, people who had real reputations for probity and level-headedness,
2746560	2753680	whether you shared their politics or not. I mean, these were real people. Some of them were goofballs.
2754480	2766720	But many people who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by him
2766720	2774800	when they finally parted company with him, yeah. I mean, it's just people bent over backwards to
2774800	2783200	accommodate his norm violations and it was bad for them and it was bad for our system.
2784080	2794640	But none of that discounts the fact that we have a system that really needs a proper house
2794640	2802160	cleaning. Yes, there are bad incentives and entrenched interests and I'm not a fan of the
2802160	2809280	concept of the deep state because it's been so propagandized. But yes, there's something like
2809280	2820160	that that is not flexible enough to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment.
2820720	2824080	There's a lot of rethinking of government and of institutions in general that I think
2826080	2833200	we should do, but we need smart, well-informed, well-intentioned people to do that job. The
2833200	2845760	well-intentioned part is hugely important. Just give me someone who is not the most selfish person
2845760	2852480	anyone has ever heard about in their lifetime. What we got with Trump was literally the one
2852480	2858640	most selfish person I think anyone could name. Again, there's so much known about this, man.
2858640	2866560	That's the thing. It predates his presidency. We knew this guy 30 years ago and this is what
2866560	2872160	to come back to those inflammatory comments about Hunter Biden's laptop. The reason why I can say
2872160	2880000	with confidence that I don't care what was on his laptop is that includes any evidence of
2880000	2885200	corruption on the part of his father. Now, there's been precious little of that that's actually
2885200	2891360	emerged. As far as I can tell, there's not a big story associated with that laptop as much as
2891360	2900560	people bang on about a few emails. Even if there were just obvious corruption, Joe Biden was at
2900560	2909280	this meeting and he took this amount of money from this shady guy for bad reasons. Given how
2909280	2914400	visible the lives of these two men have been, given how much we know about Joe Biden and how
2914400	2918640	much we know about Donald Trump and how they have lived in public for almost as long as I've
2918640	2927040	been alive, both of them, the scale of corruption can't possibly balance out between the two of
2927040	2933680	them. If you show me that Joe Biden has this secret life where he's driving a Bugatti and he's
2933680	2939920	living like Andrew Tate and he's doing all these things I didn't know about, then I'm going to
2940000	2945360	start getting a sense that, all right, maybe this guy is way more corrupt than I realized. Maybe
2945360	2950800	there is some deal in Ukraine or with China that is just like this guy is not who he seems. He's
2950800	2955840	not the public servant. He's been pretending to be. He's been on the take for decades and decades,
2955840	2962160	and he's just, he's as dirty as can be. He's all mobbed up and it's a nightmare and he can't be
2962160	2968560	trusted. That's possible if you show me that his life is not at all what it seems. But on the
2968560	2975920	assumption that having looked at this guy for literally decades and knowing that every journalist
2975920	2982640	has looked at him for decades, just how many affairs is he having? Just how many drugs is he
2982640	2990800	doing? How many houses does he have? What are the obvious conflicts of interest? You hold that
2990800	2998000	against what we know about Trump, right? And I mean, the litany of indiscretions you can put
2998000	3003840	on Trump's side that testify to his personal corruption, to testify to the fact that he has
3003840	3009600	no ethical compass, there's simply no comparison. So that's why I don't care about what's on the
3009600	3016400	laptop. Now, if you tell me Trump is no longer running for president in 2024 and we can put
3016400	3022320	Trumpism behind us, and now you're saying, listen, there's a lot of stuff on that laptop that makes
3022960	3029760	Joe Biden look like a total asshole. Okay, I'm all ears, right? I mean, in 2020, it was a force
3029760	3035680	choice between a sitting president who wouldn't commit to a peaceful transfer of power and a guy
3035680	3045520	who's obviously too old to be president, who has a crack addicted son who lost his laptop,
3046240	3052720	and I just knew that I was going to take Biden in spite of whatever litany of horrors was going
3052720	3057200	to come tumbling out of that laptop. And that might involve sort of, so the actual quote is,
3057200	3063120	Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in the basement. There's a dark humor
3063120	3067520	to it, right? Which is, I think you speak to, I would not have cared. There's nothing, it's Hunter
3067520	3072240	Biden, it's not Joe Biden. Whatever the scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, it is infinitesimally
3072240	3077200	compared to the corruption. We know Trump was involved in, it's like a firefly to the sun,
3077200	3083120	is what you're speaking to. But let me make the case that you're really focused on the surface
3083120	3090000	stuff, that it's possible to have corruption that masquerades in the thing we mentioned,
3090000	3095360	which is civility. You can spend hundreds of billions of dollars or trillion towards the war
3097120	3101360	in the Middle East, for example, something that you've changed your mind on in terms of
3101360	3106480	the negative impact that it has on the world. And that, the military industrial complex,
3107760	3112560	everybody's very nice, everybody's very civil, just very upfront. Here's how we're spending the
3112560	3118400	money. Yeah, sometimes somehow disappears in different places, but that's the way war is
3118400	3123760	complicated. And it's everyone is very polite. There's no Coke and strippers or whatever is on
3123760	3129360	the laptop. It's very nice and polite. And then meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of civilians
3129360	3137360	die of hate. Just an incredible amount of hate is created because people lose their family members,
3137360	3140320	all that kind of stuff, but there's no strippers and Coke on a laptop.
3141920	3150960	But it's not just superficial. It is when someone only wants wealth and power and fame,
3152320	3159040	that is their objective function. They're like a robot that is calibrated just to those variables.
3160000	3166480	And they don't care about the risks we run on any other front. They don't care about
3168400	3174640	environmental risk, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation risk, none of it. They're just
3174640	3183120	tracking fame and money and whatever can personally redound to their self-interest
3183120	3187360	along those lines. And they're not informed about the other risks we're running really.
3187920	3193600	In Trump, you had a president who was repeatedly asking his generals, why couldn't we use our
3193600	3198240	nuclear weapons? Why can't we have more of them? Why do I have fewer nuclear weapons than JFK?
3199040	3207680	As though that were a sign of anything other than progress. And this is the guy who's got
3208880	3214880	the button. Somebody's following him around with a bag waiting to take his order to launch.
3217360	3226320	That is a risk we should never run. One thing Trump has going for him, I think, is that he
3227120	3234000	doesn't drink or do drugs. People allege that he does speed, but let's take him in his word.
3234560	3242160	He's not deranging himself with pharmaceuticals, at least, apart from Diet Coke.
3242480	3248240	There's nothing wrong, just for the record, when you push back on that, there's nothing wrong
3248240	3252000	with Diet Coke. We could see a very large amount. I occasionally have some myself.
3252000	3257440	There's no scientific evidence that I observed the negatives of all those studies about
3257440	3266400	aspartame and all that. I hope you're right. Everything you said about the military industrial
3266400	3272000	complex is true. We've been worrying about that on both sides of the aisle for
3272480	3287040	a very long time. That phrase came from Eisenhower. So much of what ails us is a story of bad
3287040	3296400	incentives. Bad incentives are so powerful that they corrupt even good people. How much more do
3296400	3304640	they corrupt bad people? At minimum, you want reasonably good people, at least non-pathological
3304640	3313360	people in the system trying to navigate against the grain of bad incentives. Better still,
3314320	3321360	all of us can get together and try to diagnose those incentives and change them. We will really
3321360	3330080	succeed when we have a system of incentives where the good incentives are so strong that even
3330080	3335520	bad people are effortlessly behaving as though they're good people because they're so successfully
3335520	3342800	incentivized to behave that way. So it's almost the inversion of our current situation. So yes,
3343680	3351040	and you say I changed my mind about the war, not quite. I was never a supporter of the
3351040	3356640	war in Iraq. I was always worried that it was a distraction from the war in Afghanistan. I was a
3356640	3364320	supporter of the war in Afghanistan, and I will admit in hindsight, that looks like at best a
3364320	3372480	highly ambiguous and painful exercise, more likely a fool's errand. It did not turn out well.
3373200	3380800	It wasn't for want of trying. I have not done a deep dive on all of the failures there,
3381360	3386240	and maybe all of these failures are failures in principle. Maybe that's not the kind of thing
3386240	3393440	that can be done well by anybody, whatever our intentions. But yeah, the move to Iraq always
3393440	3401520	seemed questionable to me, and when we knew the immediate problem at that moment, Al-Qaeda,
3403040	3413120	was in Afghanistan, and then bouncing to Pakistan. Anyway, so yes, but my
3414400	3423360	sense of the possibility of nation building, my sense of, insofar as the neocon
3423920	3433360	spirit of responsibility and idealism, that America was the kind of nation that should
3433920	3437440	be functioning in this way as the world's cop, and we have to get in there and
3438480	3445760	untangle some of these knots by force rather often, because if we don't do it over there,
3445760	3451200	we're going to have to do it over here kind of thing. Yeah, some of that has definitely changed
3451200	3456480	for me in my thinking. There are obviously cultural reasons why it failed in Afghanistan,
3456480	3464560	and if you can't change the culture, you're not going to force a change at gunpoint
3465120	3469600	in the culture, or it certainly seems that that's not going to happen, and it took us
3470800	3474880	over 20 years to apparently to realize that. That's one of the things you realize with the
3474880	3480160	wars. There's not going to be a strong signal that things are not working. If you just keep
3480160	3484640	pouring money into a thing, a military effort. Well, also, there are signs of it working too.
3484640	3489840	You have all the stories of girls now going to school, right? The girls are getting battery
3489840	3494640	acid thrown in their faces by religious maniacs, and then we come in there and we stop that,
3495200	3500160	and now girls are getting educated, and that's all good, and our intentions are good there,
3500160	3505440	and we're on the right side of history there. Girls should be going to school. Malala Yosef
3506400	3511280	should have the Nobel Prize, and she shouldn't have been shot in the face by the Taliban, right?
3514160	3519040	We know what the right answers are there. The question is, what do you do when there are enough,
3519040	3524560	in this particular case, religious maniacs, who are willing to die and let their children die in
3524560	3532640	defense of crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the 7th century? It's a problem we
3532640	3538320	couldn't solve, and we couldn't solve it even though we spent trillions of dollars to solve it.
3538320	3545440	This reminded me of the thing that you and Jack Dorsey jokingly had for a while,
3546000	3551920	the discussion about banning Donald Trump from Twitter, but does any of it bother you
3551920	3560240	and all the Twitter files came out? It has to do with the Hunter Biden laptop story.
3560960	3566000	Does it bother you that there could be a collection of people that make decisions about
3566000	3573680	who to ban or not, and that that could be susceptible to bias and to ideological influence?
3574240	3581760	Well, I think it always will be, or in the absence of perfect AI, it always will be.
3581760	3586800	And this becomes relevant with AI as well, because there's some censorship on AI happening,
3586800	3588480	and it's an interesting question there as well.
3588480	3593760	I don't think Twitter is as important as people think it is. And I used to think it was more
3593760	3603280	important when I was on it, and now that I'm off of it, I think it's just an unambiguously good
3603280	3610800	thing in my experience to leach your Twitter account. Even the good parts of Twitter that I
3610800	3618880	miss were bad in the aggregate, the degree to which it was fragmenting my attention,
3618880	3626720	the degree to which my life was getting doled out to me in periods between those moments where I
3626720	3634560	checked Twitter and had my attention diverted. And I was not a crazy Twitter addict. I was
3634560	3639680	probably a pretty normal user. I was not someone who was tweeting multiple times a day or even
3639680	3647920	every day. I think I probably averaged something like one tweet a day, I think I averaged. But
3647920	3652560	in reality, it would be like four tweets one day, and then I wouldn't tweet for the better part of
3652560	3660640	a week. But I was looking a lot because it was my newsfeed. I was just following 200 very smart
3660640	3664400	people, and I just wanted to see what they were paying attention to, and they would recommend
3664400	3668960	articles, and I would read those articles. And then when I would read an article, then I would
3669040	3674080	thought, I should signal boost, I would tweet. And so all of that seemed good, and that's all
3674080	3679680	separable from all of the odious bullshit that came back at me in response to this, largely in
3679680	3690560	response to this Hunter Biden thing. But even the good stuff has a downside, and it comes at
3691280	3700960	this point of your phone is this perpetual stimulus which is intrinsically fragmenting
3700960	3706640	of time and attention. And now my phone is much less of a presence in my life. And it's not that
3706640	3716720	I don't check Slack or check email. I use it to work. But my sense of just what the world is,
3716720	3720720	and my sense of my place in the world, the sense of where I exist as a person,
3721520	3729120	has changed a lot by deleting my Twitter account. And the things that I think,
3729120	3734400	I mean, we all know this phenomenon. We say if someone, that person is too online. What does it
3734400	3742480	mean to be too online? And where do you draw that boundary? How do you know what constitutes being
3742560	3749520	too online? Well, in some sense, just being, I think being on social media at all is to be too
3749520	3759680	online. I mean, given what it does to, given the kinds of information, it signal boosts. And
3762880	3770480	the impulse it kindles in each of us to reach out to our audience in specific
3770480	3776160	moments and in specific ways. There are lots of moments now where I have an opinion about
3776160	3782000	something, but there's nothing for me to do with that opinion. There's no Twitter. So there are
3782000	3788080	lots of things that I would have tweeted in the last months that are not the kind of thing I'm
3788080	3792800	going to do a podcast about. I'm not going to roll out 10 minutes on that topic on my podcast.
3792800	3796560	I'm not going to take the time to really think about it. But had I been on Twitter,
3796560	3801120	I would have reacted to this thing in the news or this thing that somebody did, right?
3801680	3804480	What do you do with that thought now? I just let go of it.
3804480	3807040	Like chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing.
3807040	3812640	Yeah. It's usually not that sort of thing, but it's just, but then you look at the kinds of
3812640	3817920	problems people create for themselves. You look at the life deranging and reputation
3817920	3825040	destroying things that people do. And I look at the things that have, the analogous things that
3825040	3829200	have happened to me. I mean, the things that have really bent my life around professionally
3829200	3836240	over the past decade. So much of it is Twitter. I mean, honestly, in my case,
3836240	3839760	almost 100% of it was Twitter. The controversies I would get into,
3840400	3844400	the things I would think I would have to respond to in a pod, like I would release a podcast on
3844400	3851360	a certain topic, I would see some blowback on Twitter. It would give me the sense that there
3851360	3856720	was some signal that I really had to respond to. Now that I'm off Twitter, I recognize that most
3856720	3862080	of that was just, it was totally specious, right? It was not something I had to respond to.
3862640	3868640	But yet I would then do a cycle of podcasts responding to that thing that like taking my
3868640	3875120	foot out of my mouth or taking someone else's foot out of my mouth. And it became this self-perpetuating
3875200	3886720	cycle, which, I mean, if you're having fun, great. I mean, if it's generative of useful
3887600	3897120	information and engagement professionally and psychologically, great. And there was some of
3897120	3903520	that on Twitter. I mean, there were people who I connected with because I just, one of us DMed
3903520	3907120	the other on Twitter and it was hard to see how that was going to happen otherwise. But
3908880	3915920	it was largely just a machine for manufacturing unnecessary controversy.
3915920	3920720	Do you think it's possible to avoid the drug of that? So now that you've achieved this zen state,
3920720	3926080	is it possible for somebody like you to use it in a way that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool?
3926640	3930720	And so anytime there's a tax, you just, I mean, that's how I tried to use it.
3931360	3937520	Yeah, but it's not the way I wanted to use it. It's not the way it promises itself as a...
3937520	3938560	You wanted to have debate.
3938560	3943600	I wanted to actually communicate with people. I wanted to hear from the person because,
3944800	3951920	again, it's like being in Afghanistan. There are the potted cases where it's obviously good.
3952960	3958080	In Afghanistan, the girl who's getting an education, that is just here. That's why we're here. That's
3958080	3962160	obviously good. I've had those moments on Twitter where it's like, okay, I'm hearing from a smart
3962160	3968720	person who's detected an error I made in my podcast or in a book or they've just got some
3968720	3974000	great idea about something that I should spend time on. And I would never have heard from this
3974000	3978400	person in any other format. And now I'm actually in dialogue with them. And it's fantastic.
3979120	3983760	That's the promise of it, to actually talk to people. And so I kept getting lured back into that.
3984480	3994000	No, the same or sanity-preserving way of using it is just as a marketing channel. You just
3994000	4000000	put your stuff out there and you don't look at what's coming back at you. And I'm on other
4000000	4005840	social media platforms that I don't even touch. I mean, my team posts stuff on Facebook and on
4005840	4008080	Instagram. I never even see what's on there.
4008080	4012480	So you don't think it's possible to see something and not let it affect your mind?
4012560	4018000	No, that's definitely possible. But the question is, and I did that for vast
4018000	4026560	stretches of time. But then the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback.
4028560	4037440	If I know for whatever reason, I'm going to see 99 to 1 awful feedback, bad faith feedback,
4038080	4042400	malicious feedback. Some of it's probably even bots and I'm not even aware of who's a person
4042400	4049520	who's a bot. But I'm just going to stare into this funhouse mirror of acrimony and dishonesty.
4052080	4059520	The reason why I got off is not because I couldn't recalibrate and find equanimity again
4059520	4064560	with all the nastiness that was coming back at me and not that I couldn't ignore it for
4064560	4072160	vast stretches of time. But I could see that I kept coming back to it, hoping that it would
4072160	4078320	be something that I could use, a real tool for communication. And I was noticing that it was
4078320	4084560	insidiously changing the way I felt about people, both people I know and people I don't know.
4085920	4091200	Mutual friends of ours who are behaving in certain ways on Twitter, which just seemed insane to me.
4092640	4097120	That became a signal I felt like I had to take into account somehow. You're seeing people at
4097200	4105440	their worst, both friends and strangers. And I felt that as much as I could try to recalibrate for it,
4106880	4112960	I felt that I was losing touch with what was real information because people are performing,
4112960	4117440	people are faking, people are not themselves or you're seeing people at their worst.
4118080	4126000	And so I felt like, all right, was being advertised to me here on a not just a daily basis,
4126480	4133280	an hourly basis or an increment sometimes of multiple times an hour. I probably checked Twitter
4136160	4140880	at minimum 10 times a day and maybe I was checking it 100 times a day on some days,
4140880	4143680	right, where things were really active and I was really engaged with something.
4147920	4154400	What was being delivered into my brain there was subtly false information
4155120	4164880	about how dishonest and just generally unethical,
4167360	4174000	totally normal people are capable of being. It is a funhouse mirror. I was seeing the most
4174000	4180400	grotesque versions of people who I know. People who I know I could sit down at dinner with and
4180400	4187440	they would never behave this way. And yet they were coming at me on Twitter. It was essentially
4187440	4196960	turning ordinary people into sociopaths. People are just, and there are analogies that many of
4196960	4201920	us have made. It's like one analogy is road rage. People behave in the confines of a car
4202480	4207600	in ways that they never would if they didn't have this metal box around them moving at speed.
4208480	4215120	All of that becomes quite hilarious and obviously dysfunctional when they actually
4215120	4220160	have to stop at the light next to the person they just flipped off. They didn't understand
4220160	4224640	that the person coming out of that car next to them with cauliflower ear is someone who they
4224640	4229280	never would have rolled their eyes at in public because they would have taken one look at this
4229280	4232640	person and realized this is the last person you want to fight with.
4232640	4237280	That's one of the heartbreaking things is to see people who I know, who I admire,
4237280	4249200	who I know are friends, be everything from snarky to downright mean derisive towards each other.
4249200	4254880	It doesn't make any sense. This is the only place where I've seen people I really admire
4254880	4260960	who have had a calm head about most things really be shitty to other people. It's probably the only
4260960	4266960	place I've seen that. I choose to maybe believe that that's not really them. There's something
4266960	4274480	about the system. If you go paintballing, if you, Jordan Peterson, and you're going to shoot your
4274480	4277680	friends. Yeah, you're going to shoot your friends, but you kind of accept that that's kind of what
4277680	4282640	you're doing in this little game that you're playing, but it's sometimes hard to remind yourself of
4283520	4286800	that. I think I was guilty of that definitely.
4291600	4297280	I don't think I ever did anything that I really feel bad about, but yeah, it was always pushing
4297280	4309920	me to the edge of snideness somehow. It's just not healthy. The reason why I deleted my Twitter
4309920	4317920	account in the end was that it was obviously making me a worse person. Is there some way to be on
4317920	4323040	there where he's not making you a worse person? I'm sure there is, but given the nature of the
4323040	4329440	platform and given what was coming back at me on it, the way to do that is just to basically
4330560	4336640	use it as a one-way channel of communication, just marketing. I was like, here's what I'm paying
4336640	4341920	attention to, look at it if you want to, and you just push it out, and then you don't look at what's
4341920	4346480	coming back at you. I put out a call for questions on Twitter, and then actually quite surprising,
4346480	4353200	there's a lot of good, I mean, they're like, even if they're critical, they're like being thoughtful,
4353200	4357920	which is nice. I used it that way too, and that was what kept me hooked. But then there's also
4358880	4366880	TouchBalls69 wrote a question. I can't imagine. This is part of it. One way to solve this is,
4367520	4372800	we've got to get rid of anonymity for this. Let me ask the question. Ask Sam why he sucks was the
4372800	4379680	question. That's good. Well, one reason why I sucked was Twitter, and I've since solved that
4379760	4388160	problem. TouchBalls69 should be happy that I suck a little bit less now that I'm off Twitter,
4388880	4391520	and don't have to hear from TouchBalls69 on the regular.
4392560	4398480	The fact that you have to see that, it probably can have a negative effect,
4399920	4406160	even a moderation, just to see that there is, for me, the negative effect is slightly losing faith
4407040	4412880	in the underlying kindness of humanity. You can also just reason your way out of it,
4412880	4417360	saying that this is anonymity, and this is kind of fun, and this is kind of just the
4417360	4421520	shit show of Twitter, it's okay, but it does mentally affect you a little bit.
4421520	4433600	I don't read too much into that kind of comment. It's just that's just trolling. I understand
4433600	4437680	the fun the person is having on the other side of that. It's like- Do you though?
4437680	4444880	Well, I do. I don't behave that way, but I do, and for all I know, that person could be 16 years
4444880	4453520	old. It could be also an altar con for Elon, I don't know. I'm pretty sure Elon would just
4453520	4459040	tweet that under his own name at this point. Oh, and you love each other.
4459520	4464640	Okay, so do you think, so speaking of which, now that Elon has taken over Twitter,
4466400	4469680	is there something that he could do to make this platform better?
4470800	4475520	This Twitter and just social media in general, but because of the aggressive nature of his
4475520	4481920	innovation that he's pushing, is there any way to make Twitter a pleasant place for Sam Harris?
4482160	4489920	Maybe. I don't know. I think I'm agnostic as to whether or not he or anyone could
4489920	4493040	make a social media platform that really was healthy.
4493040	4497520	So you were just observing yourself week by week, seeing the effect that's on your mind,
4498160	4502000	and on how much you're actually learning and growing as a person, and it was negative?
4502000	4505440	Yeah, and I also seen the negativity in other people's lives. I mean, it's obviously-
4506800	4511680	he's not going to admit it, but I think it's obviously negative for Elon, right? It's just
4512240	4518160	it's- that was one of the things that- when I was looking into the Funhouse Mirror,
4518800	4523120	I was also seeing the Funhouse Mirror on his side of Twitter, and it was just even more
4523120	4528080	exaggerated. It's like, when I was asking myself, why is he spending his time this way,
4528960	4535200	I then reflected on why was I spending my time this way to a lesser degree,
4535200	4543440	and at lesser scale, and at lesser risk, frankly, right? And so- and it was just so-
4544640	4550560	it's not just Twitter. I mean, it's- this is in part an internet phenomenon. It's like the
4550560	4558560	whole Hunter Biden mess that you- you explored. That was based on- I mean, I was on somebody's
4558560	4564480	podcast, but that was based on a clip taken from that podcast, which was highly misleading as to
4565440	4571440	the general shape of my remarks on that podcast. Even, you know, I had to then do my own podcast
4572400	4577920	untangling all of that and admitting that even in the full context, I was not speaking especially
4577920	4583360	well and didn't say exactly what I thought in a way that was- would have been recognizable to
4583360	4590960	anyone, you know, even someone with not functioning by a- a spirit of charity, but- but the clip was
4590960	4596160	quite distinct from the podcast itself. The reality is, is that we're living in an environment now
4596160	4604080	where people are so lazy and their- their- their attention is so fragmented that they- they only
4604080	4611760	have time for clips, but 99% of people will see a clip and will assume there's no relevant context
4611760	4617520	I need to understand what happened in that clip, right? And obviously, the people who make those
4617520	4621360	clips know that, right? And they're doing that- doing it quite maliciously. And in this case,
4621360	4627040	the person who made that clip and subsequent clips of other podcasts was quite maliciously trying to
4627040	4638400	engineer, you know, some reputational emulation for me. And being signal boosted by Elon and other
4638400	4644960	prominent people who can't take the time to watch anything other than a clip, even when it's their
4644960	4650400	friend or someone who's ostensibly their friend in that clip, right? So it's a total failure- an
4650400	4656560	understandable failure of ethics that everyone is so short on time and they're so fucking lazy
4657360	4662960	that the ch- and- and- and that we now have these contexts in which we react so quickly to things,
4662960	4673200	right? Like Twitter is inviting an- an instantaneous reaction to this clip that it's- it's just too
4673200	4679200	tempting to just say something and not know what you're even commenting on. And most- most of the
4679200	4686240	people who saw that clip don't understand what I- what I actually think about any of these issues.
4686240	4692000	And the irony is people are going to find clips from this conversation that are just as misleading
4692000	4695200	and they're going to export those and then people are going to be dunking on those clips.
4695200	4701680	And, you know, we're all living and dying by clips now and it's- it's dysfunctional.
4701680	4707600	See, I- I think it's possible to create a platform- I- I think we will keep living on clips,
4707600	4710720	but, you know, when I saw that clip of you talking about children and so on,
4711440	4715840	just knowing that you have a sense of humor, you- we just went to a dark place in terms of humor.
4715840	4716240	Right.
4716240	4722400	So, like, I didn't even bother and then I knew that the way clips work is that people will use it for
4722400	4728640	virality's sake, but the giving- giving a person benefit of the doubt- that's not even the right
4728640	4736560	term. It's not like I was- it's really, like, interpreting it in the context of the past.
4736560	4742560	The truth is- the truth is you even need- like, I even give Trump the benefit of the doubt when I
4742560	4747120	see a clip of Trump. I mean, so- because there are famous clips of Trump that are very misleading
4747120	4751600	as to what he was saying in context. And I've been honest about that. Like, the whole, you know,
4752320	4757280	there were good people on both sides scanned all around the- his remarks after Charlottesville
4758240	4765760	that the clip that got exported and got promoted by everyone, you know, left of center, from Biden
4765760	4773280	on down, you know, the New York Times, CNN, there's nobody that I'm aware of who has honestly,
4774400	4780240	you know, apologized for what they did with that clip. That- he did not say what he seemed to be
4780240	4785680	saying in that clip about the Nazis at Charlottesville, right? And I have always been very clear about
4785680	4795600	that. So it's just, you know, I- even people who I think should be marginalized and people who-
4799600	4803840	who should be defenestrated because they really are terrible people who are doing dangerous
4803840	4811280	things and for bad reasons, I think we should be honest about what they actually meant in context,
4811280	4817520	right? And this goes to anyone else we might talk about, you know, who's more- where the case
4817520	4825840	is much more confusing. But yeah, so everyone's- it's just so- and then I'm sure we're going to get
4825840	4833040	to AI, but, you know, the prospect of being able to manufacture clips with AI and deep fakes
4834000	4838000	and that where it's going to be hard for most people most of the time to even figure out that
4838640	4844080	whether they're in the presence of something real, you know, forget about being divorced from
4844080	4851840	context. There was no context. I mean, that is- that's a misinformation apocalypse that is- we
4851840	4857040	are right on the cusp of and, you know, it's terrifying. Well, it could be just a new world
4857040	4862240	like where Alice going to Wonderland or humor is the only thing we have and it will save us.
4862880	4868240	Maybe in the end, Trump's approach to social media was the right one after all. Nothing is
4868240	4873760	true and everything's absurd. But we can't live that way. People function on the basis of what
4873760	4878000	they assume is true, right? They think, you know- People have functioned.
4878000	4881920	To do anything. It's like, I mean, you have to know what you think is going to happen
4882480	4889280	or you have to at least give a probabilistic waiting over the future. Otherwise, you're-
4889280	4893920	you're going to be incapacitated by- you're not gonna- like people want certain things and they
4893920	4899200	have to have a rational plan to get those desires gratified. And they don't want to die. They don't
4899200	4903920	want their kids to die. You tell them that there's a comet hurtling toward earth and they should get
4903920	4909040	outside and look up, right? They're going to do it. And if it turns out it's misinformation, you
4909040	4916480	know, it's- it's going to matter because it comes down to like, what medicines do you give your
4916480	4922000	children, right? Like, we're going to be manufacturing fake journal articles. I mean,
4922000	4929520	this is- I'm sure someone's using chat gpt for- for this reader as we speak. And if it's not
4929520	4935680	credible- if it's not persuasive now to most people, I mean, honestly, I don't think we're
4935680	4944000	going to- I'll be amazed if it's a year before we can actually create journal articles that would
4944000	4953600	take, you know, a PhD to debunk that are completely fake. And there are people who are celebrating
4953600	4961920	this kind of, you know, coming cataclysm. But I just- it's just- there are the people who
4963440	4967200	don't have anything to lose who are celebrating it or just are so confused that they just don't
4967200	4971520	even know what's at stake. And then there are the people who have met- the few people who
4971520	4975680	we could count on a few hands who have managed to insulate themselves or at least imagine they've
4975680	4981280	insulate- insulated themselves from the downside here enough that they're not implicated in the
4981280	4985200	great unraveling we are witnessing or could- could witness.
4985200	4990320	The shaking up of what is true. So actually that returns us to experts. Do you think experts can
4990320	4995360	save us? Is there such thing as expertise and experts in something? How do you know if you've
4995360	5000640	achieved it? I think it's- it's important to acknowledge upfront that this- there's something
5000720	5007760	paradoxical about how we relate to- to authority, especially within science.
5009200	5012960	And I don't think that paradox is going away. And it's just- it doesn't have to be confusing.
5012960	5016800	It's just- and it's not- it's not truly a paradox. It's just like there are different moments in
5016800	5027840	time. So it is true to say that within science or within any- within rationality, generally,
5027840	5032240	I mean just whenever you're making- having a fact-based discussion about anything,
5033760	5040320	it is true to say that the truth or falsity of a statement does not even slightly depend
5041200	5047120	on the credentials of the person making the statement, right? So it doesn't matter if you're
5047120	5051680	a Nobel laureate, you can be wrong, right? The thing you could- the last sentence you spoke could
5051680	5057520	be total bullshit, right? And it's also possible for someone who's deeply uninformed
5057520	5062160	to be right about something or to be right for the wrong reasons, right? Or someone just gets
5062160	5068320	lucky or someone- or- or- and there- there are middling cases where you have like a- a backyard
5068320	5074000	astronomer who's got no credentials, but he just loves astronomy and he's got a telescope and it's-
5074000	5079920	he spends a lot of time looking at the night sky and he discovers a comet that no one else has seen,
5079920	5086720	you know, not even the professional expert astronomers. I mean, I gotta think that happens
5086720	5092000	less and less now, but- but some version of that keeps happening and it may always keep happening
5092000	5104320	in every area of expertise, right? So it's true that truth is orthogonal to the reputational
5104320	5111520	concerns we have among apes who are talking about the truth. But it is also true that most of the
5111520	5121120	time real experts are much more reliable than frauds or people who are not experts, right?
5121120	5126880	So- and expertise really is a thing, right? And when it's- you know, when you're flying an airplane
5126880	5132800	in a- in a storm, you don't want just randos come into the cockpit saying, listen, I've got a new
5132800	5137520	idea about how to- you know, how we should tweak these controls, right? You want someone who's a
5137520	5142160	trained pilot and- and that training gave them something, right? It gave them a set of
5142160	5148080	competences and intuitions and they- they know what all those dials and switches do, right?
5148080	5154720	And I don't, right? I shouldn't be flying that plane. So when things really matter,
5155840	5164080	you know, and put in this at 30,000 feet in a storm sharpens this up, we want real experts
5164080	5171680	to be in charge, right? And we are at 30,000 feet a lot of the time on a lot of issues, right?
5171680	5176880	And whether they're public health issues, whether it's issue- whether it's a geopolitical emergency
5176880	5183520	like Ukraine, I mean, the climate change, I mean, just pick your- pick your topic.
5185280	5192160	There are real problems and the clock is rather often ticking and their solutions are
5192160	5199840	non-obvious, right? And so expertise is a thing and deferring to experts much of the time
5200880	5209600	makes a lot of sense. It's- at minimum, it- it prevents- it has spectacular errors of incompetence
5209600	5218000	and- and just, you know, foolhardiness. But even in- in the case of some- where you're talking
5218000	5223520	about someone- I mean, people like ourselves who are like, we're well-educated, we- we're not the
5223520	5228880	worst possible candidates for, you know, the- the Dunning-Kruger effect. When we're going into a new
5228880	5234240	area where we're not experts, we're fairly alert to the possibility that we don't- you know, it's
5234240	5239520	not as simple as things seem at first and we don't- you know, we don't know how our tools translate
5239520	5244720	to this new area. We can be fairly circumspect, but we're also- because we're well-educated,
5245440	5251440	we- we can work- and we're pretty quick studies, we can learn a lot of things pretty fast and we
5251440	5261840	can begin to play a language game that sounds fairly expert, right? And in that case, the- the
5261840	5269760	invitation to do your own research, right, is in- when- when times are good, I view as an invitation
5269760	5276560	to waste your time pointlessly, right? When times are good. Now, the truth is, times are not all
5276560	5284320	that good, right? And we have the- the ongoing public display of failures of expertise. We have
5284320	5289920	experts who are obviously corrupted by bad incentives. We've got experts who, you know,
5289920	5294560	perversely won't admit they were wrong when they, in fact, you know, are demonstrated to be wrong.
5294560	5300160	We've got institutions that have been captured by political ideology that's not truth tracking,
5300160	5307920	and this- this whole woke encroachment into really every place, you know, whether it's
5307920	5313040	universities or science journals or government or- I mean, it's just like that is- that has
5313040	5320320	been genuinely deranging. So there's a lot going on that- where- where experts- and- and the very
5320400	5324960	concept of expertise has seemed to discredit itself, but the reality is that there is a
5324960	5328960	massive difference. When anything matters, when there's anything to know about anything,
5328960	5334400	there is a massive difference most of the time between someone who has really done the work
5334400	5342400	to understand that domain and someone who hasn't. And if I get sick or someone close to me gets sick,
5344400	5349600	you know, I- I have a PhD in neuroscience, right? So I can read a medical journal article
5349600	5354480	and understand a lot of it, right? And I- you know, so I'm- I'm just fairly conversant with,
5354480	5360160	you know, medical terminology. And I understand its methods and I- I'm alert to the difference
5360160	5364240	because I've- you know, because in neuroscience, I've spent hours and hours in journal clubs,
5364240	5369680	you know, diagnosing, you know, analyzing the difference between good and bad studies,
5370800	5374640	I'm- I'm alert to the difference between good and bad studies in- in medical journals,
5374640	5378960	right? And I understand that bad studies can get published and, you know, et cetera,
5380080	5385440	and- and experiments can be poorly designed. I'm alert to all of those things, but when I get sick
5385440	5390720	or when someone close to me gets sick, I don't pretend to be a doctor, right? I- I've got no
5390720	5396640	clinical experience. I don't go down the rabbit hole on Google for days at a stretch trying to
5396640	5402880	become a doctor, much less a specialist in the domain of problem that has been visited upon me
5402880	5408400	or my family, right? So if someone close to me gets cancer, I don't pretend to be an oncologist.
5408400	5413280	I don't go out and start- I don't start reading, you know, in journals of oncology
5414080	5418560	and try to really get up to speed as an oncologist because it's- it's not- it's-
5421760	5432320	one is a bad and potent- and very likely misleading use of my time, right? And it's
5433840	5439120	if I decide- if I had- if I had a lot of runway, if I decided, okay, it's really important for me
5439120	5443680	to know everything I can. At this point, I want to- I know someone's going to get cancer. I may
5443680	5448080	not go back to school and become an oncologist, but what I want to do is I want to know everything
5448080	5452960	I can know about cancer, right? So I'm going to take the next four years and spend most of my
5452960	5457840	time on cancer. Okay, I could do that, right? I still think that's a waste of my time.
5458800	5463520	Uh, I still think at the end of- even at the end of those four years, I'm not going to be the best
5463520	5469120	person to- to form intuitions about what to do in the face of the next cancer that- that I have to
5469120	5476720	confront. Um, I'm still going to want a better oncologist than I've become to tell me what he
5476720	5480800	or she would do if they were in my shoes or in the shoes of, you know, my family member.
5481440	5485760	I'm going to- you know, I'm- what I'm- what I'm not advocating- I'm not advocating a-
5487040	5493200	a blind trust and authority. Like, if you get cancer and you're talking to one oncologist and
5493200	5497120	they're recommending some course of treatment, by all means get a second opinion, get a third
5497120	5502640	opinion, right? But it matters that those opinions are coming from real experts and not from,
5503440	5509840	you know, Robert Kennedy Jr., you know, who's telling you that, you know, you got it because
5509840	5515120	you got a- you know, a vaccine, right? It's like, it's just it- it- it- there's- we're swimming in
5515120	5521280	a sea of misinformation where you've got people who are moving the opinions of millions of others
5522240	5530560	who- who should not have an opinion on these topics. Like, there's no- there is no scenario
5530560	5536400	in which you should be getting your opinion about vaccine safety or- or climate change or
5537360	5541680	uh, the war in Ukraine or anything else that we might want to talk about from
5542560	5548720	Candace Owens, right? It's just like it- like she- she's not a relevant expert on any of those
5548720	5554240	topics and what's more, she doesn't seem to care, right? And- and- and she's living in a culture
5554880	5561760	that has- that has amplified that not caring into a business model, an effective business model,
5561760	5565680	right? So it's just- it's um- and there's something very Trumpian about all that,
5565680	5570880	or like that's- that's the pro- the problem is- is the culture, it's not these- these specific
5570880	5580560	individuals. Um, so- so the paradox here is that expertise is a real thing and we defer to it a lot
5580560	5588480	as a- as a labor-saving device and it's just as- and just based on the- the reality that
5588480	5592400	it's very hard to be a polymath, right? And specialization is a thing, right? And so the
5592400	5596560	people who specialize in a very narrow topic, they know more about that topic than the next guy,
5596560	5603920	no matter how smart that- that guy or gal is, uh, and- and that- those differences matter,
5604560	5614080	but it's also true that when you're talking about facts, sometimes the- the- the best experts are
5614080	5619840	wrong. The scientific consensus is wrong. You get a- a- a sea change in the thinking of a whole
5619840	5626720	field because one person who's an outlier for whatever reason decides, okay, I'm- uh, you know,
5626720	5633280	I'm gonna prove this point and they prove it, right? So somebody like, uh, the doctor who, uh,
5634000	5638320	believed that- that stomach ulcers were not due to stress, but were due to- to, um,
5638320	5643520	H. pylori infections, right? So he just drank a vial of H. pylori bacteria and- and proved
5643520	5649200	that- and quickly got an ul- ulcer and convinced the field that- that at minimum H. pylori was
5649200	5657840	involved in- in that process. Okay, so yes, everyone was wrong. That doesn't disprove the reality of
5657840	5664240	expertise. It doesn't disprove the utility of relying on experts most of the time, especially
5664320	5668960	in an emergency, especially when the clock is ticking, especially when you're- you know, you're-
5668960	5674720	you're in this particular cockpit and you only have one chance to land this plane, right? You
5674720	5682880	want the real pilot, uh, at the controls. But there's just a few things to say. Go. So one,
5682880	5687120	you mentioned this example with cancer and doing your own research. There- there's several things
5687120	5693280	that are different about our particular time in history. One, doing your own research has become
5693280	5700000	more and more effective because you can read- the internet made information a lot more accessible,
5700000	5707280	so you can read a lot of different meta-analyses. You can read blog posts that describe to you
5707280	5712720	exactly the flaws in the different papers they make up the meta- meta-analyses. They- and- and
5712720	5716240	you can read a lot of those blog posts that are conflicting with each other, and you can take
5716240	5723760	that information in- in a short amount of time. You can start to make, um, good faith
5723760	5728880	interpretations. For example, I don't know, I don't want to overstate things, but, um, if you
5728880	5734960	suffer from depression, for example, then there- you could go to an expert and a doctor that
5734960	5740240	prescribes you some medication, but you could also challenge some of those ideas and seeing, like,
5740240	5743280	what are the different medications? What are the different side effects? What are the different
5743280	5748080	solutions to depression? All that kind of stuff. And I think depression is just a really difficult
5748080	5755040	problem that's very, um, I don't want to, again, state incorrect things, but I think it's- there's
5755040	5761040	a lot of variability of what depression really means, so it- being introspective about the type
5761040	5766240	of depression you have and the different possible solutions you have, just doing your own research
5766240	5772080	as a first step before approaching a doctor or as you have multiple opinions could be very beneficial
5772080	5776960	in that case. Now, that's depression. That's something that's been studied for a very long time
5776960	5785120	with a new pandemic that's affecting everybody. It's, uh, you know, with the airplane equated
5785120	5792400	to, like, 9-11 or something. Like, the new emergency just happened and everybody, every
5792400	5798560	expert in the world is publishing on it and talking about it. So doing your own research there could
5798560	5805280	be exceptionally effective in asking questions. And then there's a difference between experts,
5805280	5811920	virologists, and it's actually a good question. Who is exactly the expert in a pandemic? Yeah. But
5812640	5818560	there's the actual experts doing the research and publishing stuff, and then there's the
5818560	5827680	communicators of that expertise. And the question is, uh, if the communicators are flawed to- to a
5827680	5833120	degree where doing your own research is actually the more effective way to figure out policies and
5833120	5837840	solutions, because you're not competing with experts. You're competing with the communicators
5837840	5844080	of expertise. That could be WHO, CDC, in the case of the pandemic, or politicians, or political
5844080	5851760	type of science figures like Anthony Fauci. There's a question there of the effectiveness of doing
5851760	5860080	your research- your own research in that context. And the competing forces there, incentives that
5860080	5865840	you've mentioned, is you can become quite popular by being contrarian, by saying everybody's lying
5865840	5870000	to you, all the authorities are lying to you, all the institutions are lying to you. So those are the
5870000	5875520	waters you're swimming in. But I think doing your own research in that kind of context could be
5876160	5882400	quite effective. Let me be clear. I'm not saying you shouldn't do any research, right? I'm not
5882400	5886080	saying that you shouldn't be informed about an issue. I'm not saying you shouldn't read
5886080	5891600	articles on- on whatever the topic is. And yes, if I got cancer or someone close to me got cancer,
5891600	5897040	I- I- I- I probably would read more about cancer than I've read thus far about cancer. And I've read
5897040	5906720	some. So I'm not- I'm not making a virtue of ignorance and a blind obedience to authority.
5906720	5910960	And I- and again, I recognize that- that authorities can discredit themselves or they can
5910960	5915920	be wrong. They can be wrong even when they- when there's no discredit. There's just- there's a
5915920	5924640	lot we don't understand about the- the nature of the world. But still this- this vast gulf
5924640	5935040	between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists. It always exists. And- and conspiracy thinking is
5937600	5943120	rather often, you know, most of the time, the species of bullshit, but it's not always wrong,
5943120	5948480	right? There are real conspiracies and there- there really are just awful
5949120	5955520	corruptions of, you know, but born of bad incentives within our, you know, our scientific
5955520	5960720	processes within institutions. And again, we've mentioned a lot of these things in passing,
5960720	5967600	but what- what woke political ideology did to scientific communication during the pandemic
5968160	5972880	was awful and was really corrosive of public trust, especially on the- on the right.
5973200	5978320	Right? For understandable reasons. It was just- it was crazy, some of the things that were being
5978320	5983840	said and still is. And these cases are all different. You take depression. We just don't
5983840	5989200	know enough about depression for, you know, anyone to be that confident about anything,
5989200	5994160	right? And there are many different modalities in which to interact with it as a problem,
5994160	5998080	right? So there's- you have pharmaceuticals, have whatever promise they have, but there's-
5998080	6002880	there's certainly a reason to be concerned that they don't work well for everybody and- and
6005200	6009120	I mean, that's- it's obvious they don't work well for everybody, but they do work for some people.
6013200	6018560	But again, depression is a multifactorial problem and there- there are different levels
6018560	6022080	at which to- to influence it. And there are, you know, there are things like meditation,
6022080	6028240	there are things like- you just- life changes and- and, you know, one of the perverse things
6028240	6032560	about depression is that when you're depressed, all of the things that would be good for you to do
6032560	6036240	are precisely the things you don't want to do. You don't have any energy to socialize, you don't
6036240	6041760	want to get things done, you don't want to exercise, you don't- and all of those things,
6041760	6045680	if you got those up and running, they do make you feel better in- you know, in the aggregate.
6046400	6051760	But the reality is that there- you know, there are clinical level depressions that are so bad
6051760	6057680	that it's just- we just don't have good tools for them. And it's not enough to tell- there's no
6057680	6063120	life change someone's gonna- gonna embrace that it's going to be an obvious remedy for that.
6065840	6072000	The pan- I mean, pandemics are- are obviously a complicated problem, but I- I would consider it
6072000	6079520	much simpler than depression in terms of, you know, what's on the menu to be chosen among, you
6079520	6083600	know, the various choices. Just less multifactorial. The logic by which you would make those choices,
6083600	6090320	yeah. So it's like, we have a virus, we have a new virus, it's some version of bad, you know,
6090320	6094800	it's human transmissible, we're still catching up- we're catching up to every aspect of it.
6094800	6098720	We don't know how it spreads. We don't know how- how effective masks are.
6098720	6102560	Well, to a certain point, we knew it was respiratory, but we- but how- but yeah,
6102560	6106320	but whether it's- we had spread by fomites, like all that, we were confused about a lot of things,
6106880	6110560	and we're still confused. It's been a moving target this whole time, and it's been changing
6110560	6117680	this whole time. And our responses to it have been, you know, we- we ramped up the vaccines as
6117680	6123440	quickly as we- as we could, but, you know, too quick for some, not as- not quick enough for others.
6123440	6128160	We could have done human challenge trials and got them out more quickly with- with- with better
6128160	6132560	data. And I think that's something we should probably look at in the future, because, you know,
6132560	6136560	that- you know, to my eye, that would make ethical sense to do- to do challenge trials.
6138640	6144480	But- and so much of my concern about COVID- I mean, many people are confused about my
6144480	6150960	concern about COVID. My- my concern about COVID has for much of the time not been narrowly focused
6150960	6159440	on COVID itself and how dangerous I perceive COVID to be as a- as a illness. It has been,
6159440	6167840	for the longest time, even more a concern about our ability to respond to a truly scary pathogen
6167840	6175440	next time. Like, I- I- for, you know, outside those initial months, you know, give me the- the
6175440	6181200	first six months to be quite worried about COVID and- and the unraveling of society, but-
6181200	6182640	And the supply of toilet paper.
6182640	6187680	You want to secure a steady supply of toilet paper. But beyond that initial period,
6189040	6193040	when we had a sense of what we were dealing with, and we had every hope that the vaccines are
6193040	6196160	actually going to work, and we're getting- and we knew we were getting those vaccines in short
6196160	6202320	order, right? Beyond that, and we had- and we knew just how dangerous the illness was and how
6202320	6210400	dangerous it wasn't. For years now, I've just been worrying about this as a failed dress rehearsal
6210400	6215360	for something much worse, right? I think what we proved to ourselves at this moment in history is
6215360	6222000	that we have built informational tools that we do not know how to use, to- and we have made
6222000	6227680	ourselves- we've basically enrolled all of human society into a psychological experiment
6228400	6235920	that is deranging us and making it virtually impossible to solve
6235920	6240400	coordination problems that we absolutely have to solve next time when things are worse.
6240400	6248960	Do you understand who's at fault for the way this unraveled? The way we didn't seem to have
6250480	6254240	the distrust in institutions and the institution of science that grew,
6254240	6259840	like seemingly exponentially, or got revealed through this process. Who is at fault here?
6261120	6266400	And what's the fix? So much blame to go around, but so much of it is not a matter of
6267520	6276560	bad people conspiring to do bad things. It's a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives
6276640	6284480	and just ordinary plain vanilla dysfunction. But my problem was that people like you,
6285120	6290800	people like Brett Weinstein, people like that I look to for reasonable, difficult conversations
6290800	6297040	on difficult topics, have a little bit lost their mind, became emotional and dogmatic in style of
6297040	6304160	conversation, perhaps not in the depth of actual ideas, but they're a tweet something of that nature,
6304160	6310960	and not about you, but just it feels like the pandemic made people really more emotional than
6310960	6316880	before. And then Kimball Musk responded, I think something I think you probably would agree with,
6316880	6321680	maybe not. I think it was the combo of Trump and the pandemic. Trump triggered the far left to
6321680	6326880	be way more active than they could have been without him. And then the pandemic handed big
6326880	6331840	government nanny state left these a huge platform on a silver platter. I want to punch and here we
6331840	6336160	are. I would agree with some of that. I'm not sure how much to read into the nanny state
6337520	6345680	concept. But yet basically got people on the far left really activated and then gave control to,
6345680	6353040	I don't know if you say nanny state, but just control to government that when executed poorly
6353040	6358000	has created a complete distrust in government. My fear is that there was going to be that complete
6358000	6363280	distrust anyway, given the nature of the information space, given the level of conspiracy
6363280	6371680	thinking, given the gaming of these tools by an anti-vax cult. I mean, there really is an
6371680	6377280	anti-vax cult that just ramped up its energy during this moment.
6378480	6379440	But it's a small one.
6379440	6384800	It's not to say that everything, every concern about vaccines is a species of,
6385520	6389600	it was born of misinformation or born of this cult, but there is a cult that is just,
6391920	6399040	and the core of Trumpism is a cult. I mean, the QAnon is a cult. And so there's a lot of lying
6399040	6408480	and there's a lot of confusion. It's almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some
6408480	6412800	people are and how fully their lives are organized around that confusion. I mean,
6412800	6417840	there are people who think that the world's being run by pedophile cannibals and that Tom
6417840	6422080	Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama are among those cannibals. I mean, they're
6423520	6428560	adjacent to the pure crazy, there's the semi-crazy, and adjacent to the semi-crazy,
6428560	6440240	there's the grifting opportunist asshole. And the layers of bad faith are hard to fully
6441040	6448640	diagnose, but the problem is all of this is getting signal boosted by an outrage machine
6448640	6452720	that is preferentially spreading misinformation. It has a business model
6452720	6456880	that is guaranteed that is preferentially sharing misinformation.
6456880	6462400	Can I actually just on a small tangent, how do you defend yourself against the claim that you're
6462400	6465600	a pedophile cannibal? It's difficult.
6465600	6469040	Here's the case I would make, because I don't think you can use reason.
6469680	6477280	I think you have to use empathy. I find it very difficult to believe that anyone
6477280	6483840	believes these things. I'm sure there's some number of people who are just pretending to
6483840	6489040	believe these things because it's just, again, this is sort of like the four-chanification
6489040	6495440	of everything. It's just Pepe the Frog. None of this is what it seems. They're not signaling
6496000	6501920	an alliance with white supremacy or neo-Nazism, but they're not doing it. They just don't fucking
6501920	6510160	care. It's just cynicism overflowing its banks. It's just fun to wind up the normies. Look at
6510160	6513840	all the normies that don't understand that a green frog is just a green frog, even when it
6513840	6520240	isn't just a green frog. It's just gumming up everyone's cognitive bandwidth with bullshit.
6521200	6524720	I get that that's fun if you're a teenager and you just want to vandalize our
6525840	6533840	new sphere, but at a certain point, we have to recognize that real questions of human
6533840	6541120	welfare are in play. There's wars getting fought or not fought, and there's a pandemic
6541120	6547040	raging, and there's medicine to take or not take. To come back to this issue of COVID,
6547840	6554720	I don't think I got so out of balance around COVID. I think people are quite confused about
6554720	6562400	what I was concerned about. Yes, there was a period where I was crazy because anyone who
6562400	6566880	was taking it seriously was crazy because they had no idea what was going on. Yes, I was wiping
6566880	6574960	down packages with alcohol wipes because people thought it was transmissible by touch.
6575440	6582240	When we realized that was no longer the case, I stopped doing that. Again, it was a moving
6582240	6587920	target, and a lot of things we did in hindsight around masking and school closures
6589200	6594720	looked fairly dysfunctional, unnecessary. I think the criticism that people would
6596480	6602400	say about you're talking about COVID, and maybe you can correct me, but you were
6603040	6608960	skeptical or you were against skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
6610080	6619040	People who get nervous about the vaccine but don't fall into the usual anti-vax camp,
6619040	6624160	which I think there was a significant enough number. They were getting nervous.
6624480	6631840	I mean, especially after the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, I too was nervous about anything
6632480	6639520	where a lot of money could be made. You just see how the people who are greedy,
6639520	6643920	they come to the surface all of a sudden, and a lot of them that run institutions,
6643920	6647200	actually really good human beings. I know a lot of them, but it's hard to know
6648160	6652000	how those two combine together when there's hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars
6652000	6659680	to be made. I guess the sense was that you weren't open enough to the skepticism.
6659680	6663920	I understand that people have that sense. I'll tell you how I thought about it and think about it.
6664640	6668560	One, again, it was a moving target. There was a point in the timeline where
6669520	6680320	it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were both working, but both they were
6682000	6689040	reasonably safe and that COVID was reasonably dangerous. The trade-off for basically everyone
6689040	6694160	was it was rational to get vaccinated given the level of testing and how many people had
6694160	6700400	been vaccinated before you, given what we were seeing with COVID, that that was a forced choice.
6700400	6703680	You're eventually going to get COVID and the question is, do you want to be vaccinated when
6703680	6710320	you do? There was a period where that forced choice, it was just obviously reasonable to
6710320	6717120	get vaccinated, especially because there was every reason to expect that while it wasn't a
6717120	6723760	perfectly sterilizing vaccine, it was going to knock down transmission a lot and that matters.
6723840	6730000	It wasn't just a personal choice. You were actually being a good citizen when you decided to run
6730000	6735680	whatever risk you were going to run to get vaccinated because there are people in our
6735680	6739520	society who actually can't get vaccinated. I know people who can't take any vaccines,
6739520	6746560	they're so allergic to it. They in their own person seem to justify all of the fears of the
6746560	6750960	anti-vax cult. They're the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr. can point to and say,
6751520	6758640	vaccines will fucking kill you because of the experience. I know people who have
6758640	6766960	kids who fit that description. We should all feel a civic responsibility to be vaccinated against
6767760	6774080	egregiously awful and transmissible diseases for which we have relatively safe vaccines
6774800	6778560	to keep those sorts of people safe. There was a period of time when it was thought that the
6778560	6785680	vaccine could stop transmission. Yes. All of this has begun to shift. I don't think it has
6785680	6792480	shifted as much as Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted, but yes, there are safety concerns around
6792480	6802240	the mRNA vaccines, especially for young men. As far as I know, that's the purview of actual
6802240	6810800	heightened concern, but also there's now a lot of natural immunity out there. Basically,
6810800	6815840	everyone who was going to get vaccinated has gotten vaccinated. The virus has evolved to the
6815840	6827600	point in this context where it seems less dangerous. Again, I'm going more on the seemings than on
6828400	6832400	research that I've done at this point, but I'm certainly less worried about getting COVID. I've
6832400	6838720	had it once. I've been vaccinated. You ask me now, how do I feel about getting the next booster?
6840080	6845440	I don't know that I'm going to get the next booster. I was somebody who was waiting in line
6846160	6852000	at four in the morning, hoping to get some overflow vaccine when it was first available.
6852720	6860640	And at that point, given what I thought I knew based on the best sources I could consult and
6862800	6868240	based on anecdotes that were too vivid to ignore, both data and personal experience,
6870160	6874560	it was totally rational for me to want to get that vaccine as soon as I could.
6875520	6881520	And now, I think it's totally rational for me to do a different kind of cost-benefit analysis
6881520	6888320	and wonder, listen, do I really need to get a booster? How many of these boosters am I going
6888320	6895520	to get for the rest of my life? Really? And how safe is the mRNA vaccine for a man of my age?
6896160	6901600	And do I need to be worried about myocarditis? All of that is completely rational to talk about
6901600	6912320	now. My concern is that at every point along the way, I was the wrong person and Brett Weinstein
6912320	6916320	was the wrong person, and there's many other people I could add to this list, to have strong
6916320	6923440	opinions about any of this stuff. I just disagree with that. I think, yes, in theory, I agree 100%,
6924320	6928320	but I feel like experts failed at communicating, not at doing...
6928320	6928640	They did.
6929520	6934960	And I just feel like you and Brett Weinstein actually have the tools with the internet,
6935760	6941520	given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time, deeply about the
6942080	6947600	problems that face our world, that you actually have the tools to do pretty good thinking here.
6947600	6949200	The problem I have with experts...
6949200	6953120	But there would be deference to experts and pseudo-experts behind all of that.
6953120	6956240	Well, the papers, you would stand on the shoulders of giants, but you can surf those
6956240	6957920	shoulders better than the giants themselves.
6957920	6962720	Yeah, but I knew we were going to disagree about that. I saw his podcast where he brought on these
6962720	6969600	experts who had, many of them, had the right credentials, but for a variety of reasons,
6970160	6975600	they didn't pass the smell test for me. One larger problem, and this goes back to the problem of
6976720	6982160	how we rely on authority in science, is that you can always find a PhD or an MD
6982960	6990400	to champion any crackpot idea. It is amazing, but you could find PhDs and MDs who would sit
6990400	6995600	up there in front of Congress and say that they thought smoking was not addictive, or that it
6995600	7000720	was not harmful to... There was no direct link between smoking and lung cancer.
7000720	7007440	You could always find those people. Some of the people Brett found were people who had
7007440	7013040	obvious tells to my point of view, to my eye. I saw them on some of the same people
7013040	7022400	who were on Rogan's podcast. It's hard because if a person does have the right credentials,
7023040	7029200	and they're not saying something floridly mistaken, and we're talking about something
7029200	7035360	where they're genuine unknowns, like how much do we know about the safety of these vaccines?
7035680	7041760	It's at that point not a whole hell of a lot. We have no long-term data on mRNA vaccines,
7042480	7047680	but to confidently say that millions of people are going to die because of these vaccines,
7047680	7053280	and to confidently say that ivermectin is a panacea, ivermectin is the thing that prevents
7053280	7060800	COVID, there was no good reason to say either of those things at that moment. Given that that's
7060800	7067200	where Brett was, I felt like there was nothing to debate. We're both the wrong people to be
7067200	7074240	getting into the weeds on this. We're both going to defer to our chosen experts. His experts look
7074240	7081840	like crackpots to me, or at least the ones who are most vociferous on those edgiest points,
7081840	7086800	that seem most... Your experts seem like, what is the term, mask hysteria? I forgot the term.
7087280	7094720	No, but it's like with climate science. This old, it's received as a canard in
7094720	7100400	half of our society now, but the claim that 97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused
7100400	7107920	climate change is a thing. Do you go with the 97% most of the time, or do you go with the 3% most
7107920	7113680	of the time? It's obvious you go with the 97% most of the time for anything that matters.
7113680	7119920	It's not to say that the 3% are always wrong. Again, things get overturned, and yes,
7120720	7124720	as you say, I've spent much more time worrying about this on my podcast than I've spent worrying
7124720	7136080	about COVID, our institutions have lost trust for good reason. It's an open question whether
7136960	7145200	we can actually get things done with this level of transparency and pseudo-transparency,
7145200	7151360	given our information ecosystems. Can we fight a war, really fight a war that we may have to
7151360	7157920	fight, like the next Nazis? Can we fight that war when everyone with an iPhone is showing just how
7157920	7165040	awful it is that little girls get blown up when we drop our bombs? Could we as a society
7165680	7173120	do what we might have to do to actually get necessary things done when we're living in this
7173120	7178880	panopticon of just everyone's a journalist, everyone's a scientist, everyone's an expert,
7178880	7185920	everyone's got direct contact with the facts or some or semblance of the facts? I don't know.
7185920	7190240	I think yes, and I think voices like yours are exceptionally important, and I think there's
7190320	7196000	certain signals you send in your ability to steal me on the other side, in your empathy,
7196000	7202160	essentially. That's the fight, that's the mechanism by which you resist
7204960	7212560	the dogmatism of this binary thinking, and then if you become a trusted person that's able to
7212560	7218320	consider the other side, then people will listen to you as the aggregators, the communicator of
7218320	7223760	expertise, because the virologists haven't been able to be good communicators. I still to this day
7224640	7232960	don't really know, what am I supposed to think about the safety and efficacy of the
7232960	7237200	vaccines today? As it stands today, what are we supposed to think? What are we supposed to think
7237200	7241680	about testing? What are we supposed to think about the effectiveness of masks or lockdowns?
7242320	7248480	Where's the great communicator on this topic that considered all the other conspiracy theories,
7248480	7254000	all the other, all the communication that's out there, and actually aggregating it together and
7254000	7259680	being able to say this is actually what's most likely the truth? And also some of that has to do
7259680	7266480	with humility, epistemic humility, knowing that you can't really know for sure, just like with
7266480	7272000	depression, you can't really know for sure. I'm not seeing those communications being
7272000	7278080	effectively done, even still today. Well, the jury is still out on some of it, and again,
7278080	7282880	it's a moving target. And some of it, it's complicated, some of it's a self-fulfilling
7284880	7293680	dynamic where, so like lockdowns, in theory, a lockdown would work if we could only do it,
7293680	7297200	but we can't really do it. And there's a lot of people who won't do it because they're convinced
7297200	7304480	that this is the totalitarian boot on finally on the neck of the good people who
7307600	7313200	are always having their interests traduced by the elites. So like this is, if you have enough
7313200	7318000	people who think the lockdown, for any reason in the face of any conceivable illness,
7318480	7325200	right, is just code for the New World Order coming to fuck you over and take your guns, right?
7325760	7330960	Okay, you have a society that is now immune to reason, right? Because there are absolutely
7330960	7339680	certain pathogens that we should lock down for next time, right? And it was completely rational
7339680	7345920	in the beginning of this thing to attempt to lock down. We never really locked down
7345920	7351520	to attempt some semblance of a lockdown, just to quote, bend the curve, to spare our
7351520	7356560	healthcare system, given what we were seeing happening in Italy, right? Like that moment
7356560	7363040	was not hard to navigate, at least in my view. It was obvious at the time, in retrospect, my
7363040	7370240	views on that haven't changed, except for the fact that I recognize maybe it's just impossible
7370880	7376800	given the nature of people's response to that kind of demand, right? We live in a society that's
7376800	7381840	just not going to lock down. Unless the pandemic is much more deadly. Right. So that's a point I
7381840	7386560	made, which was maliciously clipped out from some other podcast where someone's trying to
7386560	7391680	make it look like I want to see children die. There's a pity more children didn't die from COVID,
7391680	7400160	right? This is actually the same person who, and that's the other thing that got so poisoned here.
7400720	7405520	That person, this psychopath or effective psychopath who's creating these clips of me on
7405520	7412000	podcasts, the second clip of me seeming to say that I wish more children died during COVID,
7412000	7418560	but it was so clear in context what I was saying, that even the clip betrayed the context so it
7418560	7423440	didn't actually work. This psycho, and again, I don't know whether he actually is a psychopath,
7423440	7427840	but he's behaving like one because of the incentives of Twitter, this is somebody who
7427840	7436560	Brett Signal Boosted as a very reliable source of information, right? He kept retweeting this
7436560	7443200	guy at me, against me, right? And this guy, at one glance, I knew how unreliable this guy was,
7443200	7451600	right? But I think I'm not at all sad. One thing I think I did wrong, one thing that I do regret,
7451600	7461120	one thing I have not sorted out for myself is how to navigate the professional and personal
7461120	7470000	pressure that gets applied at this moment where you have a friend or an acquaintance or someone you
7470000	7478960	know who's behaving badly in public or behaving in a way that you think is bad in public.
7479840	7483920	And they have a public platform where they're influencing a lot of people,
7483920	7490000	and you have your own public platform where you're constantly getting asked to comment on what this
7490000	7498000	friend or acquaintance or colleague is doing. I haven't known what I think is ethically right
7498000	7505120	about the choices that seem forced on us at moments like this. So I've criticized you in public
7505120	7511360	about your interview with Kanye. Now, in that case, I reached out to you in private first and
7511360	7515520	told you exactly what I thought. And then when I was going to get asked in public or when I was
7515520	7520080	touching that topic on my podcast, I more or less said the same thing that I said to you in
7520080	7526640	private, right? Now, that was how I navigated that moment. I did the same thing with Elon,
7527600	7538880	at least at the beginning. We have maintained good vibes, which is not what I want to say about
7538880	7545920	Elon. I disagree with you because good vibes in the moment, there's a deep core of good vibes
7545920	7550720	that persists through time between you and Elon. And I would argue probably between some of the
7550720	7555600	other folks you mentioned. I think with Brett, I failed to reach out in private
7557120	7564800	to the degree that I should have. We had tried to set up a conversation in private that never
7564800	7572080	happened, but there was some communication. But it would have been much better for me to have made
7572080	7577440	more of an effort in private than I did before it spilled out into public. And I would say that's
7577440	7582160	true with other people as well. What kind of interaction in private do you think you should
7582160	7589120	have with Brett? Because my case would be beforehand and now still. The case I would like in this
7589120	7596000	part of the criticism you sent my way, maybe it's useful to go to that direction. Actually,
7596000	7601280	let's go to that direction because I think I disagree with your criticism as you stated publicly.
7601840	7606000	You're talking about your interview with Kanye? Yeah. The thing you criticized me for is actually
7606000	7611360	the right thing to do with Brett. Okay. You said Lex could have spoken with Kanye in such a way as
7611360	7617440	to have produced a useful document. He didn't do that because he has a fairly naive philosophy
7617440	7623520	about the power of love. Let's see if you can maintain that philosophy in the present.
7623520	7630800	Let's go. He's beautiful. He seemed to think that if he just got through the minefield
7630800	7636080	to the end of the conversation where the two of them still were feeling good about one another
7636080	7642880	and they can hug it out, that would be by definition a success. So let me make the case
7642880	7648640	for this power of love philosophy. And first of all, I love you, Sam. You're still an inspiration
7648640	7655360	and somebody I deeply admire. Okay. Back at you. To me, in the case of Kanye,
7655360	7663280	it's not only that you get through the conversation and have hugs, it's that the
7663280	7668640	display that you're willing to do that has power. So even if it doesn't end in hugging,
7669440	7675920	the actual, the turning the other cheek, the act of turning the other cheek itself communicates
7675920	7683360	both to Kanye later and to the rest of the world that we should have empathy and compassion
7683360	7689200	towards each other. There is power to that. Maybe that is naive, but I believe in the
7689200	7693360	power of that. So it's not that I'm trying to convince Kanye that some of his ideas are wrong,
7693920	7699280	but I'm trying to illustrate that just the act of listening and truly trying to understand the
7699280	7707760	human being, that is opens people's minds to actually questioning their own beliefs more.
7707760	7713280	It takes them out of the dogmatism, de-escalates the kind of dogmatism that I've been seeing.
7713520	7720880	So in that sense, I would say the power of love is the philosophy you might apply to Brett,
7720880	7726560	because the right conversation you have in private is not about, hey, listen, you're,
7726560	7731760	you know, the experts you're talking to, they seem credentialed, but they're not actually
7732400	7737120	as credentials as they illustrating, they're not grounding their findings in actual meta-analyses
7737120	7741280	and papers and so on, like making a strong case like, what are you doing? This is going to get a
7741280	7747360	lot of people in trouble, but instead just saying, like being a friend in the dumbest of ways, being
7749360	7755200	respectful, sending love their way, and just having a conversation outside of all of this.
7756640	7765600	Like basically showing that, like removing the emotional attachment to this debate,
7765600	7769680	even though you are very emotionally attached, because in the case of COVID specifically,
7769680	7776000	there is a very large number of lies at stake, but removing all of that and remembering that you
7776000	7782720	have a friendship. Yeah, well, so I think these are highly non-analogous cases, right? So your
7782720	7788560	conversation with Kanye misfired from my point of view for a very different reason. It was,
7788560	7795360	and it was, it has to do with Kanye. I mean, so Kanye, I don't know, I've never met Kanye,
7795360	7804080	so obviously I don't know him, but I think he's either obviously in the midst of a mental health
7804080	7810640	crisis, or he's a colossal asshole, or both. I mean, actually those aren't mutually exclusive.
7810640	7816960	So one of three possibilities, he's either mentally ill, he's an asshole, or he's mentally ill
7816960	7820880	and an asshole. I think all three of those possibilities are possible for the both of us
7820880	7825520	as well at the moment. No, I would argue none of those are likely for either of us.
7825520	7832720	But not to say we don't have our moments. So the reason not to talk to Kanye,
7832720	7837600	so I think you should have had the conversation you had with him in private. That's great,
7837600	7844320	and I've got no criticism of what you said had it been in private. In public, I just thought
7844640	7851200	you're not doing him a favor. If he's mentally ill, he's in the middle of a
7852640	7858800	manic episode, or I'm not a clinician, but I've heard it said of him that he is bipolar,
7860160	7863920	you're not doing him a favor sticking a mic in front of him and letting him
7863920	7871040	go off on the Jews or anything else. We know what he thought about the Jews. We know that
7871040	7875040	there's not much illumination that's going to come from him on that topic.
7876560	7880160	If it is a symptom of his mental illness that he thinks these things,
7881200	7887360	you're not doing him a favor making that even more public. If he's just an asshole and he's
7887360	7894160	just an anti-semite, an ordinary garden variety anti-semite, well then there's also not much to
7894160	7900880	say unless you're really going to dig in and kick the shit out of him in public. I'm saying you can
7900880	7907440	do that with love. That's the other thing here is that I don't agree that compassion and love always
7907440	7918960	have this patient embracing acquiescent face. They don't always feel good to the recipient.
7918960	7925280	There is a sort of wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments like that where
7925280	7930080	someone's full of shit and you just make it absolutely clear to them and to your audience
7930080	7934560	that they're full of shit. There's no hatred being communicated. In fact, you could just
7934560	7939920	like, listen, I'm going to do everyone a favor right now and just take your foot out of your
7939920	7947440	mouth. The truth is, I just wouldn't have aired the conversation. I just don't think it was a
7947440	7953920	document that had to get out there. This is not a signal you're likely to get from your
7953920	7958320	audience. I get that many people in your audience thought, oh my god, that's awesome. You're talking
7958320	7962960	to Kanye and you're doing it in Lex style where it's just love and you're not treating him like
7962960	7969120	a pariah and you're holding this tension between he's this creative genius who is work we love
7969120	7975760	and yet he's having this moment that's so painful and what a tight rope walk. I get that maybe 90%
7975760	7982080	of your audience saw it that way. They're still wrong and I still think that was unbalanced,
7982080	7985360	not a good thing to put out into the world. You don't think it opens up the mind and heart
7985360	7990880	of people that listen to that just have it? If it's opening it up in the wrong
7991920	7998320	direction where just gale force nonsense is coming in. I think we should have an open mind
7998320	8004160	and an open heart, but there's some clear things here that we have to keep in view.
8004720	8008800	The mental illness component is its own thing. I don't pretend to understand what's going on
8008800	8015040	with him, but insofar as that's the reason he's saying what he's saying, do not put this guy on
8015120	8019840	camera and let no one see it. Sorry, in that point real quick, I had a bunch of conversations with
8019840	8025760	him offline and I didn't get a sense of mental illness. That's why I chose to sit down and I
8025760	8032320	didn't get it. I mean, mental illness is such a... But when it shows up in a gimp put on Alex
8032320	8040960	Jones' podcast, is it either that's more genius performance in his world or he's unraveling further?
8040960	8046720	I wouldn't put that under mental illness. We have to... I think there's another conversation to be had
8046720	8059200	about how we treat artists because they're weirdos. They're very... I mean, taking words
8059200	8065520	from Akanya as if he's at Christopher Hitchens or something like that, very eloquent, researched,
8066320	8073680	written many books on history, on politics, on geopolitics, on psychology. Akanya didn't
8073680	8079280	do any of that. He's an artist just spouting off. And so it's a different style of conversation
8079280	8083440	and a different way to treat the words that are coming out of his mouth.
8083440	8086880	Let's leave the mental illness aside. If we're going to say that there's no reason to think
8086880	8090800	he's mentally ill and this is just him being creative and brilliant and opinionated,
8091680	8096560	well, then that falls into the asshole bucket for me. Then he's someone... And honestly,
8096560	8100560	the most offensive thing about him in that interview from my point of view is not the
8100560	8105520	anti-Semitism, which we can talk about because I think there are problems just letting him
8108080	8113360	spread those memes as well. But the most offensive thing is just how delusionally
8113360	8120160	egocentric he is or was coming off in that interview and in others. He has an estimation
8120160	8129280	of himself as this omnibus genius to not only rival Shakespeare, to exceed Shakespeare. He's
8129280	8134320	the greatest mind that has ever walked among us. And he's more or less explicit on that point.
8134320	8139040	And yet he manages to talk for hours without saying anything actually interesting or insightful
8139040	8146800	or factually illuminating. So it's complete delusion of a very Trumpian sort. It's like
8147200	8151040	when Trump says he's a genius who understands everything, but nobody takes him seriously,
8151840	8157680	it one wonders whether Trump takes himself seriously. Kanye seems to believe his own
8157680	8167600	press. He actually thinks he's just a colossus. And he may be a great musician. I'm not...
8169680	8172400	Certainly not my wheelhouse to compare him to any other musicians, but
8172960	8180880	one thing that's patently obvious from your conversation is he's not who he thinks he is
8180880	8186080	intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way. And so when you
8186080	8192640	couple that to the anti-Semitism he was spreading, which was genuinely noxious and
8192640	8199520	ill-considered and has potential knock-on effects in the black community. I mean,
8200080	8203680	there's an ambient level of anti-Semitism in the black community that is worth
8203680	8208240	worrying about and talking about anyway. There's a bunch of guys playing the knockout game in
8208240	8214960	Brooklyn just punching Orthodox Jews in the face. And I think letting Kanye air his anti-Semitism,
8214960	8220080	that publicly only raises the likelihood of that rather than diminishes it.
8220080	8224480	I don't know. So let me say just a couple of things. So one, my belief at the time
8225200	8228400	was it doesn't. It decreases it. Showing empathy while pushing back
8228960	8234800	decreases the likelihood of that. It might on the surface look like it's increasing it,
8234800	8239680	but that's simply because the anti-Semitism or the hatred in general is brought to the surface.
8239680	8245040	And then people talk about it. But I should also say that you're one of the only people
8245040	8251840	that wrote to me privately criticizing me. And out of the people I really respect and admire.
8251840	8256480	And that was really valuable that I had to, it's painful because I had to think through it for a
8256480	8264240	while. And it still haunts me because the other kind of criticism I got a lot of, people basically
8264240	8272640	said things towards me based on who I am that they hate me. You mean anti-Semitic things?
8272640	8277360	Yeah, anti-Semitic things. I just hate the word anti-Semitic. It's like racist.
8278080	8284160	But here's the reality. So I'm Jewish, although obviously not religious.
8289200	8293520	I've been a student of the Holocaust, obviously. I know a lot about that. And there's reason to
8295280	8301520	be a student of the Holocaust. But in my lifetime and in my experience, I have never
8301520	8306480	taken anti-Semitism very seriously. I have not worried about it. I have not
8307520	8312160	made a thing of it. I've done exactly one podcast on it. I had Barry Weiss on my podcast
8313200	8324800	when her book came out. But it really is a thing. And it's something we have to keep an eye on
8325360	8334960	societally because it's a unique kind of hatred. It's unique in that it's knit together with,
8334960	8339520	it's not just ordinary racism. It's knit together with lots of conspiracy theories that never seem
8339520	8347120	to die out. It can by turns equally animate the left and the right politically. I mean,
8347120	8352080	it was so perverse about anti-Semitism, look in the American context. With the far right,
8352160	8357840	with white supremacists, Jews aren't considered white. So they hate us in the same spirit in
8357840	8363280	which they hate black people or brown people or anyone who's not white. But on the left,
8363280	8368480	Jews are considered extra white. We're the extra beneficiaries of white privilege.
8369760	8376240	In the black community, that is often the case. We're a minority that has thrived. And it seems
8376240	8382880	to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems that other minorities suffer,
8382880	8389120	in particular African-Americans in the American context. Asians are now getting a little bit
8389120	8397680	of this, like the model minority issue. But Jews have had this going on for centuries and millennia.
8397680	8403520	And it never seems to go away. And again, this is something that I've never focused on. But
8404480	8412320	this has been at a slow boil for as long as we've been alive. And there's no guarantee it
8412320	8418080	can't suddenly become much, much uglier than we have any reason to expect it to become,
8418080	8424240	even in our society. And so there's kind of a special concern at moments like that where you
8424240	8432080	have an immensely influential person in a community who already has a checkered history with respect
8432080	8438160	to their own beliefs about the Jews and the conspiracies and all the rest. And he's just
8438160	8446000	messaging, not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who's given him the microphone at
8446000	8453200	that moment to the world. And so that made my spidey sense tingle.
8453200	8459520	Yeah, it's complicated. The stakes are very high. And I, somebody who's been obviously family and
8459520	8463760	also reading a lot about World War II, and just this whole period, it was a very difficult
8463760	8472560	conversation. But I believe in the power, especially given who I am of not always,
8472560	8478720	but sometimes often turning the other cheek. Oh yeah. And again, things change
8481360	8489200	when they're for public consumption. The cut for me that has just the use case,
8489200	8494400	I keep stumbling upon is the kinds of things that I will say on a podcast like this, or
8494400	8501200	if I'm giving a public lecture, versus the kinds of things I will say at dinner with strangers or
8501200	8506000	with friends. Like if you're in an elevator, like if I'm in an elevator with strangers, I do not
8506000	8511920	feel, and I hear someone say something stupid, I don't feel an intellectual responsibility to
8511920	8518400	turn around in the confines of that space with them and say, listen, that thing you just said
8518400	8525040	about X, Y, or Z is completely false and here's why. But if somebody says it in front of me on
8525040	8530880	some public dais where I'm actually talking about ideas, that's when there's a different
8530880	8534960	responsibility that comes online. The question is how you say it? How you say it?
8534960	8539440	Or even whether you say anything in those, I mean, there are moments, there are definitely
8539440	8544240	moments to privilege civility or just to pick your battles. I mean, sometimes it's just not
8544240	8548560	worth it to get into it with somebody out in real life.
8548560	8556480	I just believe in the power of empathy both in the elevator and when a bunch of people are listening,
8557680	8564080	that when they see you willing to consider another human being's perspective,
8565600	8569520	it just gives more power to your words after.
8570080	8579760	Well, yeah, but until it doesn't, because you can extend charity too far. It can be absolutely
8579760	8586080	obvious what someone's motives really are and they're dissembling about that. And so then you're
8586720	8591440	taking at face value, their representations begins to look like you're just being duped
8591440	8596480	and you're not actually doing the work of putting pressure on a bad actor.
8596800	8601920	So again, the mental illness component here makes it very difficult to think about
8602560	8604720	what you should or shouldn't have said to Kanye.
8604720	8609440	So I think the topic of platforming is pretty interesting. What's your view on
8610400	8616160	platforming controversial people? Let's start with the old, would you interview Hitler
8616880	8623040	on your podcast? And how would you talk to him? Oh, and follow question. Would you interview him
8623040	8631200	in 1935, 41, and then like 45?
8631840	8636640	Well, I think we have an uncanny valley problem with respect to this issue of
8638720	8642880	whether or not to speak to bad people. So if a person's sufficiently bad,
8642880	8648080	right, if they're all the way out of the valley, then you can talk to them and it's just totally
8648160	8653680	unproblematic to talk to them because you don't have to spend any time signaling to your audience
8653680	8656560	that you don't agree with them. And if you're interviewing Hitler, you don't have to say,
8656560	8661040	listen, I just got to say before we start, I don't agree with the whole genocide thing.
8661040	8668160	And I just think you're killing mental patients and vans and all that. That was all bad as a
8668160	8676080	bad look. It can go without saying that you don't agree with this person and you're not
8676080	8683680	platforming them to signal boost their views. You're just trying to... If they're sufficiently evil,
8683680	8690400	you can go into it very much as an anthropologist would... You just want to understand
8690400	8694400	the nature of evil. You just want to understand this phenomenon, like how is this person
8695520	8702080	who they are? And that strikes me as a intellectually interesting and
8702640	8708480	morally necessary thing to do, right? So, yes, I think you always interview Hitler.
8711120	8714160	Well, once he's... But when do you know it?
8714160	8718400	Once he's legitimately... But when do you know it? Is the genocide really happening?
8720000	8725440	42, 43? No, if you're on the cusp of it where it's just he's someone who's gaining power and you
8725440	8732000	don't want to help facilitate that, then there's a question of whether you can undermine him
8732720	8736560	while pushing back against him in that interview. So, there are people I wouldn't talk to
8737280	8741840	just because I don't want to give them oxygen and I don't think that in the context of my
8742640	8747280	interviewing them, I'm going to be able to take the wind out of their sails at all, right?
8748480	8753200	For whatever... Either because an asymmetric advantage because I just know that they can
8754160	8760480	do something within the span of an hour that I can't correct for.
8761440	8764960	It's like they can light many small fires and it just takes too much time to put them out.
8764960	8768480	That's more like on the topic of vaccines, for example, having a debate on the efficacy of
8768480	8773440	vaccines. Yeah. It's not that I don't think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant,
8773440	8781840	I think it is. Even these asymmetries aside, I mean, it is true that a person can always make
8781840	8786320	a mess faster than you can clean it up, right? But still, there are debates worth having even
8786320	8791440	given that limitation and they're the right people to have those specific debates. There's
8791440	8798160	certain topics where I'll debate someone just because I'm the right person for the job and
8798160	8803600	it doesn't matter how messy they're going to be. It's just worth it because I can make my points
8804320	8809280	land at least to the right part of the audience. So, some of it is just your own skill and
8809280	8814160	competence and also interest in preparing correctly? Well, yeah. In the nature of the
8814160	8819440	subject matter, but there are other people who just by default, I would say, well,
8820080	8824800	there's no reason to give this guy a platform. And there are also people who are so confabulatory
8824800	8833680	that they're making such a mess with every sentence that insofar as you're even trying
8833680	8840400	to interact with what they're saying, you're by definition going to fail and you're going to seem
8840400	8847360	to fail to an sufficiently large uninformed audience where it's going to be a net negative
8847360	8854960	for the cause of truth, no matter how good you are. So, for instance, I think talking to Alex
8854960	8861840	Jones on any topic for any reason is probably a bad idea because I just think he's just
8861840	8868320	neurologically wired under a string of sentences. He'll get 20 sentences out,
8868880	8879360	each of which contains more lies than the last. And there's not time enough in the world
8879360	8882880	to run down and certainly not time enough in the span of a conversation
8882880	8888880	to run down each of those leads to bedrock so as to falsify it. I mean, he'll just make
8888880	8898080	shit up or make shit up and then weave it in with half-truths and micro-truths
8898080	8903760	that give some semblance of credibility to somebody out there. I mean, apparently millions
8903760	8910080	of people out there. And there's just no way to untangle that in real time with him.
8910080	8916480	I have noticed that you have an allergic reaction to confabularitization.
8917440	8918560	Yeah, confabulation.
8918560	8924800	Confabulation, that if somebody says something a little micro-untruth,
8925680	8928000	it really stops your brain.
8928000	8931520	Here, I'm not talking about micro-untruths, I'm just talking about making up things out of
8931520	8937600	whole cloth. Just like, if someone says something, well, what about, and then the thing they put
8939440	8945680	at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo-facts, right, that you can't possibly
8945680	8951840	authenticate or not in the span of that conversation. Whether it's about UFOs or anything else,
8951840	8959440	right, they will seem to make you look like an agonormous when, in fact, everything they're
8959440	8964240	saying is specious, whether they know it or not. I mean, there's some people who are just
8964240	8968800	crazy, there's some people who are just bullshitting and they're not even tracking
8968800	8972880	whether it's true, it just feels good, and then some people are consciously lying about things.
8973440	8978880	Don't you think there's just a kind of jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should be able to
8978880	8985280	just wave off by saying, well, none of that is backed up by any evidence and just almost
8985280	8991680	take it to the humor place? Well, the thing is, the place I'm familiar with doing this and not
8991680	9002640	doing this is on specific conspiracies like 9-11 truth. Because of what 9-11 did to my
9003440	9009840	intellectual life, and they really just, you know, it sent me down a path for the better part
9009840	9015520	of a decade. Like, I became a critic of religion. I don't know if I was ever going to be a critic
9015520	9019920	of religion, right? But it happened to be in my wheelhouse because I spent so much time
9020560	9028800	studying religion on my own. And I was also very interested in the underlying spiritual
9028800	9039200	concerns of every religion. And so I was, you know, I devoted more than a full decade of my life
9039200	9044880	to just, you know, what is real here? What is possible? What is the nature of subjective
9044880	9050160	reality? And how does it relate to reality at large? And is there anything to, you know, who was
9050160	9057600	someone like Jesus or Buddha? And are these people frauds? Are these just myths? Or is there really
9058320	9064000	a continuum of insight to be had here that is interesting? So I spent a lot of time on that
9064720	9068000	question through my 20, the full decade of my 20s.
9068000	9070400	And that was launched in part by 9-11 truth or?
9070400	9075840	No, but then when 9-11 happened, I had spent all this time reading religious books,
9075840	9082000	understanding, empathically understanding the motivations of religious people, right? Knowing
9082000	9087040	just how fully certain people believe what they say they believe, right? So I took religious
9087040	9091600	convictions very seriously. And then people started flying planes into our buildings. And I,
9091600	9094880	so I knew that there was something to be said about that.
9094880	9095440	Allegedly.
9095440	9102400	The core doctrine to Islam, exactly. So I went down, so that became my wheelhouse for a time,
9103680	9111120	you know, terrorism and jihadism and related topics. And so the 9-11 truth conspiracy thing
9111840	9120400	kept getting aimed at me. And the question was, well, do I want to debate these people?
9120400	9122240	Yeah. Alex Jones, perhaps.
9122240	9125760	Yeah. So Alex Jones, I think, was an early purveyor of it, although I don't think I knew
9125760	9133840	who he was at that point. And so, and privately, I had some very long debates with people who,
9133840	9137600	you know, one person in my family went way down that rabbit hole. And I just, you know,
9137600	9142800	every six months or so, I'd literally write the two-hour email, you know, that would try to
9144160	9150240	deprogram them, you know, however ineffectually. And so I went back and forth for years on that
9150240	9155600	topic in private with people. But I could see the structure of the conspiracy. I could see the
9155600	9167440	nature of how impossible it was to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well so as to convince
9167440	9175680	anyone of anything who was not seeing the problematic structure of that way of thinking.
9175680	9181840	I mean, it's not actually a thesis. It's a proliferation of anomalies that don't,
9181840	9185840	you can't actually connect all the dots that are being pointed to. They don't connect in a
9185840	9191520	coherent way. They're incompatible, and their incompatibility is not being acknowledged.
9192080	9199360	But they're running this algorithm of things are never what they seem. There's always
9199360	9205920	malicious conspirators doing things perfectly. We see evidence of human incompetence everywhere
9205920	9212640	else. No one can tie their shoes, you know, expertly anywhere else. But over here,
9213840	9218640	people are perfectly competent. They're perfectly concealing things. Like thousands
9218720	9224560	of people are collaborating inexplicably. I mean, incentivized by what, who knows,
9224560	9229040	they're collaborating to murder thousands of their neighbors, and no one is breathing a
9229040	9234720	peep about it. No one's getting caught on camera. No one's breathe the word of it to a
9234720	9246400	journalist. And so I've dealt with that style of thinking, and I know what it's like to be
9246400	9252400	in the weeds of a conversation like that. And the person will say, okay, well, but what do you
9252400	9260400	make of the fact that all those F-16s were flown 800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9-11,
9260400	9265200	doing an exercise that hadn't even been scheduled for that day. But it was, and now all of these,
9265840	9270880	I dimly recall some thesis of that kind, but I'm just making these things up now, right? So
9270880	9274560	like that detail hadn't even been scheduled for that day. It was inexplicably run that day.
9274720	9281840	So how long would it take to track that down, right? The idea that this is anomalous, like there
9281840	9291280	was an F-16 exercise run on it, and it wasn't even supposed to be run that day, right? Someone
9291280	9299440	like Alex Jones, their speech pattern is to pack as much of that stuff in as possible at the highest
9299440	9305680	velocity that a person can speak. And unless you're knocking down each one of those things,
9305680	9310480	to that audience, you appear to just be uninformed. You appear to just not be,
9310480	9316640	you know, William, he didn't know about the F-16s. He doesn't know about Project Mockingbird. You
9316640	9319600	haven't heard about Project Mockingbird? I just made up Project Mockingbird. I don't know what
9319600	9326160	it is, but that's the kind of thing that comes tumbling out in a conversation like that. That's
9326160	9331760	the kind of thing, frankly, I was worried about in the COVID conversation, because not that someone
9331760	9338720	like Brett would do it consciously, but someone like Brett is swimming in a sea of misinformation
9338720	9344720	on social, living on Twitter, getting people sending the blog post and the study from
9346640	9350880	the Philippines that showed that in this cohort, Ivermectin did X, right? And
9351840	9361840	to actually run anything to ground, you have to actually do the work journalistically and
9361840	9368320	scientifically and run it to ground, right? So for some of these questions, you actually have
9368320	9376720	to be a statistician to say, okay, they used the wrong statistics in this experiment, right? Now,
9377120	9382960	yes, we could take all the time to do that, or we could at every stage along the way,
9384240	9391760	in a context where we have experts we can trust, go with what 97% of the experts are saying about
9391760	9396880	X, about the safety of mRNA, about the transmissibility of COVID, about whether to wear
9396880	9401520	masks or not wear masks. And I completely agree that that broke down
9402320	9414160	unacceptably over the last few years. But I think that's largely a social media and blogs
9414160	9422640	and the efforts of podcasters and sub-stack writers were not just a response to that.
9423920	9429840	I think it was a symptom of that and a cause of that, right? And I think we're living in an
9429840	9440240	environment where we've basically trained ourselves not to be able to agree about facts
9441040	9449920	on any topic, no matter how urgent, right? What's flying in our sky? What's happening in Ukraine?
9449920	9457200	Is Putin just denazifying Ukraine? I mean, there are people who we respect,
9457840	9465280	who are spending time down that particular rabbit hole. Maybe there are a lot of Nazis
9465280	9472960	in Ukraine and that's the real problem, right? Maybe Putin's not the bad actor here, right?
9472960	9478320	How much time do I have to spend empathizing with Putin to the point of thinking, well,
9478320	9484560	maybe Putin's got a point and it's like, what about the polonium and the nerve agents and the
9484560	9492000	killing of journalists and the Navalny? I'm not paying so much attention to that because
9492000	9496240	I'm following all these interesting people on Twitter and they're giving me some pro-Putin
9496880	9502320	material here. And there are some Nazis in Ukraine. It's not like there are no Nazis in
9502320	9507760	Ukraine. How am I going to wait these things? I think people are being driven crazy by Twitter.
9508560	9513360	Yeah. But you're kind of speaking to conspiracy theories that pollute everything.
9513360	9519440	And then every example you gave is kind of a bad faith style of conversation.
9520240	9526400	But it's not necessarily knowingly bad faith by the people who are worried about Ukrainian
9526400	9531680	Nazis. I mean, they're some of the same people. They're the same people who are worried about
9532640	9540320	Ivermectin got suppressed. Ivermectin is really a panacea, but it got suppressed because no one
9540320	9549040	could make billions on it. It's literally, in many cases, the same people and the same
9550560	9554960	efforts to unearth those. And you're saying it's very difficult to have conversations with those
9554960	9560880	kinds of people. What about a conversation with Trump himself? Would you do a podcast with Trump?
9562320	9567920	No. I don't think so. I don't think I'd be learning anything about him. It's like with
9568720	9571840	Hitler, and I'm not comparing Trump to Hitler, but-
9571840	9574880	Clip's guy, here's your chance. You got this one.
9574880	9581600	With certain world historical figures, I would just feel like, okay, this is an opportunity
9581600	9587760	to learn something that I'm not going to learn. I think Trump is among the most superficial people
9587760	9596400	we have ever laid eyes on. He is in public view. And I'm sure there's some distance between who he
9596400	9600800	is in private and who he is in public, but it's not going to be the kind of distance that's going
9600800	9612800	to blow my mind. And I think the liability, for instance, I think Joe Rogan was very wise not
9612800	9619280	to have Trump on his podcast. I think all he would have put himself in a situation where he
9619280	9624400	couldn't adequately contain the damage Trump was doing, and he was just going to make Trump seem
9624400	9634720	cool to a potentially new cohort of his massive audience. They would have had a lot of laughs.
9634800	9646640	Trump's funny. The entertainment value of things is so influential. It was that one debate where
9646640	9656160	Trump got a massive laugh on his line, only Rosie O'Donnell. The truth is, we're living
9656160	9662560	in a political system where if you can get a big laugh during a political debate, you win.
9663360	9668480	It doesn't matter who you are. That's the level of, it doesn't matter how uninformed you are,
9668480	9672160	it doesn't matter that half the debate was about what the hell we should do about
9673520	9680560	a threat of nuclear war or anything else. We're monkeys, right? And we like to laugh.
9681440	9687520	Well, because he brought up Joe, he's somebody like you I look up to. I've learned a lot from
9687520	9694720	him because I think who he is privately as a human being. Also, he's kind of the voice of
9694720	9702480	curiosity to me. He inspired me that so unending, open-minded curiosity, much like you are the
9702480	9708400	voice of reason. They recently had a podcast, Joe had recently a podcast with Jordan Peterson,
9708400	9717200	and I brought you up saying they still have a hope for you. Any chance you talk to Joe again,
9717680	9724160	reinvigorate your friendship? I reached out to him privately when I saw that.
9724160	9728400	Did you use the power of love? Joe knows I love him and consider him a friend,
9728400	9734080	right? So there's no issue there. He also knows I'll be happy to do his podcast
9735760	9741280	when we get that together. So there's no, I have got no policy of not talking to Joe or not doing
9741280	9749200	his podcast. I think we got a little sideways along these same lines where we've talked about
9749200	9756080	Brett and Elon and other people. It was never to that degree with Joe because
9759280	9763520	Joe's in a very different lane, right? He's unconsciously so. I mean, Joe is a
9763520	9771120	stand-up comic who interviews, who just is interested in everything, interviews the
9771120	9777440	widest conceivable variety of people and just lets his interests collide with their expertise or
9778000	9784240	lack of expertise. Again, it's a super wide variety of people. He'll talk about anything
9784800	9790640	and he can always pull the ripcord saying, I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm a comic.
9790640	9798160	I'm stoned. We just drank too much, right? It's very entertaining. To my eye, it's all in good
9798160	9803040	faith. I think Joe is an extraordinarily ethical, good person. Also doesn't use Twitter. Doesn't
9803040	9813920	really use Twitter. The crucial difference though is it because he is an entertainer first. I'm not
9813920	9818720	saying he's not smart and he doesn't understand things. What's potentially confusing is he's
9818720	9825760	very smart and he's also very informed. His full-time job is taught when he's not doing stand-up
9825760	9833840	or doing color commentary for the UFC. His full-time job is talking to lots of very smart people
9833840	9839680	at great lengths. He's created the Joe Rogan University for himself and he's gotten a lot of
9839680	9846560	information crammed into his head. It's not that he's uninformed, but he can always,
9846560	9850240	when he feels that he's uninformed or when it turns out he was wrong about something,
9850800	9855840	he can always pull the ripcord and say, I'm just a comic. We were stoned. It was fun.
9856800	9860160	Don't take medical advice from me. I don't play a doctor on the internet.
9862880	9868960	I can't quite do that. You can't quite do that. We're in different lanes. I'm not saying you and
9868960	9873600	I are in exactly the same lane, but for much of Joe's audience, I'm just this establishment
9873600	9880320	shill, just banging on about the universities and medical journals. It's not true,
9880320	9884960	but that would be the perception. As a counterpoint to a lot of what's being said on Joe's podcast
9884960	9891600	or certainly Brett's podcast on these topics, I can see how they would form that opinion.
9893280	9900320	In reality, if you listen to me long enough, you hear that I've said as much against the woke
9900400	9907200	nonsense as anyone, even any lunatic on the right who can only keep that bright shining object in
9907200	9912800	view. There's nothing that Candace Owens has said about wokeness that I haven't said about
9912800	9921680	wokeness in so far as she's speaking rationally about wokeness, but we have to be able to keep
9921680	9927040	multiple things in view. If you could only look at the problem of wokeness and you couldn't
9927040	9933680	acknowledge the problem of Trump and Trumpism and QAnon and the explosion of irrationality
9933680	9939680	that was happening on the right and bigotry that was happening on the right, you were just
9939680	9948080	disregarding half of the landscape. Many people took half of the problem in recent years. The last
9948080	9953440	five years is a story of many people taking half of the problem and monetizing that half of the
9953440	9961120	problem and getting captured by an audience that only wanted that half of the problem talked about
9961120	9971520	in that way. This is the larger issue of audience capture, which I'm sure it's an
9971520	9976320	ancient problem, but it's a very helpful phrase that I think comes to us courtesy of our mutual
9976320	9984480	friend Eric Weinstein. Audience capture is a thing, and I believe I've witnessed many
9985120	9990720	casualties of it. If there's anything I've been unguard against in my life professionally,
9990720	9997680	it's been that. When I noticed that I had a lot of people in my audience who didn't like my
9997680	10003840	criticizing Trump, I really leaned into it. When I noticed that a lot of the other cohort of my
10003840	10010080	audience didn't like me criticizing the far left and wokeness. I thought I was exaggerating that
10010080	10015920	problem. I leaned into it because I thought those parts of my audience were absolutely wrong,
10016480	10022880	and I didn't care about whether I was going to lose those parts of my audience. There are people
10022880	10028400	who have created, knowingly or not, there are people who've created different incentives for
10028400	10033600	themselves because of how they've monetized their podcasts and because of the kind of signal
10033600	10041120	they've responded to in their audience. Brett would consider this a totally invidious
10043120	10049440	ad hominem thing to say, but I really do worry that that's happened to Brett. I cannot explain
10049440	10056480	how you do 100 with all the things in the universe to be interested in, and of all the things he's
10056480	10061920	competent to speak intelligently about, I don't know how you do 100 podcasts in a row on COVID.
10063600	10068160	It makes no sense. You think in part audience capture can explain that?
10068160	10076880	I absolutely think it can. For example, do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake
10076880	10082720	on COVID or made a mistake on Trump? I'm not saying you feel that way, but do you feel this
10083360	10089440	pressure? You've attacked audience capture within the way you do stuff, so you don't feel
10090000	10092960	as much pressure from the audience, but within your own ego.
10093680	10098800	I mean, again, the people who think I'm wrong about any of these topics are going to think,
10098800	10108160	okay, you're just not admitting that you're wrong, but now we're having a dispute about specific facts.
10108160	10118480	There are things that I believed about COVID or worried might be true about COVID two years ago
10119200	10124640	that I no longer believe or I'm not so worried about now, and vice versa. I mean,
10124640	10126880	things have flipped, certain things have flipped upside down.
10129600	10135520	The question is, was I wrong? Here's a cartoon version of it, but this is something I said
10135520	10140640	probably 18 months ago, and it's still true. When I saw what Brett was doing on COVID,
10142720	10152320	let's call it two years ago, I said, even if he's right, even if he turns out that Ivermectin
10152320	10161040	is a panacea and the mRNA vaccines kill millions of people, he's still wrong right now. His reasoning
10161040	10170720	is still flawed right now. His facts still suck right now, and his confidence is unjustified now.
10171440	10180320	That was true then, that will always be true then, and not much has changed for me to revisit
10181200	10187520	any of my time points along the way. Again, I will totally concede that if I had teenage boys
10188320	10193120	and their schools were demanding that they be vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine,
10196000	10202240	I would be powerfully annoyed. I wouldn't know what I was going to do, and I would be doing more
10202240	10210480	research about myocarditis, and I'd be badgering our doctors, and I would be worried that we have
10210480	10216080	a medical system and a pharmaceutical system and a healthcare system and a public health system
10216080	10221440	that's not incentivized to look at any of this in a fine-grained way, and they just want one
10222720	10227680	blanket admonition to the entire population, just take the shot, you idiots.
10229520	10236080	I view that largely as a result, a panicked response to the misinformation explosion that
10236080	10242080	happened and the populist resistance animated by misinformation that just made it impossible to
10242080	10247600	get anyone to cooperate. Part of it is, again, a pendulum swing in the wrong direction,
10249120	10252800	somewhat analogous to the woke response to Trump and the Trumpist response to woke.
10254160	10258560	A lot of people have just gotten pushed around for bad reasons, but understandable reasons,
10259600	10269440	but yes, there are caveats. Things have changed about my view of COVID, but the question is,
10269440	10279920	if you roll back the clock 18 months, was I wrong to want to platform Eric Topol, a very
10279920	10288480	well-respected cardiologist on this topic, or Nicholas Christakis to talk about the network
10288480	10295440	effects of whether we should close schools. He's written a book on COVID, his network
10295440	10303920	effects, or his wheelhouse, both as an MD and as a sociologist. There was a lot that we believed
10303920	10313360	we knew about the efficacy of closing schools during the Spanish flu pandemic and others,
10314480	10322640	but there's a lot we didn't know about COVID. We didn't know how negligible the effects would be
10322800	10328880	on kids compared to older people. I really enjoyed your conversation with Eric Topol,
10328880	10335440	but also didn't. He's one of the great communicators in many ways on Twitter,
10335440	10344080	like distillation of the current data. I hope I'm not overstating it, but there is a bit of an
10344080	10352160	arrogance from him that I think could be explained by him being exhausted, by being constantly attacked
10352160	10357840	by conspiracy theories, like anti-vaxxers. To me, the same thing happens with people that
10359040	10366160	start drifting to being right-wing is to get attacked so much by the left, they become almost
10366160	10372560	irrational and arrogant in their beliefs. I felt your conversation with Eric Topol did not
10372560	10378640	sufficiently empathize with people that have skepticism, but also did not sufficiently
10378640	10384640	communicate uncertainty we have. Many of the decisions you made, many of the things you were
10384640	10389520	talking about, we're saying there's a lot of uncertainty, but this is the best thing we could
10389520	10394080	do now. Well, it was a forced choice. You're going to get COVID. Do you want to be vaccinated when
10394080	10403040	you get it? That was always, in my view, an easy choice. Up until you start breaking apart the
10403040	10408960	cohorts and you start saying, okay, wait a minute, there is this myocarditis issue in young men.
10409680	10416320	Let's talk about that. Before that story emerged, it was just clear that
10418560	10425840	this is, if it's not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped, it is still mitigating
10425920	10438400	severe illness and death. I still believe that it is the current view of most people competent to
10438400	10444160	analyze the data, that we lost something like 300,000 people unnecessarily in the US
10446080	10451360	vaccine hesitancy. I think there's a way to communicate with humility about the uncertainty
10451360	10458000	of things that would increase the vaccination rate. I do believe that it is rational and
10458000	10467760	sometimes effective to signal impatience with certain bad ideas and certain conspiracy theories
10467760	10474160	and certain forms of misinformation. I just think it makes you look like a douchebag most times.
10475120	10483120	Certain people are persuadable, certain people are not persuadable, but it's the opportunity
10483120	10489120	cost. Not everything can be given a patient hearing. You can't have a physics conference
10489840	10496400	and then let people in to just trumpet their pet theories about the grand unified vision of physics
10496960	10507280	when they're obviously crazy or when they're obviously half crazy. You begin to get a sense for
10507280	10513840	this when it is your wheelhouse, but there are people who declare their
10516160	10521200	irrelevance to the conversation fairly quickly without knowing that they have done it.
10521280	10533520	The truth is, I think I'm one of those people on the topic of COVID. It's never that I felt,
10534880	10541760	I know exactly what's going on here. I know these mRNA vaccines are safe. I know exactly how to run
10541760	10550080	a lockdown. This is a situation where you want the actual pilots to fly the plane. We needed
10550160	10557440	experts who we could trust. Insofar as our experts got captured by all manner of things,
10557440	10561520	some of them got captured by Trump. Some of them were made to look ridiculous just standing next
10561520	10568400	to Trump while he was bloviating about whatever. It's just going to go away. There's just 15 people
10569760	10572400	in a cruise ship and it's just going to go away. There's going to be no problem.
10575200	10578400	Many of these doctors think, I understand this better than them. They're just amazed at how I
10578400	10585040	understand this. You've got doctors, real doctors, the heads of the CDC and NIH standing
10585040	10593360	around just ashen-faced while he's talking. All of this was deeply corrupting of the public
10593360	10599520	communication of science. Again, I've banged on about the depredations of wokeness. The
10599520	10610560	woke thing was a disaster. It still is a disaster. The thing is, there's a big difference between
10610560	10615600	me and Brett in this case. I didn't do 100 podcasts on COVID. I did two podcasts on COVID.
10616320	10620880	The measure of my concern about COVID can be measured in how many podcasts I did on it.
10622000	10627360	Once we had a sense of how to live with COVID, I was just living with COVID, like,
10627360	10632640	okay, if you get vaxed or don't get vaxed, wear a mask or don't wear a mask. Travel or don't travel.
10632640	10639280	You've got a few things to decide, but my kids were stuck at home on iPads for too long. I
10639280	10645520	didn't agree with that. It was obviously not functional. I criticized that on the margins,
10645520	10651120	but there was not much to do about it. The thing I didn't do is make this my life and just
10652080	10659200	browbeat people with one message or another. We need a public health regime where we can trust
10659200	10668320	what the competent people are saying to us about what medicines are safe to take. Even in the
10668320	10672320	presence of that craziness is going to proliferate given the tools we've built, but in the absence
10672320	10678800	of that, it's going to proliferate for understandable reasons. It's not going to be good
10678800	10688080	next time when something orders of magnitude more dangerous hits us. In so far as I think about
10688080	10695760	this issue, I think much more about next time than this time. Before this COVID thing, you and
10695760	10701200	Brad had some good conversations. I would say we're friends. What do you admire most about
10701200	10705040	Brad outside of all the criticism we've had about this COVID topic?
10706960	10713840	I think Brad is very smart and he's a very ethical person who wants good things for the
10713840	10722800	world. I have no reason to doubt that. The fact that we're cross-wise on this issue does not mean
10722800	10729200	that I think he's a bad person. The thing that worried me about what he was doing,
10730080	10733840	and this was true of Joe, and this was true of Elon, this is true of many other people,
10733840	10741360	is that once you're messaging at scale to a vast audience, you incur a certain kind of
10741360	10750480	responsibility not to get people killed. I did worry that people were making decisions on the
10750480	10756080	basis of the information that was getting shared there. That's why I was, I think,
10756160	10763280	fairly circumspect. I just said, okay, give me the center of the fairway expert opinion
10763280	10769280	at this time point, and at this time point, and at this time point, and then I'm out. I don't
10769280	10774080	have any more to say about this. I'm not an expert on COVID. I'm not an expert on the safety of mRNA
10774080	10781840	vaccines. If something changes so as to become newsworthy, then maybe I'll do a podcast. I just
10781840	10790400	did a podcast on the lab leak. I was never skeptical of the lab leak hypothesis. Brett
10790400	10798160	was very early on saying, this is a lab leak at a point where my only position was, who cares
10798160	10803520	if it's a lab leak? The thing we have to get straight is, what do we do given the nature
10803520	10808480	of this pandemic? But also, we should say that you've actually stated that it is a possibility.
10808960	10814480	You just said it doesn't quite matter. The time to figure that out, now, I've actually,
10814480	10821520	I have had my podcast guest on this topic changed my view of this because one of the guests,
10822560	10829040	Alina Chan, made the point that actually the best time to figure out the origin of this is
10829760	10832880	immediately, because in the event you lose touch with the evidence, and I hadn't really
10832880	10839280	been thinking about that. If you come back after a year, there are certain facts you might not be
10839280	10848160	able to get in hand. But I've always felt that it didn't matter for two reasons. One is we had the
10848160	10853360	genome of the virus and we could design, we're very quickly designed, immediately designing
10853360	10857040	vaccines against that genome, and that's what we had to do. And then we had to figure out how to
10857760	10862880	vaccinate and to mitigate and to develop treatments and all of that.
10863600	10873360	So the origin story didn't matter. Generically speaking, either origin story was politically
10873360	10878720	inflammatory and made the Chinese look bad. And the Chinese response to this looked bad,
10878720	10884160	whatever the origin story, right? They're not cooperating. They're stopping their domestic
10884240	10890000	flights but letting their international flights go. They were bad actors and they should be treated
10890000	10897760	as such regardless of the origin. And I would argue that the wet market origin is even more
10897760	10905840	politically invidious than the lab leak origin. Because to my eye, the lab leak could happen
10905840	10912320	to anyone. All these advanced countries are running these dangerous labs. That's a practice
10912320	10919120	that we should be worried about in general. We know lab leaks are a problem. There have been
10919120	10923760	multiple lab leaks of even worse things that haven't gotten out of hand in this way but
10925040	10934640	worse pathogens. We're wise to be worried about this and on some level, it could happen to anyone.
10935520	10941280	The wet market makes them look like barbarians within another century. You've got to clean
10941280	10946160	up those wet markets. What are you doing putting a bat on top of a pangolin, on top of a duck?
10947600	10953760	Get your shit together. If anything, the wet market makes them look worse in my view. Now,
10953760	10959760	I'm sure that what they actually did to conceal a lab leak, if it was a lab leak,
10959760	10964400	all of that's going to look odious. Do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of that?
10964960	10973920	One of the big negative, I would say failures of Anthony Fauci and so on is to be transparent and
10973920	10977600	clear and it's just a good communicator about gain and function research, the dangers of that.
10981120	10987440	Why it's a useful way of research but it's also dangerous just being transparent about that as
10987440	10992880	opposed to just coming off really shady. Of course, the conspiracy theorists and the politicians are
10992880	11001440	not helping but this just created a giant mess. I would agree that that exchange with Fauci and
11001440	11011600	Rand Paul that went viral, I would agree that Fauci looked like he was taking refuge in very
11011600	11018960	lawyered language and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why we do it.
11019840	11024880	So, yeah, I think it looked shady, it played shady and it probably was shady. I don't know
11024880	11031760	how personally entangled he is with any of this but the gain of function research is something that
11033120	11040640	I think we're wise to be worried about and so far as I judge myself adequate to have an opinion on
11040640	11050320	this, I think it should be banned. Probably a podcast I'll do if you or somebody else doesn't
11050320	11061680	do it in the meantime, I would like a virologist to defend it against a virologist who would
11061680	11066240	criticize it. Forget about just the gain of function research. I don't even understand
11066240	11071520	virus hunting at this point. It's like, I don't even know why you need to go into a cave to find
11071520	11077680	this next virus that could be circulating among bats that may jump zoonotically to us.
11079440	11085600	Why do that when we can sequence in a day and make vaccines in a weekend?
11086800	11088560	What kind of head start do you think you're getting?
11088560	11091280	That's a surprising new thing, how quickly you can develop a vaccine.
11091280	11097280	Exactly. Yeah, that's really interesting but the shagginess around lab leak.
11098240	11103760	I think the point I didn't make about Brett's style of engaging this issue is people are using
11103760	11109920	the fact that he was early on lab leak to suggest that he was right about ivermectin and about mRNA
11111120	11120800	vaccines and all the rest. None of that connects and it was possible to be falsely confident.
11120800	11124400	You shouldn't have been confident about lab. No one should have been confident about lab leak
11124400	11129840	early even if it turns out to be lab leak. It was always plausible. It was never definite.
11129840	11136880	It still isn't definite. Zoonotic is also quite plausible. It certainly was super plausible then.
11138720	11146400	Both are politically uncomfortable. Both at the time were inflammatory to be banging on about
11146400	11149360	when we were trying to secure some kind of cooperation from the Chinese.
11150240	11155200	There's a time for these things and it's possible to be right by accident.
11161920	11169120	The style of reasoning matters whether you're right or not because your style of reasoning
11169120	11172160	is dictating what you're going to do on the next topic.
11172880	11181280	Sure, but this is a this multi-various situation here. It's really difficult to
11181280	11186880	know what's right on COVID given all the uncertainty, all the chaos, especially when you step outside
11186880	11193680	the pure biology, virology of it and you start to get into policy. It's really, yeah, it's just
11193680	11203360	trade-offs. Like transmissibility of the virus. Just knowing if 65% of the population gets
11203360	11208880	vaccinated, what effect would that have? Just even knowing those things, just modeling all those
11208880	11215120	things. Given all the other incentives, I mean Pfizer, I don't know what to think.
11215120	11220160	You hadn't had the CEO of Pfizer on your podcast. Did you leave that conversation feeling like
11221040	11223360	this is a person who is consciously
11228080	11237600	reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk?
11237600	11242800	Or did you think this person was making a good faith attempt to save lives
11243520	11251920	and had no taint of bad incentives or something between them?
11251920	11258320	The thing I sensed and I felt in part, it was a failure on my part,
11259840	11266080	but I sensed that I was talking to a politician. So it's not thinking of there was malevolence
11266080	11273200	there or benevolence. He just had a job. He put on a suit and I was talking to a suit,
11273200	11278480	not a human being. Now he said that his son was a big fan of the podcast, which is why he
11278480	11284480	wanted to do it. So I thought I would be talking to a human being. And I asked challenging questions
11284480	11291040	where I thought the internet thinks otherwise. Every single question in that interview was a
11291040	11296240	challenging one, but it wasn't grilling, which is what people seem to want to
11296960	11301120	do with pharmaceutical companies. There's a deep distress of pharmaceutical companies.
11301120	11308160	What's the alternative? I totally get that windfall profits at a time of public health
11308160	11319760	emergency looks bad. It is a bad look, but how do we reward and return capital to risk takers
11320480	11326960	who will spend a billion dollars to design a new drug for a disease that maybe only
11327760	11332080	harms a single digit percentage of the population? What do we want to encourage?
11333280	11338400	Who do we want to get rich? The person who cures cancer, do we want that person to get rich or
11338400	11344320	not? We want the person who gave us the iPhone to get rich, but we don't want the person who
11345120	11347360	cures cancer to get rich. What are we trying to do?
11347440	11351920	I think it's a very gray area. So what we want is the person who declares that they have a cure
11351920	11359440	for cancer to have authenticity and transparency. I think we're good now as a population smelling
11359440	11364880	bullshit. And there is something about the Pfizer CEO, for example, just CEO of the pharmaceutical
11364880	11371840	companies in general, just because they're so lured up, so much marketing PR people,
11372560	11379280	that you just smell bullshit. You're not talking a real human. It just feels like
11379920	11387600	none of it is transparent to us as a public. So this whole talking point that Pfizer's only
11387600	11393120	interested in helping people just doesn't ring true, even though it very well could be true.
11393120	11398960	It's the same thing with Bill Gates, who seems to be at scale helping a huge amount of people in
11398960	11404000	the world. And yet there's something about the way he delivers that message, where people like,
11405120	11409600	this seems suspicious. What's happening underneath this? There's certain kinds of
11409600	11416480	communication styles that seem to be more serve as better catalysts for conspiracy theories.
11417120	11420800	And I'm not sure what that is, because I don't think there's an alternative
11421520	11428320	for capitalism in delivering drugs that help people. But also at the same time,
11428320	11432960	there seems to need to be a more transparency. And plus regulation, that actually makes sense,
11434000	11438720	it seems like pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to corruption.
11440560	11447360	Yeah, I worry about all that. But I also do think that most of the people go into those
11447360	11451680	fields and most of the people going into government are doing it for good. And they're
11451680	11457680	non-psycopaths trying to get good things done and trying to solve hard problems. And they're
11457680	11466080	not trying to get rich. I mean, many of the people are, it's like, bad incentives or something.
11466080	11474640	Again, I've uttered that phrase 30 times on this podcast, but it's just almost everywhere it explains
11475600	11481120	normal people creating terrible harm. It's not that there are that many bad people.
11484640	11490080	Yes, it makes the truly bad people that much more remarkable and worth paying attention to. But
11491040	11502080	the bad incentives and the power of bad ideas do much more harm. Because that's what gets
11502080	11510800	good people running in the wrong direction or doing things that are clearly creating unnecessary
11510800	11518240	suffering. You've had and I hope still have a friendship with Elon Musk, especially over the
11518240	11523120	topic of AI. You have a lot of interesting ideas that you both share, concerns that you both share.
11524800	11528320	Well, let me first ask, what do you admire most about Elon?
11529280	11537200	Well, I had a lot of fun with Elon. I like Elon a lot. I mean, Elon, I knew as a friend,
11537200	11549200	I like a lot. It's not going to surprise anyone. He's done and he's continuing to do amazing
11549200	11559360	things. I think many of his aspirations are realized, the world will be a much better place.
11559360	11564720	I think it's just amazing to see what he's built and what he's attempted to build and what he may
11564720	11572320	yet build. Tesla with SpaceX? Yeah, I'm a fan of almost all of that. I mean, there are wrinkles
11572320	11578160	to a lot of that or some of that. All humans are full of wrinkles.
11578160	11582240	There's something very Trumpian about how he's acting on Twitter. I mean, Twitter,
11582240	11586800	I think Twitter, he thinks Twitter is great. He bought the place because he thinks it's so great.
11586800	11591680	I think Twitter is driving him crazy. I think he's needlessly complicating his life and
11592400	11597360	harming his reputation and creating a lot of noise and harming a lot of other people.
11598560	11604320	The thing that I objected to with him on Twitter is not that he bought it and made changes to it.
11605040	11610160	Again, I remain agnostic as to whether or not he can improve the platform.
11611280	11615920	It was how he was personally behaving on Twitter, not just toward me, but toward the world.
11616480	11625280	I think when you forward an article about Nancy Pelosi's husband being attacked, not as he was
11625280	11633120	by some lunatic, but that it's just some gay, trist gone awry. That's not what it seems. You
11633120	11641040	link to a website that previously claimed that Hillary Clinton was dead and that a body double
11641040	11647280	was campaigning in her place. That thing was exploding in Trumpistan as a conspiracy theory.
11647840	11652880	It was having its effect. It matters that he was signal boosting it in front of 130 million
11652880	11661440	people. It is with saying that your former employee, Yoel Roth, is a pedophile. It's like,
11661440	11667600	that has real consequences. It appeared to be complete bullshit and now this guy's getting
11667600	11674720	inundated with death threats. Elon, that's all that's totally predictable. He's behaving quite
11674720	11681760	recklessly. There's a long list of things like that that he's done on Twitter. It's not ethical.
11681760	11690080	It's not good for him. It's not good for the world. It's not serious. It's a very adolescent
11690080	11697520	relationship to real problems in our society. My problem with how he's behaved is that he's
11698800	11704080	purported to touch real issues by turns like, okay, do I give the satellites to Ukraine or not?
11705120	11711440	Do I minimize their use of them or not? Should I publicly worry about World War III or not?
11712080	11720160	He's doing this shit on Twitter. At the same moment, he's doing these other very
11721360	11727120	impulsive, ill-considered things and he's not showing any willingness to really clean up the
11727120	11734240	mess he makes. He brings Kanye on knowing he's an anti-Semite who's got mental health problems
11734240	11738480	and then kicks him off for a swastika, which I probably wouldn't have kicked him off for
11738480	11747840	a swastika. Can you really kick people off for swastikas? Are you a free speech absolutist if
11747840	11752960	you can't let a swastika show up? I'm not even sure that's enforceable in terms of service.
11754080	11758960	There are moments to use swastikas that are not conveying hate and not raising the risk of violence.
11758960	11759440	Clip that.
11761680	11766240	But so much of what he's doing, given that he's, again, scale matters. He's doing this in front
11766240	11769840	of 130 million people. That's very different than a million people and that's very different
11769840	11776400	than 100,000 people. When I went off the tracks with Elon, he was doing this about COVID.
11778320	11784400	Again, this was a situation where I tried to privately mitigate a friend's behavior
11785360	11792000	and it didn't work out very well. Did you try to correct him highlighting things he might be wrong
11792000	11798480	on or did you use the Lex Power Love method? I should write like a pamphlet for Sam Harris.
11798480	11802960	Well, no, but it was totally coming from a place of love because I was concerned about
11802960	11806800	his reputation. I was concerned about what he, I mean, there was a two-fold concern.
11806800	11811360	I could see what was happening with the tweet. I mean, he had this original tweet that was,
11812480	11817920	I think it was panic over COVID is dumb or something like that. This is, boy, this is in March,
11818720	11822240	this is early March, 2020. Oh, super early days.
11822240	11827120	Super early. When nobody knew anything, but we knew we saw what was happening in Italy,
11827120	11832400	right? It was totally kicking off. God, that was a wild time. That's when the toilet paper.
11832400	11838080	It was totally wild, but that became the most influential tweet on Twitter for that week.
11838080	11842320	I mean, it had more engagement than any other tweet, more than any crazy thing Trump was tweeting.
11842880	11853280	It went off, again, it was just a nuclear bomb of information. I could see that people were
11853280	11859040	responding to it like, wait a minute, okay, here's this genius technologist who must have
11859040	11863760	inside information about everything, right? Surely he knows something that is not on the
11863760	11871040	surface about this pandemic. They were reading into it a lot of information that I knew wasn't
11871040	11876320	there, right? At the time, I didn't even, I didn't think he had any reason to be
11876320	11878880	suggesting that. I think he was just firing off a tweet, right?
11880640	11883760	So I reached out to him in private, and I mean, because it was a private
11885520	11891440	text conversation, I won't talk about the details, but I'm just saying that's a case,
11892160	11896720	you know, among the many cases of friends who have public platforms and who did something that
11896720	11902240	I thought was dangerous and ill-considered. This was a case where I reached out in private
11902960	11912800	and tried to help, genuinely help, because it was just, I thought it was harmful and in every
11912800	11917520	sense, because it was being misinterpreted, and it was like, okay, you can say that panic over
11917520	11924080	anything is dumb, fine, but this was not how this was landing. This was like non-issue, conspiracy,
11925040	11928800	there's going to be no COVID in the US. It's going to peter out. It's just going to become
11928800	11933520	a cold. I mean, that's how this was getting received. Whereas at that moment, it was absolutely
11933520	11938160	obvious how big a deal this was going to be, or that it was going to, at minimum, going to be a
11938160	11943360	big deal. I don't know if it was obvious, but it was obvious that it was a significant probability
11943360	11948640	that it could be a big deal. I remember in March, it wasn't unclear, like, how big, because there
11948640	11953200	were still stories of it, like it's probably going to like the big concern, the hospitals might
11953280	11955680	overfill, but it's going to stay out in like two months or something.
11955680	11959680	Yeah, we didn't know, but there was no way we weren't going to have
11961120	11969280	tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum at that point. It was totally rational to be worried
11969280	11973920	about hundreds of thousands. And when Nicholas Christakis came on my podcast very early,
11974720	11979200	he predicted quite confidently that we would have about a million people dead in the US.
11979760	11986640	And that didn't seem, I think, appropriately hedged, but I mean, it was still just like,
11986640	11991200	okay, it's just going to, you just look at the, we're just kind of riding this exponential and
11993840	11999200	it's going to be, it'd be very surprising not to have that order of magnitude and not something
11999520	12008320	much less. And so anyway, I mean, again, to close the story on Elon,
12010880	12018720	I could see how this was being received and I tried to get him to walk that back. And then we
12020400	12028720	had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue. And that, so that intervention
12028800	12035600	didn't work. And it was not done, I was not an asshole, I was not, I was just concerned
12036400	12044640	for him, for the world, and then there are other relationships where
12046480	12050240	I didn't take the, but again, that's an example where taking the time didn't work,
12050240	12053200	right, privately. There are other relationships where I thought, okay,
12053200	12056960	this is just going to be more trouble than it's worth. And I said, I just ignored it. And
12057680	12064320	there's a lot of that. And frankly, again, I'm not comfortable with how this is all netted out,
12064320	12071440	because I don't know if, frankly, I'm not comfortable with how much time in this conversation
12071440	12078720	we've spent talking about these specific people. Like what good is it for me to talk about Elon
12078720	12083600	or bread or anything? I think there's a lot of good because those friendships, listen, as a fan,
12084240	12092960	these are the conversations I loved, love as a fan. And it feels like COVID has robbed the
12092960	12098320	world of these conversations. Because you are exchanging back and forth on Twitter. But that's
12098320	12102960	not what I mean by conversations, like long form discussions, like a debate about COVID,
12103680	12109440	like a normal debate. But there's no, there is no, Elon and I shouldn't be debating COVID.
12109440	12114000	You should be. Here's the thing with humility, like basically saying, we don't really know,
12114000	12119440	like the Rogan method, we don't, we're just a bunch of idiots. Like one is an engineer,
12119440	12124720	you're a neuroscientist, but like, it just kind of, okay, here's the evidence and be like normal
12124720	12129360	people. That's what everybody was doing. The whole world was like trying to figure out what the hell,
12129360	12134800	what? Yeah, but the issue was that at that, so at the moment I had this collision with Elon,
12135760	12141680	certain things were not debatable, right? It was just, it was absolutely clear where this was going.
12142240	12146240	It wasn't clear how far it was going to go or how quickly we would mitigate it, but
12146880	12152320	it was absolutely clear that it was going to be an issue, right? The train had come off the
12152320	12159440	tracks in Italy. We knew we weren't going to seal our borders. There were already people,
12160080	12165280	you know, there are already cases known to many of us personally in the U.S. at that point,
12167920	12174400	and he was operating by a very different logic that I couldn't engage with.
12174400	12179520	Sure, but that logic represents a part of the population and there's a lot of interesting
12179520	12184080	topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them, like the effectiveness of masks, like-
12184080	12188960	Yeah, but no, but where things broke down was not at the point of, oh, there's a lot to talk
12188960	12193920	about, a lot to debate, this is all very interesting, and who knows what's what. It broke down very
12193920	12203520	early at this is, you know, there's nothing to talk about here, like either there's a water bottle
12203520	12210160	on the table or there isn't, right? Well, technically, there's only one fourth of a water
12210160	12215120	bottle. So what defines a water bottle? Is it the water inside the water bottle? Is it the water
12215120	12218320	bottle? Well, I'm giving you as an example of it's worth a conversation.
12219040	12227520	This is difficult because we had an exchange in private and I want to honor not exposing
12227520	12235680	the details of it, but, you know, the details convinced me that there was not a follow-up
12235680	12243200	conversation on that topic. On this topic. That said, I hope, and I hope to be part of helping
12243280	12247760	that happen, that the friendship is rekindled because one of the topics I care a lot about,
12247760	12253680	artificial intelligence, you've had great public and private conversations about this topic.
12254400	12260640	Yeah, and Elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously. I mean, he and I went to
12260640	12267040	that initial conference in Puerto Rico together and it was only because he was going and I found
12267040	12272240	out about it through him and I just wrote his coattails to it, you know, that I got to
12273280	12278320	dropped in that side of the pool to hear about these concerns at that point.
12279040	12287280	It would be interesting to hear how has your concern evolved with the coming out of ChadGPT
12288240	12293680	and these new large language models that are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning and
12293680	12299120	seemingly to be able to do some incredible human-like things. There's two questions. One,
12299120	12304080	how is your concern in terms of AGI and superintelligence evolved and how impressed are you
12304080	12308560	with ChadGPT as a student of the human mind and mind in general?
12310080	12318080	Well, my concern about AGI is unchanged. I've spoken about it a bunch on my podcast,
12318080	12326000	but I did a TED talk in 2016, which was the kind of summary of what that conference and
12326960	12332240	various conversations I had after that did to my brain on this topic.
12333680	12340720	Basically, once superintelligence is achieved, there's a take-off. It becomes exponentially
12340720	12345920	smarter and in a matter of time, they're just where ants and they're gods.
12346880	12357600	Yeah, unless we find some way of permanently tethering a superintelligent,
12357600	12364000	superintelligent self-improving AI to our value system. I don't believe anyone has figured out
12364000	12367440	how to do that or whether that's even possible in principle. I know people like Stuart Russell,
12367440	12372880	who I just had on my podcast, are trying- Oh, really? Have you released it?
12372960	12376960	I haven't released it yet. He's been on previous podcasts, but we just recorded this week.
12377600	12381600	Because you haven't done an AI podcast in a while, so it's great. He's a good person to
12381600	12388160	talk about alignment with. Yeah, so Stuart has been probably more than anyone,
12388160	12392000	my guru on this topic. I mean, you're just reading his book and doing, I think I've done
12392640	12396720	two podcasts with him at this point. I think it's called The Control Problem or something like that.
12396720	12399040	His book is Human Compatible.
12399760	12406400	Yeah, he talks about the control problem. Yeah, so I just think the idea that we can
12406400	12413520	define a value function in advance that permanently tethers a self-improving
12413520	12422000	superintelligent AI to our values as we continue to discover them, refine them,
12422000	12428800	extrapolate them in an open-ended way, I think that's a tall order. I think
12428800	12434000	there are many more ways, there must be many more ways of designing superintelligence that
12434000	12440160	is not aligned in that way and is not ever approximating our values in that way. So Stuart's
12440160	12447360	idea to put it in a very simple way is that he thinks you don't want to specify the value
12447360	12452880	function up front. You don't want to imagine you could ever write the code in such a way as to
12452880	12462800	admit of no loophole. You want to make the AI uncertain as to what human values are and perpetually
12462800	12469120	uncertain and always trying to ameliorate that uncertainty by hewing more and more closely
12469120	12475760	to what our professed values are. So it's always interested in saying, oh, no, no, that's not what
12475760	12480800	we want. That's not what we intend. Stop doing that. No matter how smart it gets, all it wants
12480800	12487440	to do is more perfectly approximate human values. I think there are a lot of problems with that at
12487440	12490800	a high level. I'm not a computer scientist, so I'm sure there are many problems at a low level
12490800	12496320	that I don't understand. Like how to force a human into the loop always, no matter what.
12496320	12504720	There's that and what humans get a vote and what do humans value and what is the difference between
12505440	12513200	what we say we value and our revealed preferences. If you were a super intelligent AI that could
12513200	12521040	look at humanity now, I think you could be forgiven for concluding that what we value is
12521920	12528080	driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and living perpetually on the brink of nuclear war and just
12528080	12532800	watching hot girls and yoga pants on TikTok again and again and again.
12533200	12539840	You're saying that is not? This is all revealed preference and it's what is an AI to make of
12539840	12546640	that and what should it optimize? So part of this is also Stuart's observation that
12547680	12552160	one of the insidious things about the YouTube algorithm is it's not that it just caters
12553120	12560080	to our preferences. It actually begins to change us in ways so as to make us more predictable.
12560080	12567040	If I could find ways to make us a better reporter of our preferences and to trim our
12567040	12574480	preferences down so that it can further train to that signal. So the main concern is that
12575680	12581520	most of the people in the field seem not to be taking intelligence seriously.
12582000	12589440	So as they design more and more intelligent machines and as they profess to want to design
12589440	12598320	true AGI, they're not spending the time that Stuart is spending trying to figure out how to
12598320	12605200	do this safely above all. They're just assuming that these problems are going to solve themselves
12605680	12609600	as we make that final stride into the end zone or they're saying very
12612640	12620240	polyanish things like an AI would never form a motive to harm human. Why would it ever form a
12620240	12627920	motive to be malicious toward humanity unless we put that motive in there? That's not the concern.
12627920	12637360	The concern is that in the presence of vast disparities and competence and in certainly
12637360	12641120	in a condition where the machines are improving themselves, they're improving their own code,
12641840	12648640	they could be developing instrumental goals that are antithetical to our well-being
12648640	12656000	without any intent to harm us. It's analogous to what we do to every other species on Earth.
12656000	12664320	You and I don't consciously form the intention to harm insects on a daily basis, but there are many
12664320	12671040	things we could intend to do that would in fact harm insects because you decide to repave your
12671040	12677760	driveway or whatever you're doing. You're just not taking the interest of insects into account
12677760	12682560	because they're so far beneath you in terms of your cognitive horizons.
12682800	12692240	The real challenge here is that if you believe that intelligence scales up on a continuum
12693280	12698720	toward heights that we can only dimly imagine. I think there's every reason to believe that.
12698720	12701600	There's no reason to believe that we're near the summit of intelligence.
12702560	12712400	Maybe there are some forms of intelligence for which this is not true, but for many
12712400	12718320	relevant forms, like the top 100 things we care about cognitively, I think there's every reason
12718320	12723520	to believe that many of those things, most of those things, are a lot like chess or go,
12723520	12727680	where once the machines get better than we are, they're going to stay better than we are, although
12728240	12731600	I don't know if you caught the recent thing with Go where this guy actually came out of
12731600	12736320	Stewart's lab. One time a human beta machine.
12737840	12743920	They found a hack for that. But anyway, ultimately, there's going to be no looking back. And then
12743920	12753840	the question is, what do we do in relationship to these systems that are more competent than we
12753840	12761360	are in every relevant respect? Because it will be a relationship. The people who think we're just
12761360	12767520	going to figure this all out without thinking about it in advance, the solutions are just going to
12767520	12778240	find themselves, seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating autonomous super
12778240	12785440	intelligence seriously. What does that mean? It's every bit as independent and
12785440	12791680	ungovernable, ultimately, as us having created, I mean, just imagine if we created a race of people
12792240	12797440	that were 10 times smarter than all of us. How would we live with those people? They're 10 times
12797440	12802000	smarter than us, right? They begin to talk about things we don't understand. They begin to want
12802000	12806880	things we don't understand. They begin to view us as obstacles to them, to their solving those
12806880	12813680	problems or gratifying those desires. We become the chickens or the monkeys in their presence.
12813680	12823920	And I think that it's, but for some amazing solution of the sort that Stuart is imagining,
12823920	12829360	that we could somehow anchor their reward function permanently, no matter how intelligent scales.
12829920	12840880	I think it's really worth worrying about this. I do buy the sci-fi notion that this is an
12840880	12847120	existential risk if we don't do it well. I worry that we don't notice it. I'm deeply impressed
12847120	12854080	with Chad GPT and I'm worried that it will become super intelligent. These language models will
12854080	12857840	become super intelligent because they're basically trained in the collective intelligence of the
12857840	12863280	human species and then it will start controlling our behavior if they're integrated into our algorithms,
12864320	12871760	the recommender systems. And then we just won't notice that there's a super intelligent system
12871760	12878720	that's controlling our behavior. Well, I think that's true even before, far before super intelligence,
12878720	12885680	even before general intelligence. I mean, I think just the narrow intelligence of these algorithms
12885680	12901120	and of what something like Chad GPT can do, I mean, it's just far short of it developing its own
12902000	12910000	goals and that are at cross purposes with ours. Just the unintended consequences of
12910880	12917280	using it in the ways we're going to be incentivized to use it and the money to be made from scaling
12917280	12924480	this thing and what it does to our information space and our sense of just being able to get
12924480	12936320	to ground truth on any facts, it's super scary. Do you think it's a giant leap in terms of the
12936320	12946800	development towards AGI, Chad GPT, or is it just an impressive little toolbox? So when do you think
12946800	12953360	the singularity is coming? Or is it T? It doesn't matter. I have no intuitions on that front,
12953360	12960400	apart from the fact that if we continue to make progress, it will come. You just have to assume
12960400	12964320	we continue to make progress. There's only two assumptions. You have to assume
12965120	12971600	substrate independence. So there's no reason why this can't be done in silico. We can build
12971600	12979440	arbitrarily intelligent machines. There's nothing magical about having this done in the wet wear
12979440	12984400	of our own brains. I think that is true and I think that's scientifically parsimonious to think
12984400	12989520	that that's true. Then you just have to assume we're going to keep making progress. It doesn't
12989520	12993520	have to be any special rate of progress. It doesn't have to be Moore's law. It can just be,
12993520	13000320	we just keep going. At a certain point, we're going to be in relationship to minds leaving
13000320	13007440	consciousness aside. I don't have any reason to believe that they'll necessarily be conscious by
13007440	13012800	virtue of being super intelligent and that's its own interesting ethical question. But
13015200	13022800	leaving consciousness aside, they're going to be more competent than we are. Then that's like
13023520	13031120	the aliens have landed. That's an encounter with, again, leaving aside the possibility that
13031120	13039920	something like Stewart's path is actually available to us. But it is hard to picture
13041360	13045200	if what we mean by intelligence, all things considered and it's truly general,
13045200	13062880	if that scales and begins to build upon itself, how you maintain that perfect slavish devotion
13063680	13067360	until the end of time in those systems. The tether to humans?
13068160	13076880	I think my gut says that there's a lot of ways to do it. It's not this increasingly impossible
13076880	13085760	problem. I'm not a computer scientist. I have no intuitions about his algorithmically
13085760	13092240	how you would approach that and what's possible. My main intuitions is maybe deeply flawed, but the
13092320	13097840	main intuition is based on the fact that most of the learning is currently happening on human
13097840	13106240	knowledge. So even chat GPT is just trained on human data. I don't see where the takeoff happens
13106240	13112160	where you completely go above human wisdom. The current impressive aspect of chat GPT is that's
13112160	13119840	using collective intelligence of all of us. From what I glean, again, from people who know much
13119840	13128160	more about this than I do, I think we have reason to be skeptical that these techniques of deep
13128160	13136320	learning are actually going to be sufficient to push us into AGI. They're not generalizing in the
13136320	13143920	way they need to. They're certainly not learning like human children. There's brittle and strange
13143920	13153840	ways. It's not to say that the human path is the only path. Maybe we might learn better lessons
13153840	13162880	by ignoring the way brains work, but we know that they don't generalize and use abstraction the way
13162880	13171520	we do. They have strange holes in their competence. But the size of the holes is shrinking every time.
13171920	13179680	That's so the intuition starts to slowly fall apart. The intuition is surely can't be this simple
13179680	13187600	to achieve intelligence. It's becoming simpler and simpler. The progress is quite incredible.
13187600	13192160	I've been extremely impressed with chat GPT and the new models, and there's a lot of financial
13192160	13197920	incentive to make progress in this regard. We're going to be living through some very interesting
13197920	13206480	times. In raising a question that I'm going to be talking to you, a lot of people brought up this
13206480	13211680	topic probably because Eric Weinstein talked to Joe Rogan recently and said that he and you were
13211680	13221680	contacted by folks about UFOs. Can you clarify the nature of this contact? I've got very little
13221680	13227600	to say on this. He has much more to say. I think he went down this rabbit hole further than
13228080	13234800	I did, which wouldn't surprise anyone. He's got much more of a taste for this sort of thing than
13234800	13240480	I do, but I think we're contacted by the same person. It wasn't clear to me who this person was
13240480	13249200	or how this person got that my cell phone number. It didn't seem like we were getting
13249200	13253920	punked. I mean, the person seemed credible to me. Then we're talking to you about the release of
13253920	13258320	different videos on UFOs. Yeah. This is when there was a flurry of activity around this. There
13258320	13268160	was a big New Yorker article on UFOs and there was rumors of congressional hearings, I think,
13268160	13278560	come in and the videos that were being debunked or not. This person contacted both of us, I think,
13278560	13282640	around the same time. I think he might have contacted Rogan or other. Eric is just the only
13282640	13294800	person I've spoken to about it, I think, who I know was contacted. What happened is the person
13294800	13302640	kept writing a check that he didn't cash. He kept saying, okay, next week, I understand this is
13302640	13308640	sounding spooky and you have no reason to really trust me, but next week I'm going to put you on
13308640	13314000	a Zoom call with people who you will recognize and they're going to be former heads of the CIA.
13316560	13322160	Within five seconds of being on the Zoom call, you'll know this is not a hoax. I said, great,
13322160	13331440	just send me the Zoom link. That happened maybe three times. There was just one phone conversation
13331440	13339760	and then it was just texts. There's just a bunch of texts. I think Eric spent more time with this
13339760	13348000	person and I haven't spoken to him about it. I know he's spoken about it publicly. It's not
13348000	13353120	that my bullshit detector ever really went off in a big way, it's just the thing never happened.
13354160	13360880	I lost interest. You made a comment which is interesting, which I really appreciate.
13360960	13366880	You ran a thought experiment of saying, okay, maybe we do have alien spacecraft,
13366880	13373280	or just a thought experiment that aliens did visit, and then this very kind of nihilistic,
13373280	13379440	sad thought that it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't affect your life. Can you explain that?
13381280	13388320	I think many people noticed this. This was a sign of how crazy the news cycle was at that
13388320	13393360	point. We had COVID, we had Trump, and I forget when the UFO thing was really kicking off, but
13394880	13400960	it just seemed like no one had the bandwidth to even be interested in this. I was amazed to
13402000	13410960	notice in myself that I wasn't more interested in figuring out what was going on. I considered,
13411200	13418480	wait a minute. If this is true, this is the biggest story in anyone's lifetime. I mean,
13418480	13425680	contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest story in anyone's lifetime in human
13425680	13435200	history. Why isn't this just totally captivating? Not only was it not totally captivating,
13435200	13439920	it was just barely rising to the level of my being able to pay attention to it.
13442880	13454240	One, to some degree, an understandable defense mechanism against the bogus claims that have
13454240	13460800	been made about this kind of thing in the past. The general sense is probably bullshit,
13461040	13465360	it probably has some explanation that is purely terrestrial and not surprising.
13465920	13471920	And there is somebody who, what's his name? Is it Mick West? I forget, is it a YouTuber?
13471920	13473680	Yeah, Mick West, yeah. He debunked stuff.
13473680	13480640	Yeah, I mean, I have since seen some of those videos. Now this is going back still at least
13480640	13487040	a year, but some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of some of the optical evidence.
13488000	13495360	And I'm surprised we haven't seen more of that. There was a fairly credulous 60 minutes piece
13495360	13499600	that came out around that time looking at some of that video, and it was the very video that he
13499600	13505120	was debunking on YouTube, and his video only had like 50,000 views on it or whatever.
13506960	13510800	But again, it seemed like a fairly credible debunking. I haven't seen debunkings of his
13510800	13514960	debunkings, but- I think there is, but he's basically saying that there is
13515760	13518080	there is possible explanations for it. Right.
13518080	13521280	And usually in these kinds of contexts, if there's a possible explanation,
13521280	13528800	even if it seems unlikely, it's going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us.
13528800	13532080	Yeah, it's the extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle,
13532080	13534640	which I think is generally true.
13534640	13539440	Well, with aliens, I think generally, I think there should be some humility about
13539440	13544080	what they would look like when they show up. I tend to think they're already here.
13544080	13547840	The amazing thing about this AI conversation, though, is that we're talking about a circumstance
13547840	13555600	where we would be designing the aliens, and there's every reason to believe that
13555600	13561760	eventually this is going to happen. I'm not at all skeptical about the coming reality
13561760	13563520	of the aliens, that we're going to build them.
13563520	13567200	Now, here's the thing. Does this apply to when superintelligence shows up?
13568160	13573040	Will this be trending on Twitter for a day, and then we'll go on to complain about
13574080	13577360	something Sam Harris once again said in his podcast the next day?
13577360	13582640	You tend to trend on Twitter, even though you're not on Twitter, which is great.
13582640	13588560	Yeah, I haven't noticed. I did notice when I was on, but-
13589520	13596400	Do you have this concern about AGI, basically, the same kind of thing that we would just
13596400	13601440	look the other way? Is there something about this time where even like World War III,
13601440	13608320	which has been throwing around very casually, concerningly so, even that the new cycle wipes
13608320	13616720	that away? Yeah. Well, I think we have this general problem that we can't make
13618880	13630480	certain information, even unequivocally certain information, emotionally salient.
13631920	13637120	We respond quite readily to certain things. As we talked about, we respond to the
13638560	13644240	little girl who fell down a well. That gets 100% of our emotional resources, but
13645200	13652160	the abstract probability of nuclear war, even a high probability, even an intolerable
13652160	13663200	probability, even if we put it at 30%. That's Russian roulette with a gun with three chambers,
13663200	13667680	and it's aimed at the heads, not only your head, but your kid's head and everyone's kid's head,
13667680	13676720	and it's just 24 hours a day. I think people who, this pre-Ukraine, I think the people who have
13676720	13683040	made it their business to professionally to think about the risk of nuclear war and to
13683040	13691040	mitigate it, people like Graham Allison or William Perry. I think they were putting the
13691680	13699440	ongoing risk, the risk that we're going to have a proper nuclear war at some point in the next
13700000	13706320	generation, people were putting it at something like 50%. They were living with this sort of
13706320	13713920	Damocles over our heads. Now, you might wonder whether anyone could have reliable intuitions
13713920	13720800	about the probability of that kind of thing, but the status quo is truly alarming. We've got
13722000	13728880	we've got ICBMs on the leaf side, smaller exchanges and tactical nukes and how we could
13728880	13739520	have a world war based on incremental changes. We've got the biggest bombs aimed at the biggest
13739520	13750800	cities in both directions, and it's old technology. It's vulnerable to some lunatic
13750800	13757360	deciding to launch or misreading bad data, and we know we've been saved from nuclear war
13760080	13767840	I think at least twice by Soviet submarine commanders deciding, I'm not going to pass
13767840	13775360	this up the chain of command. This is almost certainly an error, and it turns out it was an
13775920	13785360	error. We need people to, in that particular case, he saw, I think it was five what seemed
13785360	13791920	like five missiles launched from the US to Russia, and he reasoned if America was going to engage
13791920	13797360	in a first strike, they'd launched more than five missiles. This has to be fictional,
13797360	13804560	and then he waited long enough to decide that it was fictional. The probability of a nuclear war
13804560	13811520	happening by mistake or some other species of inadvertence, misunderstanding,
13813360	13820720	technical malfunction, that's intolerable. Forget about the intentional use of it by
13821360	13830000	people who are driven crazy by some ideology. More and more technologies are unable to kind
13830000	13837120	of scale destruction. Misinformation plays into this picture in a way that is especially
13837120	13845200	scary. Once you can get a deep fake of any current president of the United States claiming to have
13845200	13852880	launched a first strike and just send that everywhere. They could change the nature of truth,
13852880	13860160	and then that might change the engine we have for skepticism is sharpening it,
13861120	13866800	the more you have deep fakes. We might have AI and digital watermarks that help us. Maybe we'll
13867520	13875760	not trust any information that hasn't come through specific channels. In my world,
13876720	13888000	I no longer feel the need to respond to anything other than what I put out in my channels of
13888000	13894480	information. There are so many people who have clipped stuff of me that shows the opposite of
13894480	13899200	what I was actually saying in context. The people who have re-edited my podcast audio to make it
13899200	13905360	seem like I said the opposite of what I was saying. Unless I put it out, you can't be sure
13905360	13915360	that I actually said it. But I don't know what it's like to live like that for all forms of
13915360	13925360	information. Strangely, I think it may require a greater siloing of information in the end.
13928640	13933200	We're living through this wild west period where everyone's got a newsletter and everyone's got a
13933200	13937600	blog and everyone's got an opinion. But once you can fake everything.
13937600	13943360	There might be a greater value for expertise for experts, but a more rigorous system for
13943360	13948480	identifying who the experts are. Yeah, or just knowing that it's going to be an arms race to
13949600	13957360	authenticate information. So it's like, if you can never trust a photograph unless it has been
13957360	13964640	vetted by Getty Images because only Getty Images has the resources to authenticate the provenance
13964640	13971600	of that photograph and a test that hasn't been meddled with by AI. And again, I don't even know
13971600	13979040	if that's technically possible. And maybe whatever the tools available for this will be commodified
13979040	13984160	and the cost will be driven to zero so quickly that everyone will be able to do it. It could be
13984160	13990560	like encryption. And it will be proven and tested most effectively first, of course, as always in
13990560	13997920	porn, which is where most of human innovation technology happens first. Well, I have to ask
13997920	14002880	because Ron Howard, the director asked us on Twitter, since we're talking about the threat
14002880	14007840	of nuclear war and otherwise, he asked, I'd be interested in both your expectations for human
14007840	14014880	society if when we move beyond Mars, will those societies be industrial based? How will it be
14014880	14021440	governed? How will criminal infractions be dealt with when you read or watch sci-fi what comes
14021440	14027520	closest to sounding logical? Do you think about our society beyond Earth? If we call it as Mars,
14027520	14034000	if we call it as space? Yeah, well, I think I have a pretty humbling picture of that. I mean,
14034480	14040160	because we're still going to be the apes that we are. So when you imagine colonizing Mars,
14040880	14046400	you have to imagine a first fistfight on Mars. You have to imagine a first murder on Mars.
14046400	14051600	Also infidelity? Yeah, extramarital affairs on Mars. So it's going to get
14053520	14059840	really homely and boring really fast, I think. It's like only the spacesuits or the other
14060240	14069600	exigencies of just living in that atmosphere or lack thereof will limit how badly we can behave on Mars.
14070160	14074640	But do you think most of the interaction will be still in meat space versus digital? Do you think
14074640	14080880	there'll be, do you think we're like living through a transformation of a kind where we're
14080880	14085760	going to be doing more and more interaction than digital space? Like everything we've been complaining
14085760	14090960	about Twitter, is it possible that Twitter is just the early days of a broken system that's
14090960	14095360	actually giving birth to a better working system that's ultimately digital?
14096960	14105280	I think we're going to experience a pendulum swing back into the real world. I mean, I think
14105280	14112320	many of us are experiencing that now anyway. I mean, just wanting to have face-to-face encounters
14112320	14118480	and spend less time on our phones and less time online. I think maybe everyone isn't going in that
14118480	14126160	direction, but I do notice it myself and I notice, I mean, once I got off Twitter,
14126160	14130560	then I noticed the people who were never on Twitter, right? And the people who were never,
14131280	14133600	basically, I mean, I know I have a lot of friends who were never on Twitter.
14134880	14140480	And they actually never understood what I was doing on Twitter. It wasn't that they were seeing it
14140480	14148560	and then reacting to it, they just didn't know. It's like I'm not on Reddit either,
14148560	14152720	but I don't spend any time thinking about not being on Reddit. It's like I'm just not on Reddit.
14154000	14158160	Do you think the pursuit of human happiness is better achieved and more effectively achieved
14158160	14166000	outside of Twitter world? Well, I think all we have is our attention in the end,
14166000	14174000	and we just have to notice what these various tools are doing to it. And it's just, it became
14174000	14180480	very clear to me that it was an unrewarding use of my attention. Now, it's not to say there isn't
14180480	14187440	some digital platform that's conceivable that would be useful and rewarding, but
14188400	14196560	yeah, I mean, we just have, you know, our life is doled out to us in moments. And we have,
14196560	14204480	and we're continually solving this riddle of what is going to suffice to make this moment engaging
14205360	14213280	and meaningful and aligned with who I want to be now and how I want the future to look,
14214240	14219760	that we have this tension between being in the present and becoming in the future.
14222800	14228480	It's a seeming paradox. Again, it's not really a paradox, but I do think the ground truth
14229360	14236240	for personal well-being is to find a mode of being where you can pay attention
14237680	14240800	to the present moment, and this is meditation by another name.
14241760	14249200	You can pay attention to the present moment with sufficient gravity that you recognize that
14250480	14253680	just consciousness itself in the present moment, no matter what's happening,
14254480	14262320	is already a circumstance of freedom and contentment and tranquility. You can be happy now
14263040	14268400	before anything happens, before this next desire gets gratified, before this next problem gets
14268400	14274320	solved. There's this kind of ground truth that you're free, that consciousness is free and open
14274320	14281600	and unencumbered by really any problem until you get lost in thought about all the problems that
14281600	14288640	may yet be real for you. So the ability to catch and observe consciousness, that in itself is a
14288640	14295600	source of happiness. Without being lost in thought. And so this happens haphazardly for people who
14295600	14300800	don't meditate because they'll find something in their life that's so captivating, it's so pleasurable,
14300800	14307520	it's so thrilling. It can even be scary, but it can be even being scared is captivated. It gets
14308880	14316480	their attention, whatever it is. Sebastian Younger wrote a great book about people's
14316480	14322320	experience in war here. Strangely, it can be the best experience anyone's ever had because
14322320	14328400	everything, it's like only the moment matters. The bullet is whizzing by your head. You're not
14328400	14334320	thinking about your 401k or that thing that you didn't say last week to the person you shouldn't
14334320	14339280	have been talking about. You're not thinking about Twitter. It's like you're just fully immersed in
14339280	14347280	the present moment. Meditation is the only way, I mean, that word can mean many things to many
14347280	14355600	people, but what I mean by meditation is simply the discovery that there is a way to engage the
14355600	14360000	present moment directly regardless of what's happening. You don't need to be in a war. You
14360000	14364560	don't need to be having sex. You don't need to be on drugs. You don't need to be surfing. Nothing,
14364560	14369600	there doesn't have to be a peak experience. It can be completely ordinary, but you can recognize
14370320	14377360	that in some basic sense, there's only this and everything else is something you're thinking.
14377360	14382640	You're thinking about the past. You're thinking about the future. Thoughts themselves have no
14382640	14390000	substance. It's fundamentally mysterious that any thought ever really commandeers your sense of who
14390000	14397680	you are and makes you anxious or afraid or angry or whatever it is. The more you discover that,
14398320	14401600	the half-life of all these negative emotions that blow all of us around
14402480	14411280	get much, much shorter. The anger that would have kept you angry for hours or days
14412160	14419440	lasts four seconds because the moment it arises, you recognize it and you can get off. At
14419440	14425120	minimum, you can decide whether it's useful to stay angry at that moment. Obviously, it usually
14425600	14427760	isn't. And the illusion of free will is one of those thoughts.
14428320	14434720	Yeah, it's all just happening. Even the mindful and meditative response to this is just happening.
14437600	14443920	The moments where you recognize or not recognize it's just happening. This does open up a degree
14443920	14449040	of freedom for a person, but it's not a freedom that gives any motivation to the notion of free
14449040	14453200	will. It's just a new way of being in the world.
14453200	14458240	Is there a difference between intellectually knowing free will as an illusion and really
14458240	14465200	experiencing it? What's the longest you've been able to experience, the escape, the illusion of
14465200	14475040	free will? Well, it's always obvious to me when I pay attention. Whenever I'm mindful, the term
14475040	14481120	of jargon in the Buddhist and increasingly outside the Buddhist context is mindfulness,
14481120	14488160	but there are different levels of mindfulness and there's different degrees of insight into this.
14488800	14496720	What I'm calling evidence of lack of free will and lack of the self, two sides of the same coin,
14496720	14503360	there's a sense of being a subject in the middle of experience to whom all experience refers.
14504000	14510480	A sense of I, a sense of me. That's almost everybody's starting point when they start
14510480	14515040	to meditate and that's almost always the place people live most of their lives from.
14515760	14519520	I do think that gets interrupted in ways that get unrecognized. I think people are
14519520	14523760	constantly losing the sense of I. They're losing the sense of subject to object distance,
14524400	14532640	but they're not recognizing it. Meditation is the mode in which you can recognize. You can both
14532640	14538320	consciously precipitate it. You can look for the self and fail to find it and then recognize its
14538320	14546560	absence. That's just the flip side of the coin of free will. The feeling of having free will
14546560	14553040	is what it feels like to feel like a self who's thinking his thoughts and doing his actions
14553040	14558320	and intending his intentions. The man in the middle of the boat who's rowing,
14559040	14565680	that's the false starting point. When you find that there's no one in the middle of the boat,
14566320	14570800	in fact, there's no boat. There's just the river. There's just the flow of experience
14571920	14575840	and there's no center to it and there's no place from which you would control it.
14575840	14580480	Again, even when you're doing things, this does not negate the difference between voluntary and
14580480	14587280	involuntary behavior. It's like I can voluntarily reach for this, but when I'm paying attention,
14587280	14595840	I'm aware that everything is just happening. The intention to move is just arising. I'm in no
14595840	14604880	position to know why it didn't arise a moment before or a moment later or 50% stronger or weaker
14604880	14611040	or so as to be ineffective or to be doubly effective where I lurched for it versus I move
14611040	14623120	slow. I can never run the counterfactuals. All of this opens the door to an even more
14623120	14628640	disconcerting picture along the same lines, which subsumes this conversation about free will and
14628640	14639840	it's the question of whether anything is ever possible. This is a question I haven't thought
14639840	14644480	a lot about it, but it's been a few years I've been kicking this question around.
14648240	14657040	What if only the actual is possible? We live with this feeling of possibility. We live with
14657040	14669520	the sense that I have two daughters. I could have had a third child. What does it mean to say
14669600	14674160	that I could have had a third child? Do you don't have kids? I don't think so.
14674160	14677040	Not that I know of. The possibility might be there.
14677840	14687520	What do we mean when we say you could have had a child or you might have a child in the future?
14691280	14697360	What's the relationship between possibility and actuality and reality? Is there a reality in which
14699600	14709280	non-actual things are nonetheless real? We have other categories of non-concrete things. We have
14709280	14723120	things that don't have spatial temporal dimension, but they none the less exist. There's an abstract
14723120	14727520	reality to numbers. It's philosophically interesting to think about these things.
14728160	14737840	In some sense, they're not merely invented by us. They're discovered because they have
14737840	14744480	structure that we can't impose upon them. They're not fictional characters like Hamlet and Superman
14745280	14751680	also exist in some sense, but they exist at the level of our own fiction and abstraction. But
14751760	14756960	it's like there are true and false statements you can make about Hamlet. There are true and
14756960	14762240	false statements you can make about Superman because our fiction, the fictional worlds we've
14762240	14766320	created have a certain kind of structure. But again, this is all abstract. It's all
14766960	14771680	abstractible from any of its concrete instantiations. It's not just in the comic books and just in
14771680	14779360	the movies. It's in our ongoing ideas about these characters. But natural numbers or
14779600	14786720	the integers don't function quite that way. They're similar, but they also have a structure
14786720	14792960	that's purely a matter of discovery. You can't just make up whether numbers are prime. If you
14792960	14799440	give me two integers of a certain size, let's say you mentioned two enormous integers,
14800160	14804960	if I were to say, okay, well, between those two integers, they're exactly 11 prime numbers.
14805200	14811200	That's a very specific claim about which I can be right or wrong, whether or not anyone knows
14811200	14816400	I'm right or wrong. There's a domain of facts there, but it's an abstract reality
14816960	14821600	that relates in some way that's philosophically interesting, metaphysically interesting to
14822720	14829280	what we call real reality, the spatial temporal order, the physics of things. But
14829360	14838000	possibility, at least in my view, occupies a different space. Again, my thoughts on this
14838000	14845040	are pretty in co-ed. I think I need to talk to a philosopher of physics and or a physicist about
14845040	14848800	how this may interact with things like the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
14848800	14856480	That's an interesting right, exactly. I wonder if discovers in physics further proof or more
14856480	14861920	concrete proof that many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has some validity if that
14861920	14869360	completely starts to change things. That's just more actuality. If I took that seriously,
14870960	14878000	that's a case of, and truth is that happens even if the many-worlds interpretation isn't true,
14878000	14884560	but we just imagine we have a physically infinite universe. The implication of infinity is such
14884560	14892000	that things will begin to repeat themselves the farther you go in space. If you just head
14892000	14896400	out in one direction, eventually you're going to meet two people just like us having a conversation
14896400	14902720	just like this and you're going to meet them an infinite number of times in every infinite variety
14902720	14908240	of permutations slightly different from this conversation. Infinity is just so big that our
14908240	14914960	intuitions of probability completely break down, but what I'm suggesting is maybe probability
14914960	14922800	isn't a thing. Maybe there's only actuality. Maybe there's only what happens and at every
14922800	14927520	point along the way, our notion of what could have happened or what might have happened
14928160	14932000	is just that. It's just a thought about what could have happened or might have happened.
14932000	14936160	There's no, so it's a fundamentally different thing. If you can imagine a thing that doesn't
14936160	14941840	make it real because that's where that possibility exists in your imagination.
14942960	14952080	Yeah, and possibility itself is a spooky idea because it too has a structure. If I'm going to say,
14957920	14961680	you could have had a daughter last year,
14962320	14969600	so we're saying that's possible but not actual.
14971520	14979040	That is a claim. There are things that are true and not true about that daughter. It has a kind
14979040	14986160	of structure. It's like- I feel like there's a lot of fog around the possibility. It feels
14986480	14996560	like a useful narrative. What does it mean? If we say, I just did that, but it's conceivable
14996560	15002320	that I wouldn't have done that. It's possible that I just threw this cap, but I might not have done
15002320	15007920	that. You're taking it very temporally close to the original, like what appears as a decision.
15008720	15013680	Whenever we're saying something's possible but not actual, this thing just happened,
15014480	15018000	but it's conceivable. It's possible that it wouldn't have happened or that it would have
15018000	15028000	happened differently. In what does that possibility consist? Where is that? For that to be real,
15028000	15035280	for the possibility to be real, what claim are we making about the universe?
15035280	15039920	Well, isn't that an extension of the idea that free will is an illusion, that all we have is
15039920	15044880	actuality, that the possibility is an illusion? Yeah, I'm just extending it beyond human action.
15047040	15051680	This goes to the physics of things. This is just everything. We're always telling ourselves a story
15052400	15056320	that includes possibility. Possibility is really compelling for some reason.
15058800	15068080	Because it's- I mean, this could sound just academic, but every backward looking regret
15068080	15075600	or disappointment and every forward looking worry is completely dependent on this notion
15075600	15080240	of possibility. Every regret is based on the sense that something else, I could have done
15080240	15086320	something else. Something else could have happened. Every disposition to worry about the future
15087440	15091680	is based on the feeling that there's this range of possibilities. It could go either way.
15092400	15100240	And whether or not there's such a thing as possibility, I'm convinced that worry is almost
15100240	15106480	never psychologically appropriate. Because the reality is that in any given moment,
15107280	15111200	either you can do something to solve the problem you're worried about or not. So if you can do
15111200	15116080	something, just do it. And if you can't, your worrying is just causing you to suffer twice
15116080	15121600	over. You're going to get the medical procedure next week anyway. How much
15121680	15127200	time between now and next week do you want to spend worrying about it? The worry doesn't
15127200	15131600	accomplish anything. How much do physicists think about possibility? Well, they think about it in
15131600	15139280	terms of probability more often. But probability just describes, and again, this is a place where
15139280	15146720	I might be out of my depth and need to talk to somebody to debunk this. To do therapy with a
15146720	15152240	physicist. Yeah. But probability seems just describes a pattern of actuality that we've
15152240	15158160	observed. There are certain things we observe, and those are the actual things that have happened.
15158800	15164480	And we have this additional story about probability. We have the frequency with which
15164480	15173920	things have happened in the past. I can flip a fair coin and I know in the abstract that I have a
15173920	15182240	belief that in the limit, those tosses should converge on 50% heads and 50% tails. I know I
15182240	15188080	have a story as to why it's not going to be exactly 50% within any arbitrary timeframe.
15192400	15198960	But in reality, all we ever have are the observed tosses. And then we have an additional story
15198960	15204800	that, oh, it came up heads, but it could have come up tails. Why do we think that
15206320	15214320	about that last toss? And what are we claiming is true about the physics of things
15215680	15221360	if we say it could have been otherwise? I think we're claiming that probability is true.
15222080	15229280	That it just allows us to have a nice model about the world, gives us hope about the world.
15229280	15235600	Yeah. It seems that possibility has to be somewhere to be effective. It's a little bit
15235600	15240000	like what's happening with the laws. There's something metaphysically interesting about
15240000	15245520	the laws of nature too, because the laws of nature, so the laws of nature impose their work on the
15245520	15252800	world. We see their evidence, but they're not reducible to any specific set of instances.
15253920	15260480	So there's some structure there, but the structure isn't just a matter of the actual things.
15261040	15266080	We have the actual billiard balls that are banging into each other. All of that actuality can be
15266080	15271040	explained by what actual things are actually doing. But then we have this notion that in addition to
15271040	15276800	that, we have the laws of nature that are explaining this act. But how are the laws of
15276800	15281440	nature an additional thing? In addition, it's just the actual things that actually affect
15281440	15288240	causally. And if they are an additional thing, how are they effective? If they're not among
15288240	15296000	the actual things, they're just actually banging around. Possibly it has to be hiding somewhere
15296000	15301200	for the laws of nature to be possible. For anything to be possible, it has to be.
15301200	15303120	It has to have. It's a closet somewhere, I'm sure.
15303760	15306560	Where all the possibility goes. It has to be attached to something.
15308880	15313600	You don't think many worlds is that. Because many worlds still exist.
15313600	15320480	Well, because we're in this strand of that multiverse. So still you have just a local
15320480	15324800	instance of what is actual. And then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can't
15324800	15329120	be affected by it. You can't really connect with the other.
15330960	15337040	Many worlds are just a statement of basically everything that can happen happens somewhere.
15340560	15347120	Maybe that's not an entirely kosher formulation of it, but it seems pretty close. But there's
15347120	15356960	whatever happens. In fact, relativistically, the Einstein's original notion of a block universe
15357840	15361440	seems to suggest this. And it's been a while since I've been in a conversation with a physicist
15361440	15364880	where I've gotten a chance to ask about the standing of this concept in physics currently.
15364880	15368480	I don't hear it discussed much. But the idea of a block universe is that
15369440	15377680	space-time exists as a totality. In our sense that we are traveling through space-time,
15378720	15383760	where there's a real difference between the past and the future, that that's an illusion of just our
15387840	15394800	weird slice we're taking of this larger object. But on some level, it's like you're reading a
15395520	15400720	the last page of the novel exists just as much as the first page when you're in the middle of it.
15402880	15409360	If we're living in anything like that, then there's no such thing as possibility. It would seem
15409360	15416160	there's just what is actual. So as a matter of our experience moment to moment,
15417440	15422800	I think it's totally compatible with that being true, that there is only what is actual.
15425040	15430560	That sounds to the naïve ear, that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and
15430560	15438000	confining. But it's anything but it's actually, it's a circumstance of pure discovery. You have
15438000	15443920	no idea what's going to happen next. You don't know who you're going to be tomorrow. You're only
15443920	15449840	by tendency, seeming to resemble yourself from yesterday. And there's way more freedom in all
15449840	15459360	of that than it seems true to many people. And yet the basic insight is that you're not,
15462320	15467040	the real freedom is the recognition that you're not in control of anything. Everything is just
15467040	15473200	happening, including your thoughts and intentions and moves. So life is a process of continuous
15473200	15482000	discovery. You're part of the universe. You are just this, it's the miracle that the universe
15482000	15488640	is illuminated to itself as itself where you sit. And you're continually discovering
15489520	15495040	what your life is. And then you have this layer at which you're telling yourself a story
15495840	15500400	that you already know what your life is. And you know exactly who you should be and what's
15501200	15506240	what's about to happen or you're struggling to form a confident opinion about all of that.
15506240	15512320	And yet there is this fundamental mystery to everything, even the most familiar experience.
15513120	15520880	We're all NPCs in the most marvelous video game. Maybe, although my game, my sense of
15520880	15525520	gaming is does not run as deep as to know what I'm committing to there. It's a non-playing
15525600	15533520	character. You're more of a Mario Kart guy. I went back, I was an original video gamer,
15533520	15540000	but it's been a long time since I was there for Pong. I remember when I saw the first Pong in
15540000	15546240	a restaurant in, I think it was like Benihana's or something. They had a Pong in a table and
15546240	15548960	that was an amazing moment. It was an amazing moment when you-
15548960	15554720	You Sam Harris might live from Pong to the invention and deployment of a super intelligent
15555520	15559440	system. That happened fast if it happens any time in my lifetime.
15559440	15566000	From Pong to AGI. What kind of things do you do purely for fun that others might consider a waste
15566000	15573920	of time? Purely for fun. Because meditation doesn't count because most people say that's not a waste
15573920	15580320	of time. Is there something like Pong that's a deeply embarrassing thing you would never admit?
15582800	15587200	I don't think, well, I mean, once or twice a year, I will play a round of golf,
15587200	15591440	which many people would find embarrassing. They might even find my play embarrassing,
15591440	15593920	but it's fun. Do you find it embarrassing?
15593920	15598800	No. I mean, golf just takes way too much time, so I can only squander a certain amount of time on
15598800	15603600	it. I do love it. It's a lot of fun. You have no control over your actual performance.
15604160	15609520	You're ever discovering. I do have control over my mediocre performance,
15609520	15616240	but I don't have enough control to make it really good. But happily, I'm in the perfect spot because
15616240	15620320	I don't invest enough time in it to care how I play, so I just have fun when I play.
15620320	15625200	Well, I hope there'll be a day where you play around golf with the former President Donald
15625200	15630400	Trump, and I would love to be- I would bet on him if we play golf. I'm sure he's a better golfer.
15630720	15636880	I miss the chaos of human civilization in modern times as we've talked about. What gives you hope
15637600	15643920	about this world in the coming year, in the coming decade, in the coming hundred years,
15643920	15647680	maybe a thousand years? What's the source of hope for you?
15650480	15659280	Well, it comes back to a few of the things we've talked about. I know that most people are good
15659280	15667200	and are mostly converging on the same core values. It's like we're not surrounded by
15668400	15675680	psychopaths. The thing that finally convinced me to get off Twitter was
15676320	15681600	how different life was seeming through the lens of Twitter. I just got the sense that there's
15681600	15687920	way more psychopaths or effective psychopaths than I realized. Then I thought, okay, this
15687920	15693360	isn't real. This is either a strange context in which actually decent people are behaving
15693360	15700400	like psychopaths, or it's a bot army or something that I don't have to take seriously.
15705440	15712800	If we can get the incentives right, I think there's no reason why we can't
15713760	15723120	really thrive collectively. There's enough wealth to go around. There's no effective limit
15724000	15728560	within the limits of what's physically possible, but we're nowhere near the limit
15729680	15738480	on abundance. Forget about going to Mars on this one rock. We could make this place
15739440	15747120	incredibly beautiful and stable if we just did enough work to
15751040	15756640	solve some rather long-standing political problems.
15756640	15762560	The problem of incentives. To you, the basic characteristics of human nature such that
15762640	15767360	we'll be okay if the incentives are okay. We'll do pretty good.
15768320	15772480	I'm worried about the asymmetries that it's easier to break things and to fix them. It's easier to
15775520	15783520	light a fire than to put it out. I do worry that as technology gets more and more powerful,
15783520	15790000	it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up to effectively screw things up
15790000	15796320	for everybody. It's easier. A thousand years ago, it was simply impossible for one person
15796960	15805360	to derange the lives of millions, much less billions. Now, that's getting to be possible.
15806400	15811520	On the assumption that we're always going to have a sufficient number of crazy individuals or
15812320	15822640	malevolent individuals, we have to figure out that asymmetry somehow. There's some
15823600	15831600	cautious exploration of emergent technology that we need to get our head screwed on straight
15831600	15835920	about. So gain a function of research. Just how much do we want to democratize
15836720	15843200	all the relevant technologies there? You really want to give everyone the ability to order
15843760	15850640	nucleotides in the mail and give them the blueprints for viruses online because you're a
15850640	15856880	free speech absolutist and you think all PDFs need to be exportable everywhere.
15857040	15867440	So there are limits to... Many people are confused about my take on free speech because I've come
15867440	15875200	down on the unpopular side of some of these questions, but it's been... My overriding concern
15875200	15881200	is that in many cases, I'm worried about the free speech of individual businesses or individual
15881200	15887040	platforms or individual media people to decide that they don't want to be associated with certain
15887040	15890880	things. So if you own Twitter, I think you should be able to kick off the
15891440	15895200	Nazi you don't want to be associated with because it's your platform, you own it.
15895200	15901760	That's your free speech. That's the side of my free speech concern for Twitter. It's not that
15901760	15908080	every Nazi has the right to algorithmic speech on Twitter. I think if you own Twitter, you should
15908960	15914000	whether it's just Elon or in the world where it wasn't Elon, just the people who own Twitter
15914960	15920560	and the board and the shareholders and the employees, these people should be free to decide
15921200	15927920	what they want to promote or not. I view them as publishers more than as platforms in the end and
15929760	15935680	that has other implications. But I do worry about this problem of misinformation and
15936480	15947760	algorithmically and otherwise supercharged misinformation. I do think we're at a bottleneck
15947760	15954160	now. I guess it could be the hubris of every present generation to think that their moment is
15954160	15958800	especially important. But I do think with the emergence of these technologies,
15959840	15964240	we're some kind of bottleneck where we really have to figure out how to get this right.
15964320	15968080	And if we do get this right, if we figure out how to not drive ourselves crazy
15968720	15973680	by giving people access to all possible information and misinformation at all times,
15975360	15983360	I think, yeah, there's no limit to how happily we could collaborate with billions of creative
15984160	15990480	fulfilled people. It's just- And trillions of robots. Some of them sex robots,
15990480	15994160	but that's another topic. Yeah, robots that are running the right algorithm,
15994160	15997840	whatever that algorithm is. Whatever you need in your life to make you happy.
16000240	16004800	The first time we talked is one of the huge honors in my life. I've been a fan of yours for a long
16004800	16010800	time. The few times you were respectful but critical to me means the world. And thank you so
16010800	16018320	much for helping me and caring enough about the world and for everything you do. But I should
16018320	16023520	say that the few of us that try to put love in the world on Twitter, miss you on Twitter, but
16024800	16030720	enjoy yourselves. Don't break anything, kids. Have a good party without me.
16030720	16034240	Thanks. I'm very happy to do this. Thanks for the invitation. Thank you.
16034240	16039120	Great to see you again. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Harris. To support
16039120	16043920	this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you
16043920	16050320	with some words from Martin Luther King, Jr. Love is the only force capable of transforming
16050320	16059840	an enemy into a friend. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
