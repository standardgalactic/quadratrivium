0	7520	I hope with my books, I'm saying this isn't a how-to guide, but this is somebody you can walk
7520	15600	alongside. You can see Einstein growing up Jewish in Germany. You can see Jennifer Doudna
15600	24480	growing up or as an outsider, Leonardo da Vinci or Elon Musk in really violent South Africa
24480	30720	with a psychologically difficult father and getting off the train when he goes to anti-apartheid
30720	37200	concert with his brother and there's a man with a knife sticking out of his head and they step
37200	45040	into the pool of blood and it's sticky on their souls. This causes, you know, scars that last
45040	52240	the rest of your life and the question is not, how do you avoid getting scarred? It's, you know,
52240	59440	how do you deal with it? The following is a conversation with Walter Isaacson,
59440	65840	one of the greatest biography writers ever, having written incredible books on Albert Einstein, Steve
65840	73360	Jobs, Leonardo da Vinci, Jennifer Doudna, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger, and now a new one on
73360	80880	Elon Musk. We talked for hours on and off the mic. I'm sure we'll talk many more times. Walter is a
80960	88000	truly special writer, thinker, observer, and human being. I highly recommend people read his
88000	94960	new book on Elon. I'm sure there will be short term controversy, but in the long term, I think it
94960	100320	will inspire millions of young people, especially with difficult childhoods, with hardship in their
100320	106400	surroundings or in their own minds to take on the hardest problems in the world and to build solutions
106400	113360	to those problems, no matter how impossible the odds. In this conversation, Walter and I cover
113360	118880	all of his books and use personal stories from them to speak to the bigger principles of striving
118880	126640	for greatness in science, in tech, engineering, art, politics, and life. There are many things
126640	132480	in the new Elon book that I felt are best saved for when I speak to Elon directly again on this
132480	139600	podcast, which will be soon enough. Perhaps it's also good to mention here that my friendships,
139600	146800	like with Elon, nor any other influence like money, access, fame, power will ever result
146800	152800	in me sacrificing my integrity, ever. I do like to celebrate the good in people,
152800	158720	to empathize and to understand, but I also like to call people out on their bullshit
159360	167120	with respect and with compassion. If I fail, I fail due to a lack of skill, not a lack of integrity.
167120	173200	I'll work hard to improve. This is the Lex Rudin podcast. To support it, please check
173200	178960	out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Walter Isaacson.
180000	185520	What is the role of a difficult childhood in the lives of great men and women, great minds?
185520	190960	Is that a requirement? Is it a catalyst, or is it just a simple coincidence of fate?
190960	195360	Well, it's not a requirement. Some people with happy childhoods do quite well,
196160	203440	but it certainly is true that a lot of really driven people are driven because they're harnessing
203440	209280	the demons of their childhood. Even Barack Obama's sentence in his memoirs, which is,
209280	214640	I think, every successful man is either trying to live up to the expectations of his father or
214640	220080	live down the sins of his father. And for Elon, it's especially true because he had
220080	225520	both a violent and difficult childhood and a very psychologically problematic father.
226240	234400	He's got those demons dancing around in his head, and by harnessing them, it's part of the reason
235040	241360	that he does riskier, more adventurous, wilder things than maybe I would ever do.
242000	249360	You've written that Elon talked about his father and that at times it felt like mental torture,
250480	255600	the interaction with him during his childhood. Can you describe some of the things you've learned?
256080	265200	Yeah, well, Elon and Kimball would tell me that, for example, when Elon got bullied on the playground
265200	270560	and one day was pushed down some concrete steps and had his face pummeled so badly that Kimball
270560	275040	said, I couldn't really recognize him. I mean, he was in the hospital for almost a week, but when
275040	282240	he came home, Elon had to stand in front of his father, and his father berated him for more than
282240	288320	an hour and said he was stupid and took the side of the person who had beaten him.
288320	291520	That's probably one of the more traumatic events of Elon's life.
291520	297520	Yes, and there's also Veld School, which is a sort of power military camp that young South
297520	306160	African boys got sent to. At one point, he was scrawny. He has very bad at picking up social cues
306160	313760	and emotional cues. He talks about being Asperger's. He gets traumatized at a camp like that.
313760	318400	But the second time he went, he'd gotten bigger. He had shot up to almost six feet and he'd learned
318400	324400	a little bit of judo. He realized that if he was getting beaten up, it might hurt him, but
324400	330000	he would just punch the person in the nose as hard as possible, so that sense of always
330000	336240	punching back has also been ingrained in Elon. I spent a lot of time talking to Errol Musk,
336240	342320	his father. Elon didn't talk to Errol Musk anymore, his father, nor does Kimball. It's been years,
342880	349920	and Errol doesn't even have Errol's email. A lot of times, Errol would be sending me emails,
350480	358960	and Errol had one of those Jekyll and Hyde personalities. He was a great mind of engineering,
358960	366640	and especially material science. I knew how to build a wilderness camp in South Africa using
366640	373600	mica and how it would not conduct the heat. But he also would go into these dark periods
373600	382480	in which he would just be psychologically abusive. Of course, Maymosk says to me, his mother, who
382480	390240	divorced Errol early on, said, the danger for Elon is that he becomes his father. Every now
390240	395840	and then, you've been with him so much, Lex, and you know him well. He'll even talk to you
395840	401760	about the demons, about Diablo dancing in his head. He gets it, he's self-aware,
401760	408880	but you've probably seen him at times where those demons take over, and he goes really dark and
408880	417840	really quiet. Grimes says, I can tell a minute or two in advance when demon mode is about to
417840	423440	happen, and he'll go a bit dark. I was here at Austin, wanted dinner with a group,
424160	429280	and you could tell suddenly something had triggered him, and he was going to go dark.
429280	435680	I've watched it in meetings where somebody will say, we can't make that part for less than $200,
435680	442800	or no, that's wrong, and he'll berate them, and then he snaps out of it. As you know that too,
442800	447760	the huge snap out where suddenly he's showing you a Monty Python sketch on his phone and he's
447760	453520	joking about things. I think coming out of the childhood, there were just many facets,
453520	459440	maybe even many personalities, the engineering mode, the silly mode, the charismatic mode,
459440	465440	the visionary mode, but also the demon in dark mode. A quote you cited about Elon really stood
465440	472080	out to me. I forget who it was from, but inside the man, he's still there as a child, the child
472080	480000	standing in front of his dad. That was Tallulah, his second wife, and she's great. She's an English
480000	486000	actress. They've been married twice, actually. Tallulah said that's just him from his childhood.
486000	494160	He's a drama addict. Kimball says that as well. I asked why, and Tallulah said,
496000	504400	for him, love and family are associated with those psychological torments, and in many ways,
504400	511280	he'll channel. Tallulah would be with him in 2008 when the company was going back,
511280	517200	whatever it may have been or later, and he would be so stressed he would vomit,
517840	523360	and then he would channel things that his father had said, use phrases his father had said to him,
524160	530720	and so she told me deep inside the man is this man child still standing in front of his father.
531680	534400	To what degree is that true for many of us, do you think?
535200	541920	I think it's true, but in many different ways. I'll say something personal, which is I was
541920	547280	blessed, and perhaps it's a bit of a downside too, with the fact that I had the greatest father
547280	551840	you could ever imagine and mother. They were the kindest people you'd ever want to meet. I grew
551840	557520	up in a magical place in New Orleans. My dad was an engineer, an electrical engineer, and
558400	568400	he was always kind. Perhaps I'm not quite as driven or as crazed. I don't have to prove things,
568400	575600	so I get to write about Elon Musk. I get to write about Einstein or Steve Jobs or Leonardo da Vinci,
575600	581520	who, as you know, was totally torn by demons and had different difficult childhood situations,
581520	589280	not even legitimized by his father. Sometimes those of us who are lucky enough to have
589280	596960	really gentle, sweet childhood, we grow up with fewer demons, but we grow up with fewer drives,
596960	605600	and we end up maybe being Boswell and not being Dr. Johnson. We end up being the observer,
605600	612960	not being the doer, and so I always respect those who are in the arena. I don't, you know-
612960	615920	You don't see yourself as a man in the arena.
615920	623600	I've had a gentle, sweet career, and I've got to cover really interesting people,
623600	628800	but I've never shot off a rocket that might someday get to Mars. I've never moved us into
628800	633440	the air of electric vehicles. I've never stayed up all night on the factory floor.
634400	647680	I don't have quite those either the drives or the addiction to risk. I mean, Elon's addicted to
647680	655680	risk. He's addicted to adventure. Me, if I see something that's risky, I spend some time calculating,
656000	664720	upside-downside here, but that's another reason that people like Elon Musk get stuff done,
665600	668560	and people like me write about the Elon Musk's.
669360	675840	One other aspect of this, given a difficult childhood, whether it's Elon or Da Vinci,
675920	684240	I wonder if there's some wisdom, some advice almost that you can draw,
685360	688480	that you can give to people with difficult childhoods.
689120	695440	I think all of us have demons, even those of us who grew up in a magical part of New Orleans
695440	704960	with sweet parents, and we all have demons, and rule one in life is harness your demons.
704960	710960	Know that you're ambitious or not ambitious or you're lazy or whatever. Leonardo Da Vinci knew
710960	721520	he was a procrastinator. I think it's useful to know what's eating at you, know how to harness it,
724080	731440	also know what you're good at. I'll take Musk as another example. I'm a little bit more like
731440	738960	Kimball Musk than Elon. I maybe got over-endowed with the empathy gene. What does that mean?
740240	746560	It means that I was okay when I ran Time Magazine. It was a group of about 150 people on the editorial
746560	754080	floors, and I knew them all, and we had a jolly time. When I went to CNN, I was not very good
754080	760960	at being a manager or an executive of an organization. I cared a little bit too much
760960	769680	that people didn't get annoyed at me or mad at me. Elon said that about John McNeil, for example,
769680	774160	who was president of Tesla. It's in the book. I talked to John McNeil a long time,
774720	783040	and he says, Elon just would fire people. We're really rough on people. He didn't have the empathy
783040	789040	for the people in front of him. Elon says, yeah, that's right. John McNeil couldn't fire people.
789040	794880	He cared more about pleasing the people in front of him than pleasing the entire enterprise or
794880	801840	getting things done. Being over-endowed with the desire to please people can make you less tough
801840	809200	of a manager. That doesn't mean there aren't great people who are over-endowed. Ben Franklin,
809200	815520	over-endowed with the desire to please people. The worst criticism of him from John Adams and
815520	823680	others was that he was insinuating, which meant he was always trying to get people to like him.
824960	828480	But that turned out to be a good thing. When they can't figure out the big state, little
828480	832880	state issue at the Constitutional Convention, when they can't figure out the Treaty of Paris,
832880	841200	whatever it is, he brings people together, and that is his superpower. To get back to the lessons
841280	848640	you asked, and the first was harness your demons. The second is to know your strengths and your
848640	856080	superpower. My superpower is definitely not being a tough manager. After running CNN for a while,
856080	861040	I said, okay, I think I've proven I don't really enjoy this or know how to do this well.
864160	868720	Do I have other talents? Yeah, I think I have the talent to observe people really closely,
869440	875520	to write about it in a straight, but I hope interesting narrative style. That's a power.
875520	880160	It's totally different from running an organization. It took me until three years of
880160	888880	running CNN that I realized I'm not cut to be an executive in a really high-intense
890320	898160	situation. Elon Musk is cut to be an executive in a highly intense situation, so much so that when
898160	904880	things get less intense, when they actually are making enough cars and rockets are going up and
904880	910480	landing, he thinks of something else, so he can surge and have more intensity. He's addicted to
910480	917840	intensity, and that's his superpower, which is a lot greater than the superpower of being a good
917840	927600	observer. I think also to build on that, it's not just addiction to risk and drama. There's always
927600	938240	a big mission above it. I would say it's an empathy towards people in the big picture.
939040	945040	It's an empathy towards humanity more than the empathy towards the three or four humans who
945040	951120	might be sitting in the conference room with you. That's a big deal. You see that in a lot of people.
951120	961920	You see it, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, Elon Musk. They always have empathy for these great
961920	969200	goals of humanity, and at times they can be clueless about the emotions of the people
969200	976160	in front of them, or callous sometimes. Musk, as you said, is driven by mission more than any
976160	985200	person I've ever seen. His only mission is like cosmic missions, meaning he's got three really
985200	994720	big missions. One is to make humans a space-faring civilization, make us multi-planetary, or get
994720	1001440	us to Mars. Number two is to bring us into the era of sustainable energy, to bring us into the
1001440	1009120	era of electric vehicles and solar roofs and battery packs. Third is to make sure that
1009120	1016160	artificial intelligence is safe and is aligned with human values. Every now and then I'd talk to
1016160	1022720	him and we'd be talking about Starlink satellites or whatever, or he would be pushing the people
1022720	1027760	in front of him in SpaceX and saying, if you do this, we'll never get to Mars in our lifetime.
1027760	1032640	Then he would give the lecture how important it was for human consciousness to get to Mars
1032640	1038560	in our lifetime. I'm thinking, okay, this is the pep talk of somebody trying to inspire a team,
1038560	1046000	or maybe it's the type of pontification you do on a podcast, but on the 20th time I watched him,
1046000	1051200	I realized, okay, I believe it. He actually is driven by this.
1051520	1058480	He is frustrated and angry that because of this particular minor engineering decision,
1059760	1063920	the big mission is not going to be accomplished. It's not a pep talk. It's a literal frustration.
1064720	1074960	An impatience, a frustration, and it's also just probably the most deeply ingrained thing in him
1075600	1082640	is his mission. He joked at one point to me about how much he loved reading comics as a kid,
1083280	1087360	and he said, all the people in the comic books, they're trying to save the world,
1087360	1091760	but they're wearing their underpants on the outside and they look ridiculous. Then he paused and
1091760	1099440	said, but they are trying to save the world. Whether it's Starlink in Ukraine or Starship going
1099440	1109280	to Mars or trying to get a global new Tesla, I think he's got this epic sense of the role he's
1109280	1119280	going to play in helping humanity on big things. Like the characters in the comic books, it's
1119280	1125200	sometimes ridiculous, but it also is sometimes true. When I was reading this part of the book,
1125280	1133040	I was thinking of all the young people who are struggling in this way, and I think a lot of
1133040	1137520	people are in different ways, whether they grow up without a father, whether they grow up with
1137520	1143360	physical, emotional, mental abuse, or demons of any kind, as you talked about, and it's really
1143360	1153280	painful to read, but also really damn inspiring that if you sort of walk side by side with those
1153280	1160720	demons, if you don't let that pain break you or somehow channel it, if you can put it this way,
1160720	1163520	that you can achieve, you can do great things in this world.
1163520	1170960	Well, that's an epic view of why we write biography, which is more epic than I had even
1170960	1177040	thought of. So I say thank you because in some ways what you're trying to do is say, okay,
1178000	1184160	I mean, Leonardo, you talked about being a misfit, he's born illegitimate in the village of
1184160	1191520	Venti, and he's gay, and he's left-handed, and he's distracted, and his father won't legitimize him,
1192320	1200480	and then he wanders off to the town of Florence, and he becomes the greatest artist and engineer
1201120	1207280	of the early Renaissance, of that part of the Renaissance. I hope this book inspires Jennifer
1207280	1215680	Doudna, the gene editing pioneer who helps discover CRISPR, gene editing tool, which my book, The
1215680	1222960	Code Breaker, she grew up feeling like a misfit in Hawaii, in a Polynesian village being the only
1222960	1229520	white person, and also trying to live up to a father who pushed her. So if people can read the
1229600	1235680	books, and I should have said about Jennifer Doudna, my point was that she was told by her
1235680	1240240	school guidance counselor, no, girls don't do science. Science is not for girls. You're not
1240240	1247120	going to do math or science. And so it pushes her to say, all right, I'm going to do math and science.
1247120	1252160	Just to interrupt real quick, but Jennifer Doudna, you've written an amazing book about her,
1253040	1257120	Nobel Prize winner, CRISPR developer, just incredible, one of the great scientists in
1257120	1262960	the 21st century. Right. And I'm talking about when Jennifer Doudna was young, and she felt
1262960	1268720	really, really out of place, like you and me and a lot of people when they fill in that way,
1268720	1273920	they read books, they go into, they curl up with the book. So her father drops a book on her bed
1273920	1280800	called The Double Helix, the book by James Watson on the discovery of the structure of DNA by him
1280880	1289200	in Rosalind Franklin and Francis Crick. And she realizes, oh my God, girls can become scientists.
1289200	1299360	My school guidance counselor is wrong. So I think books, like she read this book, and even if it's
1299360	1307360	a comic book, like Elon Musk read, books can sometimes inspire you. And every one of my books
1307360	1313440	is about people who are totally innovative, who weren't just smart, because none of us are going
1313440	1321120	to be able to match Einstein and mental processing power. But we can be as curious as he was and
1321120	1326240	creative and think out of the box the way he did, or Steve Jobs put it, think different.
1326960	1334560	And so I hope with my books, I'm saying this isn't a how to guide, but this is somebody
1334560	1342160	you can walk alongside. You can see Einstein growing up Jewish in Germany. You can see
1342160	1350800	Jennifer Doudna growing up or as an outsider or Leonardo da Vinci or Elon Musk in really violent
1350800	1357280	South Africa with a psychologically difficult father. And getting off the train when he goes
1357280	1363600	to anti-apartheid concert with his brother, and there's a man with a knife sticking out of his
1363600	1369280	head, and they step into the pool of blood and it's sticking on their souls. This causes
1370800	1378480	scars that last the rest of your life. And the question is not, how do you avoid getting scarred?
1379920	1388080	How do you deal with it? Einstein, too, one of my, it's hard to pick my favorite of your
1389040	1395760	biographies, but Einstein, I mean, you really paint a picture of another, I don't want to call him a
1395760	1402800	misfit, but a person who doesn't necessarily have a standard trajectory through life of success.
1403760	1411840	So, and that's extremely inspiring. I don't know exactly what question to ask. There's a million.
1411840	1415440	Well, I'll talk about the misfit for a second because, you know, we talked about Leonardo
1415520	1421440	being that way. You know, Einstein is Jewish in Germany at a time when it starts getting difficult.
1422320	1427520	He's slow in learning how to talk and he's a visual thinker, so he's always daydreaming and
1427520	1434240	imagining things. The first time he applies to the Zurich Polytech because he runs away from the
1434240	1440880	German education system because it's too much learning by rote, he gets rejected by the Zurich
1440880	1445680	Polytech. Now, it's the second best school in Zurich and they're rejecting Einstein. I tried to
1445680	1451120	find but couldn't the name of the admissions counselor at the Zurich Polytech, like you
1451120	1457760	rejected Einstein. And then he doesn't finish in the top half of his class and once he does
1458320	1464400	and he goes to graduate school, they don't accept his dissertation, so he can't get a job. He's not
1464400	1471120	teaching it. He even tries about 14 different high schools or gymnasium to get a job and they
1471120	1478240	won't take him. So he's a third class examiner in the Swiss Patent Office in 1905. Third class because
1478240	1484160	they've rejected his doctoral dissertation and so he can't be second class or first class because
1484160	1488640	he doesn't have a doctoral degree. And yet he's sitting there in the stool in the Patent Office
1488640	1497760	in 1905 and writes three papers that totally transform science. And if you're thinking about
1497760	1505200	being misunderstood or unappreciated, in 1906 he's still a third class patent. In 1907 he still is.
1505200	1511520	It takes until 1909 before people realize that this notion of the theory of relativity might be
1511520	1518320	correct and it might upend all of Newtonian physics. How is it possible for three of the greatest
1518320	1522880	papers in the history of science to be written in one year by this one person? Is there some
1523760	1530000	insights, wisdoms you draw? Plus he had a day job as a patent examiner. And there's really three
1530000	1535200	papers but there's also an addendum because once you figure out quantum theory and then you figure
1535280	1540080	out relativity and you're understanding Maxwell's equations and the speed of light,
1541520	1548000	he does a little addendum. That's the most famous equation in all of physics which is E equals mc
1548000	1555280	squared. So it's a pretty good year. It partly starts because he's a visual thinker and I think
1555280	1562080	it was helpful that he was at the Patent Office rather than being the acolyte of some professor
1562080	1567440	at the academy where he was supposed to follow the rules. And so the Patent Office said doing
1567440	1572720	devices to synchronize clocks because the Swiss have just gone on standard time zones and Swiss
1572720	1578400	people, as you know, tend to be rather, you know, Swiss. They care if it strikes the hour in bozzle,
1578400	1583200	it should do the same and burn if the exact answer. So you have to send a light signal between two
1583200	1590080	distant clocks and he's visualizing what it'll look like to ride alongside a light beam. He says,
1590080	1594480	well, if you catch up with that, if you go almost as fast, it'll look stationary but Maxwell's
1594480	1600800	equations don't allow for that. And he said, he's making my palm sweat that I was so worried.
1600800	1605920	And so he finally figures out because he's looking at these devices to synchronize clocks
1605920	1611840	that if you're traveling really, really fast, what looks synchronous to you or synchronized to
1611840	1617440	you is different than for somebody traveling really fast in the other direction and he makes
1617440	1623280	a mental leap that time, that the speed of light is always constant, but time is relative
1623280	1628720	depending on your state of motion. So it was that type of out of the box thinking, those leaps
1629360	1638000	that made 1905 his miracle year, likewise with Musk. I mean, after General Motors and Ford,
1638000	1644880	everybody gives up on electric vehicles to just say, I know how we're going to have a path
1645440	1650640	to change the entire trajectory of the world into the era of electric vehicles.
1651200	1655680	And then when he comes back from Russia where he tried to buy a little rocket ship so he could
1655680	1662960	send a experimental greenhouse to Mars and they were poking fun of him and actually spit on him
1662960	1669440	at one point in a drunken lunch. This is very fortuitous because on the ride back home, on the
1669760	1675200	plane, on the Delta Airlines flight, he's like doing the calculations of how much
1675200	1682560	materials, how much metal, how much fuel, how much wood it really costs. And so he's visualizing
1682560	1690880	things that other people would just say is impossible. It's what Steve Jobs' friends
1690880	1697200	called the reality distortion field and it drove people crazy. It drove them mad, but it also drove
1697280	1702320	them to do things they didn't think they would be able to do. You said visual thinking. I wonder
1702320	1713440	if you've seen parallels of the different styles and kinds of thinking that operate the minds of
1713440	1721040	these people. So is there parallels you see between Elon, Steve Jobs, Einstein, Da Vinci,
1721040	1726400	specifically in how they think? I think they were all visual thinkers,
1726400	1732640	perhaps coming from slight handicaps as children, meaning Leonardo was left-handed and a little
1732640	1740640	bit dyslexic, I think. And certainly Einstein had a colleague, he would repeat things, he was
1740640	1750160	slow in learning to talk. So I think visualizing helps a lot. And with Musk, I see it all the time
1750160	1757280	when I'm walking the factory lines with him or in product development, where he'll look at, say,
1757280	1764880	the heat shield under the raptor engine of a starship booster. And he'll say, why does it have
1764880	1770160	to be this way? Couldn't we trim it this way or make it or even get rid of this part of it?
1770720	1777040	And he can visualize the material science. There's a small anecdote in my book, but at one point
1777040	1783680	he's on the Tesla line and they're trying to get 5,000 cars a week in 2018. It's a life or death
1783680	1789760	situation. And he's looking at the machines that are bolting something to the chassis.
1790480	1797680	And he insists that Lars Morrowie, one of his great lieutenants, come and they have to summon
1797680	1805440	him. And he says, why are there six bolts here? And Lars and others explain, well, for the crash
1805440	1810400	test or anything else, the pressure would be in this way. So you have to and they were blah,
1810400	1816400	blah, blah, blah. And he said, no, if you visualize it, you'll see if there's a crash,
1816960	1822880	it would, the force would go this way and that way. And it could be done with four bolts.
1823840	1828720	Now that sounds risky. And they go test it in the engineer, but it turns out to be right.
1828720	1834320	I know that seems minor, but I could give you 500 of those where in any given day,
1835040	1844000	he's visualizing the physics of an engineering or manufacturing problem. That sounds pretty mundane.
1844800	1850960	But for me, if you say what makes him special, there's a mission driven thing, I give you a lot
1851040	1859040	of reasons. But one of the reasons is he cares not just about the design of the product, but
1859040	1865040	visualizing the manufacturing and of the product, the machine that makes the machine.
1865040	1869600	And that's what we failed to do in America for the past 40 years. We outsource so much
1869600	1875680	manufacturing. I don't think you can be a good innovator if you don't know how to make the stuff
1875760	1882400	you're designing. And that's why Musk puts his designer's desk right next to the assembly lines
1882400	1890000	and the factories so that they have to visualize what they drew as it becomes the physical object.
1890000	1895280	So understanding everything from the physics all the way up to the software, so like end to end?
1895280	1902080	Well, having an end to end control is important. Certainly with Steve Jobs. I'm looking at my
1902080	1908640	iPhone here. It's a big deal. That hardware only works with Apple software. And for a while,
1908640	1915280	the iTunes Store, not only what works, so he has an end to end that makes it like
1915280	1922800	a Zen garden in Kyoto. Very carefully curated, but a thing of beauty. For Musk, when he first
1922800	1929520	was at Tesla and before he was the CEO, when he was just the executive chairman and basically the
1929520	1935200	finance person funding it, they were outsourcing everything. They're making the batteries in
1935200	1940640	Japan and the battery pack would be at some barbecue shop in Thailand. And that sent to
1940640	1948720	the Lotus factory in England to be put into a Lotus Elise chassis and then that was a nightmare.
1948720	1954480	You did not have end to end control of the manufacturing process. So he goes to the other
1954480	1961280	extreme. He gets a factory in Fremont from Toyota and he wants to do everything in-house,
1961280	1970640	the software, in-house, the painting, in-house, the battery. He makes his own batteries.
1971520	1976640	And I think that end to end control is part of his personality. I mean, there's a...
1977600	1983120	But it also would allow Tesla to be innovative.
1983680	1993120	Yeah, I got to see and understand in detail one example of that, which is the development of the
1993120	2000800	brain of the car in autopilot going from Mobileye to in-house building the autopilot system to
2001680	2011040	basically getting rid of all sensors that are not rich in data to make it AI friendly,
2011680	2016720	sort of saying that we can do it all with vision. And like you said, removing some of the bolts.
2016720	2021680	So sometimes it's small things, but sometimes it's really big things like getting rid of radar.
2021680	2027120	Well, vision only, getting rid of radar is huge. And everybody's against it. Everybody...
2027120	2032800	And still fighting it a bit. They're still trying to do in next generation some form of radar.
2032800	2038160	But it gets back to the first principles. We're talking about visualizing. Well, he starts
2039600	2046080	with the first principles. And the first principles of physics involve things like, well, humans drive
2046080	2051440	with only visual input. They don't have radar. They don't have LiDAR. They don't have Sonar.
2052080	2060480	And so there is no reason in the laws of physics that make it so that vision only won't be
2060480	2067040	successful in creating self-driving. Now, that becomes an article of faith to him. And he gets
2067040	2074400	a lot of pushback. But now... And he's, by the way, not been that successful in meeting his deadlines
2074400	2082320	of getting self-driving. He's way too optimistic. But it was that first principles of get rid
2082320	2087920	of unnecessary things. Now, you would think LiDAR, why not use it? Like why not use across?
2087920	2092480	Just like, yeah, we can do things vision only. But when I look at the stars at night, I'll use
2092480	2099200	a telescope too. Well, you could use LiDAR, but you can't do millions of cars that way at scale.
2099200	2105120	At a certain point, you have to make it not only a good product, but a product that goes to scale.
2105120	2109040	And you can't make it based on maps, like Google Maps, because it'll never be able to,
2109600	2116240	you know, then drive from New Orleans to Slidell, where I want to go when it's too hot in New Orleans.
2117200	2124000	Take, for example, full self-drive. He has been obsessed with what he calls the robo-taxi.
2124080	2127120	We're going to build the next generation car without a steering wheel,
2128080	2132080	without pedals, because it's going to be full self-drive. You just summon it,
2132080	2137040	you won't need to drive it. Well, over and over again, all these people I've told you about,
2137040	2141600	you know, Lars Maravi and Drew Baglino and others, they're saying, okay, fine, that sounds really
2141600	2150080	good, but, you know, it ain't happened yet. We need to build a $25,000 mass market global car
2150080	2157120	that's just normal with a steering wheel. And yeah, he finally turned around a few months ago
2157120	2162240	and said, let's do it. And then he starts focusing on how's the assembly line going to work,
2162240	2166640	how are we going to do it, and make it the same platform for robo-taxi, so you can have the same
2166640	2173440	assembly line. Likewise, for full self-drive, they were doing it by coding hundreds of thousands
2173440	2178800	of lines of code that would say things like, if you see a red light, stop. If there's a blinking
2178800	2184240	light, if the two yellow lines do this, if there's a bike lane, do this. If there's a crosswalk, do
2184240	2190400	that. Well, that's really hard to do. Now he's doing it through artificial intelligence and
2190400	2199440	machine learning only. FSD12 will be based on the billion or so frames from Tesla each week of
2199440	2204480	Tesla drivers and saying, what happened when a human was in this situation? What did the human do?
2204480	2209360	And let's only pick the best humans, the five-star drivers or the Uber drivers, as Elon says.
2210000	2218160	And so that's him changing his mind and going to first principles, but saying, all right,
2218160	2224640	I'm even going to change full self-driving so there's not rules-based. It becomes AI-based,
2224640	2230880	just like ChatGPT doesn't try to answer your question, who are the five best popes or something
2231440	2242160	by study? ChatGPT does it by having ingested billions of pieces of writing that people have
2242160	2247840	done. This will be AI, but real world done by ingesting video. Sometimes it feels like
2248960	2254880	he and others, they're building things in this world successfully, are basically
2254880	2261520	confidently exploring a dark room with a very confident, ambitious vision of what
2261520	2268240	that room actually looks like. They're just walking straight into the darkness.
2269040	2274160	There's no painful toys or Legos on the ground. I'm just going to walk. I know exactly how far
2274160	2281120	the wall is. And then very quickly willing to adjust as they run into, they step on the Lego
2281120	2287600	and their body is filled with a lot of pain. What I mean by that is there's this kind of evolution
2287600	2294320	that seems to happen where you discover really good ideas along the way that allow you to pivot.
2294320	2304480	Like to me, since a few years ago, when you could see with Andrea Carpathi, the software 2.0
2304480	2309600	evolution of autopilot, it became obvious to me that this is not about the car.
2310320	2317120	This is about Optimus, the robot. This is like, if we look back 100 years from now,
2318160	2324160	the car will be remembered as a cool car, nice transportation, but the autopilot won't be the
2324160	2331280	thing that controls the car. It will be the thing that allows embodied AI systems to understand the
2331280	2340560	world. So broadly, that kind of approach, and you stumble into it, will Tesla be a car company?
2341200	2346720	Will it be an AI company? Will it be a robotics company? Will it be a home robotics company?
2346720	2356000	Will it be an energy company? And you slowly discover this as you confidently push forward
2356080	2361680	with a vision. It's interesting to watch that kind of evolution as long as it's backed by this
2361680	2367200	confidence. There are a couple of things that are required for that. One is being adventurous.
2367200	2372400	One doesn't enter a dark room without a flashlight and a map unless you're a risk taker, unless you're
2372400	2379440	adventurous. The second is to have iterative brain cycles where you can process information
2380080	2387760	and do a feedback loop and make it work. The third, and this is what we fail to do a lot in
2387760	2395200	the United States and perhaps around the world, is when you take risks, you have to realize you're
2395200	2404320	going to blow things up. First three rockets, the Falcon rockets that Musk does, they blow up.
2404320	2408000	Even Starship, three and a half minutes, but then it blows up the first time.
2408640	2415760	So I think Boeing and NASA and others have become unwilling to enter your dark room
2415760	2420960	without knowing exactly where the exit is and the lighted path to the exit.
2421760	2429600	And the people who created America, whenever they came over, whether the Mayflower is refugees
2429600	2439040	from the Nazis, they took a lot of risks to get here. And now I think we have more referees than
2439040	2447920	we have risk takers, more lawyers and regulators and others saying you can't do that, that's too risky
2447920	2453760	than people willing to innovate. And you need both. I think you're also right on
2454560	2461920	50-100 years from now, what Musk will be most remembered for besides space travel
2462800	2470480	is real-world AI. Not just Optimus the Robot, but Optimus the Robot and the self-driving car,
2471840	2479600	they're pretty much the same. They're using, you know, GPU clusters or dojo chips or whatever it
2479600	2486320	may be to process real-world data. We all got, and you did on your podcast, quite excited about
2486320	2494400	large language model, you know, generative, predictive text AI. That's fine, especially if
2494400	2501200	you want to chat with your chatbot. But the Holy Grail is artificial general intelligence.
2501200	2507840	And the tough part of that is real-world AI. And that's where Optimus the Robot or
2508800	2516160	full self-drive are, I think, far ahead of anybody else.
2517360	2525200	Well, I like how you said chitchat. I would say for one of the greatest writers ever,
2525200	2531760	it's funny that you spoke about language and the mastery of languages as merely chitchat.
2531760	2536640	You know, people have fallen in love over some words. People have gone to wars over some words.
2536640	2541840	I think words have a lot of power. It's actually an interesting question where the wisdom of the
2541840	2548400	world, the wisdom of humanity is in the words or is it in visual, is it in the physical? I don't
2548400	2552880	really... It's in mathematics. Maybe it all boils down to math. And in the end,
2552880	2559120	this kind of discussion about real-world AI versus language is all the same, maybe. I've
2560560	2565280	gotten a chance to hang out quite a bit in the metaverse with Mr. Mark Zuckerberg recently.
2565840	2574960	And boy is the realism in there. The thing that's coming up in the future is incredible.
2574960	2583200	I got scanned in Pittsburgh for 10 hours into the metaverse. And there's a
2584800	2588560	virtual version of me. And I got to hang out with that virtual version.
2589200	2592800	Do you like yourself? Well, I never like myself.
2593840	2599840	But it was easier to like that other guy. That was interesting. If you like you,
2601200	2604880	he didn't seem to care much. Actually lack of the empathy.
2606880	2612640	But that was, you know, it made me start to question even more than before, like,
2613200	2620640	well, how important is this physical reality? Because I got to see, you know, myself and other
2620640	2630160	people in that metaverse, like the details of the face, all the things that you think, maybe if
2630160	2634800	you look yourself in the mirror or imperfections, all this kind of stuff. When I was looking at
2634800	2642080	myself and others, all those things were beautiful. And it was real. And it was intense.
2643200	2647600	It was scary because you're like, well, are you allowed to murder people in the metaverse?
2648320	2653520	Because like, are you allowed to, because what are you allowed to do? Because you can replicate
2653520	2658720	a lot of those things. And it's, you start to question what are the fundamental things that
2658720	2664480	make life worth living here as we know it's humans. Have you talked to Elon about his views of
2664480	2668160	what living in the simulation may be and how you would figure out if that's true?
2668720	2675680	Yes, there's a constant lighthearted, but also a serious sense that this is all a bit of a game.
2676240	2682400	One of my theories on Elon, a minor theory, is that he read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
2682400	2691600	once too often. And as you know, there's a scene in there that says that there's a theory about
2691600	2697200	the universe that if anybody ever discovers the secrets of meanings of the universe,
2697200	2702800	it will be replaced by an even more complex universe. And then the next line Douglas Adams
2702800	2708240	writes is, and there's another theory that this has already happened. So I'm gonna try to get
2708240	2713760	my head around that, but I know that Elon Musk tries to. Well, there's a humor to that.
2713760	2719200	There's an enormous humor to Hitchhiker's Guide. I really think that helped Musk out of the darkest
2719200	2724880	of his periods to have sort of the sense of fun of figuring out what life is all about.
2724880	2729760	I wonder if there's a small aside we could say, just having gone to know Elon very well,
2731440	2737600	the silliness, the willingness to engage in the absurdity of it all and have fun.
2738800	2744400	What is that? Is that just a quirk of personality or is that a fundamental
2744400	2749760	aspect of a human who's running six plus companies? Well, it's a relief valve,
2749840	2754560	just like video games and Polytopia and Elden Ring or release valves for him.
2755920	2763360	And he does have an explosive sense of humor, as you know. And the weird thing is when he makes the
2763360	2770400	abrupt transition from dark demon mode and you're in the conference room and he is really
2770400	2776320	become upset about something. And not only they're dark vibes, but there's dark words emanating and
2776320	2784960	he's saying your resignation will be accepted, et cetera. And then something pops and he pulls
2784960	2792400	out his phone and pulls up a Bonnie Python skit, like the School of Silly Walks or whichever
2792400	2800800	John Cleese it was. And he starts laughing again and things break. So it's almost as if he has
2800800	2808480	different modes, the emulation of human mode, the engineering mode, the dark and demon mode,
2808480	2811040	and certainly there is the silly and giddy mode.
2813360	2819040	Yeah, you've actually opened the Elon book with the quotes from Elon and from Steve Jobs.
2819680	2824960	So Elon's quote is, to anyone I've offended, I just want to say this on SNL. I just want to
2824960	2830640	say I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you also
2830640	2835360	think I was going to be a chill normal dude? And then the quote from Steve Jobs, of course, is
2835360	2840560	the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
2841200	2848960	So what do you think is the role of the old madness and genius? What do you think is the
2848960	2855520	role of crazy in this? Well, first of all, let's both stipulate that Musk is crazy at times.
2856480	2863280	And then let's figure out, and I try to do it through storytelling, not through
2864160	2872080	highfalutin preaching, where that craziness works. Give me a story. Tell me an anecdote.
2872080	2881040	Tell me where he's crazy. And the almost final example, AI, but him shooting off Starship
2881040	2887200	for the first time in between an aborted countdown in the shootoff, he goes to Miami
2887200	2891520	to an air sales conference and meets Linda Yaccarino for the first time, makes her the CEO.
2891520	2897440	I mean, there's a very impulsiveness to him. Then he flies back, they launch Starship and
2899040	2905360	you realize that there's a drive and they're demons and there's also craziness. And
2906240	2912880	you sometimes want to pull those out. You want to take away his phone so he doesn't tweet at 3 a.m.
2912880	2920640	You want to say quit being so crazy. But then you realize there's a wonderful line of Shakespeare
2920640	2926960	and measure from measure at the very end. He says, even the best are molded out of faults.
2926960	2934160	And so you take the faults of Musk, for example, which includes a craziness that can be
2934880	2944400	endearing, but also craziness that's just like effing crazy, as well as this drive and demon mode.
2945760	2951120	I don't know that you can take that strand out of the fabric and the fabric remains whole.
2952800	2959760	I wonder sometimes it saddens me that we live in a society that doesn't celebrate even the
2959760	2966160	darker aspects of crazy in acknowledging that it all comes in one package. It's the man in
2966160	2971920	the arena versus the critic. And the man in the arena versus the regulator and to make it more prosaic.
2975360	2978880	Well, let me ask about not just the crazy, but the cruelty. So in
2980480	2985760	you've written when reporting on Steve Jobs, Was told you that the big question to ask was,
2985760	2993600	did he have to be so mean, so rough and cruel, so drama addicted? What is this answer for Steve
2993600	3000000	Jobs? Did he have to be so cruel? For Jobs, I asked Was at the end of my reporting,
3000000	3007120	because that's what he said at the beginning. We're doing the launch of, I think, the iPad 2,
3007120	3013920	it may have been. Steve is emaciated because he's been sick. And so I say to Was,
3013920	3017280	what's the answer to your question? And he said, well, if I had been running Apple,
3018000	3022320	I would have been nicer to everybody. Everybody got stock options. We've been like a family.
3022320	3026640	And then I don't know if you know Was. We're like a teddy bear. He paused. He smiled and he said,
3026640	3032400	but if I had been running Apple, I don't think we would have done the Macintosh or the iPhone.
3032400	3043280	So yeah, you have to sometimes be rough. And Jobs said the same thing that must said to me,
3043360	3049040	which is he said, people like you love wearing velvet gloves. Now, I don't know that I've worn
3049040	3053920	velvet gloves often, but you like people to like you. You like to sweet talk things. You
3053920	3060880	sugarcoat things. He says, I'm just a working class kid. And I don't have that luxury. If
3060880	3065120	something sucks, I got to tell people it sucks. Or I got a team of B players. Well,
3065120	3070000	Musk is that way as well. And it gets back to what I said earlier, which is, yeah,
3070960	3075360	I probably would wear velvet gloves if I could find them at my haberdasher.
3076480	3084000	And I do try to sugarcoat things. But when I was running CNN, it needed to be reshaped.
3084000	3089120	It needed to be broken. It needed to have certain things blown up. And I didn't do it.
3090320	3096080	So bad on me. But it made me realize, okay, I'll just write about the people who can do it.
3096080	3100720	Well, that thing of saying, I think probably both of them, but Elon certainly
3100720	3103280	saying things like that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
3104720	3110240	By the way, I've heard Jeff Bezos say that. I've heard Bill Gates say that. I've heard Steve Jobs
3110240	3114640	say it. I've heard Steve Jobs say it about a smoothie. They were making it a whole footage
3114640	3120240	or something. I mean, people, they use the word stupid really often. And you know who else used
3120240	3125280	it? Errol Musk. He kept baking Elon's stand in front of him and saying, that's the stupidest
3125280	3128240	thing. You're the stupidest person. You'll never amount to anything.
3131200	3138800	I don't know. As John McNeil, the president of Tesla said, do you have to be that way?
3139440	3151120	Probably not. There are a lot of successful people who are much kinder. But it's sometimes
3151200	3159120	necessary to be much more brutal and honest, brutally honest, I would say, than people like
3161440	3168960	when boss of the year trophies. Well, as you said, this kind of idea did also send a signal.
3168960	3172640	This idea of Steve Jobs of A Players, it did send a signal to everybody.
3174000	3176720	It was a kind of encouragement to the people that are all in.
3177360	3182080	Right. And that happened to Twitter. When we went to Twitter headquarters the day before
3182080	3189040	the takeover, he was having Andrew and James as to young cousins and other people
3189040	3194480	from the autopilot team going over lines of code and Musk himself said there was a laptop on the
3194480	3199440	second floor of the building, looking at the lines of code that had been written by Twitter
3199440	3206160	engineers. And they decided they were going to fire 85% of them because they had to be all in.
3206160	3212720	And this notion of psychological safety and mental days off and working remotely, he said either
3213360	3221280	and then it came up actually one of his, I think it was one of the cousins or maybe Ross Nordin
3221280	3227680	came up with the idea of let's not be so rough and just fire all these people. Let's ask them,
3227680	3232080	do you really want to be all in? Because this is going to be hardcore. It's going to be intense.
3232080	3237920	You get to choose. But by midnight tonight, we want you to check the box. I'm hardcore all in.
3237920	3243600	I'll be there in person. I'll work, you know, or that's not for me. I've got a family. I've got
3243600	3249600	work balance and you got different type of people that way and different stages of their life. I
3249600	3256160	was a little bit more hardcore and all in when I was in my 20s and when I was, you know, in my 50s.
3256160	3262240	Yeah. And you write about this. It's a really nice idea actually that there's two camps and you
3262240	3268320	find out, I don't, I wonder how true this is. It rings true. You can just ask people, which camp
3268320	3275040	are you in? Are you the kind of person that prides themselves and enjoy staying up to 2am
3275040	3279840	programming or whatever? Or do you see the value of quote unquote, you know,
3280080	3284720	about life, work-life balance, all this kind of stuff. And it's interesting. I mean,
3286080	3291200	like you could, people probably divide themselves in different stages of life and you can just ask
3291200	3296880	them and it makes sense for certain companies at certain stages of their development to be like,
3296880	3300160	we all want hardcore. Or certain teams. It doesn't even have to be a whole company.
3300160	3306320	And you're right. Goes back to what I was saying about rule. The first secret is sort of know
3306320	3311600	thyself. Obviously comes from Plato and everything comes from Plato and Socrates.
3314640	3322240	And decide, in this stage in my life, am I, do I want to be a hackathon all in all night
3322800	3328320	and change the world? Or do I want to bring wisdom and stability but also have balance?
3329040	3335280	I think it's good to have different companies with different styles. The problem was Twitter
3335280	3343280	was at almost one extreme with yoga studios and mental health days off and enshrining psychological
3343280	3349600	safety as one of the mantras that people should never feel psychologically threatened. And he,
3349600	3353760	I remember the bitter laugh he unleashed when he kept hearing that word. He said,
3353760	3362400	no, I like the words hardcore. I like intensity. I like a intense sense of urgency as our operating
3362400	3367600	principle. Well, yeah, there are people that way as well. And so know who you are and know what type
3367600	3373840	of team you want to build. Versus psychological safety and too many birds everywhere. Oh, yeah.
3373840	3379680	A lot of times Musk did things and I go, what the hell? And among them was changing the name
3379680	3384960	Twitter and getting rid of the birds. Hey, man, it's a lot invested in that brand. But when I
3384960	3390640	watched him, he thought, okay, these sweet little chirpy birds tweeting away in the name Twitter,
3391440	3399920	it's not hardcore. It's not intense. And so for better and for worse, I think he's taking acts
3401040	3409280	into the hardcore realm with people who post hardcore things with people with hardcore views.
3410080	3424880	It's not a polite playpen for the blue checked, anointed elite. And I thought, okay, this is
3424880	3428400	going to be bad. The whole thing is going to fall apart. Well, it has had problems,
3429040	3434800	but the hardcore intensity of it has also meant that there's new things happening there. So it's
3434800	3442080	very Elon Musk to not like this sweetness of birds chirping and tweeting and saying,
3442080	3450320	I want something more hardcore. As you've written in referring to the previous Twitter CEO,
3450320	3456960	Elon said Twitter needs a fire-breathing dragon. I think this is a good opportunity to
3458080	3462720	maybe go through some of the memorable moments of the Twitter saga, as you've written about
3462800	3469760	extensively in your book, from the early days of considering the acquisition to how it went
3469760	3473040	through to the details of, like you mentioned, the engineering teams.
3473600	3480880	Well, at the beginning of 2022, he was riding high. But as we say, he's a drama addict. He
3480880	3487520	doesn't like to coast. And Tesla told a million vehicles, I think 33 boosters,
3488400	3494000	you know, Falcon 9's have been shot up and landed safely in the past few months.
3496000	3502160	And he was the richest person on earth and times person of the year. And yet,
3503280	3509200	he'd said, I still want to put all my chips back on the table. I want to keep taking risks. I
3509200	3515680	don't want to savor things. He had told all of his houses. So he started secretly buying shares
3515680	3522480	of Twitter, January, February, March, becomes public at a certain point. He has to declare it.
3523440	3530720	And we were here in Austin at Gigafactory on the mezzanine, and he was trying to figure out,
3530720	3536720	well, where do I go from here? And at that time, this early April, they were going to offer him
3536720	3542320	a board seat, and he was going to do a standstill agreement and stop at 10% or something. Now,
3542320	3548160	remember, you know, we were standing around. It was Luke Nozick, whom you know well, Ken Halry,
3548160	3553840	some of his friends on that mezzanine here. And all afternoon and then late into the evening at
3553840	3560480	dinner is like, should we do this? And I didn't say anything. I'm just the observer. But everybody
3560480	3567280	else is saying, excuse me, why do you want to own Twitter? And Griffin, his son, joined at dinner
3567280	3573040	in May, for some reason, was in town. And like everybody says, no, we don't use Twitter. Why
3573040	3579120	would you do that? And May said, well, I use Twitter. And it's almost like, okay, the demographics
3579120	3584960	are people my age or May's age. And so it looked like he wasn't going to pursue it.
3585520	3595920	They offered him a board seat. And then he went off to Hawaii, to Larry Ellison's house,
3596480	3603280	which he sometimes uses. He was meeting a friend, Angela Bassett, an actress. And instead of enjoying
3603280	3610720	three days of vacation, he just became supercharged and started firing off text messages,
3610720	3616000	including the fire, breathing dragon, Lundy, I think, you know, he used that phrase a few times
3616000	3621920	that Parag wasn't the person who was going to take Twitter to a new level. And then by the
3621920	3627680	time he gets to Vancouver, where Grimes meets him, they stay up all night playing Elden Ring.
3627680	3634720	He was doing a TED talk. And then at 530, he finishes playing Elden Ring and sends out that
3634720	3641200	I've made an offer. Even when he comes back, people are trying to intervene and say, excuse me,
3641200	3648720	why are you doing it? And so it was a rocky period between late April and October when
3648720	3653600	the deal closes. And people ask me all the time, well, did he want to get out of the deal? I said,
3653600	3658000	which Ilana, you're talking about at what time of day? Because there'll be times in the morning
3658640	3663600	when he'd say, oh, the Delaware court's going to force me to do it. It's horrible. Talk to
3663600	3669360	his lawyers. You can win this case. Get me out of it. He met here in Austin with three or four
3669360	3676720	investment bankers, Blair Efron at Centerview, Bob Steele at Pirella Weinberg, and they offered
3676720	3680000	him options. Do you want to get out? Do you want to stay in? Do you want to reduce the price?
3681120	3687520	And I think he was mercurial. There were times he would text me or say to me, this is going to be
3687520	3693520	great. It's going to be the accelerant to do x.com the way we thought about 20 years ago.
3695440	3699840	And so it's not until they finally tell him at the beginning of October, right when Optimus
3699840	3707120	the Robot is being unveiled in California, actually, that the lawyers say, you're not going to
3707120	3714160	probably win this case, but better go through with the deal. And by then, he's not only made
3714160	3720720	his peace with it, he's kind of happy with it at that time. Eventually, the deal is going to close
3720720	3728960	on, I think, a Friday morning. I have it in the book. And we're there on Thursday and he's wandering
3728960	3735840	around looking at the Stay Woke t-shirts and psychological safety lingo they're all using.
3736480	3744800	And he and his lawyers and bankers hatched a plan to do a flash close. And the reason for that was
3745440	3753680	if they closed the deal after the markets had closed for the day, and he could send a letter
3753680	3759200	to Parag and two others firing them, quote, for cause. And this will be something the courts
3759200	3765200	will have to figure out. Then he could save $200 million or so. And it was both the money,
3765200	3771200	but for him a matter, I won't say a principle, but of, hey, they misled me about the numbers.
3771200	3779440	I got forced into doing it. So I'm going to try this jiu-jitsu maneuver and be able to get some
3779440	3786720	money out of them. Then when he takes over, it's kind of a wild scene. Him trying to decide in
3786720	3792800	three different rounds how to get the staff down to 15% of what it was. Him deciding on Christmas
3792800	3798720	Eve after he'd been at a meeting where they told him, we can't get rid of that Sacramento
3798720	3805200	server farm because it's need of a redundancy. And he says, no, it's not. And he's flying here to
3805200	3810320	Austin and young James says, why don't we just do it ourselves? He turns the plane around,
3810320	3815040	they land in Sacramento and he pulls them out himself. So it was a manic period.
3815040	3822720	We should also say that underneath of that, there was a running desire to or consideration to
3822720	3828560	perhaps start a new company to build the social media company from scratch.
3828560	3833040	Well, Kimball wanted to do that. And Kimball here at a wonderful restaurant in Austin at
3833040	3838320	lunch is like, hey, why are you buying Twitter? Let's start one from scratch and do it on the
3838320	3843040	blockchain. Now it took him a while, and you can argue it one way or the other,
3844080	3849680	to come to the conclusion that the blockchain was not fast enough and responsive time enough
3849680	3856320	to be able to handle a billion tweets in a day or so. He gets mad when they keep trying to get
3856320	3861200	him to talk to Sam Bankman-Free, who's trying to say, I'll invest, but we have to do it on the
3861200	3868800	blockchain. Kimball is still in favor of starting a new one and doing it on blockchain-based.
3869920	3876000	In retrospect, I think starting a new media company would have been better. He wouldn't have
3876000	3884000	had the baggage or the legacy that he's breaking now in breaking the way Twitter had been.
3884560	3892400	But it's hard to have millions and millions, hundreds of millions of true users, not just trolls,
3893120	3900320	and start from scratch, as others have found, as Macedon and Blue Sky and threads, and threads
3900320	3907360	even had a base. So it would have been hard. Yeah. And to do that in the way he did requires
3908480	3911920	another part that you write about with the three musketeers and the whole engineering,
3912640	3918080	the firing and the bringing in the engineers to try to sort of go hardcore. So there's a lot
3918080	3923680	interesting sort of questions to ask there, but the high level, can you just comment about that
3924880	3931040	part of the saga, which is bringing in the engineers and seeing what can we do here?
3931840	3938560	Right. He brought in the engineers and figured that the amount of people doing Tesla, full
3938560	3945200	self-driving autopilot and all the software there was about one-tenth of what was doing
3945200	3951760	software for Twitter. And he said, this can't be the case. And he fired 85% in three different
3951760	3958960	rounds. The first was just firing people because they looked at the coding and they had a team of
3958960	3966000	people from Tesla's autopilot team grading the codes of all that was written in the past year or so.
3966880	3974320	Then he fired people who didn't seem to be totally all in or loyal and then another round of layoffs.
3977840	3982960	At each step of the way, almost everybody said, that's enough. It's going to destroy things.
3984400	3990480	From Alex Spiro, his lawyer to Jared Burchell, he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. And even Andrew and
3990480	3995360	James, the young cousins who are tasked with making a list and figuring out who's good or bad,
3995360	4001280	saying, we've done enough. We're going to be in real trouble. And they were partly right.
4001280	4009520	I mean, there was degradation of the service sum, but not as much as half the services I use half
4009520	4017200	the time. And I wake up each morning and hit the app and, okay, still there.
4017200	4018480	What do you think? Was that too much?
4019120	4024080	I think that he has an algorithm that we mentioned earlier that begins with question
4024080	4030400	every requirement. What's up to is delete, delete, delete, delete every party. And then
4030400	4036880	a corollary to that is if you don't end up adding back 20% of what you deleted,
4036880	4040240	then you didn't delete enough in the first round because you were too timid.
4040960	4048800	Well, so he asked me, did he overdo it? He probably overdid it by 20%, which is his formula.
4048800	4052800	And they're probably trying to hire people now to keep things going.
4054080	4059120	But it sends a strong signal to people that are hired back or the people that are still there,
4059120	4064320	the A-player idea. Yeah. And what Steve Jobs and many other great leaders felt and certainly Bezos
4064320	4071360	and certainly in the early days of Microsoft Bill Gates, it was hardcore only A-players.
4072080	4077920	So how much of Elon's success would you say? Elon's, Steve Jobs' success is the hiring and
4077920	4083280	managing of great teams. When I asked Steve Jobs at one point, what was the best product you ever
4083280	4091840	created? I thought he'd say maybe the Macintosh or maybe the iPhone. He said, no, those products are
4091840	4098960	hard. The best thing I ever created was the team that made those products. And that's the hard part
4098960	4105760	is creating a team. And he did, you know, from Johnny Ive to Tim Cook and Eddie Q and Phil Schiller.
4106720	4114720	Elon has done a good job bringing in people. Gwen Shotwell, obviously, Linda Giacorino,
4114720	4124720	she's, you know, can navigate through the current crises. Certainly stellar people at SpaceX like
4124800	4132480	Mark Jankosa and then at Tesla like Drew Baglino and Lars Marvy and Tom Zhu and many others.
4134320	4141760	He's not as much of a team collaborator as, say, Benjamin Franklin, who, by the way, that's the
4141760	4146800	best team ever created, which is the founders. And you had to have really smart people like
4146800	4152720	Jefferson and Madison and really passionate people like John Adams and his cousin Samuel and really
4153280	4158480	a guy of high rectitude like Washington. But you also needed a Ben Franklin who could bring
4158480	4163440	everybody together and forge a team out of them and make them compromise with each other.
4164400	4170480	Musk is a magnet for awesome talent. Magnet. Interesting. But there's the
4171680	4177840	priorities of hiring based on excellence, trustworthiness and drive. These are things
4177840	4187680	you've described throughout the book. I mean, there's a pretty concrete and rigorous set of
4187680	4192240	ideas based on which the hiring is done. Oh, yeah. And he has a very good,
4193040	4201360	spidey, intuitive sense just looking at people who could, I mean, not looking at them, but studying
4201360	4212160	them who could be good. One of his ways of operating is what he calls a skip level meeting.
4212160	4217760	And let's take a very specific thing like the Raptor engine, which is powering the starship.
4218320	4221760	And it wasn't going well. It looked like a spaghetti bush and it was going to be hard
4221760	4228240	to manufacture. And he got rid of the people who were in charge of that team. And I remember
4228800	4234560	that he spent a couple of months doing what he calls skip level, which means instead of meeting
4234560	4242240	with his direct reports on the Raptor team, he would meet with the people one level below them.
4242880	4250080	And so he would skip a level and meet with them. And I just asked them what they're doing and I
4250080	4255200	drilled them with questions. And he said, and this is how I figure out who's going to emerge.
4255280	4258880	He said it was particularly difficult. I was sitting in those meetings because people were
4258880	4264640	wearing masks. It was during the height of COVID. And he said it made it a little bit harder for him
4264640	4273520	because he has to get the input. But I watched as a young kid, Dreadlocks named Jacob McKenzie,
4273520	4280080	he's in the book, is sitting there and he's a bit like you. Engineering mindset speaks in a bit
4280080	4285520	of a monotone. Musk would ask a question and he would give an answer. And the answer would be
4285520	4292480	very straightforward and he didn't get rattled. He was like this. And Musk said one day, called him
4292480	4297200	up at 3 a.m. Well, I won't say 3 a.m. But after midnight, he said, you're still around. And
4297200	4301360	Jake said, yeah, I'm still at work. And he said, okay, I'm going to make you in charge of
4301360	4309440	the team building Raptor. And that was like a big surprise. But Jacob McKenzie has now gotten a
4309440	4313360	version of Raptor and when they're building them at least one a week and they're pretty awesome.
4314160	4323760	And that's where his talent, Musk's talent for finding the right person and promoting them.
4324640	4330560	That's where it is. And promoting it in a way where it's like, here's the ball, here catch.
4331600	4338080	And you run with it. I've interacted with quite a few folks from you and just the Model X,
4339600	4344560	all throughout, where people on paper don't seem like they would be able to run the thing and
4344560	4348880	they run it extremely successfully. And he does it wrong. Sometimes he's had a horrible track
4348880	4355440	record with the Solar Roof division. Wonderful guy named Brian Dow. I really liked him.
4356400	4362400	And when they were doing the Battery Factory Surge in Nevada, Musk got rid of two or three people
4362400	4367440	and there's Brian Dow, can do, can do, can do. He stays up all night and he gets promoted and
4367440	4372560	runs it. And so finally, Musk goes through two or three people running the Solar Roof division,
4373200	4378000	finally calls up Brian Dow. I was sitting in Musk's house in Boca Chica, that little tiny
4378640	4386960	two bedroom he has. And he offers Brian Dow the job of running Solar Roof. And Brian there,
4386960	4394800	okay, can do, can do. And two or three times Musk insisted that they install a Solar Roof
4394800	4399760	in one of those houses in Boca Chica. This is this tiny village at the south end of Texas.
4400560	4404640	And late at night, I mean, I'd have to climb up to the top of the roof on these
4405200	4411680	ladders and stand on this peaked roof as Musk is there saying, why do we need four screws to
4411680	4418960	put in this single leg? And Brian was just sweating and doing everything. But then after a couple of
4418960	4426000	months, it wasn't going well and boom, Musk just fired him. So I always try to learn,
4426800	4433200	what is it that makes those who stay thrive? What's the lesson that? What do you think?
4433200	4438240	Well, I think it's self-knowledge like an Andy Krebs or others, they say,
4439680	4444480	I am hardcore. I really want to get a rocket to Mars and that's more important than anything else.
4444800	4451760	One of the people, I think it's Tim Zaman, I hope when he hears this, I'm getting him
4451760	4457840	the right person, who took time, it was working for Tesla autopilot. And it was just so intense,
4457840	4463760	he took some time off and then went to another company. He said, I was burned out at Tesla,
4463760	4468720	but then I was bored at the next place. So I called, I think it was Ashok at Tesla,
4468720	4473520	said, can I come back? He said, sure. He said, I've learned about myself. I'd rather be burned
4473520	4481440	out than bored. That's a good line. Well, can you just linger on one of the three that seem
4481440	4485680	interesting to you in terms of excellence, trustworthiness and drive? Which one do you think
4485680	4490400	is the most important and the hardest to get at? The trustworthiness is an interesting one.
4490400	4495840	Like, are you ride or die kind of thing? Yeah, I think that especially when it came
4495840	4500480	to taking over Twitter, he thought half the people there were disloyal. And he was wrong.
4500480	4506560	About two thirds were disloyal, not just half. And it was, how do we weed out those? And he did
4506560	4513520	something and made the firing squad, I call it, or the musketeers, I think is my nickname for them,
4513520	4519360	which is the young cousins and two or three other people. He made them look at the Slack messages.
4519360	4524400	These people had posted, everybody at Twitter had posted. And they went through hundreds of Slack
4524400	4532320	messages. So if anybody posted on the internal Slack, that jerky Elon Musk is going to take over
4532320	4540160	and I'm afraid that he's a maniac or something, they would be on the list because they want
4540160	4547040	all in loyal. They did not look at private Slack messages. And I guess people who are
4547040	4552800	posting on a corporate Slack board should be aware that your company can look at them.
4553440	4559600	But that's more than I would have done or most people would have done. And so that was to figure
4559600	4565200	out who's deeply committed and loyal. I think that was mainly the case at Twitter. He doesn't sit
4565200	4576400	around at SpaceX saying who's loyal to me. At other places, it's excellence, but that's pretty
4576400	4583760	well a given. Everybody is like a Mark Jankosa, just whip smart. It's all you hardcore and all in,
4583760	4590160	especially if you have to move to this bit of a town in the south tip of Texas called Boca Chica,
4591120	4598240	you got to be all in. Yeah. And that's the drive, the last piece. So you, in terms of
4598240	4603200	collaborating, one of the great teams of all time, Ben Franklin, I like that. I thought it was the
4603200	4608080	Beatles, but Ben Franklin is pretty good. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry to offend you. So
4608080	4611920	read the constitution and read Abbey Road. Listen, Abbey Road, they're both good,
4611920	4616560	but they're in a different league. Yeah, a different league. Okay. So one of the many
4616560	4623760	things that comes to mind with Ben Franklin is incredible time management. Is there something
4623760	4632080	you could say about Ben Franklin and about Steve Jobs? I think interesting with Elon is that he,
4632080	4638560	as you write, runs six companies, seven companies. It depends how you count. Starlink is its own
4638560	4644720	thing. I don't know. What can you say about these people in terms of time management?
4644720	4650880	Well, Musk is in a league of his own and the way he does it. First of all,
4652240	4659440	Steve Jobs had to run Pixar and Apple for a while. But Musk, every couple of hours,
4659440	4665600	is switching his mindset from how to implant the neural link chip and what will the robot
4665600	4671840	that implants it in the brain look like and how fast can we make it move, and then the heat
4671840	4679040	shield on the raptor or switching to human imitation machine learning full self drive.
4679600	4687440	On the night that the Twitter board agreed to the deal, this is huge around the world. I'm
4687440	4692800	sure you remember, like Musk buys Twitter. It wasn't when the deal closed. It was when
4693520	4701440	the Twitter accepted his offer. And I thought, okay, but then he went to Boca Chica to South Texas
4702240	4711520	and spent time fixating, if I remember correctly, a valve in the raptor engine that had a methane
4711520	4720160	leak issue. And what were the possible ways to fix it? And all the engineers in that room,
4721200	4725360	all that I assume are thinking about, this guy just bought Twitter, should we say something?
4726160	4734800	And then he goes with Kimball to a roadside joint in Brownsville and just sits in the front
4734800	4741040	and listens to music with nobody noticing really him being there. One of the things that one of
4741040	4752000	his strengths and weaknesses in a way is in a given day, he'll focus serially, sequentially,
4752000	4762560	on many different things. He will worry about uploading video onto x.com or the payment system,
4762560	4770640	and then immediately switch over to some issue with the FAA giving a permit for starship or
4771280	4777520	with how to deal with Starlink and the CIA. And when he's focused on any of these things,
4779280	4785200	you cannot distract him. It's not like he's also thinking about dealing with Starlink,
4785200	4792400	but I've got to also worry about the Tesla decision on the new $25,000 car. Now, he'll,
4792400	4799280	in between these sessions, process information then let off steam. And for better or worse,
4799280	4807520	he lets off steam by either playing a friend in Polytopia or fire off some tweets, which
4807520	4816240	is often not a healthy thing, but it's a release for him. I once said he was a great multitasker,
4816240	4822320	and that was a mistake. People corrected me. He's a serial tasker, which means
4822320	4829840	focuses intensely on a task for an hour, almost has a, what do they call it at restaurants where
4829840	4836560	they give you a pallet cleanser. He does some pallet cleanser with Polytopia, and then focuses
4836560	4841920	on the next task. I mean, is there some wisdom about time management that you can draw from that?
4841920	4846720	There's some things that these people do, and you say, okay, I can be that way. I can be more
4846720	4856000	curious. I can question every rule and regulation. I just don't think anybody should try to emulate
4856000	4861600	Musk's time management style, because it takes a certain set of teams, you know,
4861600	4869360	how to deal with everything else other than the thing he's focusing on, and a certain mind that
4869360	4876400	can shift, just like his moods can shift. You and I go through transitions, and also, if I'm
4876400	4881040	thinking about what I'm going to say on this podcast, I'm also thinking about the email my
4881040	4886560	daughter just sent about a house that she's looking at, you know, and I'm multitasking.
4886560	4893520	He doesn't actually do that. He singled tasks sequentially. With a focus, that's hard core.
4893520	4897840	I don't know. I think there's wisdom to draw from that. First of all, he makes me,
4898400	4904000	very frankly, makes me feel that way, that there's a lot of hours in the day. There's a lot of minutes
4904000	4910080	in the day. Like, there's no excuse not to get a lot done, and that requires just an extreme focus,
4911200	4922080	an extreme focus and like an urgency. I think the fierce urgency that drives him is important,
4922960	4928320	and it's sometimes ginned up. Like I say, the fierce urgency of getting to Mars.
4928880	4936160	And on a Friday night at the launch pad in Boca Chica at 10 p.m., there are only a few people
4936160	4939840	working because it's a Friday night. They're not supposed to launch for another eight months.
4941200	4946160	And he orders a surge. He says, I want 200 people here by tomorrow working on this pad.
4946800	4950800	We have to have a fierce sense of urgency or we will never get to Mars.
4951280	4963200	That sense of urgency is also a vibrancy that's really taking on life fully. To me,
4963200	4970560	this lesson is like, even the mundane can be full of this just richness and you just have to
4971360	4979040	really take it in intensely. So the switching enables that kind of intensity because most
4979120	4983760	of us can't hold that intensity in any one task for a prolonged period of time. Maybe that's also
4983760	4990560	a lesson. Right. And I guess it goes back to also know who you are, meaning there are people who
4992160	4996480	can focus intensely and there are people who can see patterns across many things.
4996480	5005040	Look, Leonardo da Vinci, he was not all that focused. He was easily distracted. It's why he
5005040	5012080	has more unfinished paintings and finished paintings in his canon. But his ability to
5013360	5020480	see patterns across nature and to in some ways process, procrastinate, be distracted,
5021440	5029760	that helped him some. But Musk is not that way. And every few months, there's a new
5029760	5034000	surge. You don't know where it'll be, but you'll be on solar roofs and all of a sudden
5034080	5040240	we'll have a surge and there has to be 100 solar roofs built or this has to be done by tomorrow
5040240	5048560	or make a starship dome by dawn and surge and do it. And there are people who are built that way.
5048560	5056640	It is inspiring, but also let's appreciate that there are people who can be really good,
5057520	5069840	but also can savor the success, savor the moment, savor the quiet sometimes. Musk's big
5069840	5078880	failing is he can't savor the moment or success. And that's the flip side of hardcore intensity.
5080080	5085520	In Innovators, another book of yours that I love, you write about individuals and about groups.
5086320	5092480	So one of the questions the book addresses is individuals or is it groups that turn the
5092480	5099840	tides of history? When Henry Kissinger was on the shuttle missions for the Middle East piece,
5099840	5107200	is the first book I ever wrote, he said, when I was a professor at Harvard, I thought that
5107200	5114080	history was determined by great forces and groups of people. But when I see it up close,
5114080	5120000	I see what a difference an individual can make. He's talking about Sadat and Golda Mayer,
5120000	5126960	probably talking about himself too, or at least in his mind. And we biographers have this dirty
5126960	5132800	secret that we know we distort history a bit by making the narrative too driven by an individual.
5133760	5138960	But sometimes it is driven by an individual. Musk is a case like that. And sometimes, as I did with
5138960	5145520	the Innovators, there's teams and people who build on each other. And Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce,
5146160	5152640	then getting Andy Grove and doing the microchip, which then comes out and Wozniak and Jobs find it
5153280	5162720	at some electronics store and they decide to build the Apple. And so sometimes there are flows of
5163280	5170000	forces and groups of people. I guess I err a little bit on the side of looking at
5170720	5178640	what Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and Albert Einstein can do. And I also try to figure out if they hadn't
5178640	5183120	been around with the forces of history and the groups of people have done it without them.
5183120	5190000	That's a good historical question as somebody loves history. And you think about special
5190080	5197760	relativity, one of the 1905 papers. Even after he writes it, it's four years before people truly
5197760	5203280	get what he's saying, which is it's not just how you observe time as relative, it's time itself
5203280	5209360	as relative. And on the general theory, which he does a decade later, I'm not sure we would
5209360	5216400	gotten that yet. What about moving us into the era of an iPhone in which it's so beautiful that you
5216400	5224160	can't live without a thousand songs in your pocket, email and the internet in your pocket and a phone?
5226560	5231120	There are a lot of brain dead people from Panasonic to Motorola who didn't get that,
5231120	5236240	and it may have been a while. I certainly think it's true of the era of electric vehicles.
5236800	5242240	Jim and Ford, all the great people there, they crossed the boat. And I mean that literally,
5242240	5248480	they ended up smashing them because they decided to discontinue it. Likewise, nobody was setting
5248480	5257840	up rockets. Our space shuttle was about to be grounded 12 years ago. And so Musk does things,
5259120	5263920	and there'll be people who say and read the book, they'll see the full story, but they'll say it
5263920	5269840	wasn't Musk who did, Tesla, it was Mark Navihard or Mark Tarpett. No, no, no. There were people who
5269840	5277520	had helped create the shells of companies and other things, and they were all deserved to be
5277520	5283520	called co-founders. But the guy who actually gets us to a million electric vehicles a year
5284320	5293440	is Elon Musk and without him, I don't think we... Look, if anybody five years from now buys a car
5294160	5300480	that's gasoline powered, we'll think that's quaint, you know, that's odd. I mean,
5300480	5305120	suddenly we've changed. We're not going to do it. 90% of that is Elon Musk.
5305920	5312720	We're all mortal. When and how do you think Elon will retire from the insanely productive
5312720	5319360	schedule he's on now? I would think that he would hate to retire. I think that he can't live
5319600	5332640	without the pressure, the drama, the all-in feeling. It's never been anything that seemed to have
5332640	5339040	crossed his mind. He's never said, maybe I love Larry Ellison's house on the beach in Hawaii,
5339040	5345200	maybe I should spend time in doing. Instead, he says things like, I learned early on that vacations
5345200	5351120	will kill you. He gets malaria when he goes on one vacation. I mean, he goes on vacation at one
5351120	5355840	point and they oust him from PayPal. And then he goes to Africa one way. He gets malaria. He says,
5355840	5360000	I've learned, vacations kill you. Lesson learned. Well, it's interesting because the projects are
5360960	5365120	hundred plus year projects. Many of these. One of the weird things
5367200	5373120	is watching him think incredibly long term. One of the meetings every week
5374080	5381280	early on when I was watching him was Mars colonizer. And we did through a two-hour
5381280	5387520	meeting about what would the governance structure be on Mars? What would people wear?
5387520	5396560	How would the robots work? And would there be democracy or should there be a different form of
5397760	5402800	governance? I'm sitting there saying, what are they doing? What are they talking about?
5402880	5406720	They're trying to build rocket ships and everything else. They are worrying about the
5406720	5414240	governance structure of Mars. And likewise, whenever he's in a tense moment, like there's
5414240	5419920	a rocket, it's about to be launched, he'll start asking people something in the way future, like
5419920	5426320	the new lead engine or something. If we're going to build that, do we have enough materials ready
5426320	5435600	to order? Or, I don't know, he'll just ask questions like when he's building robot taxi,
5435600	5442320	the global car, the $25,000 inexpensive global car. That's not a total passion. He was talked into
5442320	5448880	doing that. His passion is robot taxis. But his passion is, how are we going to make this factory
5448880	5456000	to do a million cars a year? So even the robot taxi is a longer range vision. I mean,
5456000	5463680	he's been touting it since 2016, but we're not. I don't know, robot taxis, I mean, there's,
5463680	5468960	Waymo may be doing a little experiments, but there's not cars being manufactured
5468960	5472240	without steering wheels that are going to take over the highways.
5473040	5477040	Yet, so he's always looking way into the future, is my point.
5477040	5483520	I just hope that there's a lot of Da Vinci's and Steve Jobs' and
5484400	5488640	Einstein's and Elon Musk's that carry the flame forward.
5488640	5494400	That's one of the reasons you write books about these people is so that if you're a young woman
5494400	5498800	in a school where you're not being told to do science and you read the Code Breaker
5498800	5506800	about Jennifer Doudna, you say, okay, I can be that. And when you say, oh, maybe I'll be a regulator
5506880	5512880	or you say, oh, no, maybe I'll be the person who pushes the boundaries, who pushes the lines,
5512880	5515760	who pushes, as Steve Jobs said, the human race.
5517120	5523440	Let me ask you about your mind, your genius, your process.
5524320	5525600	I'll give you two out of three.
5525600	5530800	All right. Take me through your process of writing a biography. I mean, the full of it.
5531360	5539440	And I'm not just writing a biography, but understanding deeply, which your books have done
5540080	5544800	for the human story and the bigger ideas underline the human story.
5544800	5549520	So you've written biographies, both of individuals, which are hardly individuals.
5550080	5559760	It's a really big, complex picture. And biographies of ideas that involve individuals.
5559840	5563280	Well, step one for me is trying to figure out how the mind works.
5565760	5568160	What causes Einstein to make that leap?
5568160	5574480	Elon Musk to say stainless steel while he's looking at a carbon fiber rocket.
5574480	5576800	Or how do you make the mental leap?
5577440	5579280	Because I write about smart people.
5579280	5582400	The smart people are a dime a dozen. They don't usually amount to much.
5582400	5586080	You have to be creative, imaginative, to think different, as Jobs would say.
5586800	5591440	And so what makes people creative? What makes them take imaginative leaps?
5591440	5594320	That's the key question you've got to ask.
5594320	5596960	You also ask the questions like you've asked earlier,
5596960	5602160	which is what demons are jangling in their head and how do they harness them into drives?
5602720	5608480	So you look at all that and you try to observe really carefully the person.
5609440	5620000	One of the more mundane things I do is a lot of writers try to give you a lot of their opinions
5620720	5625760	and preach or whatever. As I said, this mentor said,
5625760	5630480	two people, types come out, preachers, storytellers. Be a storyteller.
5631040	5641920	I try whenever I'm trying to convey a thought, there's six magic words that I almost should have
5642560	5648400	written on a card penned above my desk, which is, let me tell you a story.
5649120	5655520	So if somebody says, how does Elon Musk figure out good talent?
5656480	5661200	As you did, I think, well, let me tell you the story. I'll tell you the story of Jake McKenzie.
5662080	5666880	Or this is not something I invented. I mean, this is the way the good Lord does it in the
5666880	5672800	Bible. I mean, has the best opening lead sentence ever in the beginning, comma,
5672800	5678560	and then it's stories. And secondly, to pick up on that lead sentence in the beginning,
5678560	5688320	make it chronological. Everybody in the 40th year of their life has grown from the 39th year
5688320	5695920	and the 38th year. And so you want to show how people evolve and grow. I had the greatest of all
5695920	5702160	nonfiction narrative editors, Alice Mayhew at Simon Schuster, who among other things created
5702160	5707200	all the present men with Woodward and Burnsey. But she had a note she'd put in the margins of
5707200	5714160	my books that was a tigta. And it meant all things in good time. Keep it chronological.
5714160	5716800	If it's good enough in the Bible, it's good enough for you.
5716800	5721840	Interesting. To me, that's a small note. But to you, it's extremely important.
5721840	5726240	Because it's a framework for how you structure things, but also how you understand things,
5726240	5734640	which is if you keep it a chronological narrative, then you're showing how a person has grown
5734640	5743040	from one experience you've talked about to the next one. And that moral growth, creative growth,
5743040	5752880	risk-taking growth, wisdom, that's the essence of creativity. But you can't do it. There's a
5753440	5760400	term, building's Roman, which is a book that carries a narrative and tells how people learn
5760400	5768480	something. I'm a big believer in narrative. If you're an academic, sometimes not today,
5768480	5774240	but in like 20 years ago, 30 years ago, there were two things you thought were bad. One was
5775680	5781680	having a great person theory of history in which you decided to do biography. I had a great
5781680	5787120	professor when I was in college. Her name was Doris Kearns. She later married Dick Goodwin.
5788080	5795120	She, when she was going for tenure at the university, wrote a biography of Lyndon Johnson
5795120	5801920	and the American Dream. They denied her tenure because it was beneath the dignity of the academy
5801920	5809600	to write history through one person. That's great. It opened up the field of biography
5809600	5819600	to us non-academics, starting with David McCullough, Bob Caro, but maybe John Meacham and myself are
5819600	5825440	in a new generation and certainly there's a generation coming after us. But the second thing,
5825440	5834800	besides telling it through people, which is the academy tended to disdain what they called
5834800	5840320	imposing a narrative and what you made it storytelling. Because that meant you were
5840960	5849440	leaving things out and making it into a narrative. Well, that's how we form our views of the world.
5850400	5854640	Well, let me ask you this question. In terms of gathering an understanding,
5856800	5863040	how much of it is one observing and how much of it is interviews?
5863280	5869600	Yeah. Obviously, it depends on the subject. I mean, with a Ben Franklin, it's all based on
5869600	5875280	archives. Of course, we have 40 volumes of letters he wrote. That was a good old days,
5875280	5881520	when every day you'd write 20 letters. The Musk book is based much more on observation
5881520	5888000	than almost any of my books because he opened up in a way that was breathtaking to me.
5888960	5891520	You know, even when he'd be sitting playing
5892640	5898560	polytopia or seething at other people, he'd have me just sitting there watching.
5899840	5904320	I mean, I spent a lot of time with Jennifer Dowden at her side. I went to her lab and edited
5904320	5913920	a human gene with a pipette and a test tube. But I would say I spent 30 hours with her. I can't
5913920	5924720	count 100 hours and more just observing Musk. I'm not sure that any biographer,
5924720	5933440	perhaps since Boswell took on Dr. Johnson, has ever had quite as much up close,
5933440	5942400	meaning five feet away at all times, access. Because of that, I'll go back to what I said
5942400	5948640	a moment ago. I try to get out of the way of the story. It's not about me. I try to just say,
5948640	5954480	okay, here's what happened. Here's this story. Here's what happened the night he came in to
5954480	5959440	Twitter for the first time and let you form your own judgment. What about the interviews?
5960320	5966640	You've had a lot of conversations. You give acknowledgement to the people you've done interviews
5966640	5975440	with. Well, one, I have to ask as an aspiring interviewer myself, how?
5976160	5982960	People love to talk. People just love, you know that. And I've had 140, maybe 150 people,
5982960	5987760	they're all listed in the back. One of the little things that people won't notice,
5987760	5992880	but I'll say it now, is all of them are on the record. Getting them to talk is easy.
5992880	5996560	They all want to talk about Musk. But then at a certain point, say,
5996560	6003440	I don't put anonymous quotes in my book. I cite things. I say, if you're tough enough,
6004160	6008880	and you've gone through this, and a lot of times it takes two or three calls back.
6008880	6014400	Somebody will tell me a story, say, oh, no, no, no, I don't enjoy it. But I think it's important to
6014400	6020640	know where everything came from. And with Musk, it's, you know, I had that from the very beginning
6020640	6025600	because I was a Time Magazine reporter. I'd worked reporter for the Times-Pikion on New Orleans.
6025600	6032400	I, first day on the job, I had to go cover a murder and phoned in the story from a pay phone.
6032400	6037200	And my editor, you know, the city editor said, well, did you talk to the family? I went, no,
6037200	6042480	Billy. I mean, the family, you know, the daughter just got, he said, go knock on the door. I knocked
6042480	6046720	on the door. An hour later, they were still talking. They were bringing out her yearbook.
6047680	6052480	Lesson one, I learned. People want to talk if you're willing to just listen.
6053280	6058080	And whether it be Henry Kissinger, you just push the button and say Kissinger, and people tell
6058080	6064000	you the stories all the way through Elon Musk, everybody talked. Everybody in his family,
6064000	6068880	everybody he fired, everybody. I mean, I think it's important to listen to people.
6068880	6073680	And the other thing I learned as a reporter, back when I was covering politics in New Hampshire
6073680	6079680	in the early campaigns, I learned from two or three great reporters, a guy named David Broder
6079680	6085120	and Tim Russert, the late NBC guy. They do what was called door knocking. You just walk in a
6085120	6090480	neighborhood knock on a door and ask people about the election. But they said, here's the secret.
6091520	6096800	Don't ask any leading questions. Don't have any premise. Just say, hey, I'm trying to figure
6096800	6103200	out this election, what's going on? What do you think? And then stay silent. With Musk,
6103200	6111040	a third secret, you know this well. He'll go silent at times. Sometimes a minute, two minutes,
6111040	6117280	four minutes, don't try to fill the silences. If you're a listener, you got to learn,
6118400	6122880	okay, he's not saying anything for four minutes. I can outlast him.
6122880	6126960	It's tough. As humans, it's very tough. Respecting the silence is really, really difficult.
6127920	6133200	I'm speaking of demons. When there's silence, all the demons show up in my head.
6134320	6139600	The fear, I think, is if I don't say anything, it's boring. And if I say something, it's going to
6139600	6146240	be stupid. That the basic engine that just keeps running, not on the podcast, but also
6146240	6151200	in human interaction. And so I think there's that nervous energy when interacting with people.
6151840	6159040	You can never go wrong by staying silent, if there's nothing you have to say. Not something
6159040	6169600	I've mastered, but I do when I'm a reporter, try to master that, which is don't ask complex
6169600	6177120	questions, don't interject. And when somebody hasn't fully answered the question, don't say,
6177120	6181520	well, let me just stay silent. And then they'll keep talking.
6182080	6186400	Just give them a chance to keep talking. Even if they've kind of finished, you're still.
6186400	6193120	Sometimes they haven't given you enough. Instead of following up, I'll just nod and keep waiting.
6193120	6198080	You're making it sound simple. Is there a secret to getting people to open up more?
6198080	6206320	I'm somewhat lucky because I started off working for a daily newspaper. And people back then
6207200	6212240	they wouldn't talk to the newspaper reporter. But you also have a way about you. I feel like
6212240	6220960	you have a cowboy and a saloon. You just kind of want to talk. I don't know what it is. Maybe
6220960	6224880	this, I don't know if it's developer, you're born with it, but it feels like I want to tell
6224880	6236400	you a story of some sort. A couple of things. I did learn to be more quiet. I'm sure I know
6236400	6245840	when I was younger or even I'll see videos of me at news things where I'm always trying to
6245840	6253360	interject a question. And so you learn to be quieter sometimes. I haven't mastered it. I haven't
6253360	6261760	learned it enough. You learn to be naturally curious. Many reporters today, when they ask a
6261760	6266880	question, are either trying to play gotcha or trying to get a news scoop or trying to
6269040	6279360	gig something that can make a lead. And if you actually are curious and you really want to
6279360	6286080	know the answer to a question, then people can tell that you asked it because you want the answer,
6286080	6292240	not because you're playing a game with them. I'm sure some of them off the record, some of
6292240	6300000	them on the record you had, maybe just some incredible conversations. I was going to say
6300000	6303840	some of the greatest conversations ever, but who knows. Some of the best conversations ever are
6303840	6308720	probably somewhere in South America between two drunk people that we never get to hear.
6308720	6316960	So I don't know. But is there advice you can give from what you've learned to somebody like me
6316960	6320800	on how to have good conversation, especially when it's recorded?
6321680	6326080	Well, to be actually curious. I mean, every question you've asked me is because I think
6326080	6332480	you actually want to know the answer and you've done your homework to be open and not to have an
6332480	6339920	agenda. I mean, we all suffer from there being too many agendas in the world today.
6341040	6346800	Yeah, so that's just genuine curiosity. But there's something when you talk about just one-on-one
6346800	6356160	interaction, whether it's Elon or Steve Jobs, there's something beautiful about that person's
6356160	6367200	mind. And it feels like it's possible to reveal that, to discover that together efficiently.
6368480	6374640	And that's kind of the goal of a conversation. Well, I mean, look, you're amongst the top
6375600	6381360	podcasters and interviewers in the world today. You have an earnestness to you.
6382240	6390240	Ben Franklin is the person who taught me, I mean, by reading him, the most about
6390240	6395120	on conversation. He wrote a wonderful essay on that. It includes on silence.
6398000	6407840	But it includes trying to ask sincere questions rather than get a point across.
6408720	6421360	I mean, it's somewhat socratic. But whenever he wanted to start a fireman's core in Philadelphia,
6422480	6425600	he would go to his group that he called the Leather Apron Club
6426400	6432160	and they would pose a question, why don't we have it? What would it take? What would be good?
6432160	6437600	And then the second part is to make sure that you listen. And if somebody has even just
6437600	6445920	the germ of an idea, give them credit for it. Like, as Joe said, the real problem is this.
6447040	6457040	And I do think that if I'm in situations, and I just mean even at dinner or something,
6457600	6466720	and I'm with somebody, I'm usually curious and the conversation will proceed with questions.
6466720	6472560	And I guess it's also because I'm pretty interested in what anybody's doing,
6472560	6480160	whoever I happen to be with. And that's a talent you have, which is you're pretty
6480160	6487600	genuine in your interests. There are people like Benjamin Franklin, like the, I'll say,
6487600	6492640	Charlie Rose, even though he's in disfavor, who are interested in a huge number of subjects.
6492640	6500080	And I think that helps as well to be interested in basketball and opera and physics and metaphysics.
6501120	6506240	That was a Ben Franklin, that was a Leonardo trick, which is they wanted to know everything
6506240	6512320	you could possibly know about every subject knowable. But there's a different aspect of this,
6512320	6518480	which is that I would love to hear how you've solved it, or if you've faced it,
6518480	6524480	that you're certainly disarming. See, I'm like peppering you with compliments here,
6524480	6528560	trying to get you over. That's a very disarming method. Yeah. I've recently talked to Benjamin
6528560	6533360	and Yahoo. We'll talk again. We're unfortunate because the scheduling and complexities only
6533360	6539440	had one hour, which is very difficult, very difficult with a charismatic politician.
6539440	6544800	I understand this, but he's also a charismatic talker, which is very difficult to break through
6544800	6551680	in one hour. But there are people have built up walls, whether it's because of demons or because
6551680	6557600	of their politicians. And so they have agendas and narratives and so on. And so to break through
6557600	6562480	those, I wonder if there's some advice, some wisdom you've learned on how to
6564480	6573040	sort of wear down through water or whatever method the walls that we've built up as individuals.
6573040	6578240	I mean, you call it disarming, which I don't know that I am, but disarming basically means
6578240	6583600	you're taking down their shields also. And you know, when people have a shield,
6583920	6592320	and you try to give them comfort, I had zero of that problem with Elon Musk. I mean, it was like
6593040	6597840	disarming to me, which is, I kept waiting to say, okay, he's not going to always,
6597840	6612880	they've got a shell or he won't do that. But he was almost crazily open and did not seem to
6614560	6624000	want to be spinning or hiding or faking things. And I've been lucky. Doudna was that way.
6624800	6631840	Steve Jobs was that way. But you have to put in time too. In other words, you can't say,
6631840	6637280	okay, there's a one hour interview and I'm going to break down every wall. It's like on your fifth
6637360	6641520	visit. Yes. Well, actually, that's one of the things in my situation, you learn
6643200	6647280	fifth visit is very nice, but sometimes you don't get a fifth visit. Sometimes it's just the first
6647280	6654400	date. And I think what it boils down to, and we said disarming, but there's something about this
6654400	6663280	person that you trust. I think a lot of it just boils down to trust in some deep human way. And I
6663280	6670400	think with many other people I've spoken with, sometimes the trust happens after the interview,
6670400	6675760	which is really sad because it's like, oh man. I've never been in your situation where I have a
6675760	6685600	show. I usually have mint packs at the wheel. I'm not a first date person. Yeah. Well, you know.
6685600	6690240	But then I'm lucky. I mean, I say lucky, but I'm in print. I understand.
6690240	6695680	Print is a couple thousand-year-old medium, but they're those of us who love it.
6695680	6700880	Well, the nature of the podcast medium is that I'm a one-night stand kind of girl.
6702960	6708560	Let me ask you about objectivity. You followed Elon and you followed DJ. I mean,
6708560	6712240	I don't even know if you would say you're front. You have to be careful with words like that,
6712640	6721280	there's an intimacy. And how do you remain objective? Do you want to remain objective
6721920	6727360	while telling a deeply human story? Yeah. I mean, I want to be honest, which I think is
6727920	6738400	akin to being objective. I try to keep in mind who am I writing for? I'm not writing for Elon Musk,
6738480	6743920	as I say. I haven't sent him the book. I don't know if I don't think he's read it yet.
6746160	6756720	I've got one person I'm writing for, the open-minded reader. And if I can put in a story and say,
6756720	6761920	well, that will piss off the subject or that will really make the subject happy,
6762640	6769360	that's irrelevant. Or I try to make that a minor consideration. Will the reader
6771440	6774960	have a better understanding because I've put this story in the book?
6777280	6787280	I'm a bit of a romantic. So to me, even your Einstein book had lessons on romance and relationships.
6787360	6793040	Oh, dear. So how important are romantic relationships to the success of great men,
6793040	6800240	great women, great minds? Well, sometimes people who affect the course of humanity
6801040	6805520	have better relationships with humanity than they do with the humans sitting around them.
6806240	6813760	Einstein had two interesting relationships with wives. You know,
6813760	6818800	Maleva, his first wife, was a sounding board and helped with the mathematics of the special
6818800	6828640	relativity paper in particular. But he didn't treat her well. I mean, he made her sign a letter
6828640	6835200	that she wouldn't interrupt him. And finally, when she wanted a divorce, he couldn't afford it
6835200	6841920	because he was still a patent clerk. And so he offered her a deal, which is, I think,
6841920	6846960	totally amazing. He said, one of these days, one of those papers from 1905
6846960	6853840	is going to win the Nobel Prize. If we get a divorce, I'll give you the money.
6856240	6859120	There was a lot of money back then, like a million dollars now or something.
6860160	6864800	And she's smart. She's a scientist. She consults with a few other scientists. And after a week or
6865280	6870880	so, she takes the bet. Is that until, what, 1919 that he wins his Nobel Prize?
6873120	6877360	And she gets all the money. She buys three apartment buildings in Zurich.
6878480	6885520	With his second life, Elsa, it was more a partnership of convenience. It was not
6886240	6893280	a romantic love, but he knew. And that's sometimes what people need in life. He's just a partner.
6893280	6896000	I mean, somebody who's going to handle the stuff you're not going to handle.
6896720	6905360	So I guess if you look at my books, they're not great inspiring guides to personal relationships.
6906320	6911760	Let me ask you about actually the process of writing itself. When you've observed, when you've
6911760	6917440	listened, when you've collected all the information, what's maybe even just the silly
6917440	6922720	mundane question of what do you eat for breakfast before you start writing?
6922720	6926400	When do you write? First of all, breakfast is not my favorite meal.
6926400	6930320	And those people who tell you that you have to start with a hearty breakfast, I
6931680	6936720	look askance. Yes. And morning is not my favorite day part. It's all right at night.
6937600	6945120	And because I love narrative, it's easy to structure a book, which I can make a
6946080	6953520	outline that if I printed it out or notes would be 100 pages, but everything's in order.
6954240	6962080	In other words, if there's a burning man and he's coming back from Grimes and then there's
6962080	6970880	a solar roof thing and then there's something, I put it all in order day by day as an outline.
6970960	6977360	And that disciplines me when I'm starting to write to follow the mantra from Alice Mayhew,
6977360	6982400	my first editor, which is all things in good time. Don't get ahead of the story, don't have to flash
6982400	6989760	back. And then after you get it so that it's all chronological, you know, then you have to do
6989760	6996800	some clustering. You know, you have to say, okay, we're going to do the decision to do starship
6996800	7004160	or to build a factory in Texas or to whatever. And then you sometimes have the organizational
7004160	7010240	problem of, yeah, and that gets us all the way up to here. Do I keep that in this, that chapter,
7010240	7016320	or do I wait until later when it's better chronologically? But those are easy.
7016960	7022080	Well, what about the actual process of telling the story?
7022720	7029680	Well, that's the mantra I mentioned earlier, which is whenever I get pause or I don't know how to
7029680	7036800	say something, I just say, let me tell you a story. And then I find the actual anecdote,
7036800	7044240	the story, the tale that encompasses what I'm trying to convey. And then I don't say what I'm
7044240	7050560	trying to convey. I don't have a transition sentence that says, you know, Elon sometimes changes
7050640	7056000	mind so often he couldn't remember whether he had changed his mind. You know, you don't need
7056000	7062160	transition sentences. You just say, all right, here's the point I need to make next. And so
7062960	7069600	you start with a sentence that says, you know, one day in January in the factory in Texas, comma.
7070880	7078640	Well, one of the things that I'd love to ask you is for advice for young people. To me,
7079360	7088080	first advice would be to read biographies in a sense, because they help you understand of all
7088080	7093920	the different ways you can live a life well lived. But from having written biographies,
7093920	7100960	having studied so many great men and women, what advice could you give to people of how to live
7100960	7108000	this life? Well, I keep going back to the classics and Plato and Aristotle and Socrates.
7109920	7113520	And I guess it's Plato's maxim, but he may be quoting Socrates,
7113520	7120400	that the unexamined life is not worth living. And it gets back to the know thyself and nothings,
7120400	7126720	which is you don't have to figure out what is the big meaning of it all. But you have to figure out
7127680	7135920	why you're doing what you're doing. And that requires something that I did not have enough
7135920	7145280	of when I was young, which is self-awareness and examining every motive, everything I do.
7145280	7157680	Where does the examination lead you? Is it to a shift in life trajectory?
7157680	7164320	I mean, it's not for me sort of, all right, I've now decided having been a journalist,
7164320	7170960	I'll run a think tank or I'll run a network or I'll write a bio. It is actually something
7170960	7178320	that's more useful on an hourly basis. Like, why am I about to say that to somebody? Or why
7178960	7190640	am I going to do this particular act? What's my true motive here? And also, in the broader sense,
7190640	7200000	to learn, as I did after a couple years at CNN, my examination of my life is that I'm not great
7200000	7207680	at running complex organizations. I'm not great as a manager. Given the choice, I'd rather somebody
7207680	7213840	else have to manage me than me have to manage people. But it took me a while to figure that out.
7213840	7220720	And I was probably too ambitious when I was young and at time magazine. That was when I was green
7220720	7229200	and, oh well, that was when I was in my salad days in green and judgment. And it was like chasing
7230480	7236000	the next level at time and corporate at whatever it might be. And then one day,
7236000	7242480	I caught the brass ring and I became an editor and then the top editor. And after a while, I realized
7244160	7250400	that wasn't really totally what I'm suited to be, especially when I got put in charge of CNN.
7251520	7256400	I mean, all young people are almost by definition in their salad days in green and judgment.
7257440	7264480	But you learn what's motivating you and then you learn to ask,
7265840	7270160	but is that really what I want? Should I be careful of what I'm wishing for?
7273280	7280240	One of the big examinations you can do is the fact that you and everybody dies one day.
7281520	7286160	How much do you, Walter Isaacson, think about death? Are you afraid of it?
7286160	7290720	No, and I don't think about it a lot, but I do think about Steve Jobs's, let me tell your story,
7290720	7297200	you know, which is the wonderful Steve Jobs story of, I think after he was diagnosed but before
7297200	7304720	it was public. And he gave both a stand for talk but other things in which he said, the fact that
7304720	7310960	we are going to die gives you focus and gives you meaning. If you're going to live, and Elon
7310960	7316560	Musk has said that to me, which is a lot of the tech grows out in the Silicon Valley that looking
7316560	7325120	for ways to live forever. I can think, Musk says, of nothing worse. We read the myth of Sisyphus and
7325120	7335600	we know how bad it is to be condemned to eternal life. So there was an ancient Greece, the person
7335600	7342000	who walked behind the king and said, Momento Mori, remember you're going to die? And it kept
7343360	7353680	people from losing it a bit. Do you think about legacy? The lucky thing about being a biographer
7354640	7359120	is that you kind of know what your legacy is. There's going to be a shelf and it'll be of
7359120	7367360	interesting people. And you will have inspired a 17-year-old biology student somewhere to be
7368880	7375600	the next great biochemist or somebody to start a company like Elon Musk.
7376560	7384720	And what I think more about, I won't say giving back, that's such a trite thing,
7385360	7392560	I moved back to New Orleans for a reason. First of all, the hurricane hit. And after Katrina,
7392560	7399200	I was asked to be vice chair of the recovery authority. And I realized everything I've got
7399200	7408320	going for me, it all comes from this beautiful gem of a troubled city. The wonderful high school I
7408320	7416640	went to, the wonderful streets where I learned to ride a bike, and it's got challenges. I'm never
7416640	7424960	going to solve challenges at the grand global level, but I can go back home and say part of my
7424960	7432080	legacy is going to be I tried to pay it back to my hometown, even by teaching at Tulane,
7432080	7436800	which I don't do as a favor. I mean, I enjoy the hell out of it, but it's like, all right,
7436800	7442160	I'm part of a community. And I think we lose that in America because people who are lonely
7442160	7446160	are lonely because they're not part of a community. But I've got all my high school kids,
7446160	7451360	they're friends, they're all still in New Orleans. I've got my family, but I also have Tulane,
7451360	7456880	institutions in New Orleans that have been there forever. And if I can get involved in helping
7456880	7462640	the school system in New Orleans, of helping the youth empowerment programs, of helping the
7462640	7468000	innovation center at Tulane, I was even on the city planning commission, which worries about
7468000	7474960	zoning ordinances for short term rentals, go figure. But it was like, no, immerse myself in
7474960	7481920	my community because my community was just so awesomely good at allowing me to become who I
7481920	7492240	became and has trouble year by year, hurricane by hurricane, making sure that each new generation
7492240	7497760	can be creative. And it's a city of creativity from jazz to the food to the architecture.
7498320	7504640	So when I think of, I won't say legacy, but what am I going to do to pay it forward, which is a
7505440	7512000	lower level way of saying legacy, I pay it forward by going back to the place where I began and
7512000	7519600	trying to know it for the first time. That was a rip off of a TS Eliot line. I don't want you to
7519600	7525840	think I thought of that one. Always cite your sources, I appreciate it. TS Eliot, if you ever
7525840	7532160	need to figure it out, the four quartets, that part at the end, which is we shall not see some
7532160	7537600	exploration and the end of all of our exploring will be to return to the place where we started
7537600	7542960	and know it for the first time. They're the unknown but half remembered gate. It's just
7542960	7554640	beautiful. And that's been an inspiration of what do you do in, I guess if it's a Shakespeare play,
7554640	7562720	you call it act five. Well, you go back to the place where you came and don't sit there
7562720	7567520	worrying about legacy, but you'll sit there saying, how do I make sure that somebody else can have
7569120	7576640	a magical trajectory starting in New Orleans? Well, to me, you're one of the greatest storytellers
7576640	7582240	of all time. I've been a huge fan. Definitely not true, but it's so sweet of you. See, you can be
7582320	7593680	rudely interrupting. I think probably Ben Franklin, so for I don't know how many years, 15 years,
7593680	7599840	Einstein, all the way through today has been a huge fan of yours. And you're one of the people
7599840	7606640	that I thought surely would not lower themselves to appear and have a conversation with me.
7607520	7613280	And it's just a giant gift to me. Hey, I flew into Austin for this because I am a big fan,
7614080	7618160	and especially a big fan because you take people seriously and you care.
7618880	7623520	Thank you a thousand times. Thank you for expecting me and for inspiring just millions of
7623520	7628400	people with your stories. Again, an incredible storyteller, incredible human. And thank you for
7628400	7633680	talking today. Thank you, Alex. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Walter Isaacson.
7633680	7638640	To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,
7638640	7641760	let me leave you with one of my favorite quotes from Carl Jung.
7642880	7648720	People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls.
7649680	7654800	One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness
7655440	7660880	conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
