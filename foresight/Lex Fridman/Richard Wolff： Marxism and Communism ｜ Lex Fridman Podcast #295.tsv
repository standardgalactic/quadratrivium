0	6160	slaves produces surplus which the master gets, serfs produces surplus which the lord gets,
6880	16000	employees produces surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative
16000	26240	class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another
26240	34720	group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,
34720	41280	resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.
43680	49440	The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff. One of the top Marxist economists and
49440	57360	philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic in general and for me personally given my family
57360	64800	history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism,
64800	71680	and Communism are used to attack and to divide much more than to understand and to learn.
71920	80320	With this podcast I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx as well as
80320	87120	their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries and in general we need to
87120	93840	both steal man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize and to challenge the ideas we
93920	100640	dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant and at times dangerous.
102000	107600	This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description
107600	115040	and now dear friends, here's Richard Wolff. Let's start with a basic question but maybe not so basic
115040	122320	after all. What is Marxism? What are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and
122320	128240	political theory and ideology? Well the simplest way to begin the definition would be to say it's
128240	140640	the tradition that takes its founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because these
140640	150480	ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally it's
150560	161440	140 years since Marx died and in that time his ideas have become major types of thinking
161440	167680	in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,
169280	176800	that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.
177520	183120	And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity,
183840	191520	is that the Marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories
192160	199200	and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently
199200	206320	in different places at different times and therefore Marxism as a kind of first flush
206320	216160	definition is the totality of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For
216160	226080	the first roughly 40-50 years Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism.
226880	231040	Marx himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism,
231040	238560	he never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary,
238560	243840	dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism
244560	250160	and that's what Marxism was more or less in its first 40 or 50 years.
250240	260240	The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks.
261120	268720	In 1871 there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to
268720	275120	Bismarck's Germany and in the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working class of
275120	283200	Paris rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian
283200	290880	society and Marx's people, people influenced by Marx were very active in that commune and the
290880	296880	leadership of the commune and Marx wasn't that far away. He was in London, these things were
296880	304080	happening in Paris, you know, that's an easy transport even then and for a short time, very
304080	313280	short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism, it became
314240	322640	a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been implicit, now it became
322640	329840	explicit what is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do and why and in what order,
329840	336720	and in other words governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted a few weeks,
337280	343520	the French army regrouped and under the leadership of people who were very opposed to Marx,
344160	351120	they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the of the communards as they
351200	357680	were called and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the
357680	366240	time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists,
366240	376320	Lenin Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again,
376320	385200	a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation
385200	391200	because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,
391840	398480	Brest-Litovsky and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts. And in that
398480	409600	situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, splits under
409600	417120	the pressures of all of this into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin Trotsky and the
417120	423520	others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short, he's in exile. His position,
423520	431680	Lenin's position, gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be killing
431680	437840	German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into colonies and
437840	444720	Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you can expect,
445360	451680	they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the comparable leader
451680	457520	at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist Party at this point,
457520	464160	that comes later, the head of the Socialist Party, a very important American figure named Eugene
464160	470640	Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not fight in the war.
471680	477200	He has nothing to do with Lenin. I don't even know if they knew of each other, but he does it
477280	482560	on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the way, he runs for
482560	489440	president from jail and does very well. Really, very well, remarkable. And he's the inspiration
489440	498160	for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage politically than Bernie
498160	503840	has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link maybe later. History rhymes.
503840	508960	Yes, the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now
510320	518320	this seizure of power by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx,
518320	523920	developing what you might call a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians
523920	532640	too, but a Russian interpretation, this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism
533120	540960	into a plan at least. What are you going to do in the Soviet Union? A lot of this was then trial
540960	546640	and error. Marx never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant
546640	554000	if he had, because it was 50 years earlier in another country, etc. What begins to happen,
554000	560400	and you can see how this happens then more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on,
560960	568880	is that you have kind of a bifurcation. Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of
568880	576160	capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set, and they differ from one to the other,
576160	583440	a set of notions of what an alternative post-capitalist society ought to look like,
583440	589520	how it ought to work, and there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion,
590800	594720	and I would say that that's still where it is, that you have a tradition now
595360	601840	that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,
601840	607760	and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,
607760	614800	that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society
615680	618880	can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.
619600	623760	And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.
623760	630960	Fine. So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back,
630960	637360	what do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas
637360	642640	of Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?
645360	651840	Would he shake his head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations?
651840	655760	Like, how do you think he would analyze it? Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if
655760	661040	you've had a chance to take a look at his writing, but he had an extraordinary sense of humor. So
661040	666960	my guess is he would deploy his humor in answering this question, too. He would say some of them are
666960	672080	inspiring, some of the interpretations of his work, and he's very pleased with those.
672080	679200	Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could erase the connection between those things,
679200	686560	and the lineage they claim from him, which he would, there's a German word, I don't know if
686560	691360	he's like, if you speak the other languages, there's a wonderful German word called Verzichter,
692080	696960	and it's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse something,
696960	705520	but with real strong emphasis. Verzichter is a German way of saying, I don't want to do that.
706160	709600	And he would talk then, you know, in philosophical terms, because remember,
709600	715520	he was a student of philosophy. He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy
715520	722560	and all the rest. He would wax philosophical and say, you know, that the ideas you put out are a
722560	728720	little bit like having a child. You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own
728720	736480	person and will find his or her own way. And these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way.
736480	741040	And as you said, there's a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread
741040	747680	throughout the world made it even less able to be sort of stabilized and connected back to the
747680	754080	origins of where the idea came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians
754080	760080	after the revolution, because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they
760080	765600	occupied a position for a while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these
765600	771280	people criticizing capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid-century.
772000	779040	And these were the first guys who pulled it off. They made it. And so there was a kind of presumption
779040	787360	around the world. Their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it.
787360	796720	And so for a while, they could enunciate their interpretation, and it came to be widely grasped
797360	803520	as something which, by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism. The very idea
803520	809520	that you would put that adjective in front of Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian Marxism,
809520	816000	there were these words that where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the
816080	821520	cannon. You can depart from it, but this is the cannon. Before the Russian Revolution,
821520	830400	there was no such thing. And by the 1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time,
831280	838640	30, 40 years, it was a kind of, and the irony is, particularly here in the United States,
839520	846320	where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World War II is so total in this country
847040	855200	that I, for example, through most of my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time
856000	863440	simply explaining to American audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical
864400	871920	is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the cannon before 1917 and hasn't been
871920	878080	since at least the 1960s, but they don't know. It's not that they're stupid and it's not that
878080	883440	they're ignorant. It's that, well, the ignorance may be, but I mean, it's not a mental problem. It's
884160	891600	the taboo, shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way, recaptures what went before
892400	899200	and develops it in new direction, they just don't know. Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at
899200	907200	making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians, the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century
907200	912080	made a serious attempt at saying, okay, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually
912080	919120	build a system like this? And so in that sense, not at a high level, but at a detailed level,
919120	924880	it's interesting to look at those particular schools maybe. Right, because for example,
924880	930080	let me just take your point one step further, you really cannot understand the Cuban revolution,
930080	938080	the Chinese revolution, Vietnamese and the others, because each of them is a kind of
939280	946000	response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets did it. Are you going to do it that way? Well,
946080	952800	yes and no is the answer. This we will do that way, but that we're not going to do. And the
952800	958480	differences are huge, but you could find a thread, I can do that for you if you want,
958480	967520	in which all of them are, in a way, reacting to the originals. Yes, very much so. Like maybe most
967520	971040	of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones. That's something like that.
971680	977840	Well, can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism? So we
977840	987360	got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let's expand out to Maoism. So maybe I could
987360	995360	speak to sort of Leninism and then please tell me if I'm saying dumb things. There's a, I think
995440	1003120	for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small, so the Vanguard party, like a small
1003120	1009680	controlling entity that's like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions. Then for
1011280	1016400	Stalinism, one interesting, so Stalin's implementation of all of this, one interesting
1016400	1022720	characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal Marxism to
1023040	1034160	make it all about nationalism, the strength of nation. So Maoism is different in that it's
1034160	1044240	focused on agriculture and rural. Then Trotskyism, I don't know except that it's anti-Stalin. I mean,
1044240	1049200	I don't even know if there's unique philosophical elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those
1049200	1054720	or something else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about
1054720	1062240	implementation of Marxism in the real world? Probably the best way to get into this is to
1062240	1068560	describe something that happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question.
1070960	1077200	In the early days of Marxist writings, and you know, his life spans the 19th centuries,
1077200	1086000	born in 1818, dies in 1883. So literally, he lives the 19th century. And you might, I mean,
1086000	1090240	to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the first two-thirds of his life
1090960	1099120	as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work. Marx was unusually
1099680	1104960	scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job and partly because
1104960	1110960	he was an exile in London, most of his adult life, he worked in the library. I mean, he had a lot of
1110960	1119680	time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels whose family were manufacturers. And you might say the
1119680	1128080	first half to two-thirds of his life are about the critique of capitalism. And that was what,
1128960	1135600	in a broad sense, the audience for his work, Western Europe more or less, was interested in.
1135600	1140960	That's what they wanted. And he gave that to them. He wasn't the only one, but he was very,
1140960	1152960	very effective at it. By the last third of his life, he and the other producers of a
1152960	1158400	anti-capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England, that's a whole other movement,
1160160	1168480	the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia,
1168480	1174800	and so on. You put all these together and there was a shift in what the audience,
1175360	1182640	let's call it a mixture of militant working-class people, on the one hand,
1183280	1189120	and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.
1189120	1196640	They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would
1196640	1203040	like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore,
1203040	1208800	should we? Why should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point,
1208800	1215520	the system has to be fundamentally changed. But they didn't go, you might imagine, they
1215520	1220000	didn't go and say, well, what will that new system looks like? They didn't go that way. What they
1220000	1229040	did was ask the question, how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have
1229040	1237760	captured people's minds, people's daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became,
1238320	1245040	this was already by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency,
1245040	1252080	the mechanism whereby we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation
1252080	1259920	focused on seizing the government. See, before that, it wasn't that the government was not a
1259920	1266480	major interest. If you read Marx's capital, the great work of his maturity, three volumes,
1266480	1271520	there's almost nothing in the state. I mean, he mentions it, but he's interested in the
1271520	1278320	details of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by store, office. What's the
1278400	1283520	structure? The government's secondary for him. But there's also humans within that capitalist
1283520	1291360	system of there's the working class. That's what he's interested in. Think of it almost
1291360	1296880	mechanically like the workplace. In the workplace, there are some people who do this and other people
1296880	1302560	who do that. And they accept this division of authority. And they accept this division of
1302560	1309040	what's going on here, particularly because he believed that the core economic objective of
1309040	1315920	capitalism was to maximize something called profit, which his analysis located right there in the
1316480	1321920	workings of the enterprise. And the government was not the key factor here.
1321920	1329120	And he was looking at ideas of value. How much is the, how much value does the labor of the
1329120	1335840	individual workers provide? And that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way?
1335840	1339760	And so those are the questions of... Right, we'll get to that.
1339760	1343280	But the government was not part of that picture.
1343280	1349040	So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this
1349040	1358400	begins, but it really gets going after he dies. Is this debate among Marxists about the role of
1358400	1365280	the state? They all agree, nearly all of them agree that you have to get the state. The working
1365280	1374640	class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism.
1374640	1381600	When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of
1381600	1391120	them. And so the government is, in a sense, this key institution captured in Marxist language
1391120	1398240	by the bourgeoisie, by the by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of
1398240	1406000	suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way
1406000	1412720	capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution,
1412720	1421120	is to create a place where elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage
1421920	1426960	creates the notion, aha, here's how we're going to... We have to seize the state.
1427840	1434560	And then that gets agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how to do it. One side says,
1435120	1442480	you go with the election. You mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism.
1443040	1451200	And the other side is revolution. Don't do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged.
1452000	1456320	You can't get there. They've long ago learned how to manipulate
1457200	1463680	parliaments. They buy the politicians and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be
1463680	1470640	the way to do it. Revolution gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way.
1471200	1476800	They didn't do... I mean, they fought in the Duma in the in the parliament, but they didn't.
1476800	1485040	And this focus on the state, I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time
1486000	1490720	and if you're interested in the great names, there was a great theorist of the
1491680	1498880	role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power in Germany named Edward Bernstein.
1498880	1507520	Very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautzke and Rosa Luxemburg, two other huge
1507520	1513680	figures in Marxism at the time. And they wrote the articles that everybody reads, but it was a much
1513680	1519280	broader debate. And by the way, that debate still goes on. Reformism versus revolution.
1520080	1526240	And in terms of not all that different, I mean, it's adjusted to history, but in terms of different.
1526240	1532720	Can you comment on where you lean in terms of the mechanism of progress,
1533440	1539200	reformation versus... I'd rather tell you the historical story. Over and over and over again,
1539200	1545760	in most cases, the reformists have always won because revolution is frightening, is scary,
1545760	1552720	is dangerous. And so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant
1552720	1560160	discussion, not an abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.
1560160	1567280	I mean, and I'll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the 1930s,
1567840	1574320	you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States. The greatest shift to the left in
1574320	1583440	the country's history before or since. Nothing like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing
1584000	1591360	composed of the labor movement, which went crazy in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions
1591360	1598320	in the 1930s than at any time before or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time,
1598320	1604400	the explosion of two socialist parties and a communist party that became very powerful,
1604400	1611200	and they all worked together, creating a very powerful leftist presence in this country.
1611840	1619440	They debated in a strategically real way reform or revolution. The reformers were the union people,
1619440	1625120	by and large, and the communists were the revolutionaries, by and large, because they were
1625120	1630800	affiliated with the communist international, with Russia and all of that. And in between,
1630800	1637120	you might say, the two socialist parties. One that was Trotskyist in inspiration, and the other one
1637120	1644240	more moderate Western European kind of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended
1644240	1650880	up, the reformists won that debate. There was no revolution in the 1930s here. But there was
1651760	1659040	a reform that achieved unspeakably great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as
1659040	1665600	strong as it does, because it achieved in a few years in the 1930s, starting around 1932-3,
1666320	1671040	social security in this country. We had never had that before. That's the same one we have now.
1671680	1677760	Unemployment insurance never existed before, that you have till today. Minimum wage for the
1677760	1684080	first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment that hired 15 million people.
1684800	1689440	I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.
1689440	1691120	So that's the 30s and the 40s.
1691120	1698160	30s, not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's the best part. It was paid for by
1698160	1704160	taxes on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the government,
1704160	1712160	the joke is, I have to teach American history to Americans because it has been erased from
1712160	1717600	consciousness. We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of
1717600	1723920	the 20th century with the Russians. Right, with the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.
1724720	1733040	Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries. We
1733040	1741120	seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state and socialism is when the working class
1741840	1749120	captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses its power over the state to make
1749120	1756880	the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward. And again, make a long
1756880	1763680	story short in the interest of time. What happens, which is not unusual in human history, is that
1763680	1771440	the means becomes the end. In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear before he doesn't live very
1771440	1778800	long, he dies in 23. So he's only in power from 17 to 22. But at that time, he has his brain
1778800	1786080	in trouble. 1923, by the way, not at age 23. 1923. Yeah, he's only there for four or five years.
1786880	1792080	He's very clear. He even says, I've done work on that. I've published, so I know this stuff.
1792880	1798400	He says in a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state,
1799120	1804320	but we don't have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards that.
1806960	1812800	With Stalin, Lenin dies and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky loses the
1812800	1819120	fight. He's exiled. He goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power and does all the things he's
1819120	1829200	famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a decision. I mean, not that he
1829200	1836000	makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that they do the following. They declare that
1836000	1845920	they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state, not when the
1845920	1854400	state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other things. No, no. The state itself, once you have it,
1855040	1862560	is socialism. So when a socialist captures the state, that's socialism. Exactly. That's exactly
1862560	1868240	right. I feel like that's definitionally confusing. Well, it shouldn't be because I'll give you an
1868240	1874800	example. Yeah. If you go to many parts of the United States today and you ask people, what's
1874800	1879920	socialism? They'll tell you, they'll look you right in the face and they'll say, the post office.
1881200	1887920	And you know, when I first heard this as a young man, you know what? The post office. It took me a
1887920	1895840	while to understand the post office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States
1895840	1904480	where the government runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government
1904480	1910960	doesn't run it. If a private individual who's not a government official runs it, well,
1910960	1918080	then it's capitalism. If the government takes it, then it's socialism. So what is wrong with that
1918640	1924320	reasoning? So the idea, I think... There's nothing wrong with it. It's a way of looking at the world.
1924400	1929680	It's just got nothing to do with Marx. Well, there's Marx, there's Marxism. Let's try to
1929680	1941600	pull this apart. So what role does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned
1942560	1950560	with this class struggle, with respecting the working class. What is the connection
1951120	1957040	between that struggle and central planning that is often... Central planning is often associated
1957040	1966320	with Marxism. So a centralized power doing allocation. So that has to do with a very specific
1966320	1971840	set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union. Has nothing to do with Marx. How else can
1971840	1978720	you do... I don't think you can find anywhere in Marxist writing anything about central planning
1978720	1989280	or any other kind of planning. Again, fundamentally, then Marx's work has to do with factories,
1989280	1996400	with workers, with the bourgeoisie, and the exploitation of the working class.
1997280	2003520	You still have to take that leap. What is beyond capitalism? Right. So maybe we should
2003520	2010880	turn to that. Focus on that. Okay. We've already looked historically at several attempts
2010880	2016800	to go beyond capitalism. How else can we go beyond capitalism? Let me push it a little further.
2017360	2023600	They didn't succeed in my judgment as a Marxist. And I'm now going to tell you why they didn't
2023600	2028480	succeed because they didn't understand as well as they could have or should have
2029200	2034160	what Marxist was trying to do. I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time
2034160	2039600	under their circumstances. This is not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding
2039600	2046400	what's going on. All right. So give you an example. Most of my adult life, I have taught
2046400	2054240	Marxian economics. I'm a professor of economics. I've been that all my life. I'm a graduate of
2054240	2061280	American universities. As it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its
2061280	2068720	best universities. With another conversation, you and I can have. So I went to Harvard,
2068720	2074320	then I went to Stanford, and I finished a Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education.
2075040	2082000	They tried very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League, 20 semesters,
2082000	2090320	one after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word
2090320	2098160	about Marxism. That is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one
2098160	2104560	professor in Stanford in the one semester I studied with him. He gave me plenty to read,
2104560	2109280	but nobody else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past, and that's
2109280	2118640	very true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually through
2118640	2126160	this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it. Perhaps we can discuss historically
2126160	2132880	why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case. So Marxian economics, did Karl Marx come up in
2132880	2140400	conversation as a kind of dismissal? The best example, yeah, he came up only as an
2140400	2146480	object of dismissal. For example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with,
2146480	2153760	and that was for many years, the canonical book, isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a
2153760	2160400	professor of economics at MIT named Paul Samuelson. And people kind of, you know, a whole generation
2160400	2167120	or two were trained on his textbook. If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree,
2168080	2175120	and the tree is Adam Smith and David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of
2175120	2181040	it. He's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing developed. And it's a tree,
2181040	2186800	and everybody on it is the bourgeois. And then there's this one little branch that goes off like
2186800	2192560	this and sort of starts heading back down. That's Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it
2192560	2198800	complete because he's not a complete faker. But beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book
2198800	2206240	gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that's cold war. I mean, that's really,
2206800	2211600	that's really neat to hear. That's the craziness. Yeah, that's the cold war in this country. My
2211600	2216560	professors were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help.
2217760	2224240	Marx was interested in the relationship of people in the process of production,
2224240	2229680	that he's interested in the factory, the office, the store. What goes on, and by that he means,
2229680	2236320	what are the relationships among the people that come together in a workplace?
2236880	2247760	And what he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately
2247760	2256560	understood and that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation.
2256560	2263840	And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation, which he defines mathematically in the following
2263840	2272640	way. Whenever in a society, any society, you organize people, adults, not the children,
2272640	2279760	not the sick, but you know, healthy adults. In the following way, a big block of them,
2279760	2286320	a clear majority, work. That is, they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature.
2286320	2293280	A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater, whatever. In every human community,
2293280	2300960	Marx argues, there are the people who do that work, but they always produce more chairs,
2300960	2306720	more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume. Whatever their standard of
2306720	2312160	living doesn't have to be low, it can be medium, it can be hard, but they always produce more
2312720	2319600	than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he writes this, uses the German
2319600	2328160	word mehr, M-E-H-R, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the more. That more got badly
2328160	2335920	translated into the word surplus. Shouldn't it have been? But it was. By the way, by German
2335920	2340320	and English people doing the translations. What's the difference between more and surplus?
2340320	2347360	Is there a nuanced? Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary, it's sort of extra.
2348240	2352560	He's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation.
2352560	2358400	Yes, very simple. One minus the other. Yes. x minus y minus.
2358960	2365920	x is the total output, y is the consumption by the producer, therefore x minus y equals s the
2365920	2375760	surplus. Exactly. Now Marx argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following
2375840	2384880	question. Who gets the surplus? Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by
2384880	2392640	those who made it? And Marx's answer is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society.
2392640	2400960	How is that organized? For example, who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it
2401520	2407760	in exchange for getting it? What's their social role? For example, here we go now. If you get this
2407760	2415760	and you get the core of it anyway. And I don't charge much. The workers themselves could get it.
2415760	2422240	Western lawyers. That's right. The workers themselves could get it. That's the closest
2422240	2430400	Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus
2431280	2438720	together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets it, but more
2438720	2444480	importantly, who gets to decide who gets it? Well, who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with
2444480	2452000	it. Right. Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it. So the logic of the
2452000	2459920	word sequence, it's produced, Marx uses the word appropriated, in other words, whose property,
2460480	2465120	who gets to decide, if you like, what happens, all that property ever meant,
2465120	2470080	is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of communism.
2470080	2474960	Right. And that's it. By the way, it's not just clean. It's the only one.
2474960	2479440	So what's, can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?
2480160	2487760	Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced
2487760	2494560	is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus
2494560	2502080	which the master gets, serfs produce a surplus which the Lord gets, employees produce a surplus
2502080	2510960	which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures,
2510960	2520160	because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people,
2520880	2528640	not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment,
2528640	2535920	and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor,
2535920	2542080	simple metaphorical story. You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park,
2542080	2547520	a few blocks from here. It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those
2547520	2553360	men with an ice cream truck comes by, ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling, your children see the ice cream,
2553360	2559520	daddy, get me an ice cream. So you walk over, you take some money and you get two ice cream cones
2559520	2565760	and you give them to one of the children. The other one begins to scream and yell and how,
2566560	2572720	obviously, what's the issue? And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order
2573600	2578000	the one you gave the two ice cream cones to, give one of those to your sister or your brother or
2578000	2585600	whatever it is, and that's how you solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says,
2586400	2592640	you know, you didn't fix it by what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place.
2594480	2600880	My response, though you understand, all of the efforts to deal with inequality in
2601680	2608320	economic, political, cultural, these are all giving the ice cream cone back to the kid you should,
2608320	2610640	you should never do this in the first place.
2610640	2614320	The reallocation of resources creates bitterness and populace.
2614320	2620000	Look at our, we've, this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my
2620000	2625840	life and I've lived here all my life and I've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself apart
2625840	2633600	and it's tearing itself apart basically over the re-division, the redistribution of wealth,
2633600	2640800	having so badly distributed in the first, but that's all in Marx. And notice as I explain to you
2640880	2647120	what is going on in this tension-filled production scene in the office, the factory, the store.
2647120	2650720	I don't have to say a word about the government. I'm not interested in the government.
2650720	2657360	The government's really a very secondary matter to this core question and here comes the big point.
2658480	2667280	If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter and substitute
2667280	2673680	a government official without changing the relationship, you know, you can call yourself
2673680	2679280	a Marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point of the Marxism. The point was not who
2679280	2685680	the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se. You've got to change the organization of the
2685680	2692160	workplace so there isn't a group that makes all the decisions and gets the surplus vis-a-vis
2692160	2698880	another one that produces it. If you do that, you will destroy the whole project. You will,
2698880	2705200	not only will you not achieve what you set out to get, but you'll so misunderstand it that you,
2705200	2711440	the Germans again have a phrase, it's get chief. It goes crooked. It doesn't go right. The project
2711440	2718560	gets off the rails because it can't understand either what its objective should have been and
2718560	2724000	therefore it doesn't understand how and why it's missing its objective. It just knows that this
2724000	2729520	is not what it had hoped for. I mean, there's a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is
2732400	2738480	to what degree, so there's human nature, to what degree does Communism,
2740240	2746320	a lack of exploitation of the working class naturally emerge if you leave two people together
2746400	2751440	in a room and come back a year later? If you leave five people together in a room,
2751440	2757120	if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people, it seems that humans form hierarchies
2758640	2766080	naturally. So the clever, the charismatic, the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you
2766080	2776080	define that, start becoming a leader and start to do maybe exploitation in a non-negative sense
2776080	2783120	a more generic sense starts to become an employer, not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human.
2783120	2788000	Here, you go do this and in exchange, I will give you this, just becomes the leadership role.
2789120	2795760	So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice. The idea sort of of Communism would be nice to
2797120	2801360	not steal from the world. It's nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because of human
2801360	2808000	nature. Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human
2808000	2815360	nature to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding in no particular order.
2815360	2823840	Here's some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell, is a history in which
2823840	2838720	a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise and as they do, they rule out some kinds
2838720	2843760	of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially disruptive and unacceptable.
2845520	2851840	The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct? Is there some human nature
2851840	2858800	that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is, this has to be repressed or else we don't
2858800	2866720	have a society. And Freud helps us to understand that that repression is going on all the time
2866720	2872240	and it has consequences. It's not a finished project. You repress it. It's gone. It doesn't
2872240	2878080	work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of people together at some point,
2878080	2885360	they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to want the other person or persons
2885920	2893040	to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to do that. We just don't.
2894960	2901680	Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it
2902400	2910000	on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every
2910000	2917120	effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you
2917120	2924240	endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological community that
2924240	2930480	has ever been studied, slavery wherever it's existed. I can show you endless documents in
2930480	2936880	which the defenders of those systems, not all of them of course, but many defenders used that
2936880	2944160	argument to naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,
2944160	2951520	to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.
2952320	2959440	And therefore capitalism since it was born and since it's been developing, we all know what the
2959520	2966720	next stage of capitalism is. Looking in fur. The burden is on the people who think it isn't going
2966720	2971280	to die. Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,
2971920	2977040	you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep using
2977040	2982720	that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive systems.
2983360	2991600	That said, well let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about the argument that
2991600	3001920	sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk? So the versus the employee who's just there
3001920	3010560	doing the labor, the capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not in sort of
3010560	3016000	aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort hiring a lot of people? Aren't they
3016000	3022560	taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure? So first of all, there's risk almost
3022560	3029280	in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and ends in the future takes a risk
3029280	3033680	that between now and that future something's going to happen that makes it not work out.
3034320	3041840	I mean, I got into a cab before I came here today in order to do this with you. I took a risk. The
3041840	3046400	cab could have been in an accident, the lightning could have hit us, a bear could have eaten my
3046400	3051600	left foot. Who the hell knows? Should I reward you for the risk you took? No, hold it a second.
3051600	3057840	Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always found it wonderful. You talk about
3057840	3063600	risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk. Let's go with the worker
3063600	3072400	and with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to take
3072400	3080080	that job. He had, he made a decision to have children. They are teenagers. They're now in school
3080080	3085040	at a time when their friendships are crucial to their development. You're going to yank them
3085040	3093120	out of the school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk to do that job every day,
3093920	3100000	to forestall all the other things he could have done. He was taking a risk that this job would
3100000	3107520	be here tomorrow, next month, next year. He bought a house which Americans only do with mortgages,
3107520	3113600	which means he's now stuck. He has to make a monthly payment. If you make a mistake,
3114240	3119520	you capitalist. He's the one who's going to, you're a capitalist. You got a lot of money,
3119520	3126640	otherwise you wouldn't be in that position. You've got a cushion. He doesn't. If you investigate,
3126640	3130480	you'll see that in every business I've ever been in. I've been involved in a lot of them.
3130480	3134400	So you think it's possible to actually measure risk or as your basic argument is there's risk
3134400	3139760	involved in a lot of both the working class and the bourgeoisie, the capitalist, and it's very
3140640	3145040	difficult. The worker would never come and say, because he's been taught right,
3146960	3155680	I want this payment, a wage for the work I do, and I want this page, this payment,
3155680	3161040	for the risk I take. Well, there's some level of communication like that. You have acknowledgement
3161040	3165520	of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary, all those kinds of things.
3166400	3169840	But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.
3170720	3177200	You don't believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an
3177200	3184000	army of workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's
3184000	3192640	killing us. We get paid shit and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds
3192720	3198960	of the defenders of capitalism between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on
3198960	3204800	the one hand and the wage. Let me give you just a couple of examples, because this is my job.
3204800	3212400	This is my life, what I do. The median income of a child care worker in the United States
3212400	3221520	right now as we speak is $11.22 an hour median. So 50% make less, 50% make more.
3222320	3230240	The median income for car park attendant is several dollars per hour higher than that.
3230880	3237840	What does the car park attendant do? He stares at your car for many hours to make sure that nobody
3237840	3246720	comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it and moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure
3246720	3253600	that I know of that makes any rational sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four
3253600	3260400	year olds who are at the key moment of mental formation the first five years, to give that a
3260400	3267040	lower salary than you give the guy who watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it.
3268320	3274720	Gender explains all kinds of issues. The car park people are males and the day the child care
3274720	3281120	people are females and that in our culture is a very big marker of what, but the one who said
3281120	3288160	only the economics professor, nobody else says this stuff because in economy, I don't know if
3288160	3293920	you are familiar with our profession, but we have something which we call marginal product.
3293920	3301360	This is a, this is a fantasy. I was a mathematician before I became an economist. I loved mathematics.
3301920	3308400	I specialized in mathematics. So I know mathematics pretty well. What economists do is silly,
3308400	3318960	is childish, but they think it's mathematics. But think for a minute what it means to suggest
3318960	3325920	that you can identify the marginal product of a factor of production, like a worker.
3326800	3332080	In the textbook, when it's taught, I've taught this stuff. I hold my nose, but I teach it.
3332080	3337040	Then I explain to students what I've just taught you is horseshit, but first I teach it.
3337040	3339440	What is the marginal product if it might be useful to say?
3339440	3345440	The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the
3345440	3351520	diminution of the output? That's the marginal product of that worker.
3351520	3355920	Measured by- The amount of the output that diminishes-
3356880	3360160	Output of the raw product, of the product.
3360160	3364400	Usually in real terms, so physical, not the value. You could do a value,
3364400	3366240	but it's really more the physical you're at.
3366240	3372160	I mean, there is a transformation thing. I'd love to talk to you about value. It's so
3372160	3373680	interesting. What is value?
3373680	3378000	I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that, but I just want to get to the
3378560	3385840	that Hegel, who is Marx's teacher, has a famous line. You can't step in this in the same river
3385840	3392560	twice. The argument is you and the river have changed between the first and the second time.
3392560	3397040	So it's a different you and it's a different river. You can choose not to pay attention to that.
3397040	3402000	Just you can't claim you're not doing that. You can't claim that you can actually do that,
3402000	3404960	because you can't. There is no way to do that.
3404960	3411200	So the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation
3411200	3415520	of the effect that it has on the output. That's right, because too many other things are going on,
3415520	3422560	too many things are changing, and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome
3422560	3429440	on the output side is uniquely determined by the change you made on the input side.
3429440	3430240	Can't do that.
3430240	3434080	Even in the average, it's not going to work out.
3434080	3440720	You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,
3440720	3446240	Keteris Paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did.
3446240	3450160	You held everything. You know why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world.
3450160	3456480	That's not possible. You better account for that. Otherwise, you're mistaking the abstraction
3456480	3460960	from the messy reality you abstracted from to get the abstraction.
3461920	3467600	As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment or an actual experiment
3467600	3472160	of removing every single economist from the world, would we better off or worse off?
3472160	3472960	Much better off.
3472960	3479680	Okay. Economics, and I'm one. I'm talking about myself. See, economics-
3479680	3483840	We're going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how the world works off.
3483840	3491760	No, but the serious part of this is that economics, you know, it's really about capitalism.
3491760	3495120	Economics as a discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing.
3495920	3499200	When I teach, I teach courses at the university, for example, called
3499200	3504480	History of Economic Thought, right? And I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.
3505520	3508320	And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things,
3508880	3515040	but they never called it economics. It made no sense to people to abstract
3516720	3523280	something as central to daily life as economics broadly defined. It made no sense.
3523280	3528480	That's a creation much, much later. That's capitalism that did that, created the feeling.
3528480	3533360	So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them particular passages.
3534240	3540640	By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it, Plato and Aristotle talked about markets
3540640	3546720	because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were beginning to intrude
3546720	3554480	upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena that we're not just producing
3554480	3559280	goods and then distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid pro quo. You know, I'll give
3559280	3565200	you three oranges. You give me two shirts, a market exchange. And both Aristotle and Plato
3566080	3573680	hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason, they destroy social cohesion. They destroy
3573680	3579520	community. They make some people rich and other people poor, and they set us against each other,
3579520	3584880	and it's terrible. And that's what they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on. One of them
3585680	3592240	said, okay, there can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says,
3592240	3598640	no, no, no, no, no, no. Too late for that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid
3598640	3605840	of this institution that has crawled in amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that.
3605840	3614160	But what we can do is control it, regulate it, get from the market what it does reasonably well,
3614240	3618880	and prevent it from doing the destructive things it does so badly.
3619520	3625200	So the fundamentally, the destructive thing of a market is the engine of capitalism. So
3625200	3634160	it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an institution
3634160	3640880	that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,
3640960	3644720	is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.
3645440	3650880	Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.
3654000	3659360	And this was that God said, if there's a person who needs to borrow from you,
3660000	3665760	then that's a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do is to help him,
3666080	3675120	to demand an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is God hates you for that.
3675120	3680480	That's a sin. Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.
3680480	3686640	But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the
3687440	3695520	intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able to create a system that involves
3695600	3705840	thousands, millions of humans. And there'd be some level of safe, self-regulating fairness.
3706880	3712240	There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.
3712240	3713920	I wonder what... I guess...
3713920	3719200	Suppose you were interested in having, suppose you took us your problem,
3720080	3722560	we have a set of funds that can be loaned out.
3724000	3727920	People don't want to consume it. They're ready to lend it. Okay.
3729360	3733520	To whom should they lend it? Well, we could say in our society,
3734720	3740400	we're going to run this the way professors in institutions like MIT work this.
3741200	3746080	They write up a project. They send the project in to some government office
3747040	3753200	where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government decides we're
3753200	3760320	going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in our society. We're in
3760320	3765280	greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend money to
3765280	3770960	people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here because we're
3770960	3778240	going to... But instead, what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate? Whoa, what do you do?
3779600	3785760	What ethics would justify you do it? It's like a market in general. Something is in shortage.
3785760	3790400	All markets are about how to handle shortage. That's one basic way to understand it.
3791920	3796080	And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word shortage
3796640	3801680	means, has no other meaning. If the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you've got a
3801680	3808560	problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough supply. You have
3808560	3814000	a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who have a lot of
3814000	3821200	money to bid up the price of whatever's short. That solves your problem because as the price
3821200	3827440	goes up, the poor people can't... They drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price.
3827440	3833520	So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people with the most money. At this
3833520	3840800	point, most human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it
3840800	3846240	because it contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say,
3847200	3851920	what? You know what that means? It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk
3851920	3857040	and give it to their cat while the poor person has no milk for their five children.
3858000	3860320	There it is. Do you want to mark it? Why?
3860880	3866560	Over the fundamental thing that seems unfair, there's the resulting inequality now.
3868240	3871280	Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality. Yes, it is.
3872160	3876480	What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,
3876480	3884800	to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?
3885840	3893360	Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,
3893360	3899760	but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life,
3901360	3907920	to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments
3909680	3913440	that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces.
3914960	3922480	Not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined,
3922480	3927760	but just observing historically. Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff
3927760	3934240	that seemed to have made life easier and better on average. What do you say to that?
3935120	3942960	I have several responses to that, but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's
3942960	3948880	going on there. But let me give you the argument so that you can hear them and then you can evaluate
3948880	3958800	them as can anybody who's listening or watching. Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's
3958800	3965840	central arguments was that everything that exists, exists, quote, in the contradiction.
3966720	3970960	In simple English, there's a good and bad side if you like to everything,
3971680	3977360	and you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the good
3977360	3981200	things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the other side of the
3981200	3989760	good one, et cetera. The dialectic. Yes, exactly. Marx very attentive to that explicitly agrees
3989760	3996320	with this on many occasions and applies it, of course, to the central object of his research,
3996960	4004160	capitalism. This is not a simple-minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism
4004160	4009600	as if there were nothing that this system achieved or accomplished. One of the things he
4009600	4019200	celebrates a lot is the technological dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound,
4019200	4025920	because he lived at the time when major breakthroughs in textile technology, in mining,
4026640	4036880	in chemistry, and so on were achieved. But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible
4036880	4042400	for the improvement in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people,
4042400	4051520	Marx now comes back and says, oh, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system
4052240	4061680	has been mostly represented by capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists
4061680	4070560	with very few exceptions, some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the lives
4070560	4078480	of the mass of people. The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What that means is
4078560	4084880	replace a worker with a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap China,
4086240	4091040	bring in desperate immigrants from other parts of the world, because they will work for less
4091040	4096640	money than the folks that you have here at home. Every measure to help the standard of living
4096640	4104720	of American workers had to be fought for for decades over the opposition of capitalists
4104720	4110800	from the beginning to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was past 19,
4110800	4116960	middle of the 1930s, when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together,
4116960	4124720	they don't want, and today, just a factoid for you. The last time the minimum wage was raised
4124720	4131680	in the United States, federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty sum
4131680	4141840	of $7.25 an hour, which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is,
4141840	4148720	not 11, 12, 13 years since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country
4148720	4155360	every year, and in the last year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up,
4156320	4163600	the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom,
4163600	4176320	of growing inequality. This is the nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get
4176320	4181920	credit for the improvement in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every
4182000	4189440	generation. You know, it takes your breath away. It's an argument, whoa. But I take my hat off if
4189440	4198000	I had one, because that is one of the only ways to justify this system. Long ago, let me get the
4198000	4207360	heart of it, long ago, capitalism could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease,
4207920	4214240	could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now, but it didn't. And that's the worst
4215040	4223600	moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify that when you could, you didn't?
4224320	4229120	Look, let me get at it another way, because this may interest you anyway.
4229280	4237280	The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic, it is. And along the way,
4237280	4242320	it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better, no question.
4243200	4250960	But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into
4250960	4259520	capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous, and I can give you a, because you
4259520	4266400	do math, you'll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which you have
4269040	4273200	$100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,
4274160	4280080	and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers, and he puts them all together,
4280080	4286960	and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something at one of the prices,
4287600	4295120	and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,
4295680	4302080	let's say the revenue is, it doesn't really matter, it's 120, for lack of a better word,
4303280	4309520	220, sorry. And he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,
4309520	4314800	another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other 20 is his profit and he puts
4314800	4322880	that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough, a machine, a new machine. And the
4322880	4332160	new machine is so effective, you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers.
4333040	4338800	So you don't need to spend 100 on workers, you only need to spend 50. You can do it with half
4338800	4343920	the workers. And so the capitalist goes to the workers, by the way this happens every day,
4343920	4349600	and he says to half of them, you're fired. Don't come back Monday morning, I don't need you.
4349600	4357600	It's nothing personal, I got a machine. Why does he do that? Because the 50 he now no longer has
4357600	4362720	to spend on labor, because it doesn't need half of them, he keeps. Everything else is the same,
4362720	4369680	the machine, everything else is just to make their math easy. So he keeps as his own profit
4369680	4377280	the 50 that before he paid for those workers. Because when he sells it for 220, that 50 he
4377280	4383760	don't have to give to the next job until he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology
4383760	4391280	leads, he's happy. He's become more profitable. He's got an extra 50, which is why he buys the
4391280	4399360	machine. The workers are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their
4399360	4404720	husband and wife, tell them I don't have a job anymore. I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was
4404720	4410720	nice enough to say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need them. So I'm completely screwed
4410720	4415840	here. I don't know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's
4415840	4421680	education or whatever else he's got going for himself. All right, now, now the point. There was
4421680	4427200	of course an alternative path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers,
4427840	4432080	pay them exactly the same that you did before for half a day's work.
4434320	4439200	You would have got the same output, same revenue, same profit as before.
4439840	4447840	But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day of the lives
4447840	4456240	of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this technology,
4456960	4463920	but instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of more money.
4464560	4470880	You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.
4472320	4477520	So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation of
4477520	4484720	this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to ideas of what
4484720	4489920	the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative? So you just kind
4490000	4497120	of as a opposite by contrast showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work less,
4498080	4505760	get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other interests,
4506800	4514400	the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen and
4515360	4521920	embolden the basic humanity that's under all of us. Yes, but then what cost does that have
4523040	4532960	on the deadline fueled, competition fueled machine of technological innovation
4532960	4539200	that is the positive side of capitalism? It slows it down. It slows it down and the question is
4539520	4546960	which is more important for the flourishing of humanity? I agree with that and I'd love there
4546960	4555680	to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it, let's debate it and then let's decide what
4555680	4560960	mixture, because it's not either or, the math problem I gave you is either or we could mix it,
4560960	4566080	you could have a third less of a working day instead of a half less and then the other part
4566080	4571600	would be extra profit for our employer, et cetera. So let's have a democratic discussion
4572240	4579200	of what is the mix between the positive and we have no such thing. All of this is decided by
4579200	4584720	one side in this debate, which not only we know what they do, they always choose the one that
4584720	4589440	maximizes their profit because that's what they were told to do in business school where I've
4589440	4597200	taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision, but it's lopsided to boot. So we don't have the
4597200	4603920	opportunity, but I would love for us to be good Hegelian Marxists and say let's take a look at
4603920	4610240	the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can. We'll make mistakes, but we'll all
4610240	4617200	make them together. It won't be one of us making a dictatorial decision. Marx developed the notion
4617200	4622800	of the dictatorship of the proletariat, not as a notion of how government is not, I'm sorry, not
4622800	4628160	Marx, Lenin did that, not as a notion of how the government works, but as a notion of what the
4628160	4635760	practical reality is. The dictatorship of these key decisions is not made by some sitting council,
4635760	4641840	it's made by each little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace,
4641840	4647760	which is why Marx focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right
4647760	4653440	now so it doesn't lurk in the background what the alternative is. Let's go there. Okay. It goes
4653440	4660720	right back to what I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees together
4661600	4669280	appropriate their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it,
4669280	4676240	which includes the decision of whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not
4678000	4685920	to use the machine and the savings it might allow to be handled by more leisure for themselves
4686800	4696800	or as a fund for new developments in technology or new products or whatever they want. And you
4697680	4702480	this is an old idea in human. Marx loved that. Toward the end of his life, he
4703840	4709760	started reading extensively in anthropology. And one of the reasons he did that toward the end of
4709760	4715360	his life was because he kept discovering that in this society and that, including here in the
4715360	4724000	United States, that there were examples of people who organized their production in precisely this
4724000	4732480	way as a collective democratic community in which everybody had an equal voice. So we all
4732480	4738960	together decide democratically what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and what to do
4738960	4747600	with the output we all help to produce. So let's do it in, you know, in this country where democracy
4748320	4757360	is a value nearly everybody subscribes to. Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction
4758160	4764080	that there is a place in our society where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The
4764080	4771840	workplace, in the workplace a tiny group of people, unaccountable to the rest of them, the
4771840	4778080	employer, whether that's an individual, a family, a partnership, or a corporate board of directors.
4778080	4786400	Tiny group of people controls economically a vast mass of employees. Those employees don't elect
4786400	4792560	those people, have no, nothing, there is no accountability. It is the most undemocratic
4793280	4800800	arrangement imaginable and this society insists on calling itself democratic
4800800	4807120	when it has organized the minor matter of producing everything in a way that is the direct,
4807120	4815600	it's autocratic. So to push back on a few things. So one is the idea of this society calling itself
4815600	4821520	democratic is that the government is elected democratically and the government is able to
4821600	4827760	pressure the workplace through the process of regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of
4827760	4833840	how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things. That's the one idea. The other is there
4833840	4841200	is a natural force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies of competition being the
4841200	4849040	accountability. So if you're a shitty boss, the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom
4849040	4854720	to move to another company work for a better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers and
4854720	4862080	the bosses. That's at least the idea that you there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving.
4862080	4869120	One is the law. So regulatory regulations by passed by the government, democratic. And the second
4869120	4875600	is because there's always alternatives in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave
4875600	4882560	well because you can always leave. So I mean, that's kinds of accountability. But what you're
4882560	4889680	saying is that does not result in a significant enough accountability where the employer
4890720	4896080	that avoids exploitation of the worker. Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get
4896080	4904560	in those mechanisms. And let me respond to that. And then I'll counter argument. First, competition.
4906560	4914480	Here again, we have to be Hegelians just a little competition destroys itself. It doesn't
4914480	4920160	need any out. The whole point of competition is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same
4920160	4926960	product as the other guy, either a better quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because
4926960	4932160	the customers will come to me because my price is lower or my quality is better. And they'll
4932160	4936640	leave the other guy, he'll go out of business. Now let's follow. When he goes out of business,
4936640	4943440	because I won the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to
4943440	4949520	be able to serve a market. He can't serve anymore. So I'm going to buy the used equipment. I'm going
4950160	4960160	and thereby many become few. Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis.
4960240	4967040	It's the product. Well, let's see. That's where it comes from. There's another element to the
4967040	4973200	system where there's always a new guy that comes in. There isn't. Well, that's the dream. The
4973200	4980640	entrepreneurial spirit of a free, of the United States, for example, of a capitalist system is
4981520	4988960	you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build up a business that takes on Google and
4988960	4996880	Facebook and Twitter and all the different car for GM, which is what you look at Tesla, for
4996880	5003680	example. That's the American dream. One of the many ideals of the American dream is you can
5006240	5013920	move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world. It can happen.
5014000	5018080	It can happen, but you're against it. That's like you can win a lottery.
5018080	5024240	No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here you can work your ass off if you have
5024240	5030240	a good idea. The odds are better in the lottery. That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.
5030240	5036720	How many Teslas do you know? Tesla is a really bad example because the car company, the automotive
5036720	5045200	sector is so difficult. They operate as such a thin margin of profit. They're probably a good
5045200	5051840	example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of lack of innovation.
5054000	5060640	That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain. They have their uniqueness as
5060640	5066000	you're quite right, but so does every other industry. The one thing that's common is that
5066000	5072720	many become few. What you can also have is when you have a few, they jack up the price. They make
5072720	5079920	an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism, Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize
5079920	5086720	people to break into this industry because the few remaining are making a wild amount of profit
5086720	5091040	because they are a few and can jigger the market to make it work like that for them.
5092000	5100480	The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market share, that's a polite way of
5100480	5106800	saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact, an oligopolist, one of a handful
5106800	5112240	of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for. To push back a little bit also,
5112240	5120080	because this is a question also, do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism?
5120800	5130320	It completely removes the basic decency of human beings. If you give me a choice to press a button
5131680	5137040	to get rid of the competition, but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering. There's a lot of
5137040	5142400	people at the heads of companies that won't press that button. It's not in the calculation,
5142400	5148240	it's not just money, it's human well-being too. You think?
5150080	5153680	Yes. You and I don't live in the same place then.
5153680	5158640	You're saying that the forces of capitalism take over the minds of the people at the top,
5159520	5162960	and then they seize being human. No.
5162960	5165360	The basic, okay. I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
5165360	5170640	Depending on your model of humans, but they lose track of the better angels of their nature,
5171120	5175600	and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cop at the top.
5175600	5180560	I would put it differently, that the system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural selection.
5181120	5186560	The guys who may, I could say the women too, it doesn't matter. The people who make it up through
5186560	5193040	the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along the way
5193040	5198160	that becomes selective. If they can't stand it, because they have that human quality,
5198160	5203760	and there are people like, I've known them. They're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont.
5204960	5209440	They went there and they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that.
5209440	5214960	I'm going to make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm going to
5214960	5221520	be enjoying the people that come by and be a decent human. Of course, of course, but the system
5221520	5227680	selects the firm. If you don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up,
5228240	5232880	you're toast there anyway. The rest of the people who vote for you are going to kick you out.
5232880	5237600	You can tell them all day long what a lovely person you are. They're going to look at you and
5237600	5241760	wonder, what happened to you? How did you even get this far with the lovely person horses?
5241760	5251360	It's not necessarily just lovely person. Maybe, I'll just say my bias is the people I know are
5251840	5260800	and especially at the top of companies are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big
5260800	5267760	part of it. I think a lot of the things we're talking about is when there's not much innovation
5267760	5276560	in the system. Innovation usually comes in the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.
5276560	5281600	There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you
5281600	5288160	want to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes and then there's
5288160	5295200	a flurry as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is and then you
5295200	5300400	have a period where you can get excited about that and the very rich people who come to the top
5300480	5303840	can talk endlessly as they always do about innovation.
5304560	5313280	But again, you know, it really is, this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring kind
5313280	5322560	of issue. For me, how do I put this in a way that, you know, I don't mean to offend, so please,
5322800	5325120	please. No, no, no, I don't want to. But
5331680	5337520	the problem with capitalism is, and maybe you'll like this, the problem with capitalism is
5338800	5343680	not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders
5343680	5350640	would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite, that it is such a
5350640	5359120	contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite make it.
5359920	5364960	There's always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking about,
5364960	5372320	who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top. By God knows
5372880	5378960	what hook or what crook that they did it, but most of them go, and you know why? Because
5378960	5388240	their humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do. I mean, the corporate
5388240	5398240	sector this year, just to give you an idea, CEOs are jacking up their wage package. They're already
5398240	5405280	out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now 300, 300 times what the average worker pays,
5405280	5409920	but they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's what's happening in their universe. That's
5409920	5414640	what they're all doing it, and they have to do. Each one of them justifies that I have to do that,
5414640	5420000	otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one, which of course is true, but is no comfort for the mass
5420000	5427920	of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument isn't very exciting. So they're doing that at a
5427920	5435040	time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone through the COVID disaster. They've gone
5435040	5441600	through the worst, second worst economic crash of capitalism in our history. After two years of this
5441600	5448480	one-two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch, and we are now predicting rising interest
5448480	5453920	rates and a recession at the end of the year or early next year. You can't do this to a working
5453920	5459760	class. When this was done to the German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result.
5460400	5465600	You keep doing that in this country. We're already watching it. You're going to get that too.
5465600	5468080	You're already getting bits and pieces. You can't keep doing this.
5468080	5472000	So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.
5472000	5474160	Taking out on it. That can turn to anger.
5474160	5481120	Some little 18-year-old kid who has to go three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket.
5481440	5486080	What? And it happens every day in this country. Every day.
5486880	5493120	So that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger, potentially.
5494240	5500400	By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality, and this goes to Elon Musk.
5502720	5510000	If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number
5510000	5517040	was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.
5517040	5523600	They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous in our resources.
5526480	5532800	There is a way to make transportation much more rational, and we've known it for decades.
5532800	5540240	It's called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained crystal clear,
5540240	5550000	clean, frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this
5550000	5557760	society. In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That's less than
5557760	5564000	we're sending to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it. A public transit system where?
5564000	5568000	Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country's overwhelmingly
5568000	5573760	metropolitan area. Well, it surely has to be more than $30 billion. Well, it was a few years ago.
5574800	5578800	You're saying it's not a number that's insane. Right. It's not crazy stuff.
5578800	5583600	It's a reasonable number. Let me just finish the point.
5583600	5588480	Sure, yes. Okay. So I'm trying to be rationally here.
5590480	5595680	If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with
5595680	5600640	fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use of the fossil fuel,
5600640	5605920	particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass transit.
5606640	5610400	We don't, we're doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.
5610960	5616720	Well, there's, you know, on, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public
5616720	5623600	transit because it's going to be reasonable vehicles. It will end in theory car ownership.
5623600	5626640	So you just have a more kind of distributed public transit system.
5626640	5632400	If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal and the major goal of
5632400	5639600	the other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share by smaller, so they have some,
5639600	5645120	four General Motors Toyota, all of them are making electric cars. So what they've done is
5645120	5650480	they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.
5651360	5655200	That's fucking nuts. What are you doing? That's one of the things they're doing,
5655200	5658560	but automation is also another one. But on the Elon side, there's also
5658560	5665520	a hilariously named boring company, which is working on tunnels, which is actually expanding the
5667280	5672640	flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit. I think, listen,
5672640	5678560	I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know what a public
5678560	5685680	transit system is, period. There's F-150 pickup trucks. Well, there's, this is an interesting,
5686560	5693360	so the older, by the way, footnote, the older the city, the more likely it has public transportation.
5694240	5696480	So you're saying Boston is the best example? Yes.
5697120	5700400	Have you been, you know? Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.
5700400	5705120	Boston with the street railway. Boston is your case study of how to do this,
5705120	5707920	because they've been doing it all along. New York's pretty good too.
5707920	5710960	There's a trade out. Yeah. New York, I would say, is better than Boston because
5711760	5717200	there's, you know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.
5718480	5722560	It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point. But there is a,
5724400	5732000	the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America. And there is a practical nature to
5732000	5739920	the fact that in order to do public transit, in order to do some of these things that you're
5739920	5744880	talking about with the working class, there has to be a central planning component,
5745520	5752960	or there has to be a centralized component. And America is very much based on the idea of,
5753520	5757600	at least in recent times, I would say from the founding of individualism,
5758240	5765840	of respecting individual freedom. Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of
5765840	5774480	Marxism to life, you would trample on individual freedoms? No. Can you respect both? Sure. For
5774480	5782240	me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who have had
5782240	5788640	that freedom eroded under the capitalism. That's a motive for my Marxism. It was for Marx too.
5788640	5796160	He loved the French Revolution. He loved the liberté, égalité, fraternité, the great three,
5796160	5801680	and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like. He believed in all of that. His critique
5801680	5808160	of capitalism was it promised it and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond
5808160	5817520	it is because it didn't deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of
5818880	5828560	a gender. But again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, so if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way
5828560	5838240	it's set up in this society. Some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been
5838240	5844960	pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's bad and what's dangerous
5844960	5849440	and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in and tell you what
5849440	5854320	to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem. There really is no
5854320	5860640	other way to explain the following in American politics. Large numbers of people lose their
5860640	5868640	homes in a downturn, like the so-called Great Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government.
5869440	5874240	Large numbers of people go unemployed. And what are the media all about? The government.
5875280	5881360	If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kick the workers by throwing them out of their home,
5881360	5886800	and they don't get angry with me. They get angry with the government. I fire large numbers of people.
5886800	5891680	I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a result of having no job and no income.
5891680	5899840	And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. This is a genius stroke.
5899920	5904560	In theory, but if you look at government, because you said accountability in the
5904560	5908640	capitalist system has no accountability. There's some pushback I give on the accountability. I
5908640	5914800	think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Galilean way. There's more accountability
5915680	5922000	for, I would say, that in theory, government is perfectly accountable. That's the whole point
5922000	5928560	of a democratic system, is you vote people in. In practice, there's a giant growing bureaucracy
5929520	5933120	that is accountable only on the surface. There's two parties
5934400	5942960	that seem to be, are the same media somehow integrated into making the same two parties
5942960	5949280	that are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing
5949280	5955040	and bitterly arguing and calling each other's names, nasty names and all those kinds of things.
5955040	5963440	Okay, but that's government. So who exactly is worse here? Government or companies?
5963440	5970400	Well, why are we asking that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about
5970400	5975600	Republicans and Democrats just now, with which I agree, I would say the same thing about corporations
5975600	5980320	and the government. This is the same people, literally. But let's go to Churchill. Which one
5980320	5986080	is the, which one is worse? Let's go to Churchill, like democracy is the worst formal government,
5986080	5991440	except all the other ones or whatever. So this kind of same idea, which one exactly is worse?
5991440	5997600	Because to me, it seems like, which one between what government and industry and companies?
5998400	6007200	It's because government is plagued by, I will call it corruption because the corruption of
6008160	6013840	bureaucratic paperwork and then because they're, but they're not accountable. There doesn't seem
6013840	6019040	to be a serious accountability. Again, we're not see, we're not living on the same planet.
6019680	6028960	The greatest practitioners of central planning are corporations. Elon has an operation like
6028960	6037680	General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other mega-corps. They have to plan. They buy up companies
6038320	6044640	because they don't want to deal in the market. They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of
6044640	6051920	having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control. They want the
6051920	6058160	professor to teach the genius of a market. They hate the market. And when they grow to be big,
6058160	6063360	they keep buying whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them,
6063360	6070720	which requires them then to plan the production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying
6070720	6078960	them in the market. The model of the government is a private corporation. I have spent my life,
6078960	6085040	give you an example, in American universities, big ones, famous ones, not just as a student,
6085040	6090160	but as a professor. I teach now at the new school here. It's another one, right?
6091040	6098880	They will model themselves after businesses. You can attack the bureaucracy of universities,
6098880	6108240	good reason, it's a mess, but they're proudly modeling themselves on organizing their bureaucracy
6108240	6116080	in a business-like manner. So you're looking at a difference which isn't there. The government
6116080	6123200	and the private sector are partners and both of them wouldn't have it any other way. The corporations
6123200	6129920	want that from the government and the government now knows that to please the corporations is the
6129920	6135360	number one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs and keep their system
6135360	6140640	going. And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.
6140640	6147920	But there's important differences that I don't know if they're fundamental or just a consequence
6147920	6152880	of history, but if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than companies.
6152880	6159040	Companies are accountable by, especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable by sort of
6159040	6163200	the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling.
6164000	6173200	The government is accountable by votes and it seems like government, unlike companies,
6173200	6179760	for most of companies, history is always too big to fail, meaning it can always just print
6179760	6189840	money. It can always save itself and that creates a bureaucracy. You rarely pay the cost of having
6189840	6196640	made bad decisions if you're in government. You distribute the blame and it's very unclear
6196640	6201440	who's responsible for bad decisions. So bad decisions in government accumulate. So you become
6201440	6207520	more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor in your decision making in terms of,
6207520	6212880	you said public transit, should we build a public transit system in this city or not?
6212880	6218000	That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting decision. I would say it's very often a very good
6218000	6225280	decision, but whoever makes that decision should be accountable for a good or bad decision and it
6225280	6233120	seems like companies are more accountable. They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more
6233120	6240960	because they can go bankrupt. There's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering
6240960	6247600	decisions. Government doesn't seem to be under the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with
6247680	6254080	that? I disagree with that. Everything in my history pushes me. You may be living... I may be
6254080	6262320	living in a different... Who knows? A planet or taking a different sort of drug. I won't mention
6262320	6269360	the name but I personally had a lot to do with a very large company here in the United States,
6269360	6280400	here in the New York area and it involved two brothers and a family who built it up into a
6280400	6291360	huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo of the family and he was more responsible
6291360	6297040	than anybody else building it up. But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his
6297040	6305200	brother so the one brother who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes became a vice
6305200	6313360	president, got an enormous salary, got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from
6313360	6324000	where I'm sitting right now and that was the way that family handled that company and all of his
6324000	6332400	relatives that were somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever because in my experience
6332400	6339920	with this and because I went to the schools I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,
6339920	6346720	corporate execs, full of those stories, you know, they made mistake after mistake which they would
6346720	6355600	tell you about, didn't undermine there. They were always able to blame somebody else, something else
6356320	6361280	that scraped them through and had they not been able to they would have been replaced by another
6361280	6368640	person who did the same thing for as long as they could and they knew it. They would talk about it
6368640	6376080	at family events, that's how I know. I understand that you want the outside world to look at it
6376080	6385120	this way but it's not my experience. But again, that kind of thing at the risk of saying human
6385120	6394080	nature again, I wonder what kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is the question
6394080	6400400	of, I would call that, let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption, which system allows
6400400	6404800	for more corruption. But remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less
6404800	6412240	government, it's more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when
6412240	6420560	everybody has a vote, when you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are
6420560	6426800	to a larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is
6426800	6432320	that most companies are responsible to and now you've got a whole different universe. It's not
6432320	6438640	a small group of people, can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden, most of it on and on and on.
6438640	6444000	This is, you know, worker co-ops is what this is called in many parts of the world. So it's not
6444000	6450320	that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism I understand
6450320	6459520	is to pick from historical precedents the things that we think will work better. And I think if
6459520	6465040	all the people in an enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically decided, they would
6465040	6470880	never give two or three individuals $100 million while everybody else can't send their kid to
6470880	6479840	college. If they can do that. So just to return, just to address this point about the particular
6479840	6487040	implementation of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union, why did Stalinism,
6487040	6492800	for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, in human suffering? Is there any elements
6493520	6503040	within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system
6503040	6509040	that led to that bloodshed? I don't think so. I think there are many things that led to the
6509040	6517840	bloodshed and so all that Stalin's regimes did. And, you know, I spent 10 years in my life
6519200	6526240	with another economist writing a book about that to try to explain from a Marxist position
6526880	6532720	the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. You might want to take a look at it sometime, but
6533440	6538000	there, I'm going to say a few things now, but all of those things are spelled out
6538000	6547440	in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc., in that work. Let me start with, you know,
6547440	6558320	playing a little bit with Hegel. The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union
6559040	6564000	was really not so much what the Soviet Union did, but what the rest of the world did.
6564640	6570880	I mean, you had a really interesting move, and I'll give you a parallel from today.
6572000	6580880	The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed. World War I just, it fell apart.
6580880	6587120	The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already been in trouble. There was a
6587120	6593520	revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. I mean, if you know Russian history,
6593520	6601760	which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917.
6602640	6609840	And in some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize
6609840	6617440	the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. You know, earlier on with Karensky,
6617440	6624000	the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people more
6624000	6631040	skeptical and would not have been called Marxists, probably, by history. They couldn't, they tried.
6631040	6636960	They couldn't. Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.
6637760	6646160	The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this
6646160	6653920	immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes,
6654560	6662160	but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power and in a big country. And they freaked out.
6663120	6669760	If you know American history, this country, the leadership of this country, went completely berserk.
6669760	6676880	I mean, we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s
6676880	6687840	were a time of palmerades in Boston, the Sakhal Vanzetti trials, really grim hostility. And you
6687840	6694000	had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution. The U.S.,
6694880	6701840	Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops. So what you had right away was
6701840	6710400	a notion in the West that this was, this was unthinkable. This was, there was a great professor
6710400	6718400	at Princeton, Meyer, forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all American foreign
6718400	6727920	policy since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about
6727920	6734480	Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven't figured out. That was a big
6734480	6743280	change back in 1989 and 90, you know, Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least
6743280	6747680	they're not lending. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case.
6749600	6758720	So you had one factor was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global, I mean,
6758720	6765200	Rosa Luxemburg is, I mean, I assume you know the, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets
6765920	6771840	of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenin's, by the way, but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into
6771840	6780240	bits, killed. So you are attributing some, some of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the
6780240	6785440	rest of the world turned away. Turned against. Turned against, sort of, you turn against is the
6785440	6791360	better way. Very, yeah, I mean, not in order of importance, but it's, it's a very important part
6791360	6798160	of the psychology of being, you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite
6798160	6803440	as much evidence that indeed there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it.
6803440	6810960	Look, you could see the effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first,
6810960	6814480	that you could have socialism in one country. That was thought to be
6814480	6822080	ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism. Marx was, Marx was against capitalism everywhere.
6822080	6828400	It was, you know, workers of the world unite, not workers of Russia unite, workers of the,
6829200	6835680	he had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms with the fact that the
6836320	6842320	revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin, was tried in Munich, was tried in
6842320	6850160	Budapest, was tried in Seattle here, they all failed. They all failed, and he's left. So,
6850160	6857520	the French would say, tout ça, right, you know, all alone. That's one. The second thing is economic
6857520	6864960	isolation. Russia's a poor country and it needed what it got before the war, which were heavy
6864960	6870080	investments from the French and the Germans, particularly, but others too. Now this was all
6870080	6877040	cut off. And you can see the replay with the sanctions program. It's, we're gonna do it again,
6877040	6881680	we're gonna do it again. We have to do, we have, the world is different and the sanctions don't
6881680	6889360	work, but they're gonna try them. Because it's the history. But that culture was, today is
6889360	6894800	completely different. Russia's a different place today, but Russia has China and that changes
6894800	6900160	everything. And they don't get that here yet, but they will. Yeah, there's a very complicated
6900160	6908960	dynamic with China, even with India. Yep. Or Turkey. Brazil. Sorry to say human nature may
6908960	6915120	change at a slower pace than the geopolitical. That has occurred to me as well. I get that point.
6915120	6921520	So is there a, can you steel man the case or consider the case that there's something about
6921520	6928400	the implementation of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working
6928400	6936080	class and the workers unite, that naturally leads to formation of a dictatorial force,
6936160	6946240	a dictator that says, let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details
6946240	6952560	of how to run the democracy of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose.
6952560	6957120	And then that naturally leads to a dictator and there's naturally inhuman nature,
6958080	6965040	power and absolute power as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever
6965040	6972080	you focus on Marx's ideals, you're going to end up with a dictator and often when you give too
6972080	6976160	much power to anyone, human, a small number of people, you're going to get into a huge amount
6976160	6982480	of trouble. You've put things together there that I would, I think if you, if you give,
6983040	6991360	put as a word, yeah, as German, the, if you, I remember, I told you my mother was born in
6991360	6997920	Germany. And then your dad is French. Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know you're European.
6997920	7005600	It's a city on the border of France and Germany. If you come from, Alsatians, Alsace in Germany.
7005600	7011440	So they're German speaking. Yeah, they're both. It's bilingual because it's been back and forth
7011440	7017040	so many times in medieval days already that it literally, you go from one store to another,
7017040	7022400	the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German, but they all speak both languages
7022400	7029200	because you don't speak either of them. I speak Russian. Russian, but not German.
7029200	7034000	Ukrainian, no, it took French for four years in high school, but I've forgotten all of it.
7034560	7039120	I remember the romance and the spirit of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can
7039200	7049280	remember. If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long
7049280	7058880	period of time and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks
7058880	7063760	and it stays and you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution
7064320	7071040	and you will discover it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people
7071040	7079520	don't. If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism
7079520	7084400	and that it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was Zeus
7084400	7090880	and Diana and all the others and they were very human like, but instead we have one who is the
7090960	7099120	absolute beginning and what are you doing? You're teaching people an authority line
7099120	7105040	that comes from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings, if in your feudal manner
7105040	7111600	the Lord sits called to the landlord, he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on
7112400	7118160	and you do this for thousands of years, you can make a Russian revolution in 1917,
7118160	7124960	but if you imagine you've gotten away from all that people assume without ever thinking about it,
7125600	7134480	you're going to have trouble. Stalin is figured here as the originator of his situation. He
7134480	7141040	wasn't. He never had that power. He may have thought that, but I don't. He's the product.
7142000	7147120	Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn't that kind of guy. You know, he's a
7147120	7155600	baseball playing lawyer. That's what he was, but they made him into Tala. You're the product of
7155600	7162480	history. No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the literature. It was the structures and
7162480	7171200	institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has its own rhythm and doesn't follow the
7171200	7175520	calendar of a political revolution. That's the fundamental question. Is there something about
7175600	7184400	communism that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?
7185040	7191120	No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what
7191120	7196720	they find familiar to what seems to make sense and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example
7196720	7202720	from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party
7202720	7211280	of private enterprise and minimum government. Income Trump runs for office in 2016, is elected.
7211920	7219680	Okay, what does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most massive
7219680	7227440	government intervention in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades. Nobody says anything.
7228400	7238880	The Republicans cave and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on anything.
7239440	7244160	He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.
7244160	7250080	That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman
7250080	7255040	course in economics, which everybody knows. Everybody who teaches these courses knows.
7255040	7262000	It doesn't matter. He's still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come
7262000	7273680	to a point where it can't solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all
7273680	7282400	of the laissez-faire and all of the individualism. Suddenly the Republican Party is gone and now
7282400	7287520	they're going to make an abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with
7287520	7295680	your uterus. What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power.
7295680	7303280	They're hoping what? Do they like the government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro-government
7303760	7311440	and it wasn't in Russia. They were in a desperate fix. He took advantage.
7312640	7321040	To which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the
7323840	7331280	national socialism party of German workers, hence the Nazi party, the fascist party in the 30s
7331360	7337360	and the 40s at the head of whom was Hitler, which had just recently learned he was
7338720	7343680	employing number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party
7343680	7350160	and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history of
7350160	7358000	the 20th century? What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the national
7358640	7371600	socialist party of German workers, workers. National socialist German worker party.
7371600	7378880	Worker party. National socialist German worker party. Here's the history. Did he care about the
7378880	7384880	workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message? The only thing that Marxism
7385440	7391920	did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power, but had nothing, no
7391920	7395840	other. He didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything about it, nor did the people around
7395840	7401520	him. Here's the story of what happened there, which I know largely through my own family and
7401520	7408240	plus my own history of the work that I did. The most successful socialist party in Europe
7408240	7415440	was the German party. It started around 1870. Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were
7415440	7423360	leaders, Ferdinand LaSalle and other his daughters. By the end of the century, it was the second most
7423360	7431040	important party in Germany. Nobody understood it. It was over. It was almost as big a shock to the
7431040	7438000	Europeans as was the Russian Revolution in 1917. Here was a political party that was now in
7438000	7447760	every German city, in every German town, powerful and enjoying its rise up. That's my family is
7447760	7456320	involved in this. I mean, I really do know the story. It meant that starting around 1968,
7457600	7466640	if you wanted to have any kind of presence in the German working class, you had to use the word
7466640	7472960	socialist. You had to. Otherwise, they wouldn't pay attention. The other parties called themselves
7472960	7479760	Catholic. Germany is divided. The northern two thirds is Protestant. The southern third is
7479760	7485600	Catholic. Munich and Bavaria is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant.
7486880	7492640	You could be in the Catholic party. That was the south. Or you could be in various conservative
7493440	7500000	Prussian. If you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing in Germany,
7500000	7506640	a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time, Germany was the major
7506640	7512640	competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and
7512640	7522080	US taking over from Britain's empire. The German working class was it. Anybody who wanted to approach
7522640	7529840	the working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.
7531200	7537760	Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word socialist in their party,
7537760	7543680	but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't anything to do with the Soviet Union
7543680	7549920	or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first four letters
7550000	7556560	of national, national in German, and they ZI's how you spell national in the German
7556560	7561520	national socialism, but definitely not communists. That's right. They killed communists. They fought
7561520	7568960	communists in the street. They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each other's existence
7568960	7575040	and their life. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and Gypsies
7575040	7580080	and all the other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were the number one
7580080	7586640	and socialist right behind them. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of 1933,
7586640	7593840	that's when Hitler takes power. The last elections, two of them in 1932, the socialist and communist
7593840	7601760	to vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany. So he appealed to the German manufacturers,
7601760	7606480	the German capitalists, and he said, the communists and socialists are going to win.
7608400	7613920	And you're just the capitalists. You have too few people. You need a mass space,
7613920	7616160	and I'm the only one that can do that.
7617120	7619600	So it was just the populist message that he used.
7619600	7627360	That's right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,
7627360	7632000	the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,
7632000	7636880	you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have done it. He had
7636880	7643680	called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as a little
7643680	7649760	funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German, for them that mattered.
7649760	7658480	So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism, which he immediately does.
7660640	7666800	Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word.
7667840	7672240	You know, it's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,
7672560	7680880	we are not a democracy. We are a republic, which is like saying, I'm not a banana. I'm a fruit.
7681520	7687840	You have to explain to these people a banana. So you have to explain to people, yes,
7687840	7694080	we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic,
7694080	7698560	because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have to go through
7698560	7704000	that with people, so they kind of get it. And certain words have power beyond their actual
7704000	7711440	meaning that's used in communication, whether it's negative, like racist or positive, like freedom
7711440	7716720	of speech or Democrat or Democrat with a D. Yeah. And then you use that to mean something.
7716720	7723760	Who knows? Or negative, what, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist or something, whatever that
7723760	7728240	means that's not even used as any kind of philosophical or economic sense.
7728400	7732080	So let's fast forward to today. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.
7733280	7739040	There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic
7739040	7744080	socialism and maybe let's try to start to sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly
7744080	7754400	mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's from these parts. So maybe if you can comment on
7754400	7763680	Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism? Are they representing those
7763680	7774400	ideas well in both economic and the political sense? Okay. Where do I begin? The socialist
7774400	7782800	movement predates Marx was always larger than Marx and has gone on to develop separately after
7782800	7790320	Marx's death. So can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line
7790320	7798880	between Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to
7799840	7805040	maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?
7805040	7816560	Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics and as I said earlier,
7817280	7829120	devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism and that's its strength, how it does that,
7829120	7836720	how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works, that is really the
7836720	7844880	forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism
7845760	7851360	figures it's there so that people who aren't Marxist are nonetheless aware of Marxism,
7852320	7859600	like it more or less, study it more or less, but it's a broader notion that I like to use
7859600	7867600	this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really
7868160	7877120	there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world
7877920	7884080	think are adequate. We are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who thought they
7884080	7888560	could do better than slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.
7889760	7896160	We've made progress. Fuedalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a progress over both of
7896160	7905360	them and progress hasn't stopped and we are the people who in a variety of ways want the progress
7906000	7914640	to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best beyond which
7914640	7922320	we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of the word, a reactionary way
7922320	7929200	of thinking and we're that large community. Many of us are not interested in economics all that
7929200	7937840	much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example, because we want to do
7937840	7945920	something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to kill itself physically
7945920	7953840	and we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that, etc. So that's for me
7954720	7962160	a kind of difference. It's a little difficult to say because there's no other figure like Marx
7962960	7970080	that has an equal impact, an equal place within the broad socialist tradition.
7970720	7979840	The only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition, but that's very specialized
7979920	7986240	and that's a whole other kind of conversation. Whatever you say, the influence of the great
7986240	7996080	anarchist thinkers, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorrell, and others still doesn't amount to the impact that
7996080	8007360	Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but up to this point that's a way of
8007360	8011600	understanding the relationship. Yeah, that's interesting that some of the ideas within
8012240	8018880	anarchism, and of course it's one of the more varied disciplines, because there's such,
8019760	8025280	maybe by definition, such variety in their thinkers, but they kind of stand for a
8028080	8035840	dismantling of a power center and that, if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas
8035840	8042880	of socialism. Absolutely. So where you have the... There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas
8042880	8051760	and in Marxist ideas that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation
8051760	8061120	from Lenin. People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin and it was made by Lenin,
8061120	8066480	positive. In other words, Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for.
8067040	8072400	We want to create the conditions under which there is a... Because you remember, the
8073040	8078400	communists or whatever, they wouldn't call that at first in Russia before the revolution. They
8078400	8083680	were just socialists. They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right.
8083680	8089280	They had no love for the government. The government was their literal everyday enemy and
8089520	8096160	being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the whole...
8096800	8102400	Being a Marxist, you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is
8102400	8108480	you're struggling against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially
8108480	8114560	because if you understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.
8115200	8121920	One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia and he goes back centuries.
8121920	8126880	It's a huge book, three or four inches thick and I'm one of the few people who've read it.
8130240	8136000	He's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of feudalism,
8136000	8141920	including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe. The development of a powerful central
8141920	8149440	state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on, which ought to be suggestive
8149440	8157360	that maybe the turn to powerful governments here in the United States or in Europe is maybe also
8157360	8166240	because this system is exhausted and can't go on and has to marshal every last bit of power it can
8167040	8173040	not to be lost in history. It would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union
8173040	8178960	would look like if Lenin never died. A lot of people have asked that question over the years,
8178960	8184160	a lot of people. The area is stalling, sliding in in the middle of the night,
8184160	8190240	erasing the withering away of the state part. Yes, exactly. So just to return briefly back
8190240	8195440	to AOC and Bernie Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent
8195440	8199920	some of these ideas and they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism? Right.
8200800	8205680	The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC, and it's particularly true about Bernie,
8206800	8213840	because AOC is much younger and Bernie's an older man. Bernie, being roughly my age,
8215040	8222960	has been around formatively as a student, as an activist, then coming up through the ranks in
8223040	8230320	Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all the rest. He lived through, for lack of a better term,
8230320	8237280	I would call Cold War America. And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945-6
8238160	8248320	to the present, I mean really never stopped, was a Manichaean worldview. The United States is good,
8248320	8253760	it defines democracy, and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the opposite
8253760	8264160	of democracy should be called. Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks
8264720	8273280	of academic individuals, it was impossible to talk, have a conversation. I mean,
8274000	8279920	I can't tell, just make it very personal. The number of times I would raise my hand in my classes
8279920	8288720	at Harvard or Stanford or Yale, and I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,
8288720	8294240	because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me, except by people
8294240	8303040	who trashed it, other than that, and I didn't want that. So I would ask a question, and I would see
8303120	8308800	in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't much care for, and those who were good teachers
8308800	8314880	that I liked, fear. It was just fear. They didn't want to go there. They didn't want to answer my
8314880	8320880	question. And after a while, I got to know some of them, and I found out why, because you don't
8320880	8325360	know how the rest of the class is going to understand this. Either they would have to say,
8325360	8330160	I don't know, which would be the honest truth for many of them, but a professor does not want to
8330160	8337520	say in a classroom, I don't know, that it's not cool. Or if they knew, they'd have to say something
8338240	8342400	that indicated they didn't know really much, and they weren't even going to do that.
8342400	8349920	Or they would know something, and maybe that would be because they were interested. They did not want
8349920	8357280	the rest of the students to begin to say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, he's interested.
8357600	8362000	Mm-mm. This is not good for your career. You don't know how this is going to
8362000	8367760	play out. Who's going to say what to whom? And I could see in their faces what I later learned,
8367760	8373440	because they told me, don't come to my office hours. We're in the office. We can talk about it.
8373440	8375680	But that's how bad it was.
8376400	8378240	Is it not still?
8378240	8384720	Pretty much. In my field, the great so-called debate. I mean, I find it boring, but the great
8384720	8391840	debate for my colleagues is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics.
8391840	8398080	Neoclassical, the government should stay out of the economy, less a fair or liberalism.
8398080	8403840	And the Keynesian saying, no, you crazy neoclassical. If you do that, you'll have great depressions,
8403840	8408960	and the system will collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems,
8408960	8414080	to fix the weaknesses. And they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs.
8414720	8419600	One of the very few things they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out.
8421200	8427760	That they can find common ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own.
8427760	8437360	Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means that all of the complicated developments
8437360	8444880	within Marxism and within socialism of the post-World War II period,
8444880	8452640	the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to the average American person,
8452640	8458240	but to the average American academic, to the average American who thinks of himself or herself
8458240	8465760	as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet
8465760	8473520	history to have no idea. Or saying, there's this man, Lukacs, a Hungarian Marxist. He really had
8473520	8480880	interest in, or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the
8480880	8488080	Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? Why, you like Gramsci
8488080	8494560	as a literary critic, but they didn't even know. They don't even know. It's been erased.
8495280	8501120	It's a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the
8501120	8507520	Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings,
8507520	8513840	many of which are very interesting and complicated. Anyway, so what you're going to have in this
8513840	8522240	country is a slow awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War.
8523040	8528000	I never expected, to be very honest with you, that I would live to see. I knew it would come
8528880	8534720	because of these things always do, but I didn't expect to see it. So I have been surprised
8535840	8540640	as have a lot of us that when it starts to happen, it happens fast.
8541200	8550320	So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from the Cold War to accept the ideas.
8550720	8555040	Always a socialist. We all knew. And everybody who paid attention, he denied it.
8555760	8564320	But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous, to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont.
8564320	8570080	Vermont is one of the smallest states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you
8570080	8576160	that there are more cows than people in Vermont, etc. etc. So here from this little state,
8576160	8582880	this elderly gentleman with a New York City accent runs for all and says, I'm a socialist.
8582880	8587040	And when they attack him, he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist.
8587040	8594400	Now he had been. It wasn't a secret that suddenly got out. But the great question, and I don't mind
8594400	8599440	telling you because I went to the right schools, I know a lot of people, you know,
8599440	8605680	Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official
8605680	8610560	of the Democratic Party and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?
8611280	8619120	Makes no difference. They get 1% of the vote. He was wrong. They had no idea what was coming.
8619120	8625040	But the truth is, I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it. I thought his 1% was probably
8625040	8630800	right. So we were both wrong. Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president
8630800	8641200	one day? Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one, it's fast. Number two,
8642880	8651360	it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,
8652320	8659680	calm, non-confrontational socialism you can imagine. So not AOC or Bernie.
8660240	8663360	No, no, they are not confrontational in my judgment.
8663360	8667040	In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.
8667040	8674400	They're feisty personally. But not ideologically. You know, she is, Bernie is also,
8675520	8680640	you know, in honest moments, and they're both really are pretty honest folks,
8680640	8687920	at least in my experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates
8687920	8695760	as democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular
8696480	8703440	government tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working
8703440	8710400	class than you do now. That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means by socialism.
8710400	8716560	When he talks about it, and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot. Okay,
8716560	8723680	that's consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism. And that's where we're going to
8723680	8729280	start in a country coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon, it's already happening. There'll
8729280	8735600	be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are
8735600	8742800	comfortable with. You can already see the shoots of it now. You know, AOC voted together with
8742800	8748960	most of the others to support the money for Ukraine. Okay, that lot of people in the socialist
8748960	8753520	movement do not support that. And that's going to have, you know, I don't know exactly how
8753520	8759360	that's going to work out. But that should give people an idea. There are disagreements and they're
8759360	8766720	going to fester and they're going to grow. People in the socialist sphere don't support money
8766720	8772000	from the United States in the large amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because of,
8772000	8776400	it's a fundamentally, the military industrial complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing?
8777120	8781920	No, there are some people for whom that's the issue. Then there are people for whom
8782560	8788400	this is, you know, it's guns and butter and why are we, why are we over there when we have such
8788400	8794560	needs at home that are being neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what we
8794560	8800800	talked about at the beginning, who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between
8801600	8808880	Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine and what are we
8808880	8815680	doing here? We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate
8815680	8819840	a settlement, don't kill large numbers of Ukraine. I mean, everybody's willing to fight
8819840	8825200	to the last Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you doing? You're supposed to be in
8825280	8831040	favor of peace, you know, and for the United States, which just finished invading and occupying
8831040	8835840	Afghanistan and Iraq to be against another country invading. I mean, who in the world
8835840	8841600	is going to take this seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade, it's good and you invade,
8841600	8849600	it's terrible. What? You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? What's going on here?
8849600	8853440	All of these questions are being active, by the way, not just by socialists,
8853440	8859360	by lots of other people too, inside the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party.
8860160	8865920	You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They
8865920	8870640	don't want the money spent there, they don't want the weapons sent there, they don't like the whole
8870640	8878080	policy and Trump wobble. So, Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the
8878080	8885440	right and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that
8885440	8896240	AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War
8898160	8904640	isolation from the whole, you know, when I explained to people the contribution made,
8904720	8910640	for example, to modern Marxism, I'll give you an example, by the French philosopher
8910640	8916880	Louis Althusser, I don't know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of
8916880	8923920	the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there
8923920	8932160	were a university that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT. It would be the university.
8932160	8939120	Well, the École Normale in France in Paris is the. He was a tenured professor who became the
8939120	8944560	rector. The rector is like the president of the university. An active member of the French
8944560	8950400	Communist Party, most of his adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War.
8950400	8955040	That was unthinkable in this country. You could not in a million years, right?
8955760	8963760	So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring a version of postmodernism
8964480	8972240	into Marxism with enormous impact all over the world when he traveled, not just in Europe,
8972240	8976000	all over, right? So if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for you.
8976880	8988480	Althusser, Luis, Althusser. Look him up. You'll see tons of stuff.
8988480	8993840	By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works in English.
8996240	8999600	By the way, the textbook I wrote in Economics, in case you're ever interested,
8999600	9005520	was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories,
9005520	9011920	Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That's an MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that's right.
9011920	9016800	And by the way, when we think, I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between
9016800	9025040	Marxian economics and Marxist. I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that.
9025040	9033920	I only use it because Marxist uses a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian uses an adjective
9033920	9039840	to qualify, but I don't mean some great difference. There's a last point I would like to make about
9039840	9049440	AOC and Bernie. That's also general. I'm a historian too. And I know that the transition
9049520	9056400	out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred
9056400	9063680	in fits and starts. So for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate, serfs would run away,
9063680	9069360	then run into a town. How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because they had
9069360	9076080	run away from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding
9076080	9083760	what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the business of buying and
9083760	9089520	then reselling stuff and living off the difference. But you know, I could make more money if I produced
9089520	9096080	some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody else. So I'm going to make you a deal.
9096080	9100960	I'm going to give you money once a week. I'll give you money what we would later call a wage.
9100960	9105280	And you come here and under my supervision, you make this crap that I'm going to then sell.
9105840	9114080	And this all works out. In other words, there were efforts unconscious, not self-aware,
9114880	9122000	to go out of feudalism to a new system. Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart.
9122800	9131680	Some of them lasted weeks or months or years, but it took a long time before the conditions were
9131680	9139680	ready for a kind of a general switch. And once that was done, it grew on itself and became the
9139680	9146720	global capitalist system we have today. That's the only model we have. So for me, that's what
9146720	9155120	I see when I look at socialism. I see the Paris commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a
9155120	9162000	few weeks. I see Russia. That was an attempt lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you will fill in the
9162000	9170080	blank, I see these are all early experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things
9170080	9176000	never to do again. The good, the bad. What do you build on? How do you learn?
9176000	9181120	And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition, when it's serious, that's what it does.
9181680	9186240	In your ideas, sort of capitalism was a significant improvement over the feudalism.
9187840	9193920	And we are coming to an age and over slavery, and we're coming to an age where capitalism
9193920	9201120	will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is how fundamentally broken. It's better than
9201120	9205840	the things that came before it, but there's going to be things yet better and they will be grounded
9205840	9215440	in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just a linger briefly on the way Marxism is used
9215440	9222880	as a term on Twitter? There's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly, but
9223920	9232880	cultural Marxism or the criticisms of universities being infiltrated by cultural Marxists.
9234000	9241680	I'm not exactly sure. I don't pay close enough attention, but it's woke. There's a kind of
9241680	9251040	woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text? Who's the Karl Marx of
9251040	9261040	wokeness? All I do know is that there's certain characteristics of woke ideology, which is
9262000	9270960	hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys. Basically, everyone is a bad guy,
9270960	9276720	except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying that they're the good guy.
9276720	9288560	That applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics, identity politics, all that kind of
9288560	9297600	stuff. Is there any parallels between Marxian economics and Marxist ideology and whatever
9297600	9306400	is being called Marxism on Twitter? No, not much. One of the consequences of the taboo
9306400	9313200	after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words.
9313200	9320000	It's like calling somebody, well, I won't use bad language, but using a four-letter word to
9320000	9325760	describe somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many
9325760	9332640	circles, this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn't
9332640	9339920	have a particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is
9339920	9350320	somebody who is concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation and gender and all of those
9350320	9358720	things and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms and I don't like any of these people,
9358720	9366080	so I slap the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism because it isn't Marxism about
9366080	9372880	getting more money or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists
9372880	9378400	somehow are concerned about. So this is odd since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always
9378400	9384240	been interested in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci,
9384240	9391440	that's what they're famous for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture.
9391440	9398640	Gramsci writes a great length about the Catholic Church about theater and painting in Italy and
9398640	9403360	on and on. I mean, this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't
9403360	9411040	know what the names are. It's a label that summarizes kind of a shorthand. I'm against all of this. I
9411040	9417520	don't want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country and it always has been or sexism or
9420000	9426960	phobia against gay people or whatever it is that's agitating them, Marxism or socialism. I mean,
9426960	9434720	it's just, it's like socialism is the post office. It is a mentality. Well, but I don't blame them.
9434720	9442560	I mean, it's childish. It's mean-spirited, but it comes out of the fact no one ever sat them down
9442560	9448640	and said, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of things that people kind of share and
9448640	9457040	these big differences. Look, an intelligent society, which this country is, could have and should have
9457040	9463760	done that. It was fear and a kind of terror that made them behave in the way they did and we're now
9463760	9472000	seeing it. Having said that, there is such a thing as cultural Marxism. What that is is simply those
9472000	9484720	Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing how it is that a particular culture is on the one hand
9484720	9491040	shaped by capitalism and on the other hand, it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive
9491040	9499680	and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the interaction between the class struggle on the job
9500320	9508320	and attitude towards sexuality or movements in music or whatever else culture. And there are
9509120	9516240	Georg Lukacs, this Hungarian, great name in there, the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci,
9516240	9521920	and a modern name just died a couple of years ago, a British intellectual named Stuart Hall,
9521920	9530480	H-A-L-L. If I were teaching, which I have done, a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three
9531280	9538720	major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you articles and books to read of their stuff,
9538720	9543120	because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many others.
9543200	9548160	So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism creates
9548160	9555120	and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes. And Marxists are particularly those who like
9555120	9560640	to look at that interaction. In other words, they're interested in how capitalism shapes culture
9560640	9566960	and how culture shapes capitalism. There's another name, I forgot. Stuart Hall is British,
9567680	9578160	Gramsci is Italian, Lukacs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N.
9578160	9584880	He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that developed in
9584880	9591120	Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in cultural questions.
9591120	9597440	It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and
9597440	9603680	politics. There were people who said, you're leaving out very important parts of modern society
9603680	9610160	that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that impetus to open
9610160	9616800	Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand that this cult,
9616800	9621280	and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different meaning
9621280	9630240	from this. This is just bad-mouthing. That's all. Let me ask a more personal question. So
9630960	9636640	for most of the 20th century, no, not most, but a large many decades in the United States
9636640	9642320	as a consequence of the Cold War and before being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be.
9642880	9649840	Have you had dark periods in your own life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind,
9649840	9657520	where it was difficult, like self-doubt, difficult to know, like, what the hell am I doing when
9657520	9663280	you're surrounded by colleagues and people? You said prestigious universities, both personal
9663280	9670800	interests of career, but also as a human being when everybody, you know, kind of looks at you
9671680	9677360	funny because you're studying this thing. Did that ever get you real low?
9677360	9682880	No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.
9683680	9686000	If I were you, I'd be asking me that question, too.
9687520	9688800	And what's wrong with you?
9688800	9695520	Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am.
9695520	9702560	I really don't. But the truth is, no, I have, if my wife were sitting here, she'd tell you
9703120	9708160	what she tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true.
9709520	9714320	But then again, luck never is the only explanation for things that's part of it.
9718880	9722880	What can I say? I didn't choose the time of my birth. I didn't choose
9722880	9726960	the communities in which I grew up or the schools I attended or anything else.
9726960	9731680	No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on Marxian economics.
9731680	9737040	But you know, again, I'm haggled. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.
9737760	9742400	On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation
9743280	9749040	when you do that is very different. I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook,
9749040	9755200	taking notes of what the great professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam.
9755200	9765360	I don't have an exam. I'm doing something slightly risqué, you know, kind of romantically different
9765360	9773200	and oppositional. I was able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to
9773280	9780160	outside of the classroom situation, other students who felt enough similar to me
9780160	9785440	that we could get together and read these books and talk about them. I had a number of really
9786160	9793200	fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me of their time and their effort to teach me
9793200	9799280	along the way. And I've had the benefit that because I went to all these fancy schools,
9800000	9806400	I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture. And when I have been put in
9806400	9812480	difficult positions, I often waive my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They're
9812480	9819760	back away. They're back away. Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic
9819760	9825440	prestige. But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken
9825440	9833600	by this. You have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.
9834800	9838080	Well, I would put it, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little differently.
9838080	9846160	I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system.
9847120	9852720	And nothing has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development
9854960	9866240	just kept giving me more and more evidence. And I must say over the last 10 years,
9866240	9873280	what's really changed the last 10 years. I mean, I can't describe to you how big that changes.
9873280	9875760	And that may be more important than anything else we've discussed.
9877120	9885600	Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or a radio thing or
9886480	9892960	give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months, I'd be invited
9892960	9900800	and I would do it. Like academics often do. I now do two to three to four interviews every day.
9901040	9908000	So does a hunger, wow, is there a hunger? It's fascinating.
9908000	9912640	And I want to be honest with you. As I say at the end of some of my talks,
9913200	9917360	I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause from the podium, you know,
9918080	9924720	that I lean into the microphone and I say with as much smile as I can get, I'm having a time of my
9924720	9934240	life. And that's the truth. I never expected, look, I'm used to teaching a classroom,
9934240	9940560	a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students, or a regular undergraduate
9940560	9946240	class with 30 or an occasional introductory course with a few hundred. I've done all of those
9946240	9955520	things many times, but an audience, you know, that I can count in the hundreds of thousands
9955520	9964560	on YouTube and all of that. No, that's new. Is there advice you can give given your bold and
9964560	9971760	nonstandard career and life advice you can give to high school students, college students about
9971840	9977440	how to have a career like that, or maybe how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?
9979200	9988800	Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely
9988800	9997440	better than they were when I had to do it. And I could do it. And I can, I'm happy I did it.
9997440	10002160	Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made that I've never regretted.
10005600	10013760	And I've never regretted being a critic of this society. Never. I find it edifying. I find it,
10015200	10020560	I mean, the gratitude people expressed to me for helping them see kind of what's going on
10021760	10026000	is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you? So that feels you,
10026960	10032880	pointing out that the emperor has no clothes, it feels you, that's a life not just important.
10033360	10039760	Because most of the people who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the
10039760	10046240	vocabulary and some of them do, would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that
10046240	10053120	outfit that I was wearing. I thought it and they did. And all they needed was a little extra,
10053120	10060960	this information or that factoid or this logic. And they have that. And I remember having that too.
10060960	10067840	When I had a teacher who made something clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude.
10067840	10075280	And now I get that gratitude, a good bit. And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm not
10075360	10084720	sure I could get it any other way. And I have learned and I'm walking proof that being a
10084720	10092480	critic of society and doing it systematically and sharing it with other people makes for a
10093040	10102080	very good life, a very good life. Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature
10102160	10107680	is that life comes to an end. Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?
10108400	10116800	Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes. Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought, you know,
10116800	10125680	death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead, you know. I worry more about my
10125680	10130960	wife. I'm very attached to my wife. I might mention to you, I got married when I was 23
10130960	10139680	years old and that's my wife to this day. So I'm lucky because if you get married to anybody
10139680	10149200	at age 23, it's either luck or it isn't. What role has love played in your life? Enormous.
10151440	10156560	Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mind
10157360	10164320	who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,
10164320	10173440	find another life income and job and the disruption goes real deep for any refugee. So
10174720	10180240	my mother and father were both refugees. They met as refugees.
10180880	10190720	So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had to be, I was the first child of their,
10191360	10197920	I have a younger sister, but I was the first child and, you know, there's a lot of psychological
10197920	10204640	pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm, but you've got to do
10205520	10211520	what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do. It's the closest
10211520	10218080	they're going to get to what they had hoped and my parents were both university students.
10218080	10223360	My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.
10226720	10232640	So I had to perform, you know. I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get all
10232640	10237440	A's. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to do all
10237440	10244800	these because everything had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that way.
10245600	10249200	But that's functional in this dysfunctional society.
10249200	10255440	But on top of that, that's an achievement within the game of this particular society,
10255440	10260640	but then love seems to be a thing that's greater than that game. Is that something
10260640	10266320	that made you a better person? How was it made you a better Marxian and a better...
10266320	10272480	Everything because my wife, my wife by profession is a psychotherapist.
10273040	10274240	Excellent. I love it.
10274240	10276160	And I needed it. Yeah.
10276160	10281120	And so I married it. I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but I think,
10281120	10285920	as I look back on it, that was more than a little what was going on.
10286720	10292080	And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life
10292800	10300800	that my family never talked about, never dealt with, never, at least explicitly
10301520	10303200	engaged in any of that.
10303200	10306800	Because it was all about survival, the immigrant challenges, survival.
10306800	10313040	Survive, survive. And you're so busy that you tell yourself you can't do that.
10313520	10318240	Of course, you can. And there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those problems.
10318240	10325520	But the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way. And my parents did that.
10326240	10331760	One last question. What's the meaning of life, Richard Wolff? Why are we here?
10331760	10333280	I will quote you, Mr. Marx.
10334880	10335360	Let's go.
10336320	10345760	Life is struggle. And for me, I have found that to be true, that the struggle,
10347280	10351840	whether it is to build a relationship with your child, I have two children,
10353280	10359280	whether it's to build one with your spouse, whether it's to understand a complicated argument
10359840	10366800	and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this relationship
10366800	10373040	to a student or to an audience. These are, it's a struggle to do all those things.
10373600	10383760	But that network of struggles, that makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.
10384480	10386640	And meaningful. And very meaningful.
10386640	10391040	And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully. You're one of the great communicators
10391040	10396240	and educators out there today. And it's a huge honor that you have sit with me for so many hours.
10396240	10401200	Thank you. This is awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.
10401840	10405520	To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
10406320	10409280	And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.
10410240	10414080	The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.
10414800	10417760	The point, however, is to change it.
10419440	10425200	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
