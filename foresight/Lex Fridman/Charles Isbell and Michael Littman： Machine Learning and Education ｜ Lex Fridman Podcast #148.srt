00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell and Michael Litman.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,200
Charles is the Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,720
and Michael is a computer science professor at Brown University.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,800
I've spoken with each of them individually on this podcast

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,960
and since they are good friends in real life we all thought it would be fun

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,280
to have a conversation together. Quick mention of each sponsor

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,960
followed by some thoughts related to the episode. Thank you to

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
Athletic Greens, the only one drink that I start every day with

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,840
to cover all my nutritional bases. AteSleep, a mattress that cools itself

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,760
and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep. Masterclass,

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
online courses from some of the most amazing humans in history

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,880
having two guests on the podcast is an experiment that I've been meaning to do

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,560
for a while. In particular because down the road I

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,640
would like to occasionally be a kind of moderator for debates

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,480
between people that may disagree in some interesting ways.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,880
If you have suggestions for who you would like to see debate on this podcast,

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,480
let me know. As with all experiments of this kind,

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,520
it is a learning process. Both the video and the audio might need improvement.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,360
I realized I think I should probably do three or more cameras next time as

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
opposed to just two and also try different ways to mount the microphone

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,960
for the third person. Also, after recording this intro, I'm

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,120
going to have to go figure out the thumbnail for the video version of the

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,600
podcast since I usually put the guest's head on the thumbnail

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,680
and now there's two heads and two names

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,120
to try to fit into the thumbnail. It's a kind of a bin packing problem

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,160
which in theoretical computer science happens to be an NP-hard problem.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,520
Whatever I come up with, if you have better ideas for the thumbnail, let me

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
know as well. And in general, I always welcome ideas

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
how this thing can be improved. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
And now here's my conversation with Charles Isbell

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,240
and Michael Littman. You'll probably disagree about this question

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,440
but what is your biggest, would you say, disagreement

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,640
about either something profound and very important or something completely not

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
important at all? I don't think you have any disagreements at all.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm not sure that's true. We walked into that one, didn't we?

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,320
So one thing that you sometimes mention is that, and we did this one on

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,920
air too, as it were, whether or not machine learning is

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
computational statistics. It's not. But it is.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, it's not. And in particular, and more importantly, it is not just computational

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
statistics. So what's missing in the picture?

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
All the rest of it. What's missing? That which is missing.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
Well, you can't be wrong now. Well, it's not just the statistics.

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,160
He doesn't even believe this. We've had this conversation before.

49
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,000
If it were just the statistics, then we would be happy with where we are.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
But it's not just the statistics. That's why it's computational

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,560
statistics. Or if it were just the computational.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I agree that machine learning is not just statistics.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,320
It is not just statistics. We can agree on that.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,200
Nor is it just computational statistics. It's computational statistics.

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
It is computational. What is the computational and

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
computational statistics? Does this take us into the realm of computing?

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,240
It does. But I think perhaps the way I can get him to admit that he's wrong is that it's about rules.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,920
It's about rules. It's about symbols. It's about all these other things.

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,800
But statistics is not about rules? I'm going to say statistics is about rules.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,680
It's not just the statistics. It's not just a random variable that you choose

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
and you have a probability. I think you have a narrow view of statistics.

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
Okay. Well, then what would be the broad view of statistics that would still allow it to be

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,880
statistics and not say history that would make computational statistics okay?

64
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,400
Well, okay. So I had my first sort of research mentor, a guy named Tom Landauer,

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,400
taught me to do some statistics, right? Sure.

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,800
And I was annoyed all the time because the statistics would say that what I was doing

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,680
was not statistically significant. And I was like, but and basically what he said to me is,

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,800
statistics is how you're going to keep from lying to yourself, which I thought was really deep.

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,920
It is a way to keep yourself honest in a particular way. I agree with that.

70
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Yeah. And so you're trying to find rules. I'm just going to bring it back to rules.

71
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,440
Wait, wait, wait. Could you possibly try to define rules?

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Even regular statisticians, non-computational statisticians,

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,640
do spend some of their time evaluating rules, right? Applying statistics to try to understand,

74
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,520
does this rule capture this? Does this not capture that?

75
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
You mean like hypothesis testing kind of thing? Sure.

76
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,480
Or like confidence intervals? I think more like hypothesis. I feel like the word

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,640
statistic literally means like a summary, like a number that summarizes other numbers.

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,280
But I think the field of statistics actually applies that idea to things like rules,

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,560
to understand whether or not a rule is valid. Do software engineering statistics?

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,000
No. Programming languages statistics?

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
No. Because I think it's useful to think about a lot of what AI machine learning is,

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,200
or certainly should be, as software engineering, as programming languages.

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,360
If to put it in language that you might understand, the hyperparameters beyond the problem.

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
The hyperparameters has too many syllables for me to understand.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,080
The hyperparameters. That's better.

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,800
That goes around it, right? It's the decisions you choose to make.

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
It's the metrics you choose to use. It's the loss function.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
You want to say the practice of machine learning is different than the practice of statistics.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
Like the things you have to worry about and how you worry about them are different.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,480
Therefore, they're different.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,960
Right. At the very least, it's that much is true.

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,240
It doesn't mean that statistics computational and otherwise aren't important.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,520
I think they are. I mean, I do a lot of that, for example.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,920
But I think it goes beyond that. I think we could think about game theory in terms of statistics,

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
but I don't think it's very as useful to do. I mean, the way I would think about it,

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,640
or a way I would think about it, is this way. Chemistry is just physics.

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
Hmm.

98
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,200
But I don't think it's as useful to think about chemistry as being just physics.

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,120
It's useful to think about it as chemistry. The level of abstraction really matters here.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
So I think there are contexts in which it is useful.

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,560
Yes.

102
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,200
I think it's that way, right?

103
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,520
No, that is.

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,040
So finding that connection is actually helpful.

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,080
And I think that's when I emphasize the computational statistics thing.

106
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,760
I think I want to befriend statistics and not absorb them.

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Here's the a way to think about it beyond what I just said, right?

108
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,640
So what would you say, and I want you to think back to a conversation I had a very

109
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,760
long time ago, what would you say is the difference between, say, the early 2000s,

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,320
ICML and what we used to call NIPS, NURPS. Is there a difference?

111
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,880
A lot of it, particularly on the machine learning that was done there?

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
ICML was around that long.

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,600
So I clear as the new conference, new-ish.

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,360
Yeah, I guess so.

116
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
And ICML was around the 2000.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Oh, ICML predates that.

118
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
I think my most cited ICML papers from 94.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,920
Michael knows this better than me because, of course, he's significantly older than I am.

120
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,320
But the point is, what is the difference between ICML and NURPS in the late 90s, early 2000s?

121
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know what everyone else's perspective would be, but I had a particular perspective

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,720
at that time, which is I felt like ICML was more of a computer science place and that NURPS,

123
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,840
NURPS was more of an engineering place, like the kind of math that happened at the two places.

124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,680
As a computer scientist, I felt more comfortable with the ICML math,

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,920
and the NURPS people would say that that's because I'm dumb.

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,880
And that's such an engineering thing to say.

127
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,280
So I agree with that part of it, but I do a little different.

128
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,080
We actually had a nice conversation with Tom Dietrich about this on Twitter just a couple

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,600
days ago. I put it a little differently, which is that ICML was machine learning done by computer

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,640
scientists, and NURPS was machine learning done by computer scientists trying to impress statisticians,

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
which was weird because it was the same people, at least by the time I started paying attention.

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
But it just felt very, very different. And I think that that perspective of whether you're

133
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
trying to impress the statisticians or you're trying to impress the programmers is actually

134
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,560
very different and has real impact on what you choose to worry about and what kind of

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
outcomes you come to. So I think it really matters.

136
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,680
I think computer statistics is a means to an end. It is not an end in some sense.

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,640
And I think that really matters here in the same way that I don't think computer science

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,040
is just engineering or just science or just math or whatever.

139
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Okay. So I'd have to now agree that now we agree on everything.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes. Yes. The important thing here is that my opinions may have changed,

141
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,480
but not the fact that I'm right, I think is what we just came to.

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,280
Right. And my opinions may have changed and not the fact that I'm wrong.

143
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,600
That's right. I lost me. I think I lost myself there too.

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
But anyway, we're back.

145
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,080
We're back. This happens sometimes. We're sorry.

146
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,400
How does neural networks change this, just to even linger on this topic,

147
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:19,120
change this idea of statistics, how big of a pie statistics is within the machine learning thing?

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,520
Like, because it sounds like hyperparameters and also just the role of data.

149
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,680
You know, this people are starting to use this terminology of software 2.0,

150
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
which is like the act of programming as a,

151
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,160
like you're a designer in the hyperparameter space of neural networks,

152
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,360
and you're also the collector and the organizer and the cleaner of the data.

153
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,600
And that's part of the programming.

154
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,280
So how did, on the NeurIPS versus ICML topic,

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,040
what's the role of neural networks in redefining the size and the role of machine learning?

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,960
I can't wait to hear what Michael thinks about this, but I would add one.

157
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,360
But you will.

158
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
That's true. I will force myself to.

159
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,280
I think there's one other thing I would add to your description,

160
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,800
which is the kind of software engineering part of what does it mean to debug, for example.

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,520
But this is a difference between the kind of computational statistics view of machine learning

162
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,560
and the computational view of machine learning, which is, I think,

163
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,960
one is worried about the equation as it were. And by the way, this is not a value judgment.

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,320
I just think it's about perspective. But the kind of questions you would ask,

165
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,600
when you start asking yourself what does it mean to program and develop and build the system,

166
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
is a very computer sciencey view of the problem. I mean, when, if you get on

167
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,520
Data Science Twitter and Econ Twitter, you actually hear this a lot with the economist

168
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,160
and the data scientist complaining about the machine learning people. Well, it's just statistics.

169
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
And I don't know why they don't see this, but they're not even asking the same questions.

170
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,960
They're not thinking about it as a kind of programming problem.

171
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,760
And I think that that really matters, just asking this question.

172
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,040
I actually think it's a little different from programming and hyperparameters space and sort

173
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,440
of collecting the data. But I do think that that immersion really matters. So I'll give you a quick

174
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,560
example of the way I think about this. So I teach machine learning. Michael and I have

175
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
co-taught a machine learning class, which has now reached, I don't know, 10,000 people at least

176
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,240
over the last several years, or somewhere there's abouts. And my machine learning assignments

177
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,040
are of this form. So the super, the first one is something like implement these five algorithms,

178
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,840
K and N and SVMs and boosting and decision trees and neural networks. And maybe that's it,

179
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,920
I can't remember. And when I say implement, I mean, steal the code. I am completely uninterested.

180
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,080
You get zero points for getting the thing to work. And then once you're spending your time

181
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,680
worrying about getting the corner case right of what happens when you are trying to normalize

182
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
distances and the points on the thing. And so you divide by zero. I'm not interested in that,

183
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,080
right? Steal the code. However, you're going to run those algorithms on two data sets. The data

184
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,920
sets have to be interesting. What does it mean to be interesting? Well, data sets interesting if

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,400
it reveals differences between algorithms, which presumably are all the same, because they can

186
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,560
represent whatever they can represent. And two data sets are interesting together if they show

187
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,640
different differences as it were. And you have to analyze them. You have to justify their

188
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,400
interestingness and you have to analyze them a whole bunch of ways. But all I care about is the

189
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,640
data in your analysis, not the programming. And I occasionally end up in these long discussions

190
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,360
with students. Well, I don't really, I copy and paste the things that I've said the other 15,000

191
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,800
times it's come up, which is they go, but the only way to learn, really understand is to code them

192
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,840
up, which is a very programmer software engineering view of the world. If you don't program it,

193
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,960
you don't understand it, which is, by the way, I think is wrong in a very specific way. But

194
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,720
it is a way that you come to understand because then you have to wrestle with the algorithm.

195
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
But the thing about machine learning is it's not just sorting numbers, where in some sense,

196
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,760
the data doesn't matter. What matters is, well, does the algorithm work on these abstract things

197
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,080
upon the list of the other? In machine learning, the data matters. It matters more than almost

198
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,000
anything. And not everything, but almost anything. And so as a result, you have to live with the data

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,760
and don't get distracted by the algorithm per se. And I think that that focus on the data

200
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,400
and what it can tell you and what question it's actually answering for you, as opposed to the

201
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,960
question you thought you were asking, is a key and important thing about machine learning and is

202
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,920
a way that computationalists, as opposed to statisticians, bring a particular view about

203
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,840
how to think about the process. The statisticians, by contrast, bring, I think I'd be willing to say,

204
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,120
a better view about the kind of formal math that's behind it and what an actual number,

205
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,760
ultimately, is saying about the data. And those are both important, but they're also different.

206
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,320
I didn't really think of it this way, is to build intuition about the role of data,

207
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,080
the different characteristics of data by having two data sets that are different,

208
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,080
and they reveal the differences and the differences. That's a really fascinating,

209
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,360
that's a really interesting educational approach. The students love it, but not right away.

210
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
No, they love it at the end. They love it at the end. Not at the beginning.

211
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,440
Not even immediately after. I feel like there's a deep, profound lesson about education there.

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,800
That you can't listen to students about whether what you're doing is the right or the wrong thing.

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,280
Well, as a wise, Michael Lippmann once said to me about children, which I think applies to

214
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,320
teaching, is you have to give them what they need without bending to their will.

215
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,840
And students are like that. You have to figure out what they need. You're a curator. Your whole

216
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,560
job is to curate and to present, because on their own, they're not going to necessarily know where

217
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,000
to search. So you're providing pushes in some direction and learn space. And you have to give

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,160
them what they need in a way that keeps them engaged enough so that they eventually discover

219
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
what they want, and they get the tools they need to go and learn other things.

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,520
What's your view, let me put on my Russian hat, which believes that life is like-

221
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,000
I like Russian hats, by the way. If you have one, I would like this.

222
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
Those are ridiculous. Yes.

223
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
But in a delightful way, but sure.

224
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,600
What do you think is the role of- we talked about balance a little bit.

225
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,200
What do you think is the role of hardship and education? I think the biggest things I've learned,

226
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,920
like what made me fall in love with math, for example, is by being bad at it until I got good

227
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,040
at it. So like struggling with a problem, which increased the level of joy I felt

228
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,840
when I finally figured it out. And it always felt with me, with teachers, especially modern

229
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,160
discussions of education, how can we make education more fun, more engaging, more all those things?

230
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,120
Well, from my perspective, it's like you may be missing the point that education, that life is

231
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,920
suffering. Education is supposed to be hard, and that actually what increases the joy you feel when

232
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,760
you actually learn something. Is that ridiculous? Do you like to see your students suffer?

233
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,200
Okay, so this may be a point where we differ. I suspect not. I'm going to do go on.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Well, what would your answer be? I want to hear you first.

235
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,080
Okay, well, I was going to not answer the question.

236
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,000
Because you don't want the students to know you and hear them suffer?

237
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,680
No, no, no, no, no. I was going to say that there's, I think there's a distinction that you can make in

238
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,160
the kind of suffering. So, I think you can be in a mode where you're suffering in a hopeless way,

239
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,400
versus you're suffering in a hopeful way, where you're like, you can see

240
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,640
that you still have, you can still imagine getting to the end. And as long as people are

241
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,400
where in that mindset, where they're struggling,

242
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,440
but it's not a hopeless kind of struggling.

243
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
That's productive.

244
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,520
I think that's really helpful.

245
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,640
But it's struggling, like if you break their will,

246
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,120
if you leave them hopeless.

247
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,640
No, sure, some people are gonna,

248
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
whatever, lift themselves up by their bootstraps,

249
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
but like mostly you give up

250
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,520
and certainly it takes the joy out of it.

251
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,720
And you're not gonna spend a lot of time

252
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,840
on something that brings you no joy.

253
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,360
So it is a bit of a delicate balance, right?

254
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,920
You have to thwart people in a way

255
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,200
that they still believe that there's a way through.

256
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,000
Right, so that's a, we strongly agree actually.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,120
So I think, well, first off,

258
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,080
struggling and suffering aren't the same thing, right?

259
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,320
Yeah, it's being poetic.

260
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,680
Oh no, I actually appreciate the poetry.

261
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,720
And one of the reasons I appreciate it

262
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,880
is that they are often the same thing

263
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
and often quite different, right?

264
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,560
So you can struggle without suffering.

265
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,280
You can certainly suffer pretty easily.

266
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,840
You don't necessarily have to struggle to suffer.

267
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,880
So I think that you want people to struggle,

268
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,960
but that hope matters.

269
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
You have to, they have to understand

270
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
that they're gonna get through it on the other side.

271
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,760
And it's very easy to confuse the two.

272
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,600
I actually think Brown University has a very,

273
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,440
just philosophically has a very different take

274
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,800
on the relationship with their students,

275
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,280
particularly undergrads from say,

276
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,840
a place like Georgia Tech, which is-

277
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,800
Which university's better?

278
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,360
Well, I have my opinions on that.

279
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,240
I mean, remember, Charles said,

280
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,480
it doesn't matter what the facts are, I'm always right.

281
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,320
The correct answer-

282
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,000
Is that it doesn't matter, they're different,

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
but clearly answers to that.

284
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,920
Well, he went to a school like the school

285
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,480
where he is as an undergrad.

286
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,080
I went to a school, specifically the same school,

287
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,520
though it was changed a bit in the intervening years.

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,360
Brown or Georgia Tech?

289
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,200
No, I was talking about Georgia Tech.

290
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
And I went to an undergrad place

291
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,840
that's a lot like the place where I work now.

292
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
And so it does seem like we're more familiar

293
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,320
with these models.

294
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
There's a similarity between Brown and Yale?

295
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,080
Yeah, I think they're quite similar.

296
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,320
And Duke?

297
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,960
Duke has some similarities too,

298
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
but it's got a little Southern draw.

299
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,560
You've kind of worked at universities

300
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,840
that are like the places where you learned.

301
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,200
And the same would be true for me.

302
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,160
Are you uncomfortable venturing outside the box?

303
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,320
Is that what you're saying?

304
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,160
Journey out?

305
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,000
Is that what I'm saying?

306
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah, Charles is definitely.

307
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,000
He only goes to places that have Institute in the name.

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,120
It has worked out that way.

309
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,240
Well, academic places anyway.

310
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,280
Well, no, I was a visiting scientist at U-Pen

311
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,160
or visiting something at U-Pen.

312
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, wow.

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
I just understood your joke.

314
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
Which one?

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,080
Five minutes later.

316
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,040
I like to set the sort of time bomb.

317
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,120
The Institute is in the,

318
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,520
that Charles only goes to places that have Institute

319
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,840
in the name.

320
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
So I guess Georgia,

321
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,760
I forget that Georgia Tech is Georgia Institute of Technology.

322
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,480
The number of people who refer to it

323
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
as Georgia Tech University is large and incredibly ear-to-ear.

324
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,880
It's one of the few things

325
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,280
that genuinely gets under my skin.

326
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,240
But like schools like Georgia Tech and MIT

327
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,840
have as part of the ethos,

328
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,960
like there is,

329
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,720
I wanna say there's an abbreviation that someone taught me,

330
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,760
like IHTFP, something like that.

331
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Like there's an expression,

332
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,200
which is basically,

333
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,520
I hate being here,

334
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,640
which they say so proudly.

335
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,040
And that is definitely not the ethos at Brown.

336
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,880
Like Brown is,

337
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,360
there's a little more pampering and empowerment and stuff.

338
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,840
And it's not like we're gonna crush you

339
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
and you're gonna love it.

340
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,400
So yeah, I think there's a,

341
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I think the ethoses are different.

342
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,360
That's interesting, yeah.

343
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,160
We had Drownproofing.

344
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,000
What's that?

345
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Drownproofing.

346
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,680
In order to graduate from Georgia Tech,

347
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,520
this is a true thing,

348
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,000
feel free to look it up.

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,840
If you-

350
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
A lot of schools have this, by the way.

351
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,120
No.

352
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,960
Actually Georgia Tech was barely the first.

353
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,000
Brandeis has it.

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,320
Had it.

355
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,800
I feel like Georgia Tech was the first in a lot of things.

356
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Georgia Tech was the first in a lot of things.

357
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
It was the first in a lot of things.

358
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,680
Had the first Master's degree in-

359
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,520
Stop that.

360
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,400
First Masters in Computer Science, actually.

361
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,680
Online Masters.

362
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,840
Well, that too, but way back in the 60s.

363
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
NSF, yeah, yeah.

364
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
You're the first information

365
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,840
in Computer Science Masters degree in the country.

366
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,600
But the Georgia Tech, it used to be the case

367
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,360
that in order to graduate from Georgia Tech,

368
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,040
you had to take a Drownproofing class,

369
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,080
where effectively they threw you a water to hide you up.

370
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,720
If you didn't drown, you got to graduate.

371
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,800
Hide you up?

372
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,640
I believe so.

373
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,480
No.

374
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,520
Basically, there were certainly versions of it,

375
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,480
but I mean, luckily they ended it

376
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,640
just before I had to graduate

377
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,200
because otherwise I would have never graduated.

378
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
It wasn't gonna happen.

379
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,080
I want to say 84, 83, someone around them, they ended it,

380
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,520
but yeah, it used to have to prove you could tread water

381
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,200
for some ridiculous amount of time.

382
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,040
Are you two minutes?

383
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,880
Congratulations.

384
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
No, it was more than two minutes.

385
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,560
I bet it was two minutes.

386
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,400
Okay, well, we'll look at it.

387
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
And it was in a bathtub.

388
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,520
It was in a pool, but it was a real thing.

389
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,480
But that idea that, you know, push you-

390
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,320
Fully clothed.

391
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
Yeah, fully clothed.

392
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
I don't think, I bet it was that and not tied up.

393
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
Because like, who needs to learn

394
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
how to swim when you're tied?

395
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,520
Nobody, but who needs to learn to swim

396
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,200
when you're actually falling into the water dressed.

397
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,040
That's a real thing.

398
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,680
I think your facts are getting in the way

399
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,520
with a good story.

400
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,360
Oh, that's fair.

401
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,200
That's fair.

402
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,040
I didn't mean to.

403
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,880
All right, so they tie you up.

404
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,960
Sometimes the narrative matters.

405
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,280
But whatever it was, you had to,

406
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,800
it was called drown proofing for a reason.

407
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,160
The point of the story, Michael, is-

408
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Struggle.

409
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
It's, well, no, but that's good.

410
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,320
It doesn't bring it back to struggle.

411
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,960
That's a part of what Georgia Tech has always been.

412
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
And we struggle with that, by the way,

413
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,880
about what we want to be, particularly as things go.

414
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,880
But you sort of, how much can you be pushed

415
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
without breaking?

416
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,920
And you come out of the other end stronger, right?

417
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,840
There's this saying we used to have

418
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,680
when I was an undergrad there, which was Georgia Tech,

419
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,640
building tomorrow the night before.

420
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,480
Right?

421
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,040
And it was just kind of, kind of idea

422
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,480
that give me something impossible to do

423
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,920
and I'll do it in a couple of days

424
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,080
because that's what I just spent the last four or five

425
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,120
or six.

426
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,880
That ethos definitely stuck to you.

427
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,000
Having now done a number of projects with you,

428
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,520
you definitely will do it the night before.

429
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
That's not entirely true.

430
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,640
There's nothing wrong with waiting until the last minute.

431
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,680
The secret is knowing when the last minute is.

432
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,280
Right, that's brilliantly put.

433
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,720
Yeah, that is a definite Charles statement

434
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,400
that I am trying not to embrace.

435
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,720
Well, I appreciate that

436
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
because you helped move my last minute back.

437
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,360
That's the social construct where you converge

438
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,600
together what the definition of last minute is.

439
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,720
And we figure that all together.

440
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,600
In fact, MIT, I'm sure a lot of universities have this,

441
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,400
but MIT has like MIT time

442
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,760
that everyone has always agreed together

443
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
that there is such a concept

444
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,760
and everyone just keeps showing up like 10 to 15 to 20

445
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,440
depending on the department late to everything.

446
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
So there's like a weird drift that happens.

447
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
It's kind of fascinating.

448
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
Yeah, we're five minutes.

449
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,880
We're five minutes.

450
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,600
In fact, the classes will say,

451
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,400
well, this is no longer true actually,

452
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,600
but it used to be a class that started eight

453
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,160
but actually started eight or five.

454
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,480
It ends at nine, actually it ends at eight, 55.

455
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Everything's five minutes off

456
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
and nobody expects anything to start until five minutes

457
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,640
after the half hour, whatever it is.

458
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,480
It still exists.

459
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,320
That hurts my head.

460
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,920
Well, let's rewind the clock back to the 50s and 60s

461
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,000
when you guys met.

462
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,880
How did you, I'm just kidding, I don't know.

463
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,160
But what, can you tell the story of how you met?

464
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,960
So you've, like the internet and the world kind of

465
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,240
knows you as connected in some ways

466
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,160
in terms of education of teaching the world.

467
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,800
That's like the public facing thing,

468
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
but how did you as human beings

469
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,760
and as collaborators meet?

470
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,840
I think there's two stories.

471
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,640
One is how we met

472
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,440
and the other is how we got to know each other.

473
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,320
I'm not gonna say fall, I'm not gonna say fell in love.

474
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm gonna say that we came to understand that we...

475
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,680
Had some common something.

476
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah, it's funny, because on the surface

477
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
I think we're different in a lot of ways,

478
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,560
but there's something that's just consonant.

479
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
There you go.

480
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Afternoon.

481
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,000
So I will tell the story of how we met

482
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,000
and I'll let Michael tell the story of how we met.

483
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,840
Okay, all right.

484
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,200
Okay, so here's how we met.

485
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,040
I was already at that point it was AT&T Labs.

486
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,240
There's a long interesting story there,

487
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,880
but anyway, I was there and Michael was coming to interview.

488
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
He was a professor at Duke at the time,

489
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,200
but decided for reasons that he wanted to be in New Jersey.

490
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,960
And so that would mean Bell Labs slash AT&T Labs.

491
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,800
And we were doing interviews,

492
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,720
interviews are very much like academic interviews.

493
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,320
And so I had to be there.

494
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
We all had to meet with him afterwards and so on, one-on-one.

495
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,480
But it was obvious to me that he was gonna be hired.

496
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,120
Like no matter what, because everyone loved him.

497
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,320
They were just talking about all the great stuff he did.

498
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Oh, he did this great thing.

499
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
And you had just won something at AAAI, I think,

500
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,560
or maybe you got 18 papers in AAAI that year.

501
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,400
I got the best paper award at AAAI for the crossword stuff.

502
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,240
Right, exactly.

503
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
So that had all happened and everyone was going on

504
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,840
and on and on about it.

505
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,600
Actually, Satinder was saying incredibly nice things

506
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,440
about you.

507
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
Really?

508
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,120
Yes, so.

509
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,960
He can be very grumpy.

510
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,800
Yes.

511
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,640
That's nice to hear.

512
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,480
He was grumpily saying very nice things.

513
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Oh, that makes sense.

514
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,320
Yeah, it does make sense.

515
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,000
So, you know, so it was gonna come.

516
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,120
So why were we, why was I meeting him?

517
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
I had something else I had to do.

518
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,960
I can't remember what it was.

519
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
Yeah.

520
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,640
Probably involved comic books.

521
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,240
So he remembers meeting me as inconveniencing his afternoon.

522
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,200
So he came, so eventually came to my office.

523
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,160
I was in the middle of trying to do something.

524
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
I can't remember what.

525
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,080
And he came and he sat down.

526
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,240
And for reasons that are purely accidental,

527
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,640
despite what Michael thinks,

528
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,400
my desk at the time was set up in such a way

529
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,720
that had sort of an L shape.

530
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,800
And the chair on the outside was always lower

531
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,440
than the chair that I was in.

532
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,680
And, you know, the kind of point was to...

533
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,480
The only reason I think that it was on purpose

534
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
is because you told me it was on purpose.

535
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,080
I don't remember that.

536
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,040
Anyway, the thing is that, you know, it kind of gives...

537
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
His guest chair was really low

538
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,960
so that he could look down at everybody.

539
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,000
The idea was just to simply create a nice environment

540
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
that you were asking for a mortgage.

541
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,360
And I was gonna say, no, that was the point.

542
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,560
It was a very simple idea here.

543
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,320
Anyway, so we sat there and we just talked for a little while.

544
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,520
And I think he got the impression that I didn't like him.

545
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,360
It wasn't true.

546
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,200
He strongly got that impression.

547
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,040
The talk was really good.

548
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
The talk, by the way, was terrible.

549
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,160
Right after the talk, I said to my host,

550
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,880
Michael Kearns, who ultimately was my boss.

551
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm a friend and a huge fan of Michael, yeah.

552
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,160
Yeah, he is a remarkable person.

553
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,200
After my talk, I went into the...

554
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,520
He would take a little basketball.

555
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
I went...

556
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,200
Racquetball, he's good at everything.

557
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,040
No, basketball.

558
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
No, but basketball, racquetball too.

559
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,840
Squash.

560
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,680
Squash, squash, squash.

561
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,520
Not racquetball, that's right.

562
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,040
Yeah, squash, which is not...

563
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,440
Racquetball, yes.

564
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,280
Squash, no.

565
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,080
And I hope you hear that, Michael.

566
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,040
Oh, Michael Kearns.

567
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,640
As a game, not his skill level.

568
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,080
Because I'm pretty sure he's...

569
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,640
All right, there's some competitiveness there.

570
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,400
But the point is that it was like the middle of the day.

571
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
I had full day of interviews.

572
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,680
Like, I've met with people,

573
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,000
but then in the middle of the day, I gave a job talk.

574
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,600
And then there was gonna be more interviews.

575
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,960
But I pulled Michael aside and I said,

576
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,280
I think it's in both of our best interests

577
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,800
if I just leave now.

578
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,600
Because that was so bad that it'd just be embarrassing

579
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,120
if I have to talk to any more people.

580
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,240
Like, you look bad for having invited me.

581
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,600
Like, it's just, let's just forget this ever happened.

582
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,800
So I don't think the talk went well.

583
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,640
That's one of the most Michael Lippman set of sentences

584
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
I think I've ever heard.

585
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,400
He did great.

586
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,200
Or at least everyone knew he was great.

587
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
So maybe it didn't matter.

588
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,920
I was there, I remember the talk.

589
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,720
And I remember him being very much

590
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,960
the way I remember him now in any given week.

591
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,800
So it was good.

592
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,640
And we met and we talked about stuff.

593
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,960
He thinks I didn't like him, but...

594
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,320
Because he was so grumpy.

595
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,720
Must've been the chair thing.

596
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
The chair thing and the low voice, I think.

597
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,800
Like, he obviously was happy with me.

598
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,000
And that slight skeptical look.

599
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,560
Yes.

600
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

601
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,960
Well, I probably didn't have any idea

602
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
what you were talking about.

603
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,840
Anyway, I liked him.

604
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,680
He asked me questions.

605
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,520
I answered questions.

606
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,360
I felt bad about myself.

607
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,680
It was a normal day.

608
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
What's a normal day?

609
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
And then he left.

610
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,360
And then he left.

611
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,200
And that's how we met.

612
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,040
Can we take a...

613
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,880
And then I got hired and I was in the group.

614
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,160
Can we take a slight tangent on this topic of,

615
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,560
it sounds like, maybe you could speak

616
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600
through the bigger picture.

617
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
It sounds like you're quite self-critical.

618
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
Who, Charles?

619
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,800
No, you.

620
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
Oh.

621
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
I think I can do better.

622
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,320
I can do better.

623
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Try me again.

624
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll do better.

625
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,600
I'll be self-critical, I won't, I won't, I won't.

626
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,640
Yeah, that was like a three out of 10 response.

627
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,800
Let's try to work it up to five and six.

628
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,200
I remember Marvin Minsky said, on a video interview,

629
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,840
something that the key to success in academic research

630
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,440
is to hate everything you do.

631
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,440
For some reason...

632
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,280
I think I followed that

633
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,880
because I hate everything he's done.

634
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
That's a good line.

635
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
That's a six.

636
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,480
Maybe that's a keeper.

637
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,680
But do you find that resonance with you at all

638
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,760
in how you think about talks and so on?

639
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
I would say it differently.

640
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,720
It's not that...

641
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,560
No, not really.

642
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,440
That's such an MIT view of the world, though.

643
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,480
So I remember talking about this one as a student.

644
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,960
You were basically told I will clean it up

645
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,360
for the purpose of the podcast.

646
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,960
My work is crap, my work is crap,

647
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,200
my work is crap, my work is crap.

648
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,720
Then you go to a conference or something

649
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,080
and you're like, everybody else's work is crap.

650
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,040
Everybody else's work is crap.

651
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,240
And you feel better and better about it,

652
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,320
relatively speaking.

653
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,120
And then you sort of keep working on it.

654
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,840
I don't hate my work.

655
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,680
That resonates with me.

656
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,920
Yes, I've never hated my work,

657
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,520
but I have been dissatisfied with it.

658
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,040
And I think being dissatisfied,

659
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,360
being okay with the fact

660
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,680
that you've taken a positive step,

661
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,400
the derivative's positive.

662
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,400
Maybe even the second derivative's positive.

663
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,160
That's important because that's a part of the hope, right?

664
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,360
But you have to, but I haven't gotten there yet.

665
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,960
If that's not there, that I haven't gotten there yet,

666
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,520
then it's hard to move forward, I think.

667
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
So I buy that, which is a little different

668
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,480
from hating everything that you do.

669
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,400
Yeah, I mean, there's things that I've done

670
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,320
that I like better than I like myself.

671
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,120
So it's separating me from the work, essentially.

672
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,880
So I think I am very critical of myself,

673
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,800
but sometimes the work I'm really excited about.

674
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,360
And sometimes I think it's kind of good.

675
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,200
Does that happen right away?

676
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,400
So I found the work that I've liked, that I've done,

677
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,480
most of it, I liked it in retrospect

678
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,280
more when I was far away from it in time.

679
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,440
I have to be fairly excited about it to get done.

680
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
No, excited at the time,

681
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
but then happy with the result.

682
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,800
But years later, or even I might go back,

683
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,200
you know what, that actually turned out to matter.

684
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
That turned out to matter.

685
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,240
Oh gosh, it turns out I've been thinking about that.

686
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,400
It's actually influenced all the work

687
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,920
that I've done since without realizing it.

688
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,280
But that guy was smart.

689
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,200
Yeah, that guy had a future.

690
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,920
He's going places.

692
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,160
I think there's, so yeah, so I think there's something to it.

693
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
I think there's something to the idea of you gotta,

694
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,400
you know, hate what you do, but it's not quite hate.

695
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,680
It's just being unsatisfied.

696
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,400
And different people motivate themselves differently.

697
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,800
I don't happen to motivate myself with self-loathing.

698
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,960
I happen to motivate myself with something else.

699
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,960
So you're able to sit back and be proud

700
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,840
of in retrospect of the work you've done.

701
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,600
Well, and it's easier when you can connect it

702
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,920
with other people, because then you can be proud of them.

703
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,240
I'm proud of the people, yeah.

704
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,080
And then the question is.

705
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,480
No, you can still safely hate yourself.

706
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,800
Yeah, that's right.

707
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,160
It's win-win, Michael, or at least win-lose,

708
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,480
which is what you're looking for.

709
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,240
Oh wow, there's so many brothers and brothers in this.

710
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
There's levels.

711
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,040
So how did you actually meet, meet?

712
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,880
Yeah, Michael.

713
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,560
So the way I think about it is,

714
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,520
because we didn't do much research together at H&T,

715
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,560
but then we all got laid off.

716
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,480
So that was-

717
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,960
By the way, sorry to interrupt,

718
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,560
but that was like one of the most magical places,

719
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,400
historically speaking.

720
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,360
They did not appreciate what they had.

721
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
And how do we-

722
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,240
I feel like there's a profile lesson in there too.

723
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,400
How do we get it?

724
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,120
Like, why was it so magical?

725
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
Is it just a coincidence of history,

726
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,280
or is there something special about-

727
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,760
There were some really good managers

728
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,520
and people who really believed in machine learning

729
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,120
as this is gonna be important.

730
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,640
Let's get the people who are thinking about this

731
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,080
in creative and insightful ways

732
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,320
and put them in one place and stir.

733
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,880
Yeah, but even beyond that, right?

734
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,560
It was Bell Labs at its heyday.

735
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
And even when we were there,

736
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,880
which I think was past its heyday.

737
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,720
And to be clear, he's gotten to be at Bell Labs.

738
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,080
I never got to be at Bell Labs.

739
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,320
I joined after that.

740
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,640
Yeah, I should have been 91 as a grad student.

741
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,000
So I was there for a long time, every summer,

742
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,840
except for two.

743
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,680
So twice I worked for companies

744
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,880
that had just stopped being Bell Labs.

745
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,640
Bell Corps and then AT&T Labs.

746
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,000
So Bell Labs was several locations

747
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
or for the researchers, or is it one?

748
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Like, is that- Definitely sevens.

749
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,080
Like, Jersey's involved somehow.

750
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,920
They're all in Jersey.

751
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,760
Yeah, they're all over the place.

752
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,120
But they were in a couple places in Jersey.

753
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,480
Murray Hill was the Bell Labs place.

754
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,840
So you had an office at Murray Hill

755
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,120
at one point in your career?

756
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,400
Yeah, I played Ultimate Frisbee

757
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,360
on the cricket pitch at Bell Labs at Murray Hill.

758
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
And then it became AT&T Labs when it split off

759
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,960
with Luce during what we called Trivestiture,

760
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,680
the better than Michael Korn's at Ultimate Frisbee.

761
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,600
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

762
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,440
Okay.

763
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
But I think that one's not boasting.

764
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,600
I think that, I think Charles plays a lot of Ultimate.

765
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
And I don't think Mike-

766
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,120
No, I was, yes, but that wasn't the point.

767
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,960
The point is yes.

768
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm sorry. Oh, yes, yes, sorry, sorry.

769
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,440
Okay, I have played on a championship-winning

770
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Ultimate Frisbee team, or whatever,

771
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,800
Ultimate team with Charles.

772
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,680
So I know how good he is.

773
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,520
He's really good.

774
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
How good I was anyway when I was younger.

775
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,480
But the thing is-

776
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,920
I know how young he was when he was younger.

777
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,760
That's true.

778
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
So much younger than now.

779
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,840
He's older now.

780
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Michael was a much,

781
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,160
was a much better basketball player than I was.

782
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,400
Michael Korn's.

783
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
Yes, no, not Michael Korn.

784
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,080
Let's be very clear about that.

785
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,800
To be clear, I've not played basketball with you.

786
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,480
So you don't know how terrible I am,

787
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,360
but you have a probably pretty good guess.

788
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,320
That you're not as good as Michael Korn.

789
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,800
He's tall and athletic.

790
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,640
And he cared about it.

791
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,960
He's very athletic, very good.

792
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,800
And probably competitive.

793
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,280
I love hanging out with Michael.

794
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,680
Anyway, but we were talking about something else,

795
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
although I no longer remember what it was.

796
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,800
What were we talking about?

797
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,160
Honey, that's all Bell Labs.

798
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,000
But also Labs.

799
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,720
So this was kind of cool about what was magical about it.

800
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,360
The first thing you have to know

801
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,520
is that Bell Labs was an arm of the government, right?

802
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Because AT&T was an arm of the government.

803
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,520
It was a monopoly.

804
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,840
And you know, every month you paid a little thing

805
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,040
on your phone bill, which turned out was a tax

806
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,360
for like all the research that Bell Labs was doing.

807
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,720
And you know, they invented transistors and the laser

808
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,560
and whatever else is that they did.

809
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,600
The big bang or whatever the cosmic background radiation.

810
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,440
Yeah, they did all that stuff.

811
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
They had some amazing stuff with directional microphones.

812
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,560
By the way, I got to go in this room

813
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,000
where they had all these panels and everything

814
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and we would talk.

815
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,880
And one another and he'd lose some panels around

816
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,640
and then he'd have me step two steps to the left

817
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,160
and I couldn't hear a thing he was saying

818
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
because nothing was bouncing off the walls.

819
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,520
And then he would shut it all down

820
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,320
and you could hear your heartbeat.

821
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,400
Which is deeply disturbing to hear your heartbeat.

822
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,240
You can feel it.

823
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,080
I mean, you can feel it now.

824
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,680
So there's so much all this sort of noise around.

825
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,360
Anyway, Bell Labs is about pure research.

826
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,480
It was a university in some sense,

827
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,740
the purest sense of a university, but without students.

828
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,480
So it was all the faculty working with one another

829
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,920
and students would come in to learn.

830
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,320
They would come in for three or four months

831
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,960
during the summer and they would go away.

832
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,920
But it was just this kind of wonderful experience

833
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,800
I could walk out my door.

834
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,640
In fact, I would often have to walk out my door

835
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,760
and deal with Rich Sutton and Michael Kearns yelling

836
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,520
at each other about whatever it is they were yelling

837
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
about the proper way to prove something or another.

838
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
And I could just do that and Dave McAllister

839
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,840
and Peter Stone and all of these other people

840
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,720
including Satinder and then eventually Michael.

841
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,320
And it was just a place where you could think thoughts

842
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,680
and it was okay because so long as once every 25 years

843
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,800
or so somebody invented a transistor,

844
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,840
it paid for everything else.

845
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,160
You could afford to take the risk.

846
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,480
And then when that all went away,

847
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,400
it became harder and harder and harder to justify it

848
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,560
as far as the folks who were very far away were concerned.

849
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,600
And there was such a fast turnaround

850
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,440
among middle management on the AT&T side

851
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,400
that you never had a chance to really build a relationship.

852
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,880
At least people like us didn't have a chance

853
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,520
to build a relationship.

854
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,040
So when the diaspora happened, it was amazing, right?

855
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,720
Everybody left and I think everybody ended up

856
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,760
at a great place and made a huge,

857
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,760
made a continue to do really good work with machine learning.

858
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,040
But it was a wonderful place and people will ask me,

859
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,080
what's the best job you've ever had?

860
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,160
And as a professor, anyway, the answer that I would give is,

861
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,160
well, probably Bell Labs in some very real sense

862
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
and I would never have a job like that again

863
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,400
because Bell Labs doesn't exist anymore.

864
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,320
And Microsoft research is great and Google does good stuff

865
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,200
and you can pick IBM, you can tell everyone to,

866
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,880
but Bell Labs was magical.

867
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,040
It was around for, it was an important time

868
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,120
and it represents a high watermark in basic research

869
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,960
in the US.

870
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,800
Is there something you could say

871
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,680
about the physical proximity and the chance collisions?

872
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,400
Like we live in this time of the pandemic

873
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,800
where everyone is maybe trying to see the silver lining

874
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,960
and accepting the remote nature of things.

875
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,400
Is there one of the things that people like faculty

876
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,640
that I talk to miss is the procrastination.

877
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,000
Like the chance to make everything is about meetings

878
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
that are supposed to be,

879
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,120
there's not a chance to just talk about comic book

880
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,240
or whatever, like go into discussion that's totally pointless.

881
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
So it's funny you say this

882
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,160
because that's how we met, met is exactly that.

883
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,000
So I'll let Michael say that,

884
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,840
but I'll just add one thing,

885
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,520
which is just that research is a social process

886
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,200
and it helps to have random social interactions

887
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
even if they don't feel social at the time.

888
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,440
That's how you get things done.

889
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,200
Have one of the great things about the ad lab

890
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,040
when I was there,

891
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,920
I don't quite know what it looks like now

892
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,840
once they move buildings,

893
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,880
but we had entire walls that were whiteboards

894
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
and people would just get up there

895
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,720
and they were just right

896
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
and people would walk up and you'd have arguments

897
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,160
and you'd explain things to one another

898
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,640
and you got so much out of the freedom to do that.

899
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,000
You had to be okay with people challenging

900
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,480
every freaking word you said,

901
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,240
which I would sometimes find deeply irritating,

902
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,640
but most of the time it was quite useful,

903
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,040
but the sort of pointlessness and the interaction

904
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,820
was in some sense the point, at least for me.

905
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,120
Yeah, I mean, I think offline yesterday

906
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
I mentioned Josh Titanbaum and he's very much,

907
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,680
he's such an inspiration in the child-like way

908
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,920
that he pulls you in on any topic.

909
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,440
He doesn't even have to be about machine learning

910
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,680
or the brain.

911
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,920
He'll just pull you into a closest writable surface,

912
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,320
which is still, you can find whiteboards

913
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,760
at MIT everywhere.

914
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,960
And just like basically cancel all meetings

915
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,960
and talk for a couple hours about some aimless thing

916
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,840
and it feels like the whole world,

917
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
the time, space continuum kind of warps

918
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,760
and that becomes the most important thing.

919
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,080
And then it's just, it's definitely something worth

920
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,160
missing in this world where everything's remote.

921
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,000
There's some magic to the physical presence.

922
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
Whenever I wonder myself whether MIT really is as great

923
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,280
as I remember it, I just go talk to Josh.

924
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,680
Yeah, you know, that's funny is there's a few people

925
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,360
in this world that carry the best

926
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,440
of what particular institutions stand for, right?

927
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,280
And it's-

928
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,120
It's Josh.

929
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, I don't, my guess is he's unaware of this.

930
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,840
That's the point.

931
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,760
The masters are not aware of their mastery.

932
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,480
So-

933
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,320
How did you meet?

934
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,400
Yes, but first the tangent, no.

935
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,760
How did you meet me?

936
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,160
So I'm not sure what you were thinking,

937
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,720
but when it started to dawn on me that maybe

938
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,040
we had a longer term bond was after we all got laid off

939
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,480
and you had decided at that point that we were still paid.

940
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,000
We were given an opportunity to like do job search

941
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,040
and kind of make a transition,

942
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
but it was clear that we were done.

943
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,440
And I would go to my office to work

944
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,360
and you would go to my office to keep me from working.

945
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,520
That was my recollection of it.

946
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,240
You had decided that there was really no point

947
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,600
in working for the company

948
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,800
because our relationship with the company was done.

949
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,320
Yeah, but remember I felt that way beforehand.

950
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,280
It wasn't about the company,

951
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,320
it was about the set of people there doing really cool things

952
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,880
and it always always been that way.

953
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,560
But we were working on something together.

954
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,400
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

955
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,240
That's right.

956
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,360
So at the very end, we all got laid off,

957
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,200
but then our boss came to, our boss's boss came to us

958
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,640
because our boss was Michael Kearns

959
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,040
and he had jumped ship brilliantly, like perfect timing,

960
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,120
like things like right before the ship was about to sink.

961
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,240
He was like, gotta go.

962
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,200
And landed perfectly because Michael Kearns.

963
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,040
Because Michael Kearns.

964
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,600
And leaving the rest of us to go like, this is fine.

965
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,800
And then it was clear that it wasn't fine

966
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,440
and we were all toast.

967
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,200
So we had this sort of long period of time.

968
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
But then our boss figured out, okay, wait,

969
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,680
maybe we can save a couple of these people

970
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,440
if we can have them do something really useful.

971
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,680
And the useful thing was we were gonna make

972
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,280
basically an automated assistant

973
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,920
that could help you with your calendar.

974
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,720
You could like tell it things

975
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,880
and it would respond appropriately.

976
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,720
It would just kind of integrate across

977
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,600
all sorts of your personal information.

978
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,760
And so me and Charles and Peter Stone

979
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,880
were set up as the crack team to actually solve this problem.

980
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,440
Other people maybe were too theoretical that they thought

981
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,680
and but we could actually get something done.

982
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,280
So we sat down to get something done

983
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,080
and there wasn't time and it wouldn't have saved us anyway.

984
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
And so it all kind of went downhill.

985
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,440
But the interesting, I think, coda to that

986
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,920
is that our boss's boss is a guy named Ron Brockman.

987
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,920
And when he left AT&T, because we were all laid off,

988
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,280
he went to DARPA, started up a program there

989
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,200
that became KLO, which is the program

990
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,120
from which Siri sprung, which is a digital assistant

991
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
that helps you with your calendar

992
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,720
and a bunch of other things.

993
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,920
It really, in some ways got its start

994
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
with me and Charles and Peter trying to implement

995
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,600
this vision that Ron Brockman had

996
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,760
that he ultimately got implemented

997
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,400
through his role at DARPA.

998
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,440
So when I'm trying to feel less bad

999
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,720
about having been laid off from what is possibly

1000
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,680
the greatest job of all time, I think about,

1001
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,120
well, we kind of help birth Siri.

1002
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,960
That's something.

1003
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,160
And he did other things too.

1004
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,680
But we got to spend a lot of time in his office

1005
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,840
and talk about-

1006
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,400
We got to spend a lot of time in my office, yeah.

1007
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,520
And so then we went on our merry way.

1008
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,360
Everyone went to different places.

1009
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,560
Charles landed at Georgia Tech,

1010
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,320
which was what he always dreamed he would do.

1011
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,720
And so that worked out well.

1012
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,400
I came up with a saying at the time,

1013
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,000
which is luck favors the Charles.

1014
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,560
It's kind of like luck favors the prepared.

1015
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,960
But Charles, he wished something

1016
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,480
and then it would basically happen just the way he wanted.

1017
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,520
It was inspirational to see things go that way.

1018
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,360
Things worked out.

1019
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,200
And we stayed in touch

1020
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,760
and then I think it really helped

1021
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,120
when you were working on,

1022
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,280
I mean, you'd kept me in the loop for things like threads

1023
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,800
and the work that you were doing at Georgia Tech.

1024
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,000
But then when they were starting

1025
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,880
their online master's program,

1026
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,000
he knew that I was really excited

1027
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,120
about MOOCs and online teaching.

1028
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,960
And he's like, I have a plan.

1029
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,920
And I'm like, tell me your plan.

1030
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,680
He's like, I can't tell you the plan yet.

1031
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,000
Cause they were deep in negotiations

1032
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,560
between Georgia Tech and Udacity to make this happen.

1033
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,360
And they didn't want it to leak.

1034
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,280
So Charles would kept teasing me about it,

1035
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,760
but wouldn't tell me what was actually going on.

1036
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,040
And eventually it was announced and he said,

1037
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,080
I would like you to teach the machine learning course

1038
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,920
with me.

1039
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,360
I'm like, that can't possibly work.

1040
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,960
But it was a great idea and it was, it was super fun.

1041
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,160
It was a lot of work to put together,

1042
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,040
but it was, it was really great and...

1043
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Was that the first time you thought about,

1044
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,720
first of all, was it the first time

1045
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,160
you got seriously into teaching?

1046
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
I mean, you know, I'm trying to get the professor right.

1047
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,520
This was already after you jumped to,

1048
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,760
so like there's a little bit of jumping around in time.

1049
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah, sorry about that.

1050
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,560
There's a pretty big jump in time.

1051
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,600
So like the MOOCs thing is...

1052
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,280
So Charles got to Georgia Tech and he,

1053
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,120
I mean, maybe Charles, maybe this is a Charles story.

1054
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,080
I got to Georgia Tech in 2002.

1055
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,280
He got to Georgia Tech in 2002.

1056
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,840
And worked on things like revamping the curriculum,

1057
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,800
the undergraduate curriculum,

1058
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,840
so that it had some kind of semblance of modular structure

1059
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,640
because computer science was at the time moving

1060
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,680
from a fairly narrow specific set of topics

1061
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,360
to touching a lot of other parts of intellectual life

1062
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,840
and the curriculum was supposed to reflect that.

1063
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,520
And so Charles played a big role in kind of redesigning that.

1064
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,360
And then the...

1065
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,720
And for my, my labors, I ended up as associate dean.

1066
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,440
Right, he got to become associate dean

1067
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,840
of a charge of educational stuff.

1068
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,720
Well, that would be a valuable lesson

1069
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,960
if you're good at something,

1070
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,760
they will give you responsibility to do more of that thing.

1071
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,640
Well, don't show competence.

1072
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,280
Don't show competence if you...

1073
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,720
Well, you know what they say, here's what they say.

1074
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,360
The reward for good work is more work.

1075
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,360
The reward for bad work is less work,

1076
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,000
which I don't know, depending on what you're trying

1077
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,320
to do that week, one of those is better than the other.

1078
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,840
Well, one of the problems with the word work

1079
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,640
sorry to interrupt is that it seems to be an antonym

1080
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,280
in this particular language

1081
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,840
we have the opposite of happiness.

1082
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,640
But it seems like they're,

1083
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,440
that's one of, you know, we talked about balance.

1084
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,680
It's always like work-life balance.

1085
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,920
So it was rubbing me the wrong way as a terminology.

1086
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
I know it's just words.

1087
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,480
Right, the opposite of work is play,

1088
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,920
but ideally work is play.

1089
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,360
Oh, I can't tell you how much time I'd spend.

1090
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,800
Certainly not as a Bell Labs,

1091
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,760
except for a few very key moments.

1092
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,160
As a professor, I would do this too.

1093
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,520
I was just saying, I cannot believe they're

1094
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,440
paying me to do this.

1095
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,400
Because it's fun.

1096
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,120
It's something that I would do for a hobby

1097
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,960
if I could anyway.

1098
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,800
So that sort of worked out.

1099
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,840
Are you sure you want to be saying that

1100
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,920
when this is being recorded?

1101
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,320
As a dean, that is not true at all.

1102
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,880
I need a raise.

1103
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,440
But I think here with this, even though a lot of time passed

1104
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,600
Michael and I talked almost every, well, we texted

1105
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,920
almost every day during the period.

1106
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,200
Charles at one point took me, there was the ICML conference

1107
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,360
the machine learning conference was in Atlanta.

1108
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,440
I was the chair, the general chair of the conference.

1109
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Charles was my publicity chair or something like that

1110
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,280
or fundraising chair.

1111
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,120
Fundraising chair.

1112
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,960
Yeah.

1113
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,040
But he decided it'd be really funny

1114
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,720
if he didn't actually show up for the conference

1115
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,680
in his own home city.

1116
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,520
So he didn't.

1117
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,600
But he did at one point pick me up at the conference

1118
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,200
in his Tesla and drove me to the Atlanta mall

1119
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,120
and forced me to buy an iPhone

1120
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,720
because he didn't like how it was to text with me

1121
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,400
and thought it would be better for him if I had an iPhone,

1122
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
the text would be somehow smoother.

1123
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,240
And it was.

1124
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,080
And it was.

1125
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,920
And it is, and his life is better.

1126
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,760
And my life is better.

1127
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,600
And so, yeah.

1128
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,240
But it was, yeah, Charles forced me to get an iPhone

1129
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,360
so that he could text me more efficiently.

1130
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,000
I thought that was an interesting moment.

1131
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,840
It works for me.

1132
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,120
Anyway, so we kept talking the whole time

1133
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,440
and then eventually we did the teaching thing.

1134
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,280
And it was great.

1135
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,840
And there's a couple of reasons for that, by the way.

1136
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,480
One is I really wanted to do something different.

1137
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,240
Like you've got this medium here.

1138
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,520
People claim it can change things.

1139
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,960
What's a thing that you could do in this medium

1140
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,360
that you could not do otherwise besides edit?

1141
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,240
Right, I mean, what could you do?

1142
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
And being able to do something

1143
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,560
with another person was that kind of thing.

1144
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,400
It's very hard.

1145
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,440
I mean, you can take turns, but teaching together,

1146
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,040
having conversations is very hard, right?

1147
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,280
So that was a cool thing.

1148
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,400
The second thing, if you'd be excused

1149
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,480
to do more stuff with him.

1150
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,720
Yeah, I always thought, he makes it sound brilliant.

1151
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,240
And it is, I guess.

1152
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,320
But at the time, it really felt like

1153
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,760
I've got a lot to do, Charles is saying.

1154
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,800
And it would be great if Michael could teach the course

1155
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,280
and I could just.

1156
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,120
Hang out.

1157
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,520
Yeah, just kind of coast on that.

1158
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,600
Well, that's what the second class was more like that.

1159
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,440
Because the second class was explicit.

1160
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,440
The first class, it was at least half.

1161
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,160
Yeah, but I knew all the stuff.

1162
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,000
So the structure that we came up with.

1163
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I think you were once again letting the facts

1164
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,840
get in the way.

1165
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,680
It's a good story.

1166
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,960
A good story.

1167
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,760
I should just let Charles talk to us.

1168
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,880
But that's the facts that he saw,

1169
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,600
but so that was kind of true for 72.

1170
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,240
Yeah, that was sort of true for 7642,

1171
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,400
which is the reinforcement learning class

1172
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,600
because that was really his class.

1173
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,880
You started with reinforcement learning?

1174
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,040
No, we started with, I did the intro machine learning,

1175
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,280
7641, which is supervised learning

1176
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,040
and reinforcement learning and decision making

1177
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
and cram all that in there.

1178
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,960
Kind of assignments that we talked about earlier.

1179
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,520
And then eventually about a year later,

1180
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,560
we did a follow on 7642,

1181
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,840
which is reinforcement learning and decision making.

1182
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,360
The first class was based on something

1183
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,520
I'd been teaching at that point for well over a decade.

1184
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,920
And the second class was based on something

1185
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,480
Michael had been teaching.

1186
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,840
Actually, I learned quite a bit

1187
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,480
teaching that class with him.

1188
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,600
But he drove most of that.

1189
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,840
But the first one I drove most of it was all my material.

1190
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,560
Although I had stolen that material

1191
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,000
originally from slides I found online

1192
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,600
from Michael, who had originally stolen that material

1193
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,200
from I guess slides he found online,

1194
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,280
probably from Andrew Moore,

1195
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,680
because the jokes were the same anyway.

1196
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
At least some of the, at least when I found the slide,

1197
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,840
some of the stuff was there.

1198
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,520
Yes, every machine learning class

1199
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,960
taught an early 2000s stole from Andrew Moore.

1200
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,040
A particular joke or two.

1201
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,960
At least the structure.

1202
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,240
Now I did, and he did actually a lot more

1203
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,000
with reinforcement learning and such

1204
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,400
and game theory and those kinds of things.

1205
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,440
But you know, we all sort of-

1206
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,920
You mean in the research world?

1207
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,760
No, no, no, in that class.

1208
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,880
No, I mean in teaching that class.

1209
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,600
The coverage was different than what other people started.

1210
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,040
Most people were just doing supervised learning

1211
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,800
and maybe a little bit of clustering and whatnot.

1212
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,920
But we took it all the way to-

1213
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,880
A lot of it just comes from Tom Mitchell's book.

1214
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,600
Oh no, yeah, except, well, half of it

1215
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,040
comes from Tom Mitchell's book, right?

1216
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,120
But the other half doesn't.

1217
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,560
This is why it's all readings, right?

1218
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,000
Because certain things weren't invented when Tom Mitchell's-

1219
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,840
Yeah, okay, that's true.

1220
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,880
Right?

1221
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,760
But it was quite good.

1222
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,000
But there's a reason for that besides, you know,

1223
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,120
just I wanted to do it.

1224
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,960
I wanted to do something new

1225
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,460
and I wanted to do something with him,

1226
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,680
which is a realization,

1227
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,480
which is despite what you might believe,

1228
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,520
he's an introvert and I'm an introvert

1229
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,200
or I'm on the edge of being an introvert anyway.

1230
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,000
But both of us, I think, enjoy the energy of the crowd,

1231
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,840
right?

1232
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,760
There's something about talking to people

1233
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,000
and bringing them into whatever we find interesting

1234
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,520
that is empowering, energizing or whatever.

1235
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,520
And I found the idea of staring alone at a computer screen

1236
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,720
and then talking off of materials

1237
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,280
less inspiring than I wanted it to be.

1238
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,240
And I had in fact done a MOOC for Udacity on algorithms

1239
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,160
and it was a week in a dark room,

1240
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,080
talking at the screen, writing on the little pad.

1241
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,360
And I didn't know this was happening,

1242
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,480
but they had watched the crew had watched some of the videos

1243
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,760
while, you know, like in the middle of this

1244
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,800
and they're like, something's wrong.

1245
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,560
You're sort of shutting down.

1246
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,480
And I think a lot of it was I'll make jokes

1247
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,280
and no one would laugh.

1248
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,560
And I felt like the crowd hated me.

1249
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,880
Now, of course, there was no crowd.

1250
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,840
So like it wasn't rational, but it's little.

1251
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,960
Each time I tried it and I got no reaction,

1252
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,320
it just was taking the energy out of my performance,

1253
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,640
out of my presentation.

1254
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,440
Such a fantastic metaphor for grad school.

1255
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,680
Anyway, by working together,

1256
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,680
we could play off each other and have it.

1257
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,040
Keep the energy up because you can't let your guard down

1258
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,120
for a moment with Charles, he'll just overpower you.

1259
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,240
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1260
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,720
But we would work really well together.

1261
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,880
I thought and we knew each other.

1262
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,640
So I knew that we could sort of make it work.

1263
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,760
Plus I was the associate dean.

1264
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,080
So they had to do what I told them to do.

1265
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,920
We had to do that.

1266
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,760
We had to make it work.

1267
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,720
And so it worked out very well.

1268
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,960
I thought well enough that we

1269
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,560
with great power comes great power.

1270
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,400
That's right.

1271
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,360
And we became smooth and curly.

1272
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,360
And that's when we did the overfitting thriller video.

1273
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,560
Yeah.

1274
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,400
Yeah.

1275
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,240
That's it.

1276
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,920
Can we just like smooth and curly?

1277
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,760
What were that?

1278
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,480
So it happened.

1279
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,720
It was completely spontaneous.

1280
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,880
These are nicknames you go by.

1281
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,720
Yeah.

1282
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,640
So it's what the students call us.

1283
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,320
He was lecturing.

1284
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,040
So the way that we structured the lectures

1285
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,440
is one of us is the lecturer

1286
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,400
and one of us is basically the student.

1287
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,480
And so he was lecturing on.

1288
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,080
The lecturer prepares all the materials,

1289
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,480
comes up with the quizzes,

1290
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,160
and then the student comes in not knowing anything.

1291
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,480
So it was just like being on campus.

1292
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,120
And I was doing game theory in particular,

1293
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,960
the prisoner's dilemma.

1294
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,800
Prisoner's dilemma.

1295
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,240
We needed to set up a little prisoner's dilemma grid.

1296
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,400
So he drew it and I could see what he was drawing.

1297
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,560
And the prisoner's dilemma consists of two players,

1298
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,400
two parties.

1299
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,160
So he decided he would make little cartoons

1300
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,280
of the two of us.

1301
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,880
And so there was two criminals, right?

1302
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,980
That were deciding whether or not to rat each other out.

1303
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,160
One of them, he drew as a circle with a smiley face

1304
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,160
and a kind of goatee thing, smooth head.

1305
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,440
And the other one with all sorts of curly hair.

1306
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,480
And he said, this is smooth and curly.

1307
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,760
I said smooth and curly.

1308
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,640
He said, no, no, smooth with a V.

1309
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
It's very important that it have a V.

1310
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,280
And then the students really took to that.

1311
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,240
Like they found that relatable.

1312
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,280
He started singing in smooth criminal by Michael Jackson.

1313
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1314
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,640
And those names stuck.

1315
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,120
So we now have a video series that an episode,

1316
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,000
our kind of first actual episode should be coming out today,

1317
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,320
smooth and curly on video,

1318
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,400
where the two of us discuss episodes of Westworld.

1319
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,960
We watch Westworld and we're like,

1320
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,920
huh, what does this say about computer science and AI?

1321
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,960
And we've never, we did not watch it.

1322
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,800
I mean, I know it's on season three or whatever we have.

1323
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,760
As of this recording, it's on season three.

1324
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,000
And watch now two episodes total.

1325
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,280
Yeah, I think I watched three.

1326
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,720
What do you think about Westworld?

1327
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,560
Two episodes in.

1328
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,000
So I can tell you so far,

1329
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,200
I'm just guessing what's gonna happen next.

1330
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
It seems like bad things are gonna happen

1331
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,320
with the robots uprising.

1332
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,160
It's a lot of.

1333
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,640
So I have not, I mean, you know,

1334
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,240
I vaguely remember a movie existing.

1335
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,640
So I assume it's related to that, but.

1336
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,280
That was more my time than your time, Charles.

1337
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,600
That's right, cause you're much older than I am.

1338
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,960
I think the important thing here is that it's narrative,

1339
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,800
right?

1340
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,620
It's all about telling a story.

1341
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,460
That's the whole driving thing.

1342
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,760
But the idea that they would give these reveries,

1343
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,440
that they would make people,

1344
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,560
they would make them remember the awful things that happened.

1345
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,400
How horrible things that happened.

1346
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,880
Who could possibly think that was a good, I gotta,

1347
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,720
I mean, I don't know.

1348
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,680
I've only seen the first two episodes

1349
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,520
or maybe the third one.

1350
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,360
I think I've only seen the first one.

1351
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,200
You know what it was?

1352
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,040
Do you know what the problem is?

1353
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,880
What?

1354
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,560
That the robots were actually designed by Hannibal Lecter.

1355
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,400
That's true.

1356
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
They weren't.

1357
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,800
So like, what do you think's gonna happen?

1358
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,640
Bad thing.

1359
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,880
It's clear that things are happening

1360
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,000
and characters being introduced

1361
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,280
and we don't yet know anything.

1362
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,840
But still, I was just struck by how it's all driven

1363
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,680
by narrative and story.

1364
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,300
And there's all these implied things like programming hap,

1365
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,920
the programming interface is talking to them

1366
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,680
about what's going on in their heads,

1367
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,600
which is both, I mean, artistically,

1368
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,160
it's probably useful to film it that way.

1369
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,600
But think about how it would work in real life.

1370
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,520
That just seems very great.

1371
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,320
But there was, we saw on the second episode,

1372
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,720
there's a screen you could see things.

1373
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,560
They were wearing like clothes.

1374
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,400
It was quite interesting to just kind of ask this question

1375
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,240
so far.

1376
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,960
I mean, I assume it veers off into Never Never Land

1377
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,800
at some point.

1378
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,920
So we don't know, we can't answer that question.

1379
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,720
I'm also a fan of a guy named Alex Garland.

1380
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,440
He's a director of Ex Machina.

1381
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,020
And he is the first,

1382
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,160
I wonder if Kubrick was like this actually,

1383
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,160
is he like studies what would it take

1384
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,760
to program in AI systems?

1385
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,760
Like he's curious enough to go into that direction.

1386
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,480
On the Westworld side,

1387
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,360
I felt there was more emphasis on the narratives

1388
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,520
than like actually asking like computer science questions.

1389
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,680
Like, how would you build this?

1390
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,840
How would you, and how would you debug it?

1391
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,000
I still, to me, that's the key issue.

1392
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,320
They were terrible debuggers.

1393
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,160
Yeah.

1394
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,040
Well, they said specifically, so we make a change

1395
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,440
and we put it out in the world and that's bad

1396
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,840
because something terrible could happen.

1397
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,600
Like, if you're putting things out of the world

1398
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,160
and you're not sure whether something terrible

1399
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,320
is going to happen, your process is probably.

1400
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,800
I just feel like there should have been someone

1401
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,720
who's sole job it was was to walk around

1402
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,920
and poke his head at it and say,

1403
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,200
what could possibly go wrong?

1404
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,680
Just over and over again.

1405
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,280
I would have loved if there was an,

1406
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,840
and I did watch a lot more and I'm not giving anything away.

1407
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,120
I would have loved it if there was like an episode

1408
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,000
where like the new intern is like debugging

1409
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,760
a new model or something and like it just keeps failing

1410
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,160
and they're like, all right.

1411
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,600
And then more turns into like a episode of Silicon Valley

1412
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,980
or something like that versus like this ominous AI systems

1413
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,660
that are constantly like threatening the fabric

1414
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,380
of this world that's been created.

1415
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,220
Yeah.

1416
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,180
And you know, this reminds me of something that,

1417
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,020
so I agree with that.

1418
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,860
That should be very cool.

1419
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,780
At least well, for the small percentage of people

1420
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,740
who care about debugging systems.

1421
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
But the other thing is.

1422
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,660
Debugging the series.

1423
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,180
It falls into the thing of the sequels, fear of the debugger.

1424
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,020
Oh my gosh.

1425
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,580
And anyway, so.

1426
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,700
It's a nightmare show.

1427
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,420
It's a horror movie.

1428
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,900
I think that's where we lose people, by the way,

1429
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,700
early on as the people who either decide

1430
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,900
either figure out debugging or think debugging is terrible.

1431
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,860
This is where we lose people in computer science.

1432
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,060
This is part of the struggle versus suffering, right?

1433
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,660
You get through it and you kind of get the skills of it

1434
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,980
or you just like, this is dumb.

1435
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,340
This is a dumb way to do anything.

1436
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,540
I think that's when we lose people.

1437
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,780
But, well, I'll leave it at that.

1438
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:31,580
But I think that there's something really,

1439
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,220
really neat about framing it that way.

1440
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,620
But what I don't like about all of these things.

1441
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,060
And I love Tex Mockingham, by the way.

1442
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,300
Although the ending was very depressing.

1443
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,380
One of the things I have to talk to Alex about,

1444
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,980
he says that the thing that nobody noticed he put in

1445
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,940
is at the end, spoiler alert,

1446
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,940
the robot turns and looks at the camera and smiles,

1447
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,180
very briefly.

1448
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:05,180
And to him, he thought that his definition of passing

1449
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,620
the general version of the Torrentiaster,

1450
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,460
the consciousness test, is smiling for no one.

1451
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,580
It's like the Chinese room kind of experiment.

1452
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,820
It's not always trying to act for others,

1453
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,340
but just on your own, being able to have a relationship

1454
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,900
with the actual experience and just like take it in.

1455
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,740
I don't know.

1456
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,780
He said like nobody noticed the magic of it.

1457
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,060
I have this vague feeling that I remember the smile,

1458
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,140
but now you've just put the memory in my head.

1459
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,180
So probably not, but I do think that that's interesting.

1460
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,980
Although by looking at the camera,

1461
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,660
you are smiling for the audience, right?

1462
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,020
You're breaking the fourth wall.

1463
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,260
It seems, I mean, well, that's a limitation in the medium,

1464
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,700
but I like that idea.

1465
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,580
But here's the problem I have with all of those movies,

1466
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,780
all of them, is that, but I know why it's this way.

1467
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,420
And I enjoy those movies.

1468
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:01,420
And Westworld is, it sets up the problem of AI as succeeding

1469
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,500
and then having something we cannot control.

1470
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,500
But it's not the bad part of AI.

1471
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,980
The bad part of AI is the stuff we're living through now,

1472
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,820
right?

1473
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,820
It's using the data to make decisions that are terrible.

1474
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,900
It's not the intelligence that's gonna go out there

1475
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,060
and surpass us and take over the world

1476
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,720
or lock us into a room to starve to death slowly

1477
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,780
over multiple days.

1478
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,220
It's instead the tools that we're building

1479
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:30,420
that are allowing us to make the terrible decisions

1480
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,020
we would have less efficiently made before, right?

1481
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,740
Computers are very good at making us more efficient,

1482
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,940
including being more efficient at doing terrible things.

1483
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,300
And that's the part of the AI we have to worry about.

1484
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,980
It's not the, you know, true intelligence

1485
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,300
that we're gonna build sometime in the future,

1486
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,000
probably long after we're around.

1487
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,180
But, you know, I just, I think that whole framing of it

1488
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:56,060
sort of misses the point, even though it is inspiring.

1489
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,820
And I was inspired by those ideas, right?

1490
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,140
I got into this in part

1491
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,860
because I wanted to build something like that.

1492
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,180
Philosophical questions are interesting to me,

1493
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,820
but, you know, that's not where the terror comes from.

1494
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,220
The terror comes from the everyday.

1495
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,020
And you can construct the situation.

1496
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,420
It's in the subtlety of the interaction between AI

1497
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,180
and the human, like with social networks,

1498
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,220
all the stuff you're doing

1499
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,860
with interactive artificial intelligence.

1500
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,460
But, you know, I feel like how 9,000

1501
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,820
came a little bit closer to that

1502
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,460
when it's in 2001 Space Odyssey,

1503
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,740
because it felt like a personal assistant.

1504
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,660
You know, it felt like closer to the AI systems

1505
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,500
you have today.

1506
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,940
And the real things we might actually encounter,

1507
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,940
which is over-relying in some fundamental way

1508
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,940
on our, like, DOM assistance or on social networks,

1509
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:49,940
like over-offloading too much of us onto, you know,

1510
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:55,140
onto things that require internet and power and so on.

1511
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,620
And thereby becoming powerless as a standalone entity.

1512
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,340
And then when that thing starts to misbehave

1513
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,660
in some subtle way, it creates a lot of problems.

1514
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,500
And those problems are dramatized when you're in space,

1515
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,380
because you don't have a way to walk away.

1516
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,860
Well, as the man said,

1517
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,340
once we started making the decisions for you,

1518
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,260
it stopped being your world, right?

1519
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,460
That's the matrix, Michael, in case you don't remember.

1520
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,820
But on the other hand, I could say,

1521
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,660
no, because isn't that what we do with people anyway?

1522
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,180
You know, just kind of the shared intelligence

1523
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,260
that is humanity is relying on other people constantly.

1524
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,460
I mean, we hyper-specialize, right, as individuals.

1525
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,700
We're still generally intelligent.

1526
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,140
We make our own decisions in a lot of ways,

1527
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,700
but we leave most of this up to other people.

1528
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,940
And that's perfectly fine.

1529
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:43,300
And by the way, everyone does necessarily share our goals.

1530
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,180
Sometimes they seem to be quite against us.

1531
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,020
Sometimes we make decisions

1532
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,180
that others would see as against our own interests.

1533
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,460
And yet we somehow manage it, manage and survive.

1534
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,900
I'm not entirely sure why an AI would actually make that worse.

1535
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,420
Or even different, really.

1536
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,180
You mentioned the matrix.

1537
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,420
Do you think we're living in a simulation?

1538
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:08,100
It does feel like a thought game

1539
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,780
more than a real scientific question.

1540
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,620
Well, I'll tell you why,

1541
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,540
like I think it's an interesting thought experiment.

1542
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,180
See what you think from a computer science perspective.

1543
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,180
It's a good experiment of how difficult would it be

1544
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,900
to create a sufficiently realistic world

1545
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,020
that us humans would enjoy being in.

1546
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,700
That's almost like a competition.

1547
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,140
If we're living in a simulation,

1548
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,620
then I don't believe that we were put in the simulation.

1549
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,220
I believe that it's just physics playing out

1550
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,420
and we came out of that.

1551
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,260
Like, I don't think.

1552
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,940
So you think you have to build the universe

1553
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:41,780
kind of all the time?

1554
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,620
I think the universe itself,

1555
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,820
we can think of that as a simulation.

1556
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:46,820
And in fact, sometimes I try to think about

1557
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,580
to understand what it's like for a computer

1558
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,700
to start to think about the world.

1559
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,380
I try to think about the world.

1560
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,820
Things like quantum mechanics

1561
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,580
where it doesn't feel very natural to me at all.

1562
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,860
And it really strikes me as,

1563
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,220
I don't understand this thing that we're living in.

1564
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,660
It has, there's weird things happening in it

1565
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,700
that don't feel natural to me at all.

1566
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,100
Now, if you want to call that as the result of a simulator.

1567
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,300
Okay, I'm fine with that.

1568
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,140
But like I don't-

1569
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,980
There's the bugs in the simulation.

1570
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,820
There's the bugs.

1571
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,580
I mean, the interesting thing about simulation

1572
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,300
is that it might have bugs.

1573
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,060
I mean, that's the thing that I-

1574
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,180
But there would be bugs for the people in the simulation.

1575
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,140
They're just, that's just reality.

1576
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,340
Unless you were hard enough to know that there was a bug.

1577
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,340
But I think-

1578
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,460
Back to the matrix.

1579
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,340
Yeah, the way you put the question-

1580
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,340
I don't think that we live in a simulation created for us.

1581
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,380
Okay, I would say that.

1582
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,220
I think that's interesting.

1583
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,140
I've actually never thought about it that way.

1584
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,180
I mean, the way you asked the question though is,

1585
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,060
could you create a world that is enough for us humans?

1586
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,500
It's an interestingly sort of self-referential question

1587
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,940
because the beings that created the simulation

1588
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,500
probably have not created a simulation

1589
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,380
that's realistic for them.

1590
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,260
But we're in the simulation and so it's realistic for us.

1591
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,300
So we could create a simulation

1592
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:02,220
that is fine for the people in the simulation, as it were.

1593
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,740
That would not necessarily be fine for us

1594
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,220
as the creators of the simulation.

1595
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,540
But, well, you can forget.

1596
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,780
I mean, when you go into the,

1597
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,380
if you play video games of virtual reality,

1598
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:15,420
you can, if it was some suspension of disbelief or whatever.

1599
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,500
It becomes a world.

1600
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,140
It becomes a world even like in brief moments.

1601
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,340
You forget that another world exists.

1602
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,260
I mean, that's what good stories do.

1603
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,300
They pull you in.

1604
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,500
And the question is, is it possible to pull,

1605
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,420
our brains are limited.

1606
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,300
Is it possible to pull the brain in

1607
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,740
to where we actually stay in that world

1608
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,820
longer and longer and longer and longer?

1609
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,020
And not only that, but we don't want to leave.

1610
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,540
And so, especially, this is the key thing

1611
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,900
about the developing brain,

1612
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:48,180
is if we journey into that world early on in life, often.

1613
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,780
How would you even know, yeah?

1614
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,180
But from a video game design perspective,

1615
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,980
from a Westworld perspective,

1616
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,580
I think it's an important thing

1617
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,860
for even computer scientists to think about,

1618
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,580
because it's clear that video games are getting much better.

1619
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:08,460
And virtual reality, although it's been ups and downs,

1620
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,860
just like artificial intelligence,

1621
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,820
it feels like virtual reality will be here

1622
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,340
in a very impressive form

1623
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,100
if we were to fast forward 100 years into the future

1624
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,140
in a way that might change society fundamentally.

1625
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,100
Like, if I were to, I'm very limited

1626
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,580
in predicting the future, as all of us are.

1627
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,660
But if I were to try to predict,

1628
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,580
like, in which way I'd be surprised

1629
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,060
to see the world 100 years from now,

1630
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,540
it'd be that, or impressed,

1631
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,940
it'd be that we're all no longer

1632
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,380
living in this physical world,

1633
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,020
that we're all living in a virtual world.

1634
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:49,060
You really need to be calculating God by Sawyer.

1635
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,100
It's a, he'll read it in a night.

1636
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,300
It's a very easy read,

1637
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,180
but it's a, I was assuming you were that kind of reader,

1638
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:59,700
but it's a good story, and it's kind of about this,

1639
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,420
but not in a way that it appears.

1640
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:05,820
And I really enjoyed the thought experiment.

1641
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,260
Yeah, I think it's pretty sure it's Robert Sawyer.

1642
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,140
But anyway, he's apparently

1643
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,380
Canadian's top science fiction writer,

1644
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,100
which is why the story mostly takes place in Toronto.

1645
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,060
But it's a very good,

1646
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:21,260
it's a very good sort of story that sort of imagines this.

1647
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,420
Very different kind of simulation hypothesis

1648
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,340
sort of thing from, say, the egg, for example.

1649
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,460
You know, I'm talking about the short story.

1650
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,740
By the guy who did the Martian.

1651
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,300
Who wrote the Martian?

1652
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,140
You know, I'm talking about.

1653
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,260
Matt Damon.

1654
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,780
No, the book.

1655
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,460
So we had this whole discussion

1656
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,740
that Michael doesn't partake in this exercise of reading.

1657
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:46,780
Yeah, he doesn't seem to like it,

1658
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,180
which seems very strange to me,

1659
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,100
considering how much he has to read.

1660
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,020
I read all the time.

1661
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,380
I used to read 10 books every week

1662
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,340
when I was in sixth grade or whatever.

1663
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,060
It was a lot of it's science fiction,

1664
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,980
a lot of it, a lot of it's history, but I love to read.

1665
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,780
But anyway, you should recalculate in God.

1666
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:05,020
I think you'll, it's very easy read, like I said,

1667
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,700
and I think you'll enjoy sort of the ideas that it presents.

1668
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,540
Yeah, I think the thought experiment is quite interesting.

1669
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,700
One thing I've noticed about people growing up now,

1670
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,260
I mean, we'll talk about social media,

1671
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,260
but video games is a much bigger, bigger and bigger

1672
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,700
and bigger part of their lives.

1673
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,220
And the video games have become much more realistic.

1674
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,220
I think it's possible that the three of us are not,

1675
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,860
and maybe the two of you are not familiar

1676
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,620
exactly with the numbers we're talking about here.

1677
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,180
I think the number of people.

1678
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,500
It's bigger than movies, right?

1679
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,100
It's huge.

1680
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,940
I used to do a lot of the computational narrative stuff.

1681
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,700
I understand that economists can actually see

1682
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,700
the impact of video games on the labor market.

1683
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:53,700
That there's fewer young men of a certain age

1684
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:59,260
participating in like paying jobs than you'd expect.

1685
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,300
And that they trace it back to video games.

1686
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,900
I mean, the problem with Star Trek

1687
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,340
was not warp drive or teleportation.

1688
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,980
It was the holodeck.

1689
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,060
Like if you have the holodeck, that's it.

1690
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,620
That's it, you go in the holodeck, you never come out.

1691
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,180
I mean, it just never made,

1692
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,980
once I saw that I thought, okay, well,

1693
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,060
so this is the end of humanity, right?

1694
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,740
They've been in the holodeck.

1695
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,180
Because that feels like the singularity,

1696
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,060
not some AGI or whatever.

1697
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:28,220
It's some possibly to go into another world

1698
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,060
that can be artificially made better than this one.

1699
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,180
And slowing it down so you live forever

1700
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,740
or speeding it up so you appear to live forever

1701
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,140
or making the decision of when to die.

1702
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,340
And then most of us will just be old people on the porch

1703
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,500
yelling at the kids these days in their virtual reality.

1704
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,340
Worlds.

1705
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,900
But they won't hear us because they've got headphones on.

1706
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,700
So, I mean, rewinding back to MOOCs,

1707
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,500
is there lessons that you've speaking to kids these days?

1708
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,820
There you go.

1709
01:07:58,820 --> 01:07:59,660
That was a transition.

1710
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,500
That was, right there.

1711
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,260
I'll fix it in post.

1712
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,420
That's Charles' favorite phrase.

1713
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,260
Fix it in post.

1714
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,100
Fix it in post.

1715
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,620
He said, when we were recording all the time,

1716
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,900
whenever the editor didn't like something or whatever,

1717
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,420
I would say, we'll fix it in post.

1718
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,900
He hated that.

1719
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,860
He hated that more than anything.

1720
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,980
Because it was Charles' way of saying,

1721
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,300
I'm not gonna do it again.

1722
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,300
You know, you're on your own for this one.

1723
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,060
But it always got fixed in post.

1724
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,900
Exactly.

1725
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,340
So, is there something you've learned about,

1726
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,820
I mean, it's interesting to talk about MOOCs,

1727
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,420
is there something you've learned about the process

1728
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:35,820
of education, about thinking about the present?

1729
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,780
I think there's two lines of conversation to be had here,

1730
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,580
is the future of education in general,

1731
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:42,860
that you've learned about.

1732
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:46,700
And more, pressurantly,

1733
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,300
is the education at times of COVID.

1734
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,540
The second thing, in some ways,

1735
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:54,060
matters more than the first,

1736
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,900
for at least in my head,

1737
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,100
not just because it's happening now,

1738
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,620
but because I think it's reminded us of a lot of things.

1739
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,140
Coincidentally, today,

1740
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,580
there's an article out by a good friend of mine,

1741
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,140
who's also a professor at Georgia Tech,

1742
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,940
but more importantly, a writer and editor

1743
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,740
at the Atlantic, kind of Ian Bogos.

1744
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:13,100
And the title is something like,

1745
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,580
Americans will sacrifice anything for the college experience.

1746
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,300
And it's about why we went back to college,

1747
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,420
and why people wanted us to go back to college.

1748
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,580
And it's not greedy presidents

1749
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,300
trying to get the last dollar from someone.

1750
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,980
It's because they want to go to college.

1751
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,860
And what they're paying for is not the classes,

1752
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,180
what they're paying for is the college experience.

1753
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,580
It's not the education, it's being there.

1754
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
I've believed this for a long time,

1755
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,940
that we continually make this mistake

1756
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,660
of people want to go back to college

1757
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,340
as being people want to go back to class.

1758
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,460
They don't, they want to go back to campus.

1759
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,460
They want to move away from home.

1760
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,260
They want to do all those things that people experience.

1761
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,140
It's a rite of passage.

1762
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:53,140
It's an identity, if I can steal some of Ian's words here.

1763
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,780
And I think that's right.

1764
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,900
And I think what we've learned through COVID is,

1765
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,860
it has made it, the disaggregation

1766
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,860
was not the disaggregation of the education

1767
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,060
from the place, the university place,

1768
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,020
and that you can get the best anywhere you want to.

1769
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,060
In terms of there's lots of reasons

1770
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,180
why that is not necessarily true.

1771
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,180
The disaggregation is having it shoved in our faces

1772
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,900
that the reason to go, again,

1773
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,620
that the reason to go to college

1774
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,220
is not necessarily to learn.

1775
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,100
It's to have the college experience.

1776
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,740
And that's very difficult for us to accept,

1777
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,740
even though we behave that way,

1778
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,540
most of us, when we were undergrads, you know.

1779
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,780
A lot of us didn't go to every single class.

1780
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,700
We learned and we got it and we look back on it

1781
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,340
and we're happy we had the learning experience as well.

1782
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,420
Obviously, particularly us,

1783
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,420
because this is the kind of thing that we do.

1784
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,380
And my guess is that's true of the vast majority

1785
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,420
of your audience.

1786
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,620
But that doesn't mean the,

1787
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,380
I'm standing in front of you telling you this

1788
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,420
is the thing that people are excited about.

1789
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,060
And that's why they want to be there,

1790
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,900
primarily why they want to be there.

1791
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,420
So to me, that's what COVID has forced us to deal with,

1792
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,100
even though I think we're still all in deep denial about it

1793
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,980
and hoping that it'll go back to that.

1794
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,580
And I think about 85% of it will.

1795
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,460
We'll be able to pretend that that's really the way it is,

1796
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,380
again, and we'll forget the lessons of this.

1797
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,540
But technically what will come out of it,

1798
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,100
or technologically what will come out of it,

1799
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,740
is a way of providing a more dispersed experience

1800
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:15,420
through online education and these kinds of remote things

1801
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,260
that we've learned.

1802
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:19,100
And we'll have to come up with new ways to engage them

1803
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,580
in the experience of college,

1804
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,100
which includes not just the parties

1805
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,620
or the whatever kids do,

1806
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,580
but the learning part of it so that they actually come out

1807
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,140
four or five or six years later

1808
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,900
with having actually learned something.

1809
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,100
So I think the world will be radically different afterwards.

1810
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,220
And I think technology will matter for that,

1811
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:38,460
just not in the way that the people

1812
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,700
who were building the technology originally

1813
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,140
imagined it would be.

1814
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:45,260
And I think this would have been true even without COVID,

1815
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,820
but COVID has accelerated that reality.

1816
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,180
So it's happening in two or three years or five years

1817
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,180
as opposed to 10 or 15.

1818
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,380
That was an amazing answer that I did not understand.

1819
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,180
So it was passionate and meaningful.

1820
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,180
Shots fired.

1821
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,380
But I don't know, I just didn't,

1822
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,460
no, I'm not trying to criticize it.

1823
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,260
I think I don't think I'm getting it.

1824
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,460
So you mentioned disaggregation.

1825
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,420
So what's that?

1826
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,500
Well, so the power of technology

1827
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,620
that if you go on the West Coast and hang out long enough

1828
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,620
is all about we're gonna disaggregate these things together,

1829
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,940
the books from the bookstore, that kind of a thing.

1830
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,860
And then suddenly Amazon controls the universe,

1831
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,540
and technology is a disruptor.

1832
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,860
And people have been predicting that

1833
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,900
for a higher education for a long time,

1834
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:23,740
but certainly in the...

1835
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,660
So is this the sort of idea like

1836
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:30,180
students can aggregate on a campus some place

1837
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,580
and then take classes over the network anywhere?

1838
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,940
Yeah, this is what people thought was gonna happen,

1839
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,100
or at least people claimed it was gonna happen, right?

1840
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,980
Because my daughter is essentially doing that now.

1841
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,100
She's on one campus, but learning in a different campus.

1842
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,580
Sure, and COVID makes that possible, right?

1843
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,300
Or COVID makes that...

1844
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,140
Legal.

1845
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,460
All but avoidable, right?

1846
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,500
But the idea originally was that,

1847
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,220
you and I were gonna create this machine learning class

1848
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,060
and it was gonna be great,

1849
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,820
and then no one else would be the machine learning class

1850
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,900
everyone changed, right?

1851
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,100
That was never gonna happen,

1852
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,460
but something like that you could see happen.

1853
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,700
But I feel like you didn't address that.

1854
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,820
So why is it that...

1855
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:01,700
Why Q?

1856
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,540
Why?

1857
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,220
I don't think that will be the thing that happens.

1858
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,340
So the college experience,

1859
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,220
maybe I missed what the college experience was.

1860
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,140
I thought it was peers, like people hanging around.

1861
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,660
A large part of it is peers.

1862
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,620
Well, it's peers and independence.

1863
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,060
Yeah, but none of that...

1864
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,340
You can do classes online for all of that.

1865
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,460
No, no, no, no.

1866
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,860
Because we're social people, right?

1867
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,300
So one would take the classes,

1868
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,260
that also has to be part of an experience.

1869
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,420
It's in a context, and the context is the university.

1870
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,660
And by the way, it actually matters

1871
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,140
that Georgia Tech really is different from Brown.

1872
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,180
I see, because then students can choose

1873
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,260
the kind of experience they think

1874
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,380
is gonna be best for them.

1875
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,420
Okay, I think we're giving too much agency

1876
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,540
to the students in making an informed decision.

1877
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,380
Okay.

1878
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,540
But yes, they will make choices

1879
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,860
and they will have different experiences.

1880
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,700
And some of those choices will be made for them.

1881
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,060
Some of them will be choices they're making

1882
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,700
because they think it's this, that, or the other.

1883
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,780
I just don't want to say...

1884
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,620
I don't want to give the idea...

1885
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,140
It's not homogeneous.

1886
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,020
Yes, it's certainly not homogeneous, right?

1887
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,500
I mean, Georgia Tech is different from Brown.

1888
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,340
Brown is different from pick your favorite

1889
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,340
state school in Iowa.

1890
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,860
Iowa State, okay?

1891
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,980
Which I guess is my favorite state school in Iowa.

1892
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,740
But these are all different.

1893
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:10,780
They have different contexts.

1894
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,260
And a lot of those contexts are,

1895
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,620
they're about history, yes,

1896
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,060
but they're also about the location of where you are.

1897
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,300
They're about the larger group of people who are around you,

1898
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,620
whether you're in Athens, Georgia,

1899
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,180
and you're basically the only thing that's there

1900
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,420
as a university, you're responsible for all the jobs,

1901
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,180
or whether you're at Georgia State University,

1902
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,060
which is an urban campus,

1903
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,940
where you're surrounded by six million people

1904
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,980
in your campus where it ends and begins in the city,

1905
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,620
ends and begins, we don't know.

1906
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,380
It actually matters whether you're a small campus

1907
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,220
or a large campus.

1908
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,060
I mean, these things matter.

1909
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,660
Why is it that if you go to Georgia Tech,

1910
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,940
you're forever proud of that?

1911
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,460
And you say that to people at dinner bars and whatever.

1912
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:54,460
And if you get a degree at an online university somewhere,

1913
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,020
you don't, that's not a thing that comes up at a bar.

1914
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,860
Well, it's funny you say that.

1915
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,820
So the students who take our online masters

1916
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,660
by several measures are more loyal

1917
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,900
than the students who come on campus,

1918
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,380
certainly for the master's degree.

1919
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,980
The reason for that, I think,

1920
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:11,900
and you'd have to ask them,

1921
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,980
but based on my conversations with them,

1922
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,540
I feel comfortable saying this,

1923
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,180
is because this didn't exist before.

1924
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,780
I mean, we talk about this online masters

1925
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,140
and that it's reaching 11,000 students

1926
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,060
and that's an amazing thing.

1927
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,140
And we're admitting everyone we believe we can succeed.

1928
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,700
We got a 60% acceptance rate.

1929
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:27,900
It's amazing, right?

1930
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,740
It's also a $6,600 degree.

1931
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,100
The entire degree costs $6,600 or $7,000,

1932
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,780
depending on how long you take.

1933
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,700
Dollar degree, as opposed to the $46,000

1934
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,940
that cost you to come on campus.

1935
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,620
So that feels, and I can do it while I'm working full time

1936
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,260
and I've got a family and a mortgage

1937
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,420
and all these other things.

1938
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,260
So it's an opportunity to do something you wanted to do

1939
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,780
but you didn't think was possible

1940
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:50,380
without giving up two years of your life

1941
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,980
as well as all the money and everything else,

1942
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,220
the life that you had built.

1943
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:57,020
So I think we created something that's had an impact,

1944
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,700
but importantly, we gave a set of people opportunities

1945
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,900
they otherwise didn't feel they had.

1946
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,940
So I think people feel very loyal about that

1947
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,260
and my biggest piece of evidence for that

1948
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,980
besides the surveys is that we have somewhere

1949
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,060
north of 80 students, might be 100 at this point,

1950
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:15,100
who graduated but come back in TA for this class

1951
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,860
for basically minimum wage,

1952
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,060
even though they're working full time

1953
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:22,020
because they believe in sort of having that opportunity

1954
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,420
and they wanna be a part of something.

1955
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:26,060
Now, will generation three feel this way?

1956
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,100
15 years from now, will people have that same sense?

1957
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:31,180
I don't know, but right now, they kind of do.

1958
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,940
And so it's not the online,

1959
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:36,380
it's a matter of feeling as if you're a part of something.

1960
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,620
We're all very tribal.

1961
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:42,140
And I think there's something very tribal

1962
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,300
about being a part of something like that.

1963
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,900
Being on campus makes that easier.

1964
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,260
Going through a shared experience makes that easier.

1965
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,740
It's harder to have that shared experience

1966
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:52,060
if you're alone looking at a computer screen.

1967
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,340
We can create ways to make that.

1968
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,340
Is it possible?

1969
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,260
It is possible.

1970
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,380
The question is, it still is the intuition to me.

1971
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,460
And it was at the beginning when I saw something

1972
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,620
like the online master's program

1973
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,020
is that this is gonna replace universities.

1974
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,460
And I won't replace universities, but it won't.

1975
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,140
But like, why is it, why?

1976
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,660
Because it's living in a different part of the ecosystem,

1977
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,500
right?

1978
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,700
The people who are taking it are already adults.

1979
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,780
They've gone through their undergrad experience.

1980
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,940
I think their goals have shifted from when they were 17.

1981
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,460
They have other things that are going.

1982
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,580
But it does do something really important,

1983
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,420
something very social and very important, right?

1984
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,260
You know this whole thing about,

1985
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,100
don't build the sidewalks, just leave the grass

1986
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,700
and the students or the people will walk

1987
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,380
and you put the sidewalks where they create paths.

1988
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,220
This is kind of a thing.

1989
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,620
That's interesting, yeah.

1990
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,100
Their architects apparently believe

1991
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,780
that's the right way to do things.

1992
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:45,300
The metaphor here is that we created this environment.

1993
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,700
We didn't quite know how to think about the social aspect,

1994
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,140
but we didn't have time to solve all,

1995
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,140
do all the social engineering, right?

1996
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,260
The students did it themselves.

1997
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:58,420
They created these groups, like on Google+,

1998
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,820
they were like 30-something groups created in the first year

1999
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:04,300
because somebody had these Google+,

2000
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,740
and they created these groups

2001
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,460
and they divided up in ways that made sense.

2002
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,340
We live in the same state

2003
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,340
or we're working on the same things

2004
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,620
or we have the same background or whatever,

2005
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,140
and they created these social things.

2006
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:15,660
We sent them t-shirts and we have all these great pictures

2007
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:17,420
of students putting on their t-shirts

2008
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,420
as they travel around the world.

2009
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,380
I climbed to this mountain top,

2010
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,340
I'm putting this t-shirt on, I'm a part of this.

2011
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,180
They were part of them.

2012
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,740
They created the social environment

2013
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,820
on top of the social network and the social media

2014
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:29,460
that existed to create this sense of belonging

2015
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,580
and being a part of something.

2016
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,780
They found a way to do it, right?

2017
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:36,260
And I think they had other,

2018
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,180
it scratched an itch that they had,

2019
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,220
but they had scratched some of that itch

2020
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,580
that might have required to be physically

2021
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,500
in the same place long before, right?

2022
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,300
So I think, yes, it's possible,

2023
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,740
and it's more than possible, it's necessary,

2024
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:54,300
but I don't think it's going to replace the university

2025
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,260
as we know it.

2026
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,700
The university as we know it will change,

2027
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,260
but there's just a lot of power

2028
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,500
and a kind of rite of passage

2029
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,580
and kind of going off to yourself.

2030
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,180
Now, maybe there'll be some other rite of passage

2031
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:06,140
that'll happen that'll drive us somewhere else.

2032
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:11,220
So the university is such a fascinating mess of things.

2033
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:14,740
So just even the faculty position is a fascinating mess.

2034
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,940
Like it doesn't make any sense.

2035
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:18,380
It stabilized itself,

2036
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:22,180
but like why are the world-class researchers

2037
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,300
spending a huge amount of time,

2038
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:28,060
or their time teaching and service?

2039
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,260
Like you're doing like three jobs.

2040
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:35,060
And I mean, it turns out it's maybe an accident of history

2041
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,380
or human evolution, I don't know.

2042
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,540
It seems like the people who are really good at teaching

2043
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,500
are often really good at research.

2044
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,820
There seems to be a parallel there,

2045
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,540
but like it doesn't make any sense

2046
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,540
that you should be doing that.

2047
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,820
At the same time, it also doesn't seem to make sense

2048
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:52,140
that your place where you party

2049
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:56,420
is the same place where you go to learn calculus

2050
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,340
or whatever, but it's a safe space.

2051
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,580
Safe space for everything.

2052
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,420
Yeah, relatively speaking, it's a safe space.

2053
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,340
No, by the way, I feel the need very strongly

2054
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,220
to point out that we are living

2055
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,540
in a very particular weird bubble, right?

2056
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,900
Most people don't go to college.

2057
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,900
And by the way, the ones who do go to college,

2058
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,380
they're not 18 years old, right?

2059
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,540
They're like 25 or something.

2060
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,180
I forget the numbers.

2061
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,980
The places where we've been, where we are,

2062
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,420
they look like whatever we think

2063
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,540
the traditional movie version of universities are,

2064
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,500
but for most people, it's not that way at all.

2065
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,980
By the way, most people who drop out of college,

2066
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,660
it's entirely for financial reasons, right?

2067
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,380
So, you know, we were talking about a particular experience.

2068
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:40,700
And so for that set of people, which is very small,

2069
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,980
but larger than it was a decade or two or three or four,

2070
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,220
certainly, ago, I don't think that will change.

2071
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:50,500
My concern, which I think is kind of implicit

2072
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,140
in some of these questions is that

2073
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,420
somehow we will divide the world up further.

2074
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,020
Into the people who get to have this experience

2075
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,300
and get to have the network and they sort of benefit from it

2076
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,900
and everyone else while increasingly requiring

2077
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,140
that they have more and more credentials

2078
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,900
in order to get a job as a barista, right?

2079
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,980
You got to have a master's degree

2080
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,020
in order to work at Starbucks.

2081
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,700
We're gonna force people to do these things,

2082
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,460
but they're not gonna get to have that experience.

2083
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,820
And there'll be a small group of people who do,

2084
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,700
who will continue to, you know, positive feedback,

2085
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,940
like, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2086
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,220
I worry a lot about that,

2087
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:21,500
which is why for me, and by the way,

2088
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,940
here's an answer to your question about faculty,

2089
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,860
which is why to me that you have to focus on

2090
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,100
access in the mission.

2091
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,220
I think the reason, whether it's good, bad, or strange,

2092
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,780
I mean, I agree, it's strange.

2093
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:32,220
But I think it's useful to have the faculty member,

2094
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,900
particularly at large R1 universities

2095
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,620
where we've all had experiences,

2096
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:41,100
that you tie what they get to do

2097
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,940
and with the fundamental mission of the university

2098
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,100
and let the mission drive.

2099
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,100
What I hear when I talk to faculty is

2100
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,380
they love their PhD students

2101
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,500
because they're creating, they're reproducing,

2102
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,340
basically, right?

2103
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,740
Let's them do their research and multiply.

2104
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:57,380
But they understand that the mission is the undergrads,

2105
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,420
and so they will do it without complaint, mostly,

2106
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,500
because it's a part of the mission and why they're here,

2107
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,180
and they have experiences with it themselves.

2108
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,500
And it was important to get them where they were going.

2109
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,740
The people who tend to get squeezed in that,

2110
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,420
by the way, are the master students, right?

2111
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,260
Who are neither the PhDs who are like us,

2112
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,860
nor the undergrads, we have already bought into the idea

2113
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:16,540
that we have to teach, though.

2114
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,260
That's increasingly changing.

2115
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,100
Anyway, I think tying that mission in really matters,

2116
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,220
and it gives you a way to unify people around

2117
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,140
making it an actual higher calling.

2118
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,140
Education feels like more of a higher calling to me

2119
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,740
than even research.

2120
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,900
Because education, you cannot treat it as a hobby

2121
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,220
if you're going to do it well.

2122
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:38,420
But that's the pushback on this whole system,

2123
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:43,420
is that you should, education, be a full-time job, right?

2124
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:49,060
And almost like research is a distraction from that.

2125
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,340
Although, I think most of our colleagues,

2126
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,340
many of our colleagues would say that research is the job

2127
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,140
and education is the distraction.

2128
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,660
Right, but that's the beautiful dance.

2129
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:01,420
It seems to be that tension in itself seems to work,

2130
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:05,860
seems to bring out the best in the faculty,

2131
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,300
or like the ones I've done.

2132
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,340
But I will point out two things.

2133
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,260
One thing I'm going to point out,

2134
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,740
and the other thing I want Michael to point out,

2135
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,540
because I think Michael is much closer to the,

2136
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,300
to sort of the ideal professor in some sense than I am.

2137
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,660
You're the platonic sense of a professor.

2138
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,900
I don't know what he meant by that,

2139
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,380
but he is a dean, so he has a different experience.

2140
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,260
I'm giving him time to think of the profound thing

2141
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,100
he's gonna say. That's good.

2142
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,580
But let me point this out,

2143
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,020
which is that we have lecturers in the college

2144
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,940
of computing where I am.

2145
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:35,700
There's 10 or 12 of them, depending on your count,

2146
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:39,180
as opposed to the 90 or so tenure track faculty.

2147
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,180
Those 10 lecturers who only teach,

2148
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,900
well, they don't only teach, they also do service.

2149
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,600
Some of them do research as well, but primarily they teach.

2150
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,680
They teach 50%, over 50% of our credit hours,

2151
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,320
and we teach everybody.

2152
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,160
So they're doing not just,

2153
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,360
they're doing more than eight times the work

2154
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,000
of the tenure track faculty,

2155
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,680
just if you're closer to nine or 10.

2156
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,080
And that's including our grad courses, right?

2157
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,160
So they're doing this, they're teaching more,

2158
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
they're touching more than anyone,

2159
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,560
and they're beloved for it.

2160
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,720
So we recently had a survey, we do these alumni,

2161
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,960
everyone does these alumni surveys,

2162
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,320
you hire someone from the outside to do whatever,

2163
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,000
and I was really struck by something.

2164
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,240
I saw all these really cool numbers,

2165
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,320
I'm not gonna talk about it,

2166
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,960
because it's all internal, confidential stuff.

2167
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,200
But one thing I will talk about

2168
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,160
is there was a single question we asked our alum,

2169
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,480
and these are people who graduated,

2170
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,880
born in the 30s and 40s,

2171
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,520
all the way up to people who graduated last week, right?

2172
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,560
Well, last semester.

2173
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,400
Okay, good.

2174
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,360
Time flies.

2175
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,720
Yeah, time flies.

2176
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,440
And it was the question,

2177
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,760
name a single person who had a strong,

2178
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,120
positive impact on you, something like that.

2179
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,400
I think it was special impact?

2180
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,640
Yeah, special impact on you.

2181
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,280
And then, so they got all the answers from people,

2182
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,080
and they created a word cloud.

2183
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,600
Those clear word clouds created by people

2184
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,240
who don't do word clouds for a living,

2185
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,800
because they had one person whose name appeared

2186
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,920
like nine different times, like Phillip, Phil,

2187
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,400
Dr. Phil, you know, but whatever.

2188
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,240
But they got all this.

2189
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,400
And I looked at it, and I noticed something really cool.

2190
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,760
The five people from the college of computing,

2191
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,280
I recognized, were in that cloud.

2192
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,840
And four of them were lecturers,

2193
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,280
the people who teach.

2194
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,360
Two of them, relatively modern.

2195
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,880
Both were chairs of our division of computing instruction.

2196
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,160
One retired, one is gonna retire soon.

2197
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:26,480
And the other two were lecturers I remembered from the 1980s.

2198
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,120
Two of those four actually have-

2199
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,760
Despite the way the fifth person was Charles.

2200
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,600
That's not important.

2201
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,960
The thing is, I don't tell people that.

2202
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,240
But the two of those people are teaching awards

2203
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,080
are named after.

2204
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:36,920
Thank you, Michael.

2205
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,720
Two of those are teaching awards are named after, right?

2206
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,760
So when you ask students, alumni,

2207
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,520
people who are now 60, 70 years old even,

2208
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,360
who touch them?

2209
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,680
They say the dean of students.

2210
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,280
They say the big teachers who taught

2211
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,280
the big introductory classes, they got me into it.

2212
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,320
There's a guy named Richard Barker's on there

2213
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,360
who's known as a great teacher.

2214
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,000
The Phil Adler guy who,

2215
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,080
I probably just said his last name wrong,

2216
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,120
but I know the first name's Phil

2217
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,120
because he kept showing up over and over again.

2218
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:03,960
Famous-

2219
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,800
Adler is what it said.

2220
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,640
Okay, good.

2221
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,800
But different people spelled it differently.

2222
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,920
So he appeared multiple times.

2223
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,760
Right.

2224
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,520
He was a, clearly,

2225
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,040
he was a professor in the business school,

2226
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,840
but when you read about him,

2227
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,680
I went to read about himself,

2228
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,720
I was curious who he was.

2229
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,680
It's all about his teaching

2230
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,080
and the students that he touched, right?

2231
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,320
So whatever it is that we're doing,

2232
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,440
and we think we're doing that's important,

2233
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,360
or why we think the university's function,

2234
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,760
the people who go through it,

2235
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,520
they remember the people who were kind to them,

2236
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,360
the people who taught them something,

2237
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,480
and they do remember it.

2238
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,480
They remember it later.

2239
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,840
I think that's important.

2240
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,200
That's what the mission matters.

2241
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,920
Not to completely lose track of the fundamental problem

2242
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,920
of how do we replace the party aspect of universities.

2243
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,360
Before we go to what makes the Platonic professor,

2244
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,440
do you think,

2245
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,960
what in your sense is the role of MOOCs

2246
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,040
in this whole picture during COVID?

2247
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,200
Are we, should we desperately be clamoring

2248
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,920
to get back on campus?

2249
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,960
Or is this a stable place to be for a little while?

2250
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:09,800
I don't know.

2251
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,640
I know that it's the online teaching experience

2252
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,000
and learning experience has been really rough.

2253
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,320
I think that people find it to be a struggle

2254
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,040
in a way that's not a happy positive struggle.

2255
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,160
That when you got through it,

2256
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,840
you just feel like glad that it's over

2257
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,840
as opposed to I've achieved something.

2258
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,720
So, I worry about that,

2259
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:33,880
but I worry about just even before this happened,

2260
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,400
I worry about lecture teaching

2261
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,760
as how well is that actually really working

2262
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,720
as far as a way to do education,

2263
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,640
as a way to inspire people.

2264
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,120
I mean, all the data that I'm aware of seems to indicate,

2265
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,720
and this kind of fits I think with Charles' story,

2266
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:54,560
is that people respond to connection, right?

2267
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,920
They actually feel,

2268
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,200
if they feel connected to the person teaching the class,

2269
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,720
they're more likely to go along with it.

2270
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,040
They're more able to retain information.

2271
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,600
They're more motivated to be involved in the class

2272
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:10,200
in some way, and that really matters.

2273
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,240
You mean to the human themselves?

2274
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,080
Yeah.

2275
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,200
Can't you do that?

2276
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:18,400
Actually, perhaps more effectively online,

2277
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,280
like you mentioned science communication.

2278
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:23,680
So, I literally, I think,

2279
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,520
learned linear algebra from Gilbert Strang

2280
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,920
by watching MIT OpenCourseWare when I was in drugs.

2281
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,080
And he was a personality,

2282
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,160
he was a bit like a tiny,

2283
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,200
in this tiny little world of math,

2284
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,600
there's a bit of a rock star, right?

2285
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,760
So, you kind of look up to that person.

2286
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,920
Can't that replace the in-person education?

2287
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:45,760
It can help.

2288
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,680
I will point out something.

2289
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,560
I can't share the numbers,

2290
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,040
but we have surveyed our students,

2291
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,480
and even though they have feelings

2292
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,440
about what I would interpret as connection,

2293
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,480
I like that word, in the different modes of classrooms,

2294
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,920
there's no difference between how well

2295
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,640
they think they're learning.

2296
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,760
For them, the thing that makes them unhappy

2297
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,040
is the situation they're in.

2298
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,760
And I think the last lack of connection,

2299
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,640
it's not whether they're learning anything.

2300
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,440
They seem to think they're learning something anyway, right?

2301
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,440
In fact, they seem to think

2302
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,000
they're learning it equally well,

2303
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,720
presumably because the faculty are putting in,

2304
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,040
or the instructors, more generally speaking,

2305
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,920
are putting in the energy and effort

2306
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,160
to try to make certain

2307
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,800
what they've curated can be expressed to them

2308
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,720
in a useful way.

2309
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,840
But the connection is missing,

2310
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,200
and so there's huge differences in what they prefer,

2311
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,040
and as far as I can tell,

2312
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,400
what they prefer is more connection, not less.

2313
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,480
That connection just doesn't have to be physically

2314
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,320
in a classroom.

2315
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,520
I mean, look, I used to teach 348 students

2316
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,840
on my machine learning class on campus.

2317
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:45,680
Do you know why?

2318
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,440
That was the biggest classroom on campus.

2319
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,800
They're sitting in theaters,

2320
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,840
they're sitting in theater seats.

2321
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,400
I'm literally on a stage looking down on them

2322
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,640
and talking to them, right?

2323
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,600
I mean, we're not sitting down

2324
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,360
having a one-on-one conversation,

2325
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,720
reading each other's body language,

2326
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,680
trying to communicate,

2327
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,360
and going, we're not doing any of that.

2328
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,480
So if you're past the third row,

2329
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,760
it might as well be online anyway,

2330
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,280
is the kind of thing that people have said,

2331
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,920
Daphne has actually said some version of this,

2332
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,440
that online starts on the third row,

2333
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,600
or something like that.

2334
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,560
And I think that's not,

2335
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,320
yeah, I like it, I think it captures something important.

2336
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,120
But people still came, by the way.

2337
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,880
Even the people who had access to our material

2338
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,240
would still come to class.

2339
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,480
I mean, there's a certain element

2340
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,600
about looking to the person next to you.

2341
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,320
It's just like their presence there,

2342
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:35,040
their boredom, and like when the parts are boring,

2343
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,040
and their excitement when the parts are exciting,

2344
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,640
like, and sharing in that,

2345
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:43,720
like unspoken kind of, yeah, communication.

2346
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,720
In part, the connection is with the other people in the room.

2347
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,720
Watching the circus on TV alone is not really,

2348
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,480
they've ever been to a movie theater

2349
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,320
and been the only one there at a comedy.

2350
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,240
It's not as funny as when you're in a room

2351
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,120
full of people all laughing.

2352
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,520
Well, you need, maybe you need just another person.

2353
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,680
It's like, as opposed to many.

2354
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,160
Maybe there's some kind of-

2355
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,840
Well, there's different kinds of connection, right?

2356
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,680
And there's different kinds of comedy.

2357
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,560
Well, in the sense that-

2358
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,720
As we're learning today.

2359
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,240
I wasn't sure if that was gonna land,

2360
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:20,920
but just the idea that different jokes,

2361
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,120
I've now done a little bit of stand-up.

2362
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,560
And so different jokes work in different sized crowds too.

2363
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,400
No, it's true.

2364
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,320
Where sometimes if it's a big enough crowd,

2365
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,640
then even a really subtle joke can take root someplace,

2366
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,920
and then that cues other people,

2367
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,720
and it kind of, there's a whole statistics of,

2368
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,240
I did this terrible thing to my brother.

2369
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,440
So when I was really young,

2370
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,800
I decided that my brother was only laughing

2371
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,560
as it comes when I laughed.

2372
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,240
Like he was taking cues from me.

2373
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,160
So I like purposely didn't laugh, just to see if I was right.

2374
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,400
And did you laugh at non-funny things?

2375
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,720
I really wanted to do both sides.

2376
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,000
I did both sides.

2377
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,440
And at the end of it, I told him what I did.

2378
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,040
He was very upset about this.

2379
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,600
And from that day on.

2380
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,040
He lost his sense of humor.

2381
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:03,880
No, no, no, no.

2382
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,720
Well, yes, but from that day on,

2383
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,720
he laughed on his own.

2384
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,280
He stopped taking cues from me.

2385
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,760
So I wanna say that it was a good thing that I did,

2386
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,920
but it was mostly mean.

2387
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,080
You saved that man's life.

2388
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,960
Yes, but it was mostly mean, but it's true though.

2389
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,800
It's true, right?

2390
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,360
That people, I think you're right.

2391
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,880
But okay, so where does that get us?

2392
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,080
That gets us the idea that,

2393
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:26,240
I mean, certainly movie theaters are a thing, right?

2394
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,320
Where people like to be watching together,

2395
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,480
even though the people on the screen

2396
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,080
aren't really co-present with the people in the audience.

2397
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,040
The audience is co-present with themselves.

2398
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,240
By the way, and that point,

2399
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,640
it's an open question that's being raised by this,

2400
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,000
whether movies will no longer be a thing

2401
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,760
because Netflix's audience is growing.

2402
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,200
So that's a very parallel question for education.

2403
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,120
Will movie theaters still be a thing in 2021?

2404
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,160
I think the argument is that there is a feeling

2405
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,080
of being in the crowd that isn't replicated

2406
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,520
by being at home watching it,

2407
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,280
and that there's value in that.

2408
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,120
And then I think just-

2409
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,440
But.

2410
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,280
But.

2411
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,280
It scales better online.

2412
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,880
But I feel like we're having a conversation

2413
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,360
about whether concerts will still exist

2414
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,080
after the invention of the record or the CD

2415
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,040
or wherever it is, right?

2416
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:14,880
They won't.

2417
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,920
You're right, concerts are dead.

2418
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,600
Well, okay, I think the joke is only funny

2419
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,480
if you say it before now.

2420
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,200
Right, yeah, that's true.

2421
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,040
We'll fix it in post.

2422
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:24,880
It's like three years ago.

2423
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,720
It's like, well, no, obviously,

2424
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,560
concerts are still-

2425
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,680
I'll wait to publish this until we have a vaccine.

2426
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,400
No, we'll fix it in post.

2427
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,160
But I think the important thing is-

2428
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,440
Fix the virus first.

2429
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,120
Concert's changed, right?

2430
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,840
Concert's changed.

2431
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,560
First off, movie theaters weren't this way, right?

2432
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,960
In like the 60s and 70s, they weren't like this.

2433
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,040
Like blockbusters were basically what?

2434
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:47,040
What, Jaws and Star Wars created blockbusters, right?

2435
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,880
Before then, there weren't.

2436
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,840
The whole shared summer experience didn't exist

2437
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,320
in our lifetimes, right?

2438
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,800
Certainly, you were well into adulthood

2439
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,960
by the time this was true, right?

2440
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,160
So it's just a very different, it's very different.

2441
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,520
So what we've been experiencing in the last 10 years

2442
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,800
is not like the majority of human history,

2443
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,520
but more importantly, concerts, right?

2444
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,680
Concerts mean something different.

2445
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,680
Most people don't go to concerts anymore.

2446
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,680
Like there's an age where you care about it.

2447
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,520
You sort of stop doing it.

2448
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,240
You keep listening to music or whatever

2449
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,840
and da, da, da, da, da, da.

2450
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:18,320
So I think that's a painful way of saying

2451
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,560
that it will change.

2452
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,880
It was not the same thing as it going away.

2453
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,000
Replace is too strong of a word, but it will change.

2454
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,840
It has to.

2455
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,800
I actually, like to push back, I wonder

2456
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,920
because I think you're probably just throwing

2457
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,200
that you're intuition out.

2458
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,200
Oh, absolutely.

2459
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,280
And it's possible that concerts,

2460
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,640
more people go to concerts now,

2461
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,760
but obviously much more people listen to,

2462
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,120
dumb, than before there was records.

2463
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,680
It's possible to argue that if you look at the data

2464
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,560
that it just expanded the pie

2465
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,000
of what music listening means.

2466
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,040
So it's possible that like universities grow

2467
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,720
in the parallel or the theaters grow,

2468
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,640
but also more people get to watch movies,

2469
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:05,680
more people get to be educated.

2470
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,080
Yeah, I hope that.

2471
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,720
Yeah, and to the extent that we can grow the pie

2472
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,000
and have education be not just something you do

2473
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,440
for four years when you're done with your other education,

2474
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,120
but it'd be a more lifelong thing,

2475
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,640
that would have tremendous benefits,

2476
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,320
especially as the economy and the world change rapidly.

2477
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,200
Like people need opportunities to stay abreast

2478
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,920
of these changes.

2479
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,520
And so, I don't know, that's all part of the ecosystem.

2480
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,360
It's all to the good.

2481
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,920
I mean, you know, I'm not gonna have an argument

2482
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,320
about whether we lost fidelity when we went

2483
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,040
from laser discs to DVDs or record players to CDs.

2484
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,600
I mean, I'm willing to grant that that is true,

2485
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,600
but convenience matters and the ability to do something

2486
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,760
that you couldn't do otherwise

2487
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,800
because that convenience matters.

2488
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,160
And you can tell me I'm only getting 90% of the experience,

2489
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,760
but I'm getting the experience.

2490
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,120
I wasn't getting it before or wasn't lasting as long

2491
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:00,960
or it wasn't as easy.

2492
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,640
I mean, this just seems straightforward to me.

2493
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,520
It's gonna, it's going to change.

2494
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,320
It is for the good that more people get access.

2495
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,520
And it is our job to do two separate things.

2496
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,480
One, to educate them and make access available.

2497
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,720
That's our mission.

2498
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,080
But also for very simple selfish reasons,

2499
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,320
we need to figure out how to do it better

2500
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,160
so that we individually stay in business.

2501
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,880
We can do both of those things at the same time.

2502
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,400
They are not in, they may be intention,

2503
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,760
but they are not mutually exclusive.

2504
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:32,100
So you've educated some scary number of people.

2505
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:37,420
So you've seen a lot of people succeed,

2506
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,620
find their path through life.

2507
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:44,260
Is there a device that you can give to a young person today

2508
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:49,020
about computer science education,

2509
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:53,380
about education in general, about life,

2510
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:58,380
about whatever the journey that one takes in there,

2511
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:02,620
maybe in their teens, in their early 20s,

2512
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:05,100
sort of in those underground years,

2513
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:08,140
as you try to go through the essential process

2514
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,780
of partying and not go into classes.

2515
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:12,980
And yet somehow try to get a degree.

2516
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:16,460
If you get to the point where you're far enough up

2517
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,900
in the hierarchy of needs

2518
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:21,900
that you can actually make decisions like this,

2519
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,500
then find the thing that you're passionate about

2520
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,740
and pursue it.

2521
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,860
And sometimes it's the thing that drives your life

2522
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,100
and sometimes it's secondary.

2523
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,660
And you'll do other things because you've got to eat, right?

2524
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:32,860
You've got to family, you've got to feed,

2525
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:34,540
you've got people you have to help or whatever, right?

2526
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,420
And I understand that and it's not easy for everyone,

2527
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:40,980
but always take a moment or two to pursue the things

2528
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:44,580
that you love, the things that bring passion

2529
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:45,420
and happiness to your life.

2530
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:46,820
And if you don't, I know that sounds corny,

2531
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,020
but I genuinely believe it.

2532
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,900
And if you don't have such a thing,

2533
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,420
then you're lying to yourself.

2534
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,500
You have such a thing, you just have to find it.

2535
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,020
And it's okay if it takes you a long time to get there.

2536
01:37:56,020 --> 01:38:00,380
Rodney Dangerfield became a comedian in his 50s, I think.

2537
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:01,820
It certainly wasn't his 20s.

2538
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:03,700
And lots of people failed for a very long time

2539
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,700
before getting to where they were going.

2540
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,580
I try to have hope.

2541
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,780
And it wasn't obvious.

2542
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:13,180
I mean, you and I talked about the experience

2543
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:17,500
that I had a long time ago with a particular police officer.

2544
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,940
Was it my first one and was it my last one?

2545
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:24,180
But in my view, I wasn't supposed to be here after that

2546
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,940
and I'm here, so it's all gravy.

2547
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:29,020
So you might as well go ahead and grab life as you can

2548
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:29,860
because of that.

2549
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,260
That's sort of how I see it.

2550
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:34,540
While recognizing, again, the delusion matters, right?

2551
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:35,940
Allow yourself to be deluded.

2552
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:38,100
Allow yourself to believe that it's all gonna work out.

2553
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,740
Just don't be so deluded that you missed the obvious.

2554
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,500
And you're gonna be fine.

2555
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,900
It's gonna be there.

2556
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,740
It's gonna be there.

2557
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,660
It's gonna work out.

2558
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,020
What do you think?

2559
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:50,140
I like to say, choose your parents wisely

2560
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,100
because that has a big impact on your life.

2561
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,580
It's different.

2562
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:57,420
Yeah, I mean, there's a whole lot of things

2563
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:58,540
that you don't get to pick.

2564
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:02,980
And whether you get to have one kind of life

2565
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:05,140
or a different kind of life can depend a lot

2566
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,900
on things out of your control.

2567
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,020
But I really do believe in the passion and excitement thing.

2568
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:11,980
I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day

2569
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:16,980
and essentially what came out is that computer science

2570
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,140
is really popular right now.

2571
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,900
And I get to be a professor teaching something

2572
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,860
that's very attractive to people.

2573
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:33,540
And she was like trying to give me some appreciation

2574
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,700
for how foresightful I was for choosing this line of work

2575
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:39,980
as if somehow I knew that this is what was gonna happen

2576
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:40,940
in 2020.

2577
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,020
But that's not how it went for me at all.

2578
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,540
Like I studied computer science

2579
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,900
because I was just interested.

2580
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,620
It was just so interesting to me.

2581
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:54,580
I didn't think it would be particularly lucrative.

2582
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,460
And I've done everything I can to keep it

2583
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,380
as un-lucrative as possible.

2584
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,380
Some of my friends and colleagues have not done that.

2585
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:07,900
And I pride myself on my ability to remain un-rich.

2586
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:12,900
But I do believe that, like I'm glad,

2587
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,260
I mean, I'm glad that it worked out for me.

2588
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,100
It could have been like,

2589
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,940
oh, what I was really fascinated by

2590
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,300
is this particular kind of engraving

2591
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,660
that nobody cares about.

2592
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:22,780
But so I got lucky and the thing that I cared about

2593
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:24,140
happened to be a thing that other people

2594
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,340
eventually cared about.

2595
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,060
But I don't think I would have had a fun time

2596
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:29,180
choosing anything else.

2597
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:31,860
Like this was the thing that kept me interested

2598
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:32,700
and engaged.

2599
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,700
Well, one thing that people tell me,

2600
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:38,220
especially around early on the graduate

2601
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:41,580
and the internet is part of the problem here

2602
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,860
is they say they're passionate about so many things.

2603
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:46,540
How do I choose a thing?

2604
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:50,300
Which is a harder thing for me to know what to do with.

2605
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,380
Is there any?

2606
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:54,460
I mean, don't you know, which, I mean, you know, look.

2607
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,740
A long time ago, I walked down a hallway

2608
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,020
and I took a left turn.

2609
01:40:59,020 --> 01:40:59,860
Yeah.

2610
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,340
I could have taken a right turn.

2611
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:03,820
And my world could be better or it could be worse.

2612
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,660
I have no idea.

2613
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:05,500
I have no way of knowing.

2614
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,100
Is there anything about this particular hallway

2615
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,100
that's relevant or are you just in general choices?

2616
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:09,940
Yeah, you were on the left.

2617
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,900
It sounds like you regret not taking the right turn.

2618
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:12,740
Oh, no, not at all.

2619
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:13,940
Well, you brought it up.

2620
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,460
Well, because it was a turn there.

2621
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,100
On the left was Michael Liman's office, right?

2622
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,100
I mean, these sorts of things happen, right?

2623
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:20,940
But here's the thing.

2624
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:23,180
On the right, by the way, there was just a blank wall.

2625
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,500
It wasn't a huge choice.

2626
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,340
It would have really hurt.

2627
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,260
He tried first.

2628
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:27,660
No, but it's true, right?

2629
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,860
That, you know, I think about Ron Brockman, right?

2630
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,340
I went, I took a trip I wasn't supposed to take

2631
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:38,100
and I ended up talking to Ron about this

2632
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,740
and I ended up going down this entire path

2633
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,820
that allowed me to, I think, get tenure.

2634
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:45,820
But by the way, I decided to say yes to something

2635
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,740
that didn't make any sense

2636
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:48,260
and I went down this educational path.

2637
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,500
But it would have been, you know, who knows, right?

2638
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,140
Maybe if I hadn't done that,

2639
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:54,300
I would be a billionaire right now.

2640
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:55,300
I'd be Elon Musk.

2641
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,020
My life could be so much better.

2642
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,540
My life could also be so much worse.

2643
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,860
You know, you just gotta feel

2644
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:03,020
that sometimes you have decisions you're gonna make.

2645
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:04,220
You cannot know what's gonna do.

2646
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,580
You should think about it, right?

2647
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:07,540
Some things are clearly smarter than other things.

2648
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:09,580
You gotta play the odds a little bit.

2649
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,580
But in the end, if you've got multiple choices

2650
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,820
or lots of things you think you might love,

2651
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,420
go with the thing that you actually love,

2652
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,900
the thing that jumps out at you

2653
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:17,260
and sort of pursue it for a little while.

2654
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:18,180
The worst thing that'll happen

2655
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,060
is you took a left turn instead of a right turn

2656
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:21,660
and you ended up merely happy.

2657
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:23,580
Beautiful.

2658
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:27,780
So accepting, so taking the step and just accepting,

2659
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,460
accepting that that don't like question,

2660
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,300
question the choice.

2661
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:33,100
I like to think that life is long

2662
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:36,580
and there's time to actually pursue.

2663
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,500
Every once in a while,

2664
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:41,140
you have to put on a leather suit

2665
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:43,060
and make a thriller video.

2666
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,340
Every once in a while.

2667
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:46,620
If I ever get a chance to put on a leather suit,

2668
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:47,460
I'm doing it.

2669
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,140
Yeah.

2670
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:51,020
I was told that you actually danced,

2671
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:53,620
but that part was edited out.

2672
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,460
I don't dance.

2673
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:59,220
There was a thing where we did do the zombie thing.

2674
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,740
We did do the zombie thing.

2675
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:02,020
That wasn't edited out.

2676
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,300
It just wasn't put into the final thing.

2677
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:06,380
I'm quite happy.

2678
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,540
There was a reason for that too, right?

2679
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,540
Like I wasn't wearing something right.

2680
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:10,380
There was a reason for that.

2681
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,420
No leather suit.

2682
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,260
Is that what it was?

2683
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,100
I can't remember.

2684
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:16,100
Anyway, the right thing happened.

2685
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:16,940
Exactly.

2686
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,660
You took the left turn and ended up being the right thing.

2687
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:23,180
So a lot of people ask me that are a little bit

2688
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:26,540
tangential to the programming, the computing world,

2689
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,300
and they're interested to learn programming,

2690
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,380
like all kinds of disciplines that are outside

2691
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:33,260
of the particular discipline of computer science.

2692
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:36,140
What advice do you have for people

2693
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:38,100
that want to learn how to program

2694
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:43,140
or want to either taste this little skill set

2695
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:47,300
or discipline or try to see if it can be used somehow

2696
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,940
in their own life?

2697
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,540
What stage of life are they in?

2698
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:55,100
It feels, well, one of the magic things about the internet

2699
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,180
of the people that write me is I don't know.

2700
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:00,060
Cause my answer is different for,

2701
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,540
my daughter is taking AP computer science right now.

2702
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,620
Hi, Johnny.

2703
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:06,380
She's amazing in doing amazing things

2704
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:08,100
and my son's beginning to get interested

2705
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,340
and I'll be really curious where he takes it.

2706
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,460
I think his mind actually works very well

2707
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:14,740
for this sort of thing and she's doing great.

2708
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,180
But one of the things I have to tell her all the time

2709
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:19,940
is she points, well, I want to make a rhythm game.

2710
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,380
So I want to go for two weeks and then build a rhythm game,

2711
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:26,820
show me how to build a rhythm game and start small,

2712
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,980
learn the building blocks and how to take the time,

2713
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:31,180
have patience, eventually you'll build a rhythm game.

2714
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:34,180
I was in grad school when I suddenly woke up one day

2715
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:37,260
over the Royal East and I thought, wait a minute,

2716
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,100
I'm a computer scientist.

2717
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,820
I should be able to write Pac-Man in an afternoon.

2718
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:42,140
And I did, not with great graphics.

2719
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,180
It was actually a very cool game.

2720
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:45,180
I had to figure out how the ghost moved and everything.

2721
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:48,900
And I did it in an afternoon and Pascal on an old Apple 2GS.

2722
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:52,500
But if I had started out trying to build Pac-Man,

2723
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:55,140
I think it probably would have ended very poorly for me.

2724
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:58,220
Luckily back then there weren't these magical devices

2725
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:00,260
we call phones and software everywhere

2726
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,460
to give me this illusion that I could create something

2727
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:05,820
by myself from the basics inside of a weekend like that.

2728
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:09,580
I mean, that was a culmination of years and years and years

2729
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:12,220
before I decided I should be able to write this and I could.

2730
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:16,980
So my advice if you're early on is you've got the internet.

2731
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,900
There are lots of people there to give you the information.

2732
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,620
Find someone who cares about this.

2733
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:22,700
Remember they've been doing it for a very long time.

2734
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,820
Take it slow, learn the little pieces,

2735
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:27,180
get excited about it and then keep the big projects

2736
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,580
you want to build in mind.

2737
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,700
You'll get there soon enough

2738
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:32,860
because as a wise man once said, life is long.

2739
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:35,700
Sometimes it doesn't seem that long, but it is long

2740
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:39,100
and you'll have enough time to build it all out.

2741
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,100
All the information is out there, but start small.

2742
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,740
Generative and object numbers.

2743
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:48,700
That's not exciting, but it'll get you a programming language.

2744
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,980
Well, there's only one programming language, it's Lisp.

2745
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:53,580
But if you have to pick a programming language,

2746
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,500
I guess in today's, what would I do?

2747
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,820
I guess I'd do-

2748
01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:00,580
Python is basically Lisp, but with better syntax.

2749
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:01,420
Blast for me.

2750
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:03,780
Yeah, with C syntax, how about that?

2751
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,300
So you're going to argue that C syntax

2752
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,100
is better than anything?

2753
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:10,220
Anyway, I'm going to answer Python despite what he said.

2754
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:12,540
Tell your story about somebody's dissertation

2755
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,540
that had a Lisp program in it.

2756
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,380
It was so funny.

2757
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,900
This is Dave's, Dave's dissertation was like

2758
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:20,140
Dave McAllister who was a professor at MIT for a while

2759
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:24,740
and then he came to our lab and now he's at technology,

2760
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:26,380
technicals to Chicago.

2761
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,940
A brilliant guy, such an interesting guy.

2762
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:33,940
Anyway, his thesis, it was a theorem prover

2763
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:38,460
and he decided to have as an appendix his actual code,

2764
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,700
which of course was already in Lisp

2765
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,940
because of course it was.

2766
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:43,820
And like the last 20 pages are just right parentheses.

2767
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:46,460
It's just wonderful.

2768
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,460
It's like, that's programming right there.

2769
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:51,060
Just pages upon pages of right parentheses.

2770
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:52,900
Anyway, Lisp is the only real language,

2771
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,460
but I understand that that's not necessarily

2772
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,020
the place where you start.

2773
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:57,740
Python is just fine.

2774
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:59,060
Python is good.

2775
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:01,380
If you're of a certain age, if you're really young

2776
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:03,220
and trying to figure out graphical languages

2777
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:04,940
that let you kind of see how the thing works

2778
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:06,500
and that's fine too, they're all fine.

2779
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,860
It almost doesn't matter, but there are people

2780
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,940
who spend a lot of time thinking about

2781
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:13,100
how to build languages that get people in.

2782
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,860
The questions are you trying to get in

2783
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:17,340
and figure out what it is or do you already know

2784
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,860
what you want and that's why I asked you

2785
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:19,940
what stage of life people are in

2786
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,260
because if you're different stages of life,

2787
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:23,700
you would attack it differently.

2788
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,420
The answer to that question of which language

2789
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:27,980
keeps changing, I mean, there's some value

2790
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:32,780
to exploring a lot of people write to me about Julia.

2791
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:35,300
There's these like more modern languages

2792
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:38,620
that keep being invented, Rust and Kotlin.

2793
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:42,340
There's stuff that, for people who love

2794
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,340
functional languages like Lisp,

2795
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,940
apparently there's echoes of that,

2796
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:49,500
but much better in the modern languages.

2797
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,380
It's worthwhile to, especially when you're learning languages,

2798
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:55,380
it feels like it's okay to try one

2799
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,900
that's not like the popular one.

2800
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,100
Oh yeah, but you want something simple.

2801
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:02,220
And I think you get that way of thinking

2802
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,540
almost no matter what language

2803
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:07,980
and if you push far enough, like it can be assembly language,

2804
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:09,580
but you need to push pretty far

2805
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:11,540
before you start to hit the really deep concepts

2806
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:13,420
that you would get sooner in other languages.

2807
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:16,660
But like, I don't know, computation is kind of computation

2808
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:19,540
is kind of touring equivalent is kind of computation.

2809
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,260
And so it matters how you express things,

2810
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:24,500
but you have to build out that mental structure

2811
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,540
in your mind.

2812
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:28,860
And I don't think it's super matters which language.

2813
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:30,020
I mean, it matters a little

2814
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:31,740
because some things are just at the wrong level

2815
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:32,580
of abstraction.

2816
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,900
I think assembly is at the wrong level abstract

2817
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,020
for someone coming in new.

2818
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:37,340
I think that if you start it from-

2819
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,500
For someone coming in new.

2820
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:42,700
Yes, for frameworks, big frameworks are quite a bit.

2821
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:43,740
You know, you got to get to the point

2822
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:45,180
where I want to learn any language means

2823
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:46,260
I just pick up a reference book

2824
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,580
and I think of a project

2825
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,340
and I go through it in a weekend.

2826
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,380
Right, you got to get there.

2827
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,420
You're right though.

2828
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,780
The languages that are designed for that

2829
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:54,980
or it almost doesn't matter.

2830
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:57,900
Pick the ones that people have built tutorials

2831
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,140
and infrastructure around to help you

2832
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:00,900
get kind of kind of ease into it.

2833
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:01,740
Cause it's hard.

2834
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,500
I mean, I did this little experiment with.

2835
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:08,620
I was teaching intro to CS in the summer as a favor.

2836
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:11,980
Which is, anyway.

2837
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:15,260
I was teaching intro to CS as a favor.

2838
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:17,060
And it was very funny cause I'd go in every single time

2839
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:18,860
and I would think to myself,

2840
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:21,580
how am I possibly going to fill up an hour and a half

2841
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:23,180
talking about for loops, right?

2842
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,300
And there wasn't enough time.

2843
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,700
Took me a while to realize this, right?

2844
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:27,940
There are only three things, right?

2845
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:29,140
There's reading from a variable,

2846
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:31,620
writing to a variable and conditional branching.

2847
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:34,140
Everything else is syntactic sugar, right?

2848
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,140
The syntactic sugar matters, but that's it.

2849
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:38,980
And when I say that's it, I don't mean it's simple.

2850
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,180
I mean, it's hard.

2851
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:43,540
Like conditional branching, loops, variable.

2852
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:45,260
Those are really hard concepts.

2853
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:47,300
So you shouldn't be discouraged by this.

2854
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,780
Here's the simple experiment I'm going to ask you

2855
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:50,780
a question now, you ready?

2856
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:51,740
X equals three.

2857
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:52,580
Okay.

2858
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:55,420
Y equals four.

2859
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,140
What is X?

2860
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:57,980
Three.

2861
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:59,100
What is Y?

2862
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,940
Four.

2863
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:00,780
Y equals S.

2864
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,620
I'm going to mess this up.

2865
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:02,660
Oh, it's easier.

2866
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,060
Y equals X.

2867
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:04,900
Y equals X.

2868
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,620
What is Y?

2869
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:08,740
Three.

2870
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,580
That's right.

2871
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,340
X equals seven.

2872
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:12,580
What is Y?

2873
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,940
That's one of the trickiest things to get

2874
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,500
for programmers that there's a memory

2875
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:19,300
and the variables are pointing

2876
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:21,100
to a particular thing in memory.

2877
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,340
And sometimes the languages hide that from you

2878
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:24,420
and they bring it closer

2879
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:26,700
to the way you think mathematics works.

2880
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:27,540
Right.

2881
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,260
So in fact, Mark Gustav, who worries

2882
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:30,140
about these sorts of things

2883
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:32,540
or used to worry about these sorts of things anyway,

2884
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:35,980
had this kind of belief that actually people

2885
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,020
when they see these statements,

2886
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:39,620
X equals something Y equals something Y equals X,

2887
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:42,980
that you have now made a mathematical statement

2888
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,300
that Y and X are the same.

2889
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:46,780
Which you can if you just put like

2890
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,140
an anchor in front of it.

2891
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:49,940
Yes, but people, that's not what you're doing.

2892
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:50,780
Yeah.

2893
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:51,620
Right.

2894
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:54,100
I thought, and I kind of asked the question

2895
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,580
and I think had some evidence for this.

2896
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:56,660
I'm sorry, they study.

2897
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:59,300
Is that most of the people who didn't know the answer

2898
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,380
weren't sure about the answer.

2899
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:01,700
They had used spreadsheets.

2900
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:08,540
And so it's by reference or by name really, right?

2901
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:13,380
And so depending upon what you think they are,

2902
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,820
you get completely different answers.

2903
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:17,940
The fact that I could go or one could go

2904
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,180
two thirds of the way through a semester

2905
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,620
and people still hadn't figured out in their heads

2906
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:25,180
when you say Y equals X, what that meant,

2907
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:27,180
tells you it's actually hard

2908
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:29,180
because all those answers are possible.

2909
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:30,100
And in fact, when you said,

2910
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,900
oh, if you just put an ampersand in front of it,

2911
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,740
I mean, that doesn't make any sense for an intro class.

2912
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:34,780
And of course, a lot of language

2913
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:36,300
don't even give you the ability to think about it

2914
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:37,380
in terms of ampersand.

2915
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:38,980
Do we want to have a 45 minute discussion

2916
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:42,380
about the difference between equal EQ and equal in Lisp?

2917
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:43,220
Yeah.

2918
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:44,060
I know you do.

2919
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:47,300
But you know, you could do that.

2920
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,180
It's just actually really hard stuff.

2921
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:52,380
So you shouldn't be, it's not too hard, we all do it,

2922
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,940
but you shouldn't be discouraged.

2923
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,340
It's why you should start small

2924
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:56,620
so that you can figure out these things

2925
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,380
so you have the right model in your head

2926
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:59,980
so that when you write the language,

2927
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:02,020
you can execute it and build the machine

2928
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:03,260
that you want to build, right?

2929
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,180
Yeah, the funny thing about programming

2930
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:09,100
on those very basic things is the very basics

2931
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,140
are not often made explicit,

2932
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:13,900
which is actually what drives everybody away

2933
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:15,300
from basically any discipline,

2934
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,020
but programming is just another one.

2935
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,340
Like even a simpler version of the equal sign

2936
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:23,740
that I kind of forget is in mathematics,

2937
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:25,460
equals is not assignment.

2938
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:26,500
Yeah.

2939
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:30,260
Like, I think basically every single programming language

2940
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:35,140
with just a few handful of exceptions equals is assignment.

2941
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:38,820
You have some other operator for equality.

2942
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:42,540
And you know, even that, like everyone kind of knows it.

2943
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:45,020
Once you started doing it,

2944
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:47,140
but like you need to say that explicitly

2945
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:50,980
or you just realize it like yourself.

2946
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:53,220
Otherwise you might be stuck for,

2947
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:54,660
you said like half a semester,

2948
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:57,180
you could be stuck for quite a long time.

2949
01:52:57,180 --> 01:53:02,060
And I think also part of the programming is being okay

2950
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:04,500
in that state of confusion for a while.

2951
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,740
It's to the debugging point.

2952
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:09,820
It's like, I just wrote two lines of code.

2953
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,020
Why doesn't this work?

2954
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:13,420
And staring at that for like hours

2955
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:15,860
and trying to figure out,

2956
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:17,020
and then every once in a while,

2957
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,540
you just have to restart your computer

2958
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,620
and everything works again.

2959
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:24,260
And then you just kind of stare into the void

2960
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:26,660
with the tears slowly rolling down your eye.

2961
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:28,260
By the way, the fact that they didn't get this

2962
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,100
actually had no impact on,

2963
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,460
I mean, they were still able to redo their assignments.

2964
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:35,140
Because it turns out their misunderstanding

2965
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:37,660
wasn't being revealed to them

2966
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:40,380
by the problems that we were giving them.

2967
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:44,380
I wrote a program a long time ago,

2968
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:46,340
actually for my master's thesis,

2969
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:49,380
and in C++ I think, or C, I guess it was C.

2970
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:51,740
And it was all memory management and terrible.

2971
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:55,420
And it wouldn't work for a while.

2972
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,500
And it was some kind of,

2973
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,660
it was clear to me that it was overwriting memory.

2974
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:00,980
And I just couldn't,

2975
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:03,340
I was like, look, I got a paper done, time for this.

2976
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:06,540
So I basically declared a variable

2977
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:10,140
at the front in the main that was like 400K,

2978
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:12,500
just an array, and it worked.

2979
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:14,380
Because wherever I was scribbling over memory,

2980
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:17,180
it would scribble into that space and it didn't matter.

2981
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:19,700
And so I never figured out what the bug was,

2982
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,860
but I did create something to sort of deal with it.

2983
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:22,780
To work around it.

2984
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,660
And it, you know, that's crazy, that's crazy.

2985
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:27,300
It was okay, because that's what I wanted.

2986
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,380
But I knew enough about memory management to go,

2987
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,940
you know, management to go, you know,

2988
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:32,260
I'm just gonna create an empty array here

2989
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:34,820
and hope that that deals with the scribbling memory problem.

2990
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:37,020
And it did, that takes a long time to figure out.

2991
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,580
And by the way, the language you first learned

2992
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:39,820
probably does garbage collection anyway,

2993
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:41,100
so you're not even gonna come across,

2994
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:43,540
you're not gonna come across that problem.

2995
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:46,060
So we talked about the Minsky idea

2996
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:49,620
of hating everything you do and hating yourself.

2997
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:52,660
So let's end on a question

2998
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:54,780
that's gonna make both of you very uncomfortable.

2999
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:55,620
Okay.

3000
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:58,020
Which is what is your, Charles,

3001
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:01,900
what's your favorite thing that you're grateful for

3002
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:05,300
about Michael and Michael?

3003
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:06,700
What is your favorite thing

3004
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,700
that you're grateful for about Charles?

3005
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:12,140
Well, that answer is actually quite easy.

3006
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:12,980
His friendship.

3007
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,820
He stole the easy answer.

3008
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,500
Yeah, I can tell you what I hate about Charles.

3009
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,500
He steals my good answers.

3010
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,140
The thing I like most about Charles,

3011
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:25,140
he sees the world in a similar enough but different way

3012
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:28,900
that it's sort of like having another life.

3013
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:31,460
It's sort of like I get to experience things

3014
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,940
that I wouldn't otherwise get to experience

3015
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:36,060
because I would not naturally gravitate to them that way.

3016
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:39,100
And so he just shows me a whole other world.

3017
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:39,980
That's awesome.

3018
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:44,100
Yeah, the inner product is not zero for sure.

3019
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,540
It's not quite one, 0.7 maybe.

3020
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:49,340
Just enough that you can learn.

3021
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:53,060
Just enough that you can learn.

3022
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:54,380
That's the definition of friendship.

3023
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,740
The inner product is 0.7.

3024
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:56,700
Yeah, I think so.

3025
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,140
That's the answer to life really.

3026
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:59,380
Charles sometimes believes in me

3027
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:01,060
when I have not believed in me.

3028
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:04,380
He also sometimes works as an outboard confidence

3029
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:08,780
that he has so much, so much confidence and self,

3030
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:11,380
I don't know, comfortableness.

3031
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,020
Okay, let's go with that.

3032
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:16,140
That I feel better a little bit.

3033
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:17,700
If he thinks I'm okay,

3034
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:20,260
then maybe I'm not as bad as I think I am.

3035
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:23,260
At the end of the day, luck favors the Charles.

3036
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:26,740
It's a huge honor to talk with you.

3037
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:29,340
Thank you so much for taking this time,

3038
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,740
wasting your time with me.

3039
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:32,180
It was an awesome conversation.

3040
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:35,260
You guys are an inspiration to a huge number of people

3041
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,260
and to me, so really enjoyed this.

3042
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:38,100
Thanks for talking to me.

3043
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:39,100
Thank you so much.

3044
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,460
And by the way, if luck favors the Charles,

3045
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,420
then it's certainly the case

3046
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:43,860
that I've been very lucky to tell you.

3047
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:45,140
I'm gonna end that part out.

3048
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:45,980
Yeah.

3049
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:49,380
