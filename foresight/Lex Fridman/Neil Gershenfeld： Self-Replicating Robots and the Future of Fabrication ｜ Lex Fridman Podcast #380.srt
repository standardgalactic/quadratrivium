1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
The ribosome, who I mentioned a little while back,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,360
can make an elephant one molecule at a time.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,200
Ribosomes are slow.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,240
They run at about one molecule a second.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,480
But ribosomes make ribosomes.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,520
So you have trillions of them, and that makes an elephant.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,640
In the same way, these little assembly robots,

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm describing, can make giant structures at heart

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,240
because the robot can make the robot.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,760
So more recently, two of my students, Amira and Miana,

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,200
had a nature communication paper showing

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,760
how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,520
so the robots can make the robot,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,520
The following is a conversation with Neil Gershenfeld,

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,720
the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms,

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,880
an amazing laboratory that is breaking down boundaries

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,560
between the digital and physical worlds,

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,880
fabricating objects and machines at all scales of reality,

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,920
including robots and automata

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,240
that can build copies of themselves

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,600
and self-assemble into complex structures.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
His work inspires millions across the world

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,240
as part of the maker movement to build cool stuff,

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,240
to create the very act that makes life so beautiful and fun.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,880
This is a Lex Friedman podcast.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,000
in the description.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,520
And now, dear friends, here's Neil Gershenfeld.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,880
You have spent your life working at the boundary

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,200
between bits and atoms, so the digital and the physical.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,960
What have you learned about engineering

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,240
and about nature of reality from working at this divide,

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,040
trying to bridge this divide?

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,760
I learned why Van Neumann and Turing

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,260
made fundamental mistakes.

37
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,780
I learned the secret of life.

38
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,180
Yeah.

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,100
I learned how to solve many of the world's most important

40
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,300
problems, which all sound presumptuous,

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,460
but all of those are things I learned at that boundary.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,700
Okay, so Turing and Van Neumann, let's start there.

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,820
Some of the most impactful, important humans

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,620
who have ever lived in computing, why were they wrong?

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,220
So, I worked with Andy Gleason,

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,740
who is Turing's counterpart.

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,140
So, just for background, if anybody doesn't know,

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,140
Turing is credited with the modern architecture

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,900
of computing, among many other things.

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,380
Andy Gleason was his US counterpart.

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,660
And you might not have heard of Andy Gleason,

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,940
but you might have heard of the Hilbert problems.

53
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,380
And Andy Gleason solved the fifth one.

54
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,460
So, he was a really notable mathematician.

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,340
During the war, he was Turing's counterpart.

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,980
Then Van Neumann is credited with the modern architecture

57
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,780
of computing, and one of his students was Marvin Minsky.

58
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,140
So, I could ask Marvin what Johnny was thinking,

59
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,940
and I could ask Andy what Alan was thinking.

60
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,300
And what came out from that,

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,060
what I came to appreciate as background,

62
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,540
I never understood the difference between computer science

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,900
and physical science.

64
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,900
But Turing's machine, that's the foundation

65
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,180
of modern computing, has a simple physics mistake,

66
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,020
which is the head is distinct from the tape.

67
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,860
So, in the Turing machine, there's a head

68
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,540
that programmatically moves and reads and writes a tape.

69
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,180
The head is distinct from the tape,

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,060
which means persistence of information

71
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,140
is separate from interaction with information.

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,140
Then Van Neumann wrote deeply and beautifully

73
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,700
about many things, but not computing.

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,780
He wrote a horrible memo called the first draft

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,660
of a report on the EDVAC,

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,980
which is how you program a very early computer.

77
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,060
In it, he essentially roughly took Turing's architecture

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,620
and built it into a machine.

79
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,580
So, the legacy of that is the computer somebody's using

80
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,900
to watch this is spending much of its effort

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,620
moving information from storage transistors

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,380
to processing transistors,

83
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,060
even though they have the same computational complexity.

84
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,460
So, in computer science, when you learn about computing,

85
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,900
there's a ridiculous taxonomy

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,100
of about a hundred different models of computation.

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,860
But they're all fictions.

88
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,340
In physics, a patch of space occupies space.

89
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,420
It stores state, it takes time to transit,

90
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,780
and you can interact.

91
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,140
That is the only model of computation that's physical.

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,300
Everything else is a fiction.

93
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,820
So, I really came to appreciate that a few years back

94
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,460
when I did a keynote for the annual meeting

95
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,500
of the supercomputer industry,

96
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
and then went into the halls and spent time

97
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
with the supercomputer builders,

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,580
and came to appreciate,

99
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,020
oh, let's see, if you're familiar with the movie,

100
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,140
The Metropolis, people would frolic upstairs in the gardens,

101
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,540
and down in the basement, people would move levers.

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,140
And that's how computing exists today,

103
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,740
that we pretend software is not physical.

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,620
It's separate from hardware.

105
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,020
And the whole canon of computer science

106
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,700
is based on this fiction

107
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,580
that bits aren't constrained by atoms,

108
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,700
but all sorts of scaling issues in computing

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,740
come from that boundary,

110
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,780
but all sorts of opportunities come from that boundary.

111
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,740
And so, you can trace it all the way back

112
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,060
to Turing's machine making this mistake

113
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,220
between the head and the tape.

114
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Van Neumann, he never called it Van Neumann's architecture.

115
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,180
He wrote about it in this dreadful memo,

116
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,260
and then he wrote beautifully about

117
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,900
other things we'll talk about.

118
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,500
Now, to end a long answer, Turing and Van Neumann

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,140
both knew this.

120
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,900
So all of the canon of computer scientists credits them

121
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,300
for what was never meant to be a computer architecture.

122
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Both Turing and Van Neumann ended their life

123
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,300
studying exactly how software becomes hardware.

124
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,300
So Van Neumann studied self-reproducing automata,

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,420
how a machine communicates its own construction.

126
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,580
A Turing studied morphogenesis,

127
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,340
how genes give rise to form.

128
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,140
They ended their life studying the embodiment of computation,

129
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,140
something that's been forgotten by the canon of computing,

130
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,900
but developed sort of off to the sides

131
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,940
by a really interesting lineage.

132
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,260
So there's no distinction between the head and the tape,

133
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,940
between the computer and the computation.

134
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,500
It is all computation.

135
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,860
Right, so I never understood the difference

136
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,540
between computer science and physical science.

137
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,060
And working at that boundary helped lead to things

138
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,100
like my lab was part of doing

139
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,780
with a number of interesting collaborators,

140
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,580
the First Fest or the classical quantum computations.

141
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,340
We were part of a collaboration creating

142
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,900
the minimal synthetic organism

143
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,740
where you design life in a computer.

144
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,500
Those both involve domains

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,420
where you just can't separate hardware from software.

146
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,180
The embodiment of computation is embodied

147
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,900
in these really profound ways.

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,860
So the first quantum computations,

149
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,540
synthetic life, so in the space of biology,

150
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,740
the space of physics at the lowest level

151
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,740
and space of biology at the lowest level.

152
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,260
So let's talk about CBA, Center of Bits and Atoms.

153
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,940
What's the origin story of this MIT, legendary MIT center

154
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,300
that you're a part of creating?

155
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,780
In high school, I really wanted to go to vocational school

156
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,100
where you learn to weld and fix cars and build houses.

157
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,180
And I was told, no, you're smart, you have to sit in a room.

158
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,380
And nobody could explain to me

159
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,380
why I couldn't go to vocational school.

160
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,140
I then worked at Bell Labs,

161
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,460
this wonderful place before deregulation, legendary place.

162
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,820
And I would get union grievances

163
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,980
because I would go into the workshop

164
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,380
and try to make something and they would say,

165
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,700
no, you're smart, you have to tell somebody what to do.

166
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,220
And it wasn't until MIT, and I'll explain how CBA started,

167
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,580
but I could create CBA that I came to understand

168
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,100
this is a mistake that dates back to the Renaissance.

169
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,900
So in the Renaissance, the liberal arts emerged

170
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,420
and liberal doesn't mean politically liberal.

171
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,580
This was the path to liberation, birth of humanism.

172
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,380
And so the liberal arts were the trivium, quadrivium,

173
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,900
roughly language, natural science.

174
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,900
And at that moment, what emerged was this dreadful concept

175
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,580
of the illiberal arts.

176
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
So anything that wasn't the liberal arts

177
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,540
was for commercial gain and was just making stuff

178
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,500
and wasn't valid for serious study.

179
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,780
And so that's why we're left with learning to well

180
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,140
wasn't a subject for serious study,

181
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,420
but the means of expression have changed

182
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,340
since the Renaissance.

183
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,900
So micromachining or embedded coding

184
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,420
is every bit as expressive as painting a painting

185
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,460
or writing a sonnet.

186
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,420
So never understanding this difference

187
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,020
between computer science and physical science,

188
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,020
the path that led me to create CBA with colleagues

189
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,900
was, I was what's called the junior fellow at Harvard.

190
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,220
I was visiting MIT through Marvin

191
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,740
because I was interested in the physics

192
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,020
of musical instruments.

193
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,900
This will be another slight digression.

194
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,820
And Cornell, I would study physics

195
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,660
and then I would cross the street

196
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,540
and go to the music department where I played the bassoon

197
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,460
and I would trim reads and play the reads

198
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,860
and they'd be beautiful, but then they'd get soggy.

199
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,340
And then I discovered in the basement

200
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,140
of the music department at Cornell was David Borden,

201
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,260
who you might not have heard of,

202
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,180
but is legendary in electronic music

203
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,380
because he was really the first electronic musician.

204
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,180
So Bob Mogue, who invented Mogue synthesizers

205
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,420
was a physics student at Cornell like me crossing the street

206
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,140
and eventually he was kicked out

207
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,860
and invented electronic music.

208
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,540
David Borden was the first musician

209
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,060
who created electronic music.

210
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,020
So he's legendary for people like Phil Glass

211
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,460
and Steve Reich.

212
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,940
And so that got me thinking about,

213
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,620
I would behave as a scientist in the music department,

214
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,900
but not in the physics department,

215
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,260
but not in the music department,

216
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,100
got me thinking about

217
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,820
what's the computational capacity of a musical instrument.

218
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,140
And through Marvin, he introduced me to Todd Backover

219
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,860
at the Media Lab,

220
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,660
who was just about to start a project with Yo-Yo Ma

221
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,180
that led to a collaboration to instrument a cello,

222
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,300
to extract Yo-Yo's data

223
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,300
and bring it out into computational environments

224
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,420
what is the computational capacity of a musical instrument?

225
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,740
As we continue on this tangent

226
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,180
and we'll share a return to CBA.

227
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,180
Yeah, so one part of that is to understand the computing

228
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,100
and if you look at like the finest timescale

229
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,540
and length scale you need to model the physics,

230
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,980
it's not heroic.

231
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,900
A good GPU can do teraflops today.

232
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,020
That used to be a national class supercomputer,

233
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,300
now it's just a GPU.

234
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,940
And that's about if you take the timescales

235
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,700
and length scales relevant for the physics,

236
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,380
that's about the scale of the physics computing.

237
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,780
For Yo-Yo, what was really driving it

238
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,500
was he's completely unsentimental about the Strad.

239
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,180
It's not that it makes some magical wiggles

240
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,380
in the sound wave,

241
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,940
it's performance as a controller,

242
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,860
how he can manipulate it as an interface device.

243
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,500
Interface between one and what exactly?

244
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,820
Him and sound.

245
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,660
Okay, him and sound.

246
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,700
And so what it led to was,

247
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,020
I had started by thinking about ops per second,

248
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,020
but Yo-Yo's question was really resolution and bandwidth.

249
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,220
It's how fast can you measure what he does

250
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,220
and the bandwidth and the resolution

251
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,220
of detecting his controls

252
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,420
and then mapping them into sounds.

253
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,740
And what we found, what he found was

254
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,140
if you instrument everything he does

255
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,940
and connect it to almost anything,

256
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,620
it sounds like Yo-Yo,

257
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,220
that the magic is in the control,

258
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,780
not in ineffable details in how the wood wiggles.

259
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,060
And so with Yo-Yo and Todd, that led to a piece in,

260
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,140
towards the end I asked Yo-Yo,

261
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,860
what it would take for him to get rid of his Strad

262
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,820
and use our stuff?

263
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,460
And his answer was just logistics.

264
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,140
It was at that time, our stuff was like a rack of electronics

265
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,620
and lots of cables and some grad students to make it work.

266
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,140
Once the technology becomes as invisible as the Strad,

267
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,100
then sure, absolutely he would take it.

268
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,060
And by the way, as a footnote on the footnote,

269
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,140
an accident in the sensing of Yo-Yo's cello

270
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,820
led to $100 million a year auto safety business

271
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,860
to control airbags and cars.

272
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,260
How did that work?

273
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,020
I had to instrument the bow without interfering with it.

274
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,100
So I set up local electromagnetic fields

275
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,780
where I would detect how those fields interact

276
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,380
with the bow he's playing.

277
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,540
But we had a problem that his hand,

278
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,660
whenever his hand got near the sensing fields,

279
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,060
I would start sensing his hand

280
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,580
rather than the materials on the bow.

281
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,500
And I didn't quite understand what was going on

282
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,180
with that interference.

283
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,940
So my very first grad student ever, Josh Smith,

284
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,420
did a thesis on tomography with electric fields,

285
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,380
how to see in 3D with electric fields.

286
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Then through Todd and at that point,

287
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,740
research scientist in my lab, Joe Paradiso,

288
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,460
it led to a collaboration with Penn and Teller,

289
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,820
who, where we did a magic trick in Las Vegas

290
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,100
to contact Houdini.

291
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,780
And sort of these fields are sort of like,

292
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,140
contacting spirits.

293
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,500
So we did a magic trick in Las Vegas.

294
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,620
And then the crazy thing that happened after that

295
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,820
was Phil Rittmueller came running into my lab.

296
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,180
He worked with, this became with Honda and NEC,

297
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,700
airbags were killing infants in rear-facing child seats.

298
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,540
Cars need to distinguish a front-facing adult

299
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,540
where you'd save the life versus a bag of groceries

300
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,940
where you don't need to fire the airbag

301
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,300
versus a rear-facing infant where you would kill it.

302
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,820
And so the seat need to, in effect,

303
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,140
see in 3D to understand the occupants.

304
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,100
And so we took the Penn and Teller magic trick

305
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,620
derived from Josh's thesis from Yo-Yo's cello

306
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,060
to an auto show.

307
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,100
And all the car companies said,

308
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,820
great, when can we buy it?

309
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,900
And so that became Elisys and it was $100 million a year

310
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
business making sensors.

311
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,060
There wasn't a lot of publicity

312
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,180
because it was in the car so the car didn't kill you.

313
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,500
So they didn't sort of advertise,

314
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,780
we have nice sensors so the car doesn't kill you.

315
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,900
But it became a leading auto safety sensor.

316
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,580
And that started from the cello

317
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,260
and the question of the computational capacity,

318
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,180
the musical instrument.

319
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,020
Right.

320
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,340
So now to get back to MIT,

321
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,260
I was spending a lot of outside time at IBM research

322
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,100
that had gods of the foundations of computing.

323
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,220
There's just amazing people there.

324
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,300
And I'd always expected to go to IBM to take over a lab.

325
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,100
But at the last minute, pivoted and came to MIT

326
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,100
to take a position in the media lab

327
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,460
and start what became the predecessor to CBA.

328
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,940
Media lab is well known for Nicholas Negarpanti.

329
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,460
What's less well known is the role of Jerry Wiesner.

330
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,740
So Jerry was MIT's president

331
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,540
before that Kennedy science advisor,

332
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,140
grand old man of science.

333
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,740
At the end of his life,

334
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,940
he was frustrated by how knowledge was segregated.

335
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,220
And so he wanted to create a department

336
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,140
of none of the above,

337
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,540
a department for work that didn't fit in departments.

338
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,100
And the media lab in a sense was a cover story

339
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,660
for him to hide a department.

340
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,300
As MIT's president towards the end of his tenure,

341
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,100
if he said, I'm gonna make a department

342
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,660
for things that don't fit in departments,

343
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
the departments would have screamed.

344
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,460
But everybody was sort of paying attention

345
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,980
to Nicholas creating the media lab

346
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,700
and Jerry kind of hid in it a department

347
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,260
called media arts and sciences.

348
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,940
It's really the department of none of the above.

349
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,020
And Jerry explaining that and Nicholas then confirming it

350
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,860
is really why I pivoted and went to MIT.

351
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,580
Because my students who helped create quantum computing

352
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,460
or synthetic life get degrees from media arts and sciences,

353
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,580
this department of none of the above.

354
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,660
So that led to coming to MIT with Todd and Joe Paradiso

355
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,060
and my colleague, we started a consortium

356
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,340
called Things That Think.

357
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,340
And this was around the birth of internet of things

358
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,900
and RFID.

359
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,940
But then we started doing things like work we can discuss

360
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,340
that became the beginnings of quantum computing

361
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,380
and cryptography and materials

362
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,940
and logic and microfluidics.

363
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,940
And those needed much more significant infrastructure

364
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,300
and were much longer research arcs.

365
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,660
So with a bigger team of about 20 people,

366
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,700
we wrote a proposal to the NSF

367
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,180
to assemble one of every tool

368
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,660
to make anything of any size was roughly the proposal.

369
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,580
One of any tool to make anything of any size.

370
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Yeah, so they're usually nanometers, micrometers,

371
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,860
millimeters, meters are segregated,

372
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,860
input and output is segregated.

373
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,020
We wanted to look just very literally

374
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,980
how digital becomes physical and physical becomes digital.

375
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,660
And fortunately, we got NSF on a good day

376
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,580
and they funded this facility of one of almost every tool

377
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,100
to make anything.

378
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,020
And so with a group of core colleagues

379
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,980
that included Joe Jacobson, Ike Trang, Scott Minales,

380
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,300
we launched CBA.

381
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,860
And so you're talking about nanoscale, microscale,

382
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,580
nanostructures, microstructures, macrostructures,

383
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,180
electron microscopes and focus time beam probes

384
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,620
for nanostructures, laser, micro machining

385
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,300
and X-ray microtomography for microstructures,

386
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,060
multi-axis machining and 3D printing

387
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,100
for macrostructures, just some examples.

388
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,740
What are we talking about in terms of scale?

389
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,100
How can we build tiny things and big things

390
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,180
all in one place, is that possible?

391
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,740
Yeah, so a well-equipped research lab

392
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,940
has the sort of tools we're talking about,

393
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,340
but they're segregated in different places.

394
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,580
They're typically also run by technicians

395
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,620
where you then have an account and a project and you charge.

396
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,140
All of these tools are essentially

397
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,460
when you don't know what you're doing,

398
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,100
not when you do know what you're doing

399
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,300
in that they're when you need to work across length scales

400
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,020
where we don't, once projects are running in this facility,

401
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,340
we don't charge for time,

402
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,980
you don't make a formal proposal to schedule

403
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,860
and the users really run the tools and it's for work

404
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,780
that's kind of in Co8 that needs to span

405
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,540
these disciplines and length scales.

406
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,540
And so work in the project today,

407
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,860
work in CBA today ranges from developing

408
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,220
Zeptojoule electronics for the lowest power computing

409
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,580
to micromachining diamond to take 10 million RPM bearings

410
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,340
for molecular spectroscopy studies

411
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,740
up to exploring robots to build

412
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,820
100 meter structures in space.

413
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,940
Okay, can we, the three things you just mentioned,

414
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,780
let's start with the biggest.

415
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,380
What are some of the biggest stuff you attempted

416
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,300
to explore how to build in a lab?

417
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,100
Sure, so viewed from one direction,

418
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,940
what we're talking about is a crazy random seeming

419
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,700
of almost unrelated projects.

420
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,380
But if you rotate 90 degrees,

421
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,980
it's really just a core thought over and over again,

422
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,340
just very literally how bits and atoms relate,

423
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,660
how digital and just going from digital to physical

424
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,820
in many different domains,

425
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,740
but it's really just the same idea over and over again.

426
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,820
So to understand the biggest things,

427
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,940
let me go back to bring in now Shannon

428
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,300
as well as Van Neumann.

429
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,140
Claude Shannon.

430
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,620
Yeah, so what is digital?

431
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,300
The casual obvious answer is digital in one and zero,

432
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,700
but that's wrong.

433
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
There's a much deeper answer,

434
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,100
which is Claude Shannon at MIT wrote the best master thesis

435
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,540
ever in his master's thesis,

436
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,340
he invented our modern notion of digital logic.

437
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,340
Where it came from was Vannevar Bush was a grand old man

438
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,820
at MIT, he created the post war research establishment

439
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,140
that led to the National Science Foundation

440
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,340
and he made an important mistake, which we can talk about.

441
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,620
But he also made the differential analyzer,

442
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,900
which was the last grade analog computer.

443
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
So it was a room full of gears and pulleys

444
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,020
and the longer it ran, the worse the answer was.

445
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,540
And Shannon worked on it as a student

446
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,060
and he got so annoyed in his master's thesis,

447
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,700
he invented digital logic,

448
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,740
but he then went on to Bell Labs.

449
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,100
And what he did there was communication

450
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,220
was beginning to expand,

451
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,540
there was more demand for phone lines.

452
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,780
And so there's a question about how many phone lines

453
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,620
you could, phone messages you could send down a wire.

454
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,940
And you could try to just make it better and better.

455
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,820
He asked a question nobody had asked,

456
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,740
which is rather than make it better and better,

457
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
what's the limit to how good it can be?

458
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,860
And he proved a couple of things,

459
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,620
but one of the main things he proved

460
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,660
was a threshold theorem for channel capacity.

461
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,500
And so what he showed was my voice to you right now

462
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,460
is coming as a wave through sound

463
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,900
and the further you get, the worse it sounds.

464
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,820
But people watching this are getting it

465
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,180
as packets of data in a network.

466
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,340
When the computer, they're watching this,

467
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,780
gets the packet of information,

468
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,940
it can detect and correct an error.

469
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,820
And what Shannon showed is if the noise

470
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,380
in the cable to the people watching this

471
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,980
is above a threshold, they're doomed.

472
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,460
But if the noise is below a threshold

473
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,300
for a linear increase in the energy

474
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,420
representing our conversation,

475
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,540
the error rate goes down exponentially.

476
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,180
Exponentials are fast.

477
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,620
There's very few of them in engineering.

478
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,100
And the exponential reduction of error

479
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,060
below a threshold if you restore state

480
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,260
is called a threshold theorem.

481
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,300
That's what led to digital.

482
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,340
That means unreliable things can work reliably.

483
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,900
So Shannon did that for communication.

484
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,660
Then Van Neumann was inspired by that

485
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,860
and applied it to computation.

486
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,100
And he showed how an unreliable computer

487
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,900
can operate reliably

488
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,180
by using the same threshold property of restoring state.

489
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,620
It was then forgotten many years.

490
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,300
We had to rediscover it in effect

491
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,940
in the quantum computing era

492
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,820
when things are very unreliable again.

493
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,620
But now to go back to how does this relate

494
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
to the biggest things I've made?

495
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,620
So in fabrication, MIT invented

496
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,180
computer-controlled manufacturing in 1952.

497
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,460
Jet aircraft were just emerging.

498
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,860
There was a limit to turning cranks

499
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,780
on a milling machine to make parts for jet aircraft.

500
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,060
Now, this is a messy story.

501
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,740
MIT actually stole computer-controlled machining

502
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,020
from an inventor who brought it to MIT.

503
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,340
Wanted to do a joint project with the Air Force

504
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,140
and MIT effectively stole it from him.

505
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,460
So it's kind of a messy history.

506
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,100
But that sounds like the birth

507
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,020
of computer-controlled machining, 1952.

508
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,140
There are a number of inventors of 3D printing.

509
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,220
One of the companies spun off my lab

510
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,900
by Max Lobowski's form labs,

511
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,780
which is now a billion dollar 3D printing company.

512
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,620
That's the modern version.

513
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,860
But all of that's analog, meaning the information

514
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,060
is in the control computer.

515
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,020
There's no information in the materials.

516
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,580
And so it goes back to Vannevar Bush's analog computer.

517
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,380
If you make a mistake in printing or machining,

518
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,820
just the mistake accumulates.

519
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,940
The real birth of computerized digital manufacturing

520
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
is four billion years ago.

521
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,980
That's the evolutionary age of the ribosome.

522
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,140
So the way you're manufactured

523
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,140
is there's a code that describes you, the genetic code.

524
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,620
It goes to a micro machine, the ribosome,

525
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,340
which is this molecular factory

526
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,360
that builds the molecules that are you.

527
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,980
The key thing to know about that

528
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,580
is there are about 20 amino acids that get assembled.

529
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,380
And in that machinery,

530
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,900
it does everything Shannon and Van Neumann taught us.

531
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,580
You detect and correct errors.

532
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,540
So if you mix chemicals,

533
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,020
the error rate is about a part in a hundred.

534
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,020
When you elongate a protein in the ribosome,

535
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,100
it's about a part in 10 to the four.

536
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,940
When you replicate DNA,

537
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,180
there's an extra level of error correction.

538
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,260
It's a part in 10 to the eight.

539
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,500
And so in the molecules that make you,

540
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,660
you can detect and correct errors

541
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,700
and you don't need a ruler to make you.

542
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,300
The geometry comes from your parts.

543
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,420
So now compare a child playing with Lego

544
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,660
and a state-of-the-art 3D printer

545
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,540
or a computerized milling machine.

546
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,180
The tower made by a child

547
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,540
is more accurate than their motor control

548
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,860
because the act of snapping the bricks together

549
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,860
gives you a constraint on the joints.

550
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,500
You can join bricks made out of dissimilar materials.

551
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,100
You don't need a ruler for Lego

552
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,980
because the geometry locally gives you the global parts

553
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,540
and there's no Lego trash.

554
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,580
The parts have enough information to disassemble them.

555
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,180
Those are exactly the properties of a digital code.

556
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,060
The unreliable is made reliable.

557
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,460
Yes, absolutely.

558
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,620
So what the ribosome figured out four billion years ago

559
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,540
is how to embody these digital properties

560
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,540
but not for communication or computation

561
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,900
in effect but for construction.

562
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,180
So a number of projects in my lab

563
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,380
have been studying the idea of digital materials

564
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,340
and think of a digital material just as Lego bricks.

565
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,340
The precise meaning is a discrete set of parts

566
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,380
reversibly joined with global geometry

567
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,580
determined from local constraints.

568
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,380
And so it's digitizing the materials.

569
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,620
And so I'm coming back to

570
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,380
what are the biggest things I've made?

571
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,780
My lab was working with the aerospace industry.

572
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,020
So Spirit Arrow was Boeing's factories.

573
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,700
They asked us for how to join composites.

574
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,460
When you make a composite airplane,

575
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,900
you make these giant wing and fuselage parts

576
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,260
and they asked us for a better way to stick them together

577
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,540
because the joints were a place of failure.

578
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,500
And what we discovered was

579
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,740
instead of making a few big parts,

580
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,940
if you make little loops of carbon fiber

581
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,220
and you reversibly link them in joints

582
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,020
and you do it in a special geometry

583
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,460
that balances being under constrained and over constrained

584
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,780
with just the right degrees of freedom.

585
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,260
We set the world record for the highest modulus

586
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,140
ultralight material

587
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,620
just by in effect making carbon fiber Lego.

588
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,300
So lightweight materials are crucial for energy efficiency.

589
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,300
This let us make the lightest weight,

590
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,020
high modulus material.

591
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,740
We then showed that with just a few part types

592
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,980
we can tune the material properties

593
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,260
and then you can create really wild robots

594
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,940
that instead of having a tool the size of a jumbo jet

595
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,020
to make a jumbo jet,

596
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,620
you can make little robots

597
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,740
that walk on these cellular structures

598
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,260
to build the structures

599
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,620
where they error correct their position on the structure

600
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,740
and they navigate on the structure.

601
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,740
And so using all of that with NASA,

602
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,580
we made morphing airplanes.

603
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,420
A former student Kenny Chang and Ben Jeanette

604
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,380
made a morphing airplane

605
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,020
the size of NASA Langley's biggest wind tunnel.

606
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,700
With Toyota, we've made super efficiency race cars.

607
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,060
We're right now looking at projects with NASA

608
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,220
to build these for things like space telescopes

609
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,620
and space habitats where the ribosome

610
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,220
I who I mentioned a little while back

611
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,180
can make an elephant one molecule at a time.

612
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,980
Ribosomes are slow.

613
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,060
They run at about one molecule a second

614
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,300
but ribosomes make ribosomes.

615
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,260
So you have thousands of them,

616
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,620
billions of them and that makes an elephant.

617
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,300
In the same way these little assembly robots I'm describing

618
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,580
can make giant structures at heart

619
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,540
because the robot can make the robot.

620
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,100
So more recently to my students, Samira and Miana

621
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,500
had a nature communication paper showing

622
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,060
how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making

623
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,820
so the robots can make the robot.

624
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,340
So you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.

625
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,180
It can self-replicate.

626
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,140
Can you linger on what that robot looks like?

627
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,180
What is a robot that can walk along

628
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,620
and do error correction?

629
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,900
And what is a robot that can self-replicate

630
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,860
from the materials that is given?

631
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,700
What does that look like?

632
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,540
What are we talking?

633
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,860
This is fascinating.

634
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah, the answer is different at different length scales.

635
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,740
So to explain that in biology, primary structure

636
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,540
is the code in the messenger RNA

637
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,220
that says what the ribosome should build.

638
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,860
Secondary structure are geometrical motifs

639
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
or things like helices or sheets.

640
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,540
Tertiary structures are functional elements

641
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,940
like electron donors or acceptors.

642
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,940
Quaternary structure is things like molecular motors

643
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,220
that are moving my mouth

644
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,580
or making the synapses work in my brain.

645
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,540
So there's that hierarchy of primary,

646
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,900
secondary, tertiary, quaternary.

647
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Now, what's interesting is if you wanna buy electronics today

648
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,740
from a vendor, there are hundreds of thousands of types

649
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,740
of resistors or capacitors or transistors, huge inventory.

650
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,980
All of biology is just made from this inventory

651
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,700
of 20 parts of the amino acids.

652
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,540
And by composing them, you can create all of life.

653
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,580
And so as part of this digitization of materials,

654
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,900
we're in effect trying to create something

655
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,540
like amino acids for engineering,

656
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,700
creating all of technology from 20 parts.

657
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,340
I see, as another discretion,

658
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,860
I helped start an office for science in Hollywood.

659
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,100
And there was a fun thing for the movie, The Martian,

660
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,180
where I did a program with Bill Nye and a few others

661
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,580
on how to actually build a civilization on Mars

662
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,940
that they described in a way that I like

663
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,060
as I was talking about how to go to Mars without luggage.

664
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,860
And at heart, it's sort of how to create life

665
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,340
in non-living materials.

666
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,820
So if you think about this primary,

667
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,060
secondary, tertiary, quaternary structure,

668
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,380
in my lab, we're doing that,

669
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,460
but on different length scales for different purposes.

670
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,660
So we're making micro robots out of like nanobricks

671
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,940
and to make the robots to build large scale structures

672
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,980
in space, the elements of the robots now are centimeters

673
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,460
rather than micrometers.

674
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,300
And so the assembly robots for the bigger structures are,

675
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,900
there are the cells that make up the structure,

676
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,580
but then we have functional cells.

677
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,460
And so cells that can process and actuate,

678
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,380
each cell can like move one degree of freedom

679
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,460
or attach or detach or process.

680
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,140
Now, those elements I just described,

681
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,340
we can make out of the still smaller parts.

682
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,820
So eventually there's a hierarchy of the little parts

683
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,660
make little robots that make bigger parts

684
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,620
of bigger robots up through that hierarchy.

685
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,460
And that way you can move up the length scale.

686
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,380
Right, early on I tried to go in a straight line

687
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,540
from the bottom to the top

688
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,460
and that ended up being a bad idea.

689
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,940
Instead, we're kind of doing all of these in parallel

690
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,820
and then they're growing together.

691
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,340
And so to make the larger scale structures,

692
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,300
like there's a lot of hype right now

693
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,540
about 3D printing houses

694
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,900
where you have a printer the size of the house.

695
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,340
We're now working on using swarms of these,

696
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,580
table scale robots that walk on the structures

697
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,380
to place the parts much more efficiently.

698
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,740
That's amazing.

699
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,940
But you're saying you can't for now go

700
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,900
from the very small to the very large.

701
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,860
That'll come in stages.

702
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,020
Can we just link around this idea

703
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,660
starting from Vinoyman's self replicating automata

704
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,740
that you mentioned, it's just a beautiful idea.

705
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,620
That's at the heart of all of this.

706
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,940
In the stack I described,

707
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,860
so one student, Will Langford,

708
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,540
made these micro-robots out of little parts

709
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,780
that then we're using for Miana's bigger robots

710
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,220
up through this hierarchy.

711
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,980
And it's really realizing

712
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,060
this idea of the self-reproducing automata.

713
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,020
So Vinoyman, when I complained about

714
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,420
the Vinoyman architecture,

715
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,820
it's not fair to Vinoyman

716
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
because he never claimed it as his architecture.

717
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,300
He really wrote about it in this one fairly dreadful memo

718
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,940
that led to all sorts of lawsuits

719
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,900
and fights about the early days of computing.

720
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,620
He did beautiful work on reliable computation

721
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,100
and reliable devices.

722
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,500
And towards the end of his life,

723
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,500
what he studied was how,

724
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,060
and I have to say this precisely,

725
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,500
how a computation communicates its own construction.

726
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,980
Yeah, so beautiful.

727
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,980
So a computation can store a description

728
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,980
of how to build itself.

729
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,620
But now there's a really hard problem,

730
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,500
which is if you have that in your mind,

731
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,060
how do you transfer it and wake up a thing

732
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,300
that then can contain it?

733
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,740
So how do you give birth to a thing

734
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,660
that knows how to make itself?

735
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,340
And so with Stan Ulam,

736
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,300
he invented cellular automata as a way to simulate these.

737
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,980
But that was theoretical.

738
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,900
Now the work I'm describing in my lab

739
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,500
is fundamentally how to realize it,

740
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,140
how to realize self-reproducing automata.

741
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,860
And so this is something Van Neumann thought very deeply

742
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,620
and very beautifully about theoretically.

743
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,020
And it's right at this intersection.

744
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,020
It's not communication or computation or fabrication.

745
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,660
It's right at this intersection

746
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,420
where communication and computation meets fabrication.

747
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,020
Now the reason self-reproducing automata intellectually

748
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,860
is so important,

749
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,460
is this is the foundation of life.

750
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,820
This is really just understanding

751
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,100
the essence of how to life.

752
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,700
And in effect, we're trying to create life

753
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,380
in non-living material.

754
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,380
The reason it's so important technologically

755
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,820
is because that's how you scale capacity.

756
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,540
That's how you can make an elephant from a ribosome

757
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,340
because the assemblers make assemblers.

758
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,340
So simple building blocks

759
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,180
that inside themselves contain the information

760
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,420
how to build more building blocks.

761
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,220
And between each other construct arbitrarily complex objects.

762
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,820
Now let me give you the numbers.

763
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,860
So let me relate this to right now

764
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,860
we're living in AI mania explosion time.

765
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,940
Let me relate that to what we're talking about.

766
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,380
A hundred petaflop computer,

767
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,380
which is a current generation supercomputer,

768
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,140
not quite the biggest ones,

769
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,900
does 10 to the 17 ops per second.

770
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,820
Your brain does 10 to the 17 ops per second.

771
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,060
It has about 10 to the 15 synapses

772
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,140
and they run at about a hundred hertz.

773
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,140
So as of a year or two ago,

774
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,700
the performance of a big computer matched a brain.

775
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,540
So you could view AI as a breakthrough,

776
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,540
but the real story is within about a year or two ago,

777
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,980
and let's see that the supercomputer

778
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,500
has about 10 to the 15 transistors in the processors,

779
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,380
10 to the 15 transistors in the memory,

780
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,220
which is the synapses in your brain.

781
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,940
So the real breakthrough was

782
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,700
the computers match the computational capacity of a brain.

783
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,140
And so we'd be sort of derelict

784
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,540
if they couldn't do about the same thing.

785
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,700
But now the reason I'm mentioning that is

786
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,340
the chip fab making the supercomputer

787
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,380
is placing about 10 to the 10 transistors a second.

788
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,780
While you're digesting your lunch right now,

789
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,840
you're placing about 10 to the 18 parts per second.

790
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,540
There's an eight order of magnitude difference.

791
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,460
So in computational capacity, it's done, we've caught up.

792
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,060
But there's eight orders of magnitude difference

793
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,620
in the rate at which biology can build

794
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,860
versus state-of-the-art manufacturing can build.

795
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,960
And that distinction is what we're talking about.

796
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,260
That distinction is not analog,

797
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,780
but this deep sense of digital fabrication,

798
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,140
of embodying codes in construction.

799
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,900
So a description doesn't describe a thing,

800
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,980
but the description becomes the thing.

801
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,420
So you're saying, I mean, this is one of the cases

802
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,460
you're making and that this is this third revolution.

803
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,540
We've seen the Moore's Law in communication,

804
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,380
we've seen the Moore's Law-like type of growth

805
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,460
in computation, and you're anticipating,

806
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,220
we're going to see that in digital fabrication.

807
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,820
Can you actually first of all describe

808
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,460
what you mean by this term, digital fabrication?

809
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,460
So the casual meaning is the computer controls

810
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,540
the tool to make something.

811
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,140
And that was invented when MIT stole it in 1952.

812
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,620
There's the deep meaning of what the ribosome does,

813
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,620
of a digital description doesn't describe a thing,

814
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,100
a digital description becomes the thing.

815
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,020
That's the path to the Star Trek replicator,

816
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,300
and that's the thing that doesn't exist yet.

817
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,540
Now, I think the best way to understand

818
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,380
what this roadmap looks like is to now bring in FAB Labs

819
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,780
and how they relate to all of this.

820
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,940
What are FAB Labs?

821
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,820
So here's a sequence.

822
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,340
With colleagues, I accidentally started a network

823
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,500
of what's now 2,500 digital fabrication community labs

824
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,540
called FAB Labs right now in 125 countries,

825
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,340
and they double every year and a half.

826
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,300
That's called Lassa's Law after Sherry Lasseter,

827
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,260
who I'll explain.

828
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,580
So here's the sequence.

829
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,140
We started Center for Bits and Atoms

830
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,420
to do the kind of research we're talking about.

831
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,940
We had all of these machines, and then had a problem,

832
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,940
it would take a lifetime of classes

833
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,540
to learn to use all the machines.

834
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,620
So with colleagues who helped start CBA,

835
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,420
we began a class modestly called

836
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,940
how to make almost anything.

837
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,380
And there's no big agenda, it was just,

838
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,060
it was aimed at a few research students to use the machines,

839
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,060
and it was completely unprepared

840
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,860
for the first time we taught it.

841
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,780
We were swamped by, every year since,

842
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,740
hundreds of students try to take the class.

843
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,620
It's one of the most oversubscribed classes at MIT.

844
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,940
Students would say things like,

845
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,380
can you teach this at MIT?

846
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,580
It seems too useful.

847
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,180
It's just how to work these machines.

848
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,780
And the students in the class,

849
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,980
I would teach them all the skills to use all these tools,

850
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,060
and then they would do projects integrating them,

851
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,900
and they're amazing.

852
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,580
So Kelly was a sculptor, no engineering background.

853
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,380
Her project was she made a device

854
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,940
that saves up screams when you're mad

855
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,740
and plays them back later.

856
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,420
And saves up screams when you're mad

857
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,460
and plays them back later.

858
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,620
You scream into this device and it deadens the sound,

859
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,380
records it, and then when it's convenient,

860
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,060
releases your scream.

861
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,260
Can we just pause on the brilliance of that invention?

862
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,380
Creation, the art, I don't know, the brilliance.

863
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Who is this that created this?

864
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,220
Kelly Dobson.

865
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,220
Gone on to do a number of interesting things.

866
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,180
Mijin, who's gone on to do a number of interesting things,

867
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,900
made a dress instrumented with sensors and spines.

868
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,300
And when somebody creepy comes close,

869
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,860
it would defend your personal space.

870
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,340
It's also very easy.

871
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,980
Another project early on was a web browser for parrots,

872
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,020
which have the cognitive ability of a young child,

873
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,260
and lets parrots surf the internet.

874
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,380
You know, another was an alarm clock,

875
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,340
an alarm clock you wrestle with and prove you're awake.

876
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,340
And what connects all of these is,

877
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,460
so MIT made the first real-time computer, the whirlwind.

878
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,420
That was transistorized as the TX.

879
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,580
The TX was spun off from MIT as the PDP.

880
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,580
PDPs were the mini computers that created the internet.

881
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,740
So outside MIT was DEC, Prime, Wang, Data, General,

882
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,900
the whole mini computer industry.

883
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,820
The whole computing industry was there,

884
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,820
and it all failed when computing became personal.

885
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,420
Ken Olson, the head of digital,

886
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,980
famously said, you don't need a computer at home.

887
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,220
There's a little background to that,

888
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,780
but DEC completely missed computing became personal.

889
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,780
So I mentioned all of that because I was asking

890
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,780
how to do digital fabrication, but not really why.

891
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,460
The students in this how to make class were showing me

892
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,060
that the killer app of digital fabrication

893
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,420
is personal fabrication.

894
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,700
Yeah, how do you jump to the personal fabrication?

895
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,940
So Kelly didn't make the screen body

896
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,220
because it was for a thesis.

897
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,300
She wasn't writing a research paper.

898
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,180
It wasn't a business model.

899
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,500
She wanted, it was because she wanted one.

900
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,740
It was personal expression going back

901
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,620
to me in vocational school.

902
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,060
It was personal expression in these new means of expression.

903
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,940
So that's happened every year since.

904
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,260
It literally is called,

905
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,660
the course is literally called

906
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,740
how to make almost anything.

907
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,540
A legendary course at MIT every year.

908
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,620
And it's grown to multiple labs at MIT

909
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,220
with as many people involved in teaching as taking it.

910
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,660
There's even a Harvard lab for the MIT class.

911
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
What have you learned about humans colliding

912
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,980
with the fab lab, about what the capacity

913
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,580
of humans to be creative and to build?

914
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,020
I mentioned Marvin.

915
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,580
Another mentor at MIT, sadly no longer living

916
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,180
is Seymour Papper.

917
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,140
So Papper studied with Piaget.

918
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,660
He came to MIT to get access to the early computer.

919
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,020
Piaget was a pioneer in how kids learn.

920
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,780
Papper came to MIT to get access to the early computers

921
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,300
with the goal of letting kids play with them.

922
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,380
Piaget helps show kids are like scientists.

923
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,300
They learn as scientists

924
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,340
and it gets kind of throttled out of them.

925
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Seymour wanted to let kids have a broader landscape to play.

926
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,220
Seymour's work led with Mitch Resnick

927
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,420
to Lego, Logo, Mindstorms, all of that stuff.

928
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,420
As fab lab spread and we started creating

929
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,460
educational programs for kids in them,

930
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,100
Seymour said something really interesting.

931
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,980
He made a gesture.

932
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,500
He said it was a thorn in his side

933
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,060
that they invented what's called the turtle,

934
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,660
a early robot kids could program

935
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,940
to connect it to a mainframe computer.

936
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,300
Seymour said the goal was not for the kids

937
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,500
to program the robot,

938
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,460
it was for the kids to create the robot.

939
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,540
And so in that sense, the fab labs,

940
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,420
which for me were just this accident,

941
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,140
he described as sort of this fulfillment

942
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,460
of the arc of kids learned by experimenting.

943
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,900
It was to give them the tools to create,

944
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,620
not just assemble things and program things,

945
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,980
but actually create.

946
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,180
So coming to your question,

947
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,180
what I've learned is MIT,

948
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,260
a few years back, somebody added up businesses

949
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,820
from spun off from MIT

950
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,500
and it's the world's 10th economy.

951
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,580
It falls between India and Russia.

952
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,820
And I view that in a way as a bad number

953
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,740
because it's only a few thousand people

954
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,820
and these aren't uniquely the 4,000 brightest people,

955
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,380
it's just a productive environment for them.

956
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,820
And what we found is in rural Indian villages

957
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,220
in African shantytowns and Arctic hamlets,

958
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,900
I find exactly precisely that profile.

959
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,300
So Ling sighed at a few hours above Tromsø,

960
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,940
way above the Arctic circles.

961
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,420
So far in North, the satellite dishes,

962
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,500
look at the ground, not the sky.

963
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,340
Hans Christian in the lab was considered a problem

964
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,500
in the local school

965
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,220
because they couldn't teach him anything.

966
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,500
I showed him a few projects.

967
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,180
Next time I came back, he was designing

968
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,060
and building little robot vehicles.

969
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:26,060
And in South Africa, I mentioned Soshengovie,

970
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,420
in this apartheid township,

971
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,500
the local technical institute taught kids

972
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,980
how to make bricks and fold sheets.

973
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,820
So it was punitive.

974
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,580
But Chepiso in the fab lab

975
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,900
was actually doing all the work of my MIT classes.

976
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,700
And so over and over, we found precisely

977
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,700
the same kind of bright invent of creativity.

978
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,860
And historically, the answer was,

979
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,220
go, you're smart, go away.

980
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,580
It's sort of like me in vocational school.

981
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,300
But in this lab network,

982
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,140
what we could then do is in effect,

983
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,500
bring the world to them.

984
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,460
Now let's look at the scaling of all of this.

985
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,460
So there's one earth, 1,000 cities,

986
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,140
a million towns, a billion people, a trillion things.

987
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,220
There was one whirlwind computer,

988
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,300
MIT made the first real-time computer.

989
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,860
There were thousands of PDPs.

990
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,820
There were millions of hobbyist computers

991
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,660
that came from that,

992
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,140
billions of personal computers,

993
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,420
trillions of internet of things.

994
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,180
So now if we look at this fab lab story,

995
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,380
1952 was the NC mill.

996
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,700
There are now thousands of fab labs.

997
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,620
And the fab lab costs exactly the same

998
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,500
constant complexity of the mini computer.

999
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,020
So on the mini computer, it didn't fit in your pocket.

1000
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,700
It filled the room.

1001
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,620
But video games, email, word processing,

1002
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,460
really anything you do, the internet,

1003
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,740
anything you do with a computer today happened at that era

1004
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,300
because it got on the scale of a work group,

1005
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,460
not a corporation.

1006
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,140
In the same way, fab labs are like the mini computers

1007
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,540
inventing how does the world work

1008
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,380
if anybody can make anything.

1009
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,380
Then if you look at that scaling,

1010
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,080
fab labs today are transitioning from buying a machine

1011
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,060
to make machines, making machines.

1012
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,660
So we're transitioning to you can go to a fab lab,

1013
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,380
not to make a project, but to make a new machine.

1014
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,300
So we talked about the deep sense of self-replication.

1015
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,260
There's a very practical sense of fab lab machines

1016
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,500
making fab lab machines.

1017
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,500
And so that's the equivalent of the habeas computer era,

1018
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,460
what it's called the Altair historically.

1019
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,660
Then the work we spent a while talking about

1020
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,620
about assemblers and self-assemblers,

1021
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,620
that's the equivalent of smartphones

1022
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,700
and internet of things.

1023
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,940
That's when, so the assemblers are like the smartphone

1024
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,940
where a smartphone today has the capacity

1025
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,700
of what used to be a supercomputer in your pocket.

1026
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,380
And then the smart thermostat on your wall

1027
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,380
has the power of the original PDP computer,

1028
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,980
not metaphorically, but literally,

1029
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,020
and now there's trillions of those in the same sense

1030
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,820
that when we finally merge materials

1031
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,620
with the machines in the self-assembly,

1032
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,140
that's like the internet of things stage.

1033
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,260
But here's the important lesson.

1034
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,880
If you look at the computing analogy,

1035
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
computing expanded exponentially,

1036
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,160
but it really didn't fundamentally change.

1037
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,040
The core things happened in that transition

1038
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,300
in the mini computer era.

1039
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,200
So in the same sense, the research now,

1040
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,360
we spent a while talking about

1041
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,680
is how we get to the replicator.

1042
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,640
Today you can do all of that if you close your eyes

1043
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,140
and view the whole fab lab as a machine.

1044
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,080
In that room, you can make almost anything,

1045
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,800
but you need a lot of inputs.

1046
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,680
Bit by bit, the inputs will go down

1047
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
and the size of the room will go down

1048
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,880
as we go through each of these stages.

1049
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,720
So how difficult is it to create a self-replicating assembler,

1050
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,720
self-replicating machine that builds copies of itself

1051
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,680
or builds more complicated version of itself,

1052
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,360
which is kind of the dream towards which you're pushing

1053
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,880
in a generic arbitrary sense?

1054
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,360
I had a student Nadia Peek with Jonathan Ward,

1055
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,600
who for me started this idea of how do we use

1056
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,800
the tools in my lab to make the tools in the lab?

1057
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,520
In a very clear sense,

1058
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,840
they are making self-reproducing machines.

1059
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,560
So one of the really cool things that's happened

1060
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,040
is there's a whole network of machine builders

1061
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,920
around the world.

1062
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,800
So there's Danielle and now in Germany

1063
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,120
and Jens in Norway.

1064
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,120
And each of these people has learned the skills

1065
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,920
to go into a fab lab and make a machine.

1066
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,040
And so we've started creating a network of super fab,

1067
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,520
so the fab lab can make a machine,

1068
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,520
but it can't make a number

1069
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,680
of the precision parts of the machine.

1070
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,960
So in places like Bhutan or Kerala in the south of India,

1071
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,000
we've started creating super fab labs

1072
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,800
that have more advanced tools to make the parts

1073
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,280
of the machines so that the machines themselves

1074
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,240
become even cheaper.

1075
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,680
So that is self-reproducing machines,

1076
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,440
but you need to feed it things like bearings

1077
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,920
or microcontrollers, they can't make those parts.

1078
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,440
But other than that, they're making their own things.

1079
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,360
And I should note as a footnote,

1080
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,600
the stack I described of computers controlling machines

1081
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,600
to machine making machines to assemblers to self-assemblers,

1082
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,400
view that as fab1234.

1083
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,280
So we're transitioning from fab1 to fab2

1084
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,640
and the research in the lab is three and four.

1085
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,960
At this fab2 stage, a big component of this

1086
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,920
is sustainability in the material feedstocks.

1087
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,600
So Alicia, colleague in Chile is leading a great effort

1088
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,040
looking at how you take forest products

1089
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,720
and coffee grounds and seashells

1090
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,680
and a range of locally available materials

1091
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,520
and produce the high tech materials that go into the lab.

1092
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,840
So all of that is machine building today.

1093
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,840
Then back in the lab, what we can do today is

1094
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,040
we have robots that can build structures

1095
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,440
and can assemble more robots that build structures.

1096
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,280
We have finer resolution robots

1097
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,880
that can build micromechanical systems.

1098
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,840
So robots that can build robots that can walk and manipulate.

1099
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,920
And we're just now, we have a project at the layer below that

1100
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,720
where there's endless attention today

1101
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,200
to billion dollar chip fab investments.

1102
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,120
But a really interesting thing we pass through

1103
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,200
is today the smallest transistors you can buy

1104
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,400
as a single transistor, just commercially for electronics,

1105
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,760
is actually the size of an early transistor

1106
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,840
in an integrated circuit.

1107
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,600
So we're using these machines, making machines,

1108
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,360
making assemblers to place those parts

1109
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,360
to not use a billion dollar chip fab

1110
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,520
to make integrated circuits,

1111
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,160
but actually assemble little electronic components.

1112
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,880
So have a fine enough, precise enough actuators

1113
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,200
and manipulators that allow you to place these transistors.

1114
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,600
Right, that's a research project in my lab

1115
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,360
called DICE on Discrete Assembly of Integrated Electronics.

1116
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,920
And we're just at the point to really start

1117
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,480
to take seriously this notion

1118
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,400
of not having a chip fab make integrated electronics,

1119
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,840
but having not a 3D printer,

1120
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,120
but a thing that's a cross between a pick in place

1121
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,200
makes circuit boards in 2D.

1122
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,840
The 3D printer extrudes in 3D.

1123
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,040
We're making sort of a micromanipulator

1124
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,160
that acts like a printer,

1125
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,400
but it's placing to build electronics in 3D.

1126
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,440
But this micromanipulator is distributed,

1127
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,880
so there's a bunch of them, or is this one centralized thing?

1128
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,680
So that's why that's a great question.

1129
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,280
So I have a prize that's almost but not been claimed

1130
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,680
for the students whose thesis can walk out of the printer.

1131
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,640
Oh, nice.

1132
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,400
So you have to print the thesis with the means

1133
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,560
to exit the printer,

1134
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,840
and it has to contain its description of the thesis

1135
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,200
that says how to do that.

1136
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,760
It's a really good...

1137
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,680
I mean, it's a fun example of exactly

1138
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,520
the thing we're talking about.

1139
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,480
And I've had a few students almost get to that.

1140
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,920
And so in what I'm describing,

1141
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,400
there's this stack where we're getting closer,

1142
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,720
but it's still quite a few years to really go from us.

1143
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,840
So there's a layer below the transistors

1144
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,520
where we assemble the base materials

1145
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,200
that become the transistor.

1146
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,600
We're now just at the edge of assembling the transistors

1147
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,760
to make the circuits.

1148
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,640
We can assemble the micro parts to make the micro robots.

1149
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,640
We can assemble the bigger robots.

1150
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,600
And in the coming years,

1151
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,560
we'll be patching together all of those scales.

1152
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,560
So do you see a vision of just endless billions of robots

1153
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,920
at the different scales, self-assembling,

1154
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,880
self-replicating and building complicated structures?

1155
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,520
Yes.

1156
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,360
And the but to the yes, but is...

1157
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,960
Let me clarify two things.

1158
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,960
One is that immediately raises King Charles' fear

1159
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,040
of gray goo, of runaway mutant self-reproducing things.

1160
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,320
The reason why there are many things

1161
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,080
I can tell you to worry about,

1162
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,280
but that's not one of them,

1163
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,680
is if you want things to autonomously self-reproduce

1164
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,800
and take over the world,

1165
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,080
that means they need to compete with nature

1166
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,960
on using the resources of nature, of water and sunlight.

1167
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,640
And in light of everything I'm describing,

1168
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,960
biology knows everything I told you.

1169
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,560
Every single thing I explained,

1170
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,280
biology already knows how to do.

1171
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,480
What I'm describing isn't new for biology,

1172
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,920
it's new for non-biological systems.

1173
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,520
So in the digital era,

1174
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,800
the economic when ended up being centralized,

1175
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,680
the big platforms.

1176
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,320
In this world of machines that can make machines,

1177
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,960
I'm asked for example,

1178
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,560
what's the killer opportunity?

1179
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,640
Who's gonna make all the money?

1180
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,120
Who to invest in?

1181
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,000
But if the machine can make the machine,

1182
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,200
it's not a great business to invest in the machine.

1183
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:17,880
In the same way that if you can think globally,

1184
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,760
but produce locally,

1185
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,360
then the way the technology goes out into society

1186
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,160
isn't a function of central control,

1187
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,940
but is fundamentally distributed.

1188
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,680
Now, that raises an obvious kind of concern,

1189
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,800
which is well, doesn't this mean

1190
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,760
you could make bombs and guns and all of that?

1191
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,600
The reason that's much less of a problem than you would think

1192
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,920
is making bombs and guns and all of that

1193
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,280
is a very well-met market need.

1194
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,720
Anywhere we go, there's a fine supply chain for weapons.

1195
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,840
Now, hobbyists have been making guns for ages

1196
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,360
and guns are available just about anywhere.

1197
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,360
So you could go into the lab and make a gun.

1198
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,440
Today, it's not a very good gun

1199
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,160
and guns are easily available.

1200
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,240
And so generally, we've run these lab and war zones.

1201
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,080
What we find is people don't go to them to make weapons,

1202
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,480
which you can already do anyway.

1203
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,600
It's an alternative to making weapons.

1204
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,800
Coming back to your question,

1205
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,880
I'd say the single most important thing I've learned is

1206
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,040
the greatest natural resource of the planet

1207
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,120
is this amazing density of bright invent of people

1208
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,640
whose brains are underused.

1209
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,640
And you could view the social engineering of this lab work

1210
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,440
is creating the capacity for them.

1211
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,120
And so in the end, the way this is gonna impact society

1212
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,920
isn't gonna be command and control.

1213
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,000
It's how the world uses it.

1214
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,560
And it's been really gratifying for me

1215
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,800
to see just how it does.

1216
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,160
Yeah, but what are the different ways

1217
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,920
the evolution of the exponential scaling

1218
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,760
of digital fabrication can evolve?

1219
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,760
So you said, yeah, self replicating nanobots, right?

1220
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,720
This is the gray goo fear.

1221
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,800
It's a caricature of a fear,

1222
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,720
but nevertheless, there's interesting,

1223
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,600
just like you said, spam and all these kinds of things

1224
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,080
that came with the scaling of communication and computation.

1225
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,920
What are the different ways

1226
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,120
that malevolent actors will use this technology?

1227
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,680
Yeah, well, first, let me start with a benevolent story,

1228
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,720
which is trash is an analog concept.

1229
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,800
There's no trash in a forest.

1230
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,520
All the parts get disassembled and reused.

1231
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,560
Trash means something doesn't have enough information

1232
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,960
to tell you how to reuse it.

1233
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,400
It's as simple as there's no trash in a Lego room.

1234
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,760
When you assemble Lego,

1235
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,880
the Lego bricks have enough information to disassemble them.

1236
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,320
So as you go through this fab one, two, three, four story,

1237
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,200
one of the implications of this transition

1238
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,720
to from printing to assembling.

1239
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,280
So the real breakthrough technologically

1240
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,280
isn't additive versus subtractive,

1241
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,400
which is a subject of a lot of attention and hype.

1242
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,040
3D printers are useful.

1243
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,960
We spun off companies like form labs

1244
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,840
led by Max for 3D printing.

1245
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,400
But in a fab lab, it's one of maybe 10 machines.

1246
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,140
It's used, but it's only part of the machines.

1247
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,060
The real technological change is when we go from printing

1248
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:22,220
and cutting to assembling and disassembling.

1249
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,580
But that reduces inventories of hundreds of thousands

1250
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,260
of parts to just having a few parts

1251
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,860
to make almost anything.

1252
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,880
It reduces global supply chains

1253
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,180
to locally sourcing these building blocks.

1254
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,980
But one of the key implications is it gets rid

1255
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,820
of technological trash because you can disassemble

1256
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,260
and reuse the parts, not throw them away.

1257
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,900
And so initially that's of interest for things

1258
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,720
at the end of long supply chains, like satellites on orbit.

1259
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,700
But one of the things coming is eliminating technical trash

1260
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,420
through reuse of the building blocks.

1261
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,840
So like when you think about 3D printers,

1262
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,960
you're thinking about addition and subtraction

1263
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,660
when you think about the other options available to you

1264
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,820
in that parameter space as you call it,

1265
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,540
that's going to be assembly, this assembly cutting you said.

1266
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:14,540
So the 1952 NC mill was subtractive, you remove material.

1267
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,140
And 3D printing additive, and there's a couple of claims

1268
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,820
to the invention of 3D printing,

1269
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,660
that's closer to what's called net shape,

1270
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,500
which is you don't have to cut away the material

1271
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,700
you don't need, you just put material where you do need it.

1272
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,140
And so that's the 3D printing revolution.

1273
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,620
But there are all sorts of limitations on 3D printing

1274
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,220
to the kinds of materials you can print,

1275
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,420
of kind of functionality you can print.

1276
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,620
We're just not going to get to making a,

1277
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,860
everything in a cell phone on a single printer,

1278
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,160
but I do expect to make everything in a cell phone

1279
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,180
with an assembler.

1280
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,380
And so instead of printing and cutting technologically,

1281
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,780
it's this transition to assembling and disassembling,

1282
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,300
going back to Shannon and Van Neumann,

1283
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,500
going back to the ribosome four billion years ago.

1284
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,420
Now you come to malevolent.

1285
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,020
Let me tell you a story about,

1286
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:14,020
I was doing a briefing for the National Academy

1287
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:19,060
of Sciences group that advises the intelligence communities.

1288
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,740
And I talked about the kind of research we do.

1289
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,940
And at the very end, I showed a little video clip

1290
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,660
of Valentina and Ghana making a local girl

1291
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,460
making surface mount electronics in the fab lab.

1292
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,380
And I showed that to this room full of people.

1293
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,140
One of the members of the intelligence community

1294
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,180
got up livid and said,

1295
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,660
how dare you waste our time showing us a young girl

1296
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,540
in an African village making surface mount electronics.

1297
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,060
We're looking at, we need to know about disruptive threats

1298
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,820
to the future of the United States.

1299
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,700
And somebody else got up in the room and yelled at him,

1300
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,500
and you idiot, I can't think of anything more important

1301
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,860
than this, but for two reasons.

1302
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,420
One reason was because if we rely

1303
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,620
on like informational superiority in the battlefield,

1304
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,020
it means other people could get access to it.

1305
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,060
But this intelligence person's point, bless him,

1306
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:20,060
wasn't that it was getting at the root causes of conflict

1307
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,300
is if this young girl in an African village

1308
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,140
could actually master surface mount electronics,

1309
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,140
it changes some of the most fundamental things

1310
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,980
about recruitment for terrorism,

1311
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,020
impact of economic migration,

1312
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,940
basic assumptions about an economy.

1313
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,700
It's just existential for the future of the planet.

1314
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,780
But we've just lived through a pandemic.

1315
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,460
I would love to linger on this

1316
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,460
because the possibilities that are positive are endless,

1317
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,100
but the possibilities are negative

1318
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,420
are still nevertheless extremely important.

1319
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,540
Well, it's both positive and negative.

1320
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:01,540
What do you do with a large number of general assemblers?

1321
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,140
Yeah, with the fab lab,

1322
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,940
you could roughly make a bio lab,

1323
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,540
then learn biotechnology.

1324
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,660
Now, that's terrifying because making self-reproducing

1325
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:14,300
gray goo that outcompetes biology,

1326
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,540
I consider doom because biology knows everything

1327
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,940
I'm describing and is really good at what it does.

1328
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,860
In how to grow almost anything,

1329
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,980
you learn skills in biotechnology

1330
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:32,860
that let you make serious biological threats.

1331
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,580
And when you combine some of the innovations

1332
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,180
you see with large language models,

1333
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,740
some of the innovations you see with AlphaFold,

1334
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,940
so applications of AI for designing biological systems

1335
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,020
for writing programs,

1336
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,300
which you can have a large language models increasingly.

1337
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,100
So there seems to be an interesting dance here

1338
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:58,100
of automating the design stage of complex systems using AI.

1339
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,500
And then that's the bits.

1340
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,260
And you can leap now, the innovations you're talking about,

1341
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,580
you can leap from the complex systems in the digital space

1342
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,620
to the printing, to the creation, to the assembly

1343
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,220
at scale of complex systems in the physical space.

1344
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,540
Yeah, so something to be scared about

1345
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,380
is a fab lab can make a biolab,

1346
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,540
a biolab can make biotechnology,

1347
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,980
somebody could learn to make a virus.

1348
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,060
That's scary.

1349
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,860
That's unlike some of the things I said,

1350
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,780
I don't worry about that's something

1351
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,100
I really worry about that is scary.

1352
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,980
Now, how do you deal with that?

1353
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:45,580
Prior threats we dealt with command and control.

1354
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,980
So like early color copiers had unique codes

1355
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,620
and you could tell which copier made them.

1356
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,420
Eventually you couldn't keep up with that.

1357
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,500
There was a famous meeting at Asilomar

1358
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,580
in the early days of recombinant DNA,

1359
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:06,500
where that community recognized the dangers

1360
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,780
of what it was doing and put in place a regime

1361
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,260
to help manage it.

1362
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,580
And so that led to the kind of research management.

1363
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,100
MIT has an office that supervises research

1364
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,860
and it works with the national office.

1365
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,500
That works if you can identify who's doing it and where.

1366
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,420
It doesn't work in this world we're describing.

1367
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,900
So anybody could do this anywhere.

1368
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:33,900
And so what we found is you can't contain this,

1369
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,060
it's already out, you can't forbid

1370
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,260
because there isn't command and control.

1371
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,540
The most useful thing you can do

1372
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,340
is provide incentives for transparency.

1373
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,380
So, but really the heart of what we do is

1374
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,500
you could do this by yourself in a basement

1375
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,900
for nefarious reasons,

1376
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,140
or you could come into a place in the light

1377
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,900
where you get help and you get community

1378
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,580
and you get resources.

1379
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:02,540
And there's an incentive to do it in the open,

1380
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,500
not in the dark.

1381
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,300
And that might sound naive,

1382
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,220
but in the sort of places we're working,

1383
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,260
so again, bad people do bad things in these places already,

1384
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,780
but providing openness and providing transparency

1385
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,460
is a key part of managing these.

1386
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,860
And so it transitions from regulating risks

1387
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:30,060
as regulation to soft power to manage them.

1388
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,020
So there's so much potential for good,

1389
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:35,340
so much capacity for good that Fab Labs

1390
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:40,420
and the ability and the tools of creation

1391
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,820
really unlock that potential.

1392
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:48,140
Yeah, and I don't say that as sort of dewy-eyed naive,

1393
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,100
I say that empirically from just years

1394
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,740
of seeing how this plays out in communities.

1395
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,340
I wonder if it's the early days of personal computers though,

1396
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,420
before we get spam, right?

1397
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:00,700
In the end, most fundamentally,

1398
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,340
literally the mother of all problems

1399
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,820
is who designed us.

1400
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,900
So assume success

1401
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,860
in that we're gonna transition to the machines,

1402
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,060
making the machines,

1403
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,300
and all of these new sort of social systems we're describing

1404
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,660
will help manage them and curate them and democratize them.

1405
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,580
If we close the gap I just let off with

1406
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:33,580
of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18 between Chip Fab and you,

1407
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,820
we're ultimately in marrying communication,

1408
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,340
computation, and fabrication

1409
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,260
gonna be able to create unimaginable complexity.

1410
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:48,260
And how do you design that?

1411
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:53,260
And so I'd say the deepest of all questions

1412
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,820
that I've been working on is,

1413
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,540
goes back to the oldest part of our genome.

1414
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:05,540
So in our genome, what are called Hox genes,

1415
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:09,700
and these are morphogenes,

1416
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:15,620
and nowhere in your genome is the number five.

1417
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,580
It doesn't store the fact that you have five fingers.

1418
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,460
What it stores is what's called a developmental program.

1419
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,300
It's a series of steps,

1420
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,820
and the steps have the character of like,

1421
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,460
grow up a gradient or break symmetry.

1422
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,580
And at the end of that developmental program,

1423
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,540
you have five fingers.

1424
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:39,540
So you are stored not as a body plan,

1425
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,540
but as a growth plan.

1426
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,540
And there's two reasons for that.

1427
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,660
One reason is just compression.

1428
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,980
Billions of genes can place trillions of cells,

1429
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,460
but the much deeper one is evolution

1430
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,420
doesn't randomly perturb.

1431
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,700
Almost anything you did randomly in the genome

1432
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,980
would be fatal or inconsequential, but not interesting.

1433
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:11,080
But when you modify things in these developmental programs,

1434
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,260
you go from like webs for swimming to fingers,

1435
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,220
or you go from walking to wings for flying.

1436
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,740
It's a space in which search is interesting.

1437
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:24,740
So this is the heart of the success of AI.

1438
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:30,700
In part, it was the scaling we talked about a while ago.

1439
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,940
And in part, it was the representations

1440
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,060
for which search is effective.

1441
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:41,620
AI has found good representations.

1442
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,060
It hasn't found new ways to search,

1443
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,540
but it's found good representations of search.

1444
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,300
You're saying that's what biology,

1445
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,860
that's what evolution has done,

1446
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:52,580
is creative representations, structures,

1447
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:56,260
biological structures through which search is effective.

1448
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,340
And so the developmental programs in the genome

1449
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,420
beautifully encapsulate the lessons of AI.

1450
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:08,700
And it's molecular intelligence.

1451
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,740
It's AI embodied in our genome.

1452
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:16,500
It's every bit as profound as the cognition in our brain,

1453
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,660
but now this is sort of thinking in molecular thinking

1454
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,460
in how you design.

1455
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,140
And so I'd say the most fundamental problem we're working on

1456
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,740
is it's kind of tautological

1457
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:33,420
that when you design a phone, you design the phone.

1458
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,340
You represent the design of the phone.

1459
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,380
But that actually fails when you get

1460
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,420
to the sort of complexity that we're talking about.

1461
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,500
And so there's this profound transition to come.

1462
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,300
Once I can have self-reproducing assemblers

1463
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,580
placing 10 to the 18 parts,

1464
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:54,420
you need to not sort of metaphorically, but create life

1465
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,660
in that you need to learn how to evolve.

1466
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,820
But evolutionary design has a really misleading,

1467
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,460
trivial meaning.

1468
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,500
It's not as simple as you randomly mutate things.

1469
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,100
It's this much more deep embodiment of AI

1470
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,820
and morphogenesis.

1471
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,340
Is there a way for us to continue the kind of evolutionary

1472
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,020
design that led us to this place

1473
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,820
from the early days of bacteria, single cell organism,

1474
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,500
to ribosomes and the 20 amino acids?

1475
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,900
You mean for human augmentation or?

1476
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,060
For life augment.

1477
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,620
I mean, what would you call assemblers

1478
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,620
that are self-replicating and placing parts?

1479
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,460
What is that?

1480
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:39,460
The dynamic complex things built with digital fabrication.

1481
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,700
What is that?

1482
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,540
That's life.

1483
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:44,180
Yeah, so ultimately, absolutely,

1484
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,580
if you add up everything I'm talking about,

1485
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:51,500
it's building up to creating life in non-living materials.

1486
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:56,100
And I don't view this as copying life.

1487
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,260
I view it as driving life.

1488
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,780
I didn't start from how does biology work

1489
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,660
and then I'm gonna copy it.

1490
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,980
I start from how to solve problems

1491
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:09,700
and then it leads me to, in a sense, rediscover biology.

1492
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:13,060
So if we go back to Valentina in Ghana

1493
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,100
making her circuit board,

1494
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,140
she still needs a chip fab very far away

1495
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,900
to make the processor on her circuit board.

1496
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,700
For her to make the processor locally

1497
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,820
for all the reasons we described,

1498
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,980
you actually need the deep things

1499
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,380
we were just talking about.

1500
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:32,140
And so it really does lead you.

1501
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:37,140
So there's a wonderful series of books by Gingery.

1502
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,180
Book one is how to make a charcoal furnace

1503
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:44,700
and at the end of book seven, you have a machine shop.

1504
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,820
So it's sort of how you do your own

1505
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,340
personal industrial revolution.

1506
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:55,020
ISRU is what NASA calls in situ resource utilization.

1507
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,740
And that's how do you go to a planet

1508
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,860
and create a civilization?

1509
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,820
ISRU has essentially assumed Gingery.

1510
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,860
You go through the industrial revolution

1511
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,540
and you create the inventory of 100,000 resistors.

1512
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,500
What we're finding is the way,

1513
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,660
the minimum building blocks for a civilization

1514
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,900
is roughly 20 parts.

1515
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,780
So what's interesting about the amino acids

1516
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,380
is they're not interesting.

1517
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,780
They're hydrophobic or hydrophilic, basic or acidic.

1518
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,420
They have typical but not extremal properties

1519
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:29,700
but they're good enough you can combine them to make you.

1520
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,020
So what this is leading towards is technology

1521
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:36,980
doesn't need enormous global supply chains.

1522
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,180
It just needs about 20 properties you can compose

1523
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:43,780
to create all technology as the minimum building blocks

1524
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,940
for a technological civilization.

1525
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:49,460
So there's going to be 20 basic building blocks

1526
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,940
based on which the self-replicating assemblers can work.

1527
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,220
Right, and I say that not philosophically,

1528
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,420
just empirically, sort of that's where it's heading.

1529
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,780
And I like thinking about

1530
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,860
how you bootstrap a civilization on Mars, that problem.

1531
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,260
There's a fun video on bonus material for the movie

1532
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,580
where we're with a neat group of people we talk about it

1533
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,740
because it has really profound implications

1534
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,300
back here on earth about how we live sustainably.

1535
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,740
What does that civilization on Mars looks like

1536
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,940
that's using ISRU,

1537
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,140
that's using these 20 building blocks and does self-assembly?

1538
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:27,220
Yeah, go through primary secondary tertiary, quaternary.

1539
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:33,860
You extract properties like conducting, insulating,

1540
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:39,060
semi-conducting, magnetic, dielectric, flexural.

1541
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,060
These are the kind of roughly 20 properties.

1542
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:49,380
With those, those are enough for us to assemble logic

1543
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,540
and they're enough for us to assemble actuation.

1544
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,700
With logic and actuation, we can make micro-robots.

1545
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:03,300
The micro-robots can build bigger robots.

1546
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:07,620
The bigger robots can then take the building block materials

1547
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,460
and make the structural elements

1548
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,500
that you then do to make construction

1549
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,060
and then you boot up through the stages

1550
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,380
of a technological civilization.

1551
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,540
By the way, where in the span of logic and actuation

1552
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,380
did the sensing come in?

1553
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,500
Oh, I skipped over that.

1554
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:28,500
But my favorite sensor is a step response.

1555
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,260
So if you just make a step

1556
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,740
and measure the response to the electric field,

1557
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,220
that ranges from user interfaces

1558
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,020
to positioning to material properties.

1559
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,300
And if you do it at higher frequencies, you get chemistry.

1560
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,380
And you can get all of that just from a step

1561
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,860
in an electric field.

1562
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:51,860
So for example, once you have time resolution in logic,

1563
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,620
something as simple as two electrodes

1564
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:58,220
let you do amazingly capable sensing.

1565
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,660
So we've been talking about all the work I do.

1566
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:04,380
There's a story about how it happens.

1567
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,500
Where do ideas come from?

1568
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,540
That's an interesting story.

1569
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,580
Where do ideas come from?

1570
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:12,180
So I had mentioned Vannevar Bush

1571
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,980
and he wrote a really influential thing

1572
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,540
called the Endless Frontier.

1573
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:22,260
So science won World War II.

1574
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:26,380
The more known story is Nuclear Bombs.

1575
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,940
The less well-known story is the Rad Lab.

1576
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,700
So at MIT, an amazing group of people invented radar

1577
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,300
which is really credited as winning the war.

1578
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,500
So after the war, a grand old man from MIT

1579
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,500
and it was charged with science won the war,

1580
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:48,300
how do we maintain that edge?

1581
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,620
And the report he wrote led to

1582
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,540
the National Science Foundation

1583
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,420
and the modern notion we take for granted

1584
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,140
but didn't really exist before then

1585
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:01,640
of public funding of research or research agencies.

1586
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:06,100
In it, he made again what I consider

1587
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:11,100
an important mistake, which is he described basic research

1588
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,100
leads to applied research, leads to applications,

1589
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,580
leads to commercialization, leads to impact.

1590
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,820
And so we need to invest in that pipeline.

1591
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,980
The reason I considered a mistake

1592
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,920
is almost all of the examples we've been talking about

1593
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,320
in my lab went backwards,

1594
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:37,580
that the basic research came from applications.

1595
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,660
And further, almost all of the examples

1596
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,980
we've been talking about came fundamentally

1597
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,300
from mistakes.

1598
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,300
So essentially everything I've ever worked on has failed

1599
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,140
but in failing, something better happened.

1600
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:00,180
So the way I like to describe it is ready, aim, fire

1601
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:04,620
is you do your homework, you aim carefully

1602
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,980
at a target you want to accomplish.

1603
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,140
And if everything goes right,

1604
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,300
you then hit the target and succeed.

1605
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,140
What I do, you can think of as ready, fire, aim.

1606
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,220
So you do a lot of work to get ready,

1607
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,960
then you close your eyes

1608
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,700
and you don't really think about where you're aiming

1609
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,900
but you look very carefully at where you did aim,

1610
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:29,060
where you aim after you fire.

1611
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,940
And the reason that's so important is

1612
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,980
if you do ready, aim, fire,

1613
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:38,540
there's the best you can hope is hit what you aim at.

1614
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,580
So let me give you some examples.

1615
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:43,580
Because this is a source of great...

1616
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,500
You're full of good lines today.

1617
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,220
...source of great frustration.

1618
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:51,300
So I mentioned the early quantum computing.

1619
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,740
So quantum computing is this power of using quantum mechanics

1620
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,860
to make computers that for some problems

1621
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:01,020
are dramatically more powerful than classical computers.

1622
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,780
Before it started,

1623
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,260
there was a really interesting group of people

1624
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,540
who knew a lot about physics and computing

1625
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,620
that were inventing what became quantum computing

1626
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,180
before it was clear anything,

1627
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,620
there was an opportunity there.

1628
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,380
It was just studying how those relate.

1629
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,020
Here's how it fits to the ready, fire, aim,

1630
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,280
in that I was doing really short-term work in my lab

1631
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,980
on shoplifting tags.

1632
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,980
This was really before there was modern RFID.

1633
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:35,460
And so how you put tags in objects to sense them,

1634
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,540
something we just take for granted commercially.

1635
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,660
And there was a problem of how you can sense

1636
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,540
multiple objects at the same time.

1637
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:47,980
And so I was studying how you can remotely sense materials

1638
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,300
to make low-cost tags

1639
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,740
that could let you distinguish multiple objects simultaneously.

1640
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,980
To do that, you need non-linearity

1641
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,260
so that the signal is modulated.

1642
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,980
And so I was looking for material sources of non-linearity

1643
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:07,980
and that led me to look at how nuclear spins interact,

1644
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:13,060
just for spin resonance,

1645
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:17,380
the sort of things you use when you go in an MRI machine.

1646
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,460
And so I was studying how to use that.

1647
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,980
And it turns out that it was a bad idea.

1648
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:26,980
You couldn't remotely use it for shoplifting tags.

1649
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,260
But I realized you could compute.

1650
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:36,260
And so with a group of colleagues thinking

1651
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,060
about early quantum computing,

1652
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,980
like David D. Vincenzo and Charlie Bennett

1653
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:43,220
was articulating what are the properties you need to compute?

1654
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,500
And then looking at how to make the tags,

1655
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,300
it turns out the tags were a terrible idea

1656
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:53,300
for sensing objects in a supermarket checkout.

1657
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,500
But I realized they were computing.

1658
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,580
So with Ike Chuang and a few other people,

1659
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:02,220
we realized we could program nuclear spins to compute.

1660
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,700
And so that's what we used to do Grover's search algorithm

1661
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,980
and then it was used for a Shores factoring algorithm.

1662
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,260
And it worked out,

1663
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,940
the systems we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance

1664
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:15,860
don't scale beyond a few qubits,

1665
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,180
but the techniques have lived on.

1666
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:22,020
And so all the current quantum computing techniques

1667
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,460
grew out of the ways we would talk to these spins,

1668
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,340
but I'm telling this whole story

1669
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,260
because it came from a bad way to make a shoplifting tag.

1670
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,020
Starting with an application,

1671
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:37,900
mistakes led to break through fundamental science.

1672
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,420
I mean, can you just link on that?

1673
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,620
I mean, just using nuclear spins to do computation

1674
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:48,620
that like what gave you the guts to try

1675
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:53,100
to think through this from a digital fabrication perspective

1676
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,020
actually, how to leap from one to the other.

1677
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:55,900
I wouldn't call it guts.

1678
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,140
I would call it collaboration.

1679
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:02,140
So at IBM, there was this amazing group of like,

1680
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,060
I mentioned Charlie Bennett and David DiVincenzo

1681
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,260
and Ralph Landau and Nabil Amir.

1682
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,740
And these were all gods of thinking

1683
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:13,060
about physics and computing.

1684
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:18,060
So I yelled at the whole computer industry

1685
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:22,900
being based on a fiction, metropolis.

1686
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,340
Programmers frolicking in the garden

1687
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,420
while somebody moves levers in the basement.

1688
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,820
There's a complete parallel history

1689
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:33,820
of Maxwell de Boltzmann does a lard

1690
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:37,140
to Landau or to Bennett.

1691
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,300
Most people won't know most of these names,

1692
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,060
but this whole parallel history thinking deeply

1693
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,420
about how computation and physics relate.

1694
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:48,780
So I was collaborating with that whole group of people.

1695
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:53,460
And then at MIT, I was in this high traffic environment.

1696
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,380
I wasn't deeply inspired to think about better ways

1697
01:20:56,380 --> 01:21:00,180
to detect shoplifting tags, but stumbled across companies

1698
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,740
that needed help with that and was thinking about it.

1699
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:05,260
And then I realized those two worlds intersected

1700
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,740
and we could use the failed approach

1701
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:12,740
for the shoplifting tags to make early quantum computing

1702
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,700
algorithms.

1703
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,300
And this kind of stumbling is fundamental

1704
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,140
to the fab lab idea, right?

1705
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:18,980
Right.

1706
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,040
Here's one more example.

1707
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,060
With a student, Manu, we talked about ribosomes

1708
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,940
and I was trying to build a ribosome

1709
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,820
that worked on fluids so that I could place

1710
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,900
the little parts we're talking about.

1711
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:35,540
And it kept failing because bubbles would come

1712
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,380
into our system and the bubbles would make

1713
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,020
the whole thing stop working.

1714
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,740
And we spent about half a year trying to get rid

1715
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,340
of the bubbles.

1716
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,220
Then Manu said, wait a minute,

1717
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:47,340
the bubbles are actually better than what we're doing.

1718
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,780
We should just use the bubbles.

1719
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:52,460
And so we invented how to do universal object

1720
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,740
logic with little bubbles and fluid.

1721
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:59,700
Okay, you have to explain this microfluidic bubble logic.

1722
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,060
Please, how does this work?

1723
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,900
So, yeah, it's super interesting.

1724
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,580
Yeah, and so I'll come back and explain it.

1725
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:10,660
But what it led to was we showed fluids could do,

1726
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,940
it'd been known fluid could do logic.

1727
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:17,540
Like your old automobile transmissions do logic,

1728
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,660
but that's macroscopic.

1729
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,980
It didn't work at little scales.

1730
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:20,980
We showed with these bubbles,

1731
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,860
we could do it at little scales.

1732
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,580
Then I'm gonna come back and explain it.

1733
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:27,380
But what came out of that is Manu then showed

1734
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:31,060
you could make a 50 cent microscope using little bubbles.

1735
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:33,820
And then the techniques we developed

1736
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,500
are what we used to transplant genomes

1737
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,940
to make synthetic life all came out of the failure

1738
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:43,740
of trying to make the genome, the ribosome.

1739
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,620
Now, so the way the bubble logic works is

1740
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:52,620
in a little channel, fluid at small scales

1741
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,780
is fairly viscous.

1742
01:22:56,780 --> 01:23:00,180
It's sort of like pushing Jell-O, think of it as.

1743
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,820
If a bubble gets stuck, the fluid has to detour around it.

1744
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:12,980
So now imagine a channel that has two wells and one bubble.

1745
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,660
If the bubble is in one well,

1746
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,340
the fluid has to go in the other channel.

1747
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,620
If the fluid is in the other well,

1748
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,780
it has to go in the first channel.

1749
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:26,780
So the position of the bubble can switch,

1750
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,820
it's a switch, it can switch the fluid between two channels.

1751
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:33,020
So now we have one element, a switch.

1752
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,260
And it's also a memory because you can detect

1753
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,740
whether or not a bubble is stored there.

1754
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:41,100
Then if two bubbles meet,

1755
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,860
if you have two channels crossing,

1756
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,780
a bubble can go through one way

1757
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,700
or a bubble can go through the other way.

1758
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,380
But if two bubbles come together,

1759
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,700
then they push on each other and one goes one way

1760
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,100
and one goes the other way.

1761
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,180
That's a logic operation, that's a logic gate.

1762
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,940
So we now have a switch, we have a memory

1763
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,980
and we have a logic gate,

1764
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,180
and that's everything you need to make

1765
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,940
a universal computer.

1766
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,300
I mean, the fact that you did that with bubbles

1767
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,220
and microfluid just kind of,

1768
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,180
kind of brilliant.

1769
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,860
Well, so to stay with that example,

1770
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:20,100
what we proposed to do was to make a fluid ribosome

1771
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,300
and the project crashed and burned, it was a disaster.

1772
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,220
This is what came out of it.

1773
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:30,700
And so it was precisely ready fire aim

1774
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,820
in that we had to do a lot of homework

1775
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:36,020
to be able to make these microfluidic systems.

1776
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,980
The fire part was we didn't think too hard

1777
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,060
about making the ribosome,

1778
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:41,500
we just tried to do it.

1779
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,860
The aim part was we realized the ribosome failed

1780
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:45,540
but something better had happened.

1781
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,740
And if you look all across research funding,

1782
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:53,460
research management, it doesn't anticipate this.

1783
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,340
So fail fast is familiar,

1784
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:01,100
but fail fast tends to miss ready and aim.

1785
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,220
You can't just fail.

1786
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:05,260
You have to do your homework before the fail part

1787
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,060
and you have to do the aim part after the fail part.

1788
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,980
And so the whole language of research

1789
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,180
is about like milestones and deliverables.

1790
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,980
That works when you're going down a straight line

1791
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,580
but it doesn't work for this kind of discovery.

1792
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:20,220
And to leap to something you said that's really important

1793
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,940
is I view part of what the fab lab network is doing

1794
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:28,940
is giving more people the opportunity to fail.

1795
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:34,020
You've said that geometry is really important in biology.

1796
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:39,900
What does fabrication biology look like?

1797
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,820
Why is geometry important?

1798
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:46,420
So molecular biology is dominated by geometry.

1799
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,420
That's why the protein folding is so important

1800
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:53,220
that the geometry gives the function.

1801
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,980
And there's this hierarchical construction

1802
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,220
of as you go through primary, secondary, tertiary,

1803
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,300
the shapes of the molecules

1804
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,900
make the shape of the molecular machines.

1805
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,980
And they really are exquisite machines.

1806
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:12,980
If you look at how your muscles move,

1807
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,540
if you were to see a simulation of it,

1808
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:19,940
it would look like a improbable science fiction cyborg world

1809
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,300
of these little walking robots

1810
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,060
that walk on a discrete lattice

1811
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,220
that they're really exquisite machines.

1812
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:29,460
And then from there, this whole hierarchical stack

1813
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,220
of once you get to the top of that,

1814
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,020
you then start making organelles that make cells

1815
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:39,420
that make organs through the stack of that hierarchy.

1816
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,540
Just stepping back, does it amaze you

1817
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,380
that from small building blocks

1818
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:49,300
where amino acids you mentioned, molecules,

1819
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,420
let's go to the very beginning of hydrogen and helium

1820
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,060
at the start of this universe,

1821
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:57,580
that we're able to build up such complex

1822
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,740
and beautiful things like our human brain.

1823
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:04,780
So studying thermodynamics,

1824
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:10,660
which is exactly the question of batteries run out

1825
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:17,420
and need recharging, equipment, cars get old and fail,

1826
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:22,980
cars get old and fail, yet life doesn't.

1827
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,420
And that's why there's a sense

1828
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:28,860
in which life seems to violate thermodynamics,

1829
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:30,140
although of course it doesn't.

1830
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:33,340
It seems to resist the March towards entropy somehow.

1831
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,500
Right, and so Maxwell,

1832
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,900
who helped give rise to the science of thermodynamics,

1833
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:45,620
posited a problem that was so infuriating,

1834
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,100
it led to a series of suicides.

1835
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,460
There was a series of advisors and advisees,

1836
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:56,700
three in a row that all ended up committing suicide

1837
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,140
that happened to work on this problem.

1838
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:04,140
And Maxwell's demon is this simple but infamous problem

1839
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:11,620
where right now in this room we're surrounded by molecules

1840
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,620
and they run at different velocities.

1841
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:18,540
Imagine a container that has a wall

1842
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,660
and it's got gas on both sides and a little door.

1843
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:26,060
And if the door is a molecular sized creature

1844
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,340
and it could watch the molecules coming

1845
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,380
and when a fast molecule is coming, it opens the door.

1846
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,940
When a slow molecule is coming, it closes the door.

1847
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:38,180
After it does that for a while, one side is hot,

1848
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,220
one is cold.

1849
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,700
When something is hot and it's cold, you can make an engine.

1850
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,980
And so you close that, you make an engine and you make energy.

1851
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:51,660
So the demon is violating thermodynamics

1852
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:55,140
because it's never touching the molecule.

1853
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,660
Yet by just opening and closing the door,

1854
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:03,660
it can make arbitrary amounts of energy and power a machine.

1855
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,380
And in thermodynamics, you can't do that.

1856
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,740
So that's Maxwell's demon.

1857
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:13,020
That problem is connected to everything we just spoke about

1858
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,300
for the last few hours.

1859
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:25,300
So Leo Zalard around early 1900s was a deep physicist

1860
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:33,300
who then had a lot to do with also post-war anti-nuclear things.

1861
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:38,780
But he reduced Maxwell's demon to a single molecule.

1862
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:41,740
So the molecule, there's only one molecule

1863
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,940
and the question is which side of the partition is it on.

1864
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:48,980
That led to the idea of one bit of information.

1865
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:53,580
So Shannon credited Zalard's analysis of Maxwell's demon

1866
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,380
for the invention of the bit.

1867
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:00,940
For many years, people tried to explain Maxwell's demon

1868
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:05,780
by like the energy in the demon looking at the molecule

1869
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:08,500
or the energy to open and close the door

1870
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,060
and nothing ever made sense.

1871
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:14,540
Finally, Rolf Landauer, one of the colleagues

1872
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:18,380
I mentioned at IBM, finally solved the problem.

1873
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,940
He showed that you can explain Maxwell's demon

1874
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:27,140
by you need the mind of the demon.

1875
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:32,940
When the demon open and closes the door,

1876
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,340
as long as it remembers what it did,

1877
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:38,740
you can run the whole thing backwards.

1878
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:45,140
But when the demon forgets, then you can't run it backwards

1879
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:49,140
and that's where you get dissipation

1880
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,940
and that's where you get the violation of thermodynamics.

1881
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,540
And so the explanation of Maxwell's demon

1882
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,740
is that it's in the demon's brain.

1883
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:02,300
So then Rolf's colleague, Charlie at IBM,

1884
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:07,380
then shock Rolf by showing you can compute

1885
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,100
with arbitrarily low energy.

1886
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:13,260
So one of the things that's not well covered

1887
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,260
is the big computers used for big machine learning,

1888
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:22,100
the data centers use tens of megawatts of power,

1889
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,820
they use as much power as a city.

1890
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:27,780
Charlie showed you can actually compute

1891
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,860
with arbitrarily low amounts of energy

1892
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,140
by making computers that can go backwards

1893
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:34,540
as well as forwards.

1894
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:39,180
And what limits the speed of the computer

1895
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,380
is how fast you want an answer

1896
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,100
and how certain you want the answer to be.

1897
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,500
But we're orders of magnitude away from that.

1898
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,380
So I have a student Cameron working with Lincoln Labs

1899
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,180
on making superconducting computers

1900
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,860
that operate near this land hour limit

1901
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,900
that are orders of magnitude more efficient.

1902
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,900
So stepping back to all of that,

1903
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:05,700
that whole tour was driven by your question about life.

1904
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:10,060
And right at the heart of it is Maxwell's demon.

1905
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:14,380
Life exists because it can locally violate thermodynamics.

1906
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:16,500
It can locally violate thermodynamics

1907
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:21,500
because of intelligence and it's molecular intelligence

1908
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:25,740
that I would even go out on a limb to say,

1909
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:28,180
we can already see we're beginning to come

1910
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:32,260
to the end of this current AI phase.

1911
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,020
So depending on how you count,

1912
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,940
this is I'd say the fifth AI boom bus cycle.

1913
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,180
And you can already, it's exploding,

1914
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,860
but you can already see where it's heading,

1915
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:46,900
how it's going to saturate what happens on the far side.

1916
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:50,940
The big thing that's not yet on horizons

1917
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:55,940
is embodied AI, molecular intelligence.

1918
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,980
So to step back to this AI story,

1919
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:05,100
there was automation and that was gonna change everything.

1920
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,100
Then there were expert systems.

1921
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:13,980
There was then the first phase of the neural network systems.

1922
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,580
There've been about five of these

1923
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:19,340
in each case on the slope up,

1924
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:21,020
it's gonna change everything.

1925
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,800
Each case what happens is on the slope down,

1926
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:28,340
we sort of move the goal posts

1927
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:29,940
and it becomes sort of irrelevant.

1928
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:33,260
So a good example is going up,

1929
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,340
computer chess was gonna change everything.

1930
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,620
Once computers could play chess,

1931
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:38,540
that fundamentally changes the world.

1932
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:41,540
Now on the downside, computers play chess.

1933
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,460
Winning at chess is no longer seen as a unique human thing,

1934
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:48,180
but people still play chess.

1935
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:51,260
This new phase is gonna take a new chunk of things

1936
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,020
that we thought computers couldn't do.

1937
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,500
Now computers will be able to do,

1938
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,420
they have roughly our brain capacity,

1939
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:01,180
but we'll keep thinking as well as computers.

1940
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,740
And as I described,

1941
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:06,060
while we've been going through these five boom busts,

1942
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,500
if you just look at the numbers of ops per second,

1943
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,660
bits storage, bits of IO,

1944
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:11,940
that's the more interesting one.

1945
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:12,940
That's been steady,

1946
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,980
and that's what finally caught up to people.

1947
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,940
But as we've talked about a couple of times,

1948
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:20,740
there's eight orders of magnitude to go,

1949
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:24,180
not in the intelligence in the transistors or in the brain,

1950
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,860
but in the embodied intelligence,

1951
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,500
in the intelligence in our body.

1952
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,540
So the intelligent constructions of physical systems

1953
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,700
that would embody the intelligence

1954
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,860
versus contain it within the computation.

1955
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:38,220
Right, and there's a brain centrism

1956
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:42,900
that assumes our intelligence is centered in our brain.

1957
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,260
And in endless ways in this conversation,

1958
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,500
we've been talking about molecular intelligence.

1959
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,700
Our molecular systems do a deep kind

1960
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,100
of artificial intelligence.

1961
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:56,700
All the things you think of as artificial intelligence does

1962
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:01,780
in representing knowledge, storing knowledge,

1963
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,620
searching over knowledge, adapting to knowledge,

1964
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:06,860
our molecular systems do,

1965
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:11,100
but the output isn't just a thought, it's us.

1966
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,060
It's the evolution of us.

1967
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:17,820
And the real horizon to come is now embodying AI,

1968
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,820
of not just a processor and a robot,

1969
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:25,820
but building systems that really can grow and evolve.

1970
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,660
So we've been speaking about this boundary

1971
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,860
between bits and atoms.

1972
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:34,820
So let me ask you about one of the big mysteries

1973
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,980
of consciousness.

1974
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:41,900
Do you think it comes from somewhere between that boundary?

1975
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,820
I won't name names,

1976
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:47,340
but if you know who I'm talking about, it's probably clear.

1977
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:52,340
I once did a drive, in fact, up to the Mussolini era villa

1978
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,860
outside Torino in the early days

1979
01:35:55,860 --> 01:36:00,860
of what became quantum computing with a famous person

1980
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,500
who thinks about quantum mechanics and consciousness.

1981
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,780
And we had the most infuriating conversation

1982
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:12,780
that went roughly along the lines of consciousness is weird,

1983
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,340
quantum mechanics is weird,

1984
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:20,580
therefore quantum mechanics explains consciousness.

1985
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:24,380
That was roughly the logical process.

1986
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,180
And you're not satisfied with that process?

1987
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,620
No, and I say that very precisely in the following sense.

1988
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:32,900
I was a program manager somewhat by accident

1989
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:37,940
in a DARPA program on quantum biology.

1990
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:43,620
And so biology trivially uses quantum mechanics

1991
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:45,860
and that were made out of atoms,

1992
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:49,420
but the distinction is in quantum computing,

1993
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:53,220
quantum information, you need quantum coherence.

1994
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:57,900
And there's a lot of muddled thinking about like collapse

1995
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,620
of the wave function and claims of quantum computing

1996
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:04,700
that garbles just quantum coherence.

1997
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:09,180
That you can think of it as a wave

1998
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:10,620
that has very special properties,

1999
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:12,820
but these wave-like properties.

2000
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:16,700
And so there's a small set of places

2001
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:21,140
where biology uses quantum mechanics in that deeper sense.

2002
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:26,140
One is how light is converted to energy in photo systems.

2003
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,300
It looks like one is all faction,

2004
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,860
how your nose is able to tell different smells.

2005
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:37,260
Probably one has to do with how birds navigate,

2006
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,140
how they sense magnetic fields.

2007
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:44,660
That involves a coupling between a very weak energy

2008
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:48,100
with a magnetic field, coupling into chemical reactions.

2009
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,780
And there's a beautiful system.

2010
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:56,180
Standard in chemistry is magnetic fields

2011
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,220
like this can influence chemistry,

2012
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:00,060
but there are biological circuits

2013
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,260
that are carefully balanced with two pathways

2014
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:04,620
that become unbalanced with magnetic fields.

2015
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,020
So each of these areas are expensive for biology.

2016
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:09,740
It has to consume resources

2017
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:11,540
to use quantum mechanics in this way.

2018
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,620
So those are places where we know

2019
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,700
there's quantum mechanics in biology.

2020
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:20,300
In cognition, there's just no evidence.

2021
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:27,460
There's no evidence of anything quantum mechanical going on

2022
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:29,540
in how cognition works.

2023
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:30,740
Consciousness.

2024
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:33,700
Well, I'm saying cognition, I'm not saying consciousness,

2025
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:37,220
but to get from cognition to consciousness.

2026
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,780
So McCullough and Pitts made a model of neurons.

2027
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:47,780
That led to perceptrons that then through a couple

2028
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:51,180
of boom busts led to deep learning.

2029
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,980
One of the interesting things about that sequence is

2030
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:57,500
it diverged off so deep neural networks

2031
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,180
used in machine learning,

2032
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:03,260
diverged from trying to understand how the brain works.

2033
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:09,100
What makes them work, what's emerged is,

2034
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,780
it's a really interesting story.

2035
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:13,140
This may be too much of a technical detail,

2036
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:15,300
but it has to do with function approximation.

2037
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:18,660
That we talked about exponentials.

2038
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:23,660
A deep network needs an exponentially larger

2039
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:27,220
shallow network to do the same function.

2040
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,860
And that exponential is what gives the power

2041
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:31,500
to deep networks.

2042
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,820
But what's interesting is the sort of lessons

2043
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:37,460
about building these deep architectures

2044
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:41,340
and how to train them have really interesting echoes

2045
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,340
to how brains work.

2046
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,340
And there's an interesting conversation

2047
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:48,220
that's sort of coming back of neuroscientists

2048
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:50,380
looking over the shoulder of people training

2049
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:52,780
these deep networks, seeing interesting echoes

2050
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:56,700
for how the brain works, interesting parallels with it.

2051
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:01,580
And so I didn't say consciousness, I just said cognition,

2052
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:05,220
but I don't know any experimental evidence

2053
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,580
that points to anything in neurobiology

2054
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:10,100
that says we need quantum mechanics.

2055
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:15,100
And I view the question about whether a large language model

2056
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:20,380
is conscious as silly in that biology is full of hacks

2057
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:29,500
and it works.

2058
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:34,140
There's no evidence we have that there's anything deeper

2059
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:37,100
going on than just this sort of stacking up

2060
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,420
of hacks in the brain.

2061
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,860
And somehow consciousness is one of the hacks

2062
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:42,740
or an emergent property of the hacks.

2063
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:43,580
Absolutely.

2064
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:47,980
And just numerically, I said big computations now

2065
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:50,540
have the degrees of freedom of the brain.

2066
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:53,300
And they're showing a lot of the phenomenology

2067
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:57,140
of what we think is properties of what a brain can do.

2068
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:02,420
And I don't see any reason to invoke anything else.

2069
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,940
That makes you wonder what kind of beautiful stuff

2070
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,900
digital fabrication will create.

2071
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,500
If biology created a few hacks on top of which

2072
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:12,500
consciousness and cognition, some of the things

2073
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,460
we love about human beings was created.

2074
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:19,980
It makes you wonder what kind of beauty in the complexity

2075
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,940
can create digital fabrication.

2076
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,700
There's an early peek at that,

2077
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,740
which is there's a misleading term,

2078
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:29,220
which is generative design.

2079
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:32,820
Generative design is where you don't tell a computer

2080
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:33,820
how to design something.

2081
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:36,420
You tell the computer what you want it to do.

2082
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,020
That doesn't work.

2083
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:40,940
That only works in limited subdomains.

2084
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:44,060
You can't do really complex functionality that way.

2085
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:46,100
The one place it's matured, though,

2086
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,580
is topology optimization for structure.

2087
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:52,260
So let's say you wanted to make a bicycle or a table.

2088
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,860
You describe the loads on it

2089
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,860
and it figures out how to design it.

2090
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:01,620
And what it makes are beautiful, organic-looking things.

2091
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:04,500
These are things that look like they grew in a forest.

2092
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:07,100
And they look like they grew in a forest

2093
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,940
because that's sort of exactly what they are,

2094
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:12,900
that they're solving the ways of how you handle loads

2095
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,260
in the same way biology does.

2096
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:16,500
And so you get things that look like trees

2097
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,820
and shells and all of that.

2098
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:19,980
And so that's a peek at this transition

2099
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:24,980
from we design to we teach the machines how to design.

2100
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,060
What can you say about,

2101
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:30,540
because you mentioned cellular automata earlier,

2102
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,540
about from this example you just gave,

2103
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:34,380
and in general the observation you can make

2104
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,820
by looking at cellular automata,

2105
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:40,380
that from simple rules and simple building blocks

2106
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:43,540
can emerge arbitrary complexity.

2107
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:48,540
Do you understand what that is, how that can be leveraged?

2108
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:53,740
So understand what it is is much easier than it sounds.

2109
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,980
I complained about Turing's machine

2110
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,340
making a physics mistake,

2111
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:01,660
but Turing never intended it to be a computer architecture.

2112
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:06,340
He used it just to prove results about uncomputability.

2113
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:10,900
What Turing did on what his computation is exquisite

2114
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,700
is gorgeous.

2115
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:16,420
He gave us our notion of computational universality

2116
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:19,740
and something that sounds deep

2117
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:24,740
and turns out to be trivial is it's really easy

2118
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:29,300
to show almost everything is computationally universal.

2119
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,340
So Norm Margolis wrote a beautiful paper

2120
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:39,180
with Tom Toffoli showing in a cellular automata world

2121
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,660
is like the game of life

2122
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,940
where you just move tokens around.

2123
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:48,660
They showed that modeling billiard balls

2124
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:52,420
on a billiard table with cellular automata

2125
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:53,900
is a universal computer.

2126
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:59,620
To be universal, you need a persistent state.

2127
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:03,020
You need a non-linear operation to interact them

2128
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:08,380
and you need connectivity.

2129
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:11,420
So that's what you need to show computational universality.

2130
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:15,660
So they showed that a CA modeling billiard balls

2131
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,620
is a universal computer.

2132
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:21,780
Chris Moore went on to show that instead of chaos,

2133
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:27,140
Turing showed their problems in computation

2134
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:30,340
that you can't solve, that they're harder

2135
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,340
than you can't predict.

2136
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:34,700
They're actually in a deep reason that they are unsolvable.

2137
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:39,300
Chris Moore showed it's very easy to make physical systems

2138
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:43,380
that are uncomputable, that what the physics system does,

2139
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,500
just bouncing balls and surfaces,

2140
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,900
you can make systems that solve uncomputable problems.

2141
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,580
And so almost any non-trivial physical system

2142
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,740
is computationally universal.

2143
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:57,700
So the first part of the answer to your question is,

2144
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,660
this comes back to my comment about

2145
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,980
how do you bootstrap a civilization?

2146
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:06,780
You just don't need much to be computationally universal.

2147
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:10,780
So then there isn't today a notion

2148
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:14,100
of like fabricational universality

2149
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,340
or fabricational complexity.

2150
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:18,500
The sort of numbers I've been giving you

2151
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,900
about you eating lunch versus the chip fab,

2152
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:26,580
sort of that, that's in the same spirit of what Shannon did.

2153
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:31,580
But once you connect computational universality

2154
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:35,340
to kind of fabricational universality,

2155
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:39,340
you then get the ability to grow and adapt and evolve.

2156
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,620
Because that evolution happens in the physical space.

2157
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:45,780
Yeah, and so that's why, for me,

2158
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:49,820
the heart of this whole conversation is morphogenesis.

2159
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,980
So just to come back to that,

2160
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:58,860
what Turing ended his sadly cut short life studying

2161
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,700
was how genes give rise to form.

2162
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,380
So how the small amount of it,

2163
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:11,660
relatively it affects small amount of information

2164
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:14,020
in the genome can give rise to the complexity

2165
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,660
of who you are.

2166
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:21,660
That's where what resides is this molecular intelligence,

2167
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:24,980
which is first how to describe you,

2168
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:29,380
but then how to describe you such that you can exist

2169
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:33,580
and you can reproduce and you can grow and you can evolve.

2170
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:38,580
And so that's the seat of our molecular intelligence.

2171
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:41,100
The maker of revolution in biology.

2172
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:45,140
Yeah, it really is, it really is.

2173
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:48,700
And that's where you can't separate

2174
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,940
communication, computation and fabrication.

2175
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:53,740
You can't separate computer science and physical science.

2176
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,980
You can't separate hardware and software.

2177
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,340
They all intersect right at that place.

2178
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,660
Do you think of our universe as just one giant computation?

2179
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:08,860
I would even kind of say quantum computing is overhyped

2180
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:11,340
in that there's a few things quantum computing

2181
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,380
is gonna be good at.

2182
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:14,140
One is breaking crypto systems,

2183
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:16,100
how to make new crypto systems.

2184
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:19,020
What it's really good at is modeling other quantum systems.

2185
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:23,300
So for studying nanotechnology, it's gonna be powerful,

2186
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,220
but quantum computing is not going to disrupt

2187
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:29,060
and change everything.

2188
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:33,140
But the reason I say that is this interesting group

2189
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:36,620
of strange people who helped invent quantum computing

2190
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:39,400
before it was clear anything was there.

2191
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:43,220
One of the main reasons they did it wasn't

2192
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,460
to make a computer that can break a crypto system.

2193
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,900
It was you could turn this backwards.

2194
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:52,340
You could be surprised quantum mechanics can compute

2195
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,300
or you can go in the opposite direction

2196
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,580
and say if quantum mechanics can compute,

2197
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:01,900
that's a description of nature.

2198
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:05,660
So physics is written in terms

2199
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:08,340
of partial differential equations.

2200
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:11,860
That is an information technology

2201
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:15,260
from two centuries ago.

2202
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:21,260
The equations of physics are not,

2203
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:22,740
this would sound very strange to say,

2204
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:24,140
but the equations of physics,

2205
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:26,180
Schrodinger's equations and Maxwell's equations

2206
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:28,820
and all of them are not fundamental.

2207
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:31,020
They're a representation of physics

2208
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,220
that was accessible to us

2209
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:35,740
in the era of having a pencil and a piece of paper.

2210
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:41,540
They have a fundamental problem

2211
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:45,580
which is if you make a dot on a piece of paper

2212
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:48,540
in traditional physics theory,

2213
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:51,860
there's infinite information in that dot.

2214
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:55,360
A point has infinite information.

2215
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,740
That can't be true because information

2216
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:05,740
is a fundamental resource that's connected to energy.

2217
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:09,980
And in fact, one of my favorite questions

2218
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:14,140
you can ask a cosmologist to trip them up is ask,

2219
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:17,780
is information a conserved quantity in the universe?

2220
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:20,300
Was all the information created in the Big Bang

2221
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:21,980
or can the universe create information?

2222
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:26,620
And I've yet to meet a cosmologist who doesn't stutter

2223
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:31,620
and not clearly know how to handle that existential question,

2224
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:35,220
but sort of putting that to a side,

2225
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:38,060
in physics theory, the way it's taught,

2226
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:43,260
information comes late.

2227
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:46,420
You're taught about X, a variable,

2228
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,220
which can contain infinite information,

2229
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,380
but physically that's unrealistic.

2230
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:53,940
And so physics theories have to find ways to cut that off.

2231
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:57,860
So instead, there are a number of people

2232
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:03,220
who start with a theory of the universe

2233
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,660
should start with information and computation

2234
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,580
as the fundamental resources that explain nature.

2235
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,740
And then you build up from that

2236
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:15,820
to something that looks like throwing baseballs down a slope.

2237
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:20,820
And so in that sense, the work on physics and computation

2238
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:24,660
has many applications that we've been talking about,

2239
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:29,060
but more deeply, it's really getting at new ways

2240
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:31,220
to think about how the universe works.

2241
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:32,780
And there are a number of things

2242
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:34,860
that are hard to do in traditional physics

2243
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:37,580
that make more sense when you start with information

2244
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:41,260
and computation as the root of physical theory.

2245
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,620
So information and computation

2246
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:46,060
being the real fundamental thing in the universe.

2247
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:49,020
Right, that information is a resource.

2248
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,900
You can have infinite information in finite space.

2249
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:56,340
Information propagates and interacts,

2250
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,780
and from there you erect the scaffolding of physics.

2251
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:01,540
Now it happens, the words I just said

2252
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:04,340
look a lot like quantum field theories.

2253
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,380
But there's an interesting way

2254
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:11,060
where instead of starting with differential equations

2255
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:13,020
to get to quantum field theories

2256
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:16,260
and quantum field theories, you get to quantization.

2257
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:21,300
If you start from computation and information,

2258
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:24,740
you begin sort of quantized and you build up from there.

2259
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:29,300
And so that's the sense in which absolutely,

2260
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,260
I think about the universe as a computer.

2261
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:34,180
The easy way to understand that is

2262
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:38,940
just almost anything is computationally universal,

2263
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:41,980
but the deep way is it's a real fundamental way

2264
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,980
to understand how the universe works.

2265
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,620
Let me go a little bit to the personal

2266
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:50,500
and the center of bits and atoms.

2267
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:56,620
You have worked with the students you've worked with

2268
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:00,460
have gone on to do some incredible things in this world,

2269
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:04,500
including build supercomputers that power Facebook

2270
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,620
and Twitter and so on.

2271
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:08,860
What advice would you give to young people?

2272
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:11,220
What advice have you given them?

2273
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:14,180
How to have one heck of a great career,

2274
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:15,740
one heck of a great life?

2275
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:20,740
What one important one is if you look at junior faculty

2276
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:25,460
trying to get tenure at a place like MIT,

2277
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:28,420
the ones who try to figure out how to get tenure

2278
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:30,740
are miserable and don't get tenure.

2279
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:33,420
And the ones who don't try to figure it out

2280
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:34,700
are happy and do get it.

2281
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:39,180
You have to love what you're doing and believe in it

2282
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:42,980
and nothing else could possibly be

2283
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,500
what you wanna be doing with your life

2284
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,580
and it gets you out of bed in the morning.

2285
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,740
And again, it sounds naive,

2286
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:53,740
but within the limited domain I'm describing now

2287
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,340
of getting tenure at MIT, that's a key attribute to it.

2288
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:02,140
And in the same sense, if you take the sort of outliers

2289
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:05,900
students were talking about, 99 out of 100 come to me

2290
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:07,540
and say your work is very fascinating,

2291
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:11,180
I'd be interesting to work for you.

2292
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:15,620
And one out of 100 come and say, you're wrong.

2293
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:20,020
Here's your mistake, here's what you should have been doing.

2294
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:26,540
They just sort of say I'm here and get to work.

2295
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:29,860
And again, I don't know how far this resource goes.

2296
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:33,780
So I've said, I consider the world's greatest resource,

2297
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:36,060
this engine, a bright invent of people

2298
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,220
of which we only see a tiny little iceberg of it.

2299
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,100
And everywhere we open these labs,

2300
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,340
they come out of the woodwork, they come.

2301
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:45,940
We didn't create all these educational programs,

2302
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,740
all these other things I'm describing.

2303
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:51,180
We tried to partner everywhere with local schools

2304
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:53,660
and local companies and kept tripping over dysfunction

2305
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,260
and find we had to create the environment

2306
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,820
where people like this can flourish.

2307
01:53:56,820 --> 01:54:00,060
And so I don't know if this is everyone,

2308
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:02,580
if it's 1% of society, what the fraction is,

2309
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:05,620
but it's so many orders of magnitude bigger

2310
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:07,020
than we see it today.

2311
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:08,380
We've been racing to keep up with it

2312
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,340
to take advantage of that resource.

2313
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:12,220
Something tells me it's a very large fraction

2314
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,260
of the population.

2315
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:17,620
I mean, the thing that gives me most hope for the future

2316
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,820
is that population.

2317
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:21,180
Once a year, this whole lab network meets.

2318
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:24,100
And it's my favorite gathering, it's in Bhutan this year,

2319
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:27,820
because it's every body shape, it's every language,

2320
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:30,020
every geography, but it's the same person

2321
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:31,700
in all those packages.

2322
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:36,700
It's the same sense of bright invent of joy and discovery.

2323
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,340
If there's people listening to this

2324
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:41,700
and they're just overwhelmed with how exciting this is,

2325
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:44,300
which I think they would be, how can they participate,

2326
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:47,540
how can they help, how can they encourage young people

2327
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,940
or themselves to build stuff, to create stuff?

2328
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:51,980
Yeah, that's a great question.

2329
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:56,980
So this is part of a much bigger maker movement

2330
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,580
that has a lot of embodiments.

2331
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:03,380
The part I've been involved in, this fab lab network,

2332
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,180
you can think of as a curated part that works as a network.

2333
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:09,260
So you don't benefit in a gym

2334
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:11,780
if somebody exercises in another gym,

2335
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:14,420
but in the fab network, you do, in a sense,

2336
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:16,780
benefit when somebody works in another network,

2337
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:19,540
another lab in the way it functions as a network.

2338
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:23,540
So you can come to cba.mit.edu

2339
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:26,340
to see the research we're talking about.

2340
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:29,420
There's a fab foundation run by Sherry Lasseter

2341
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:31,460
at fabfoundation.org.

2342
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:35,320
Fab Labs I.O. is a portal into this lab network.

2343
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:40,020
Fabacademy.org is this distributed hands-on

2344
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:41,980
educational program.

2345
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:44,940
Fab.city is the platform of cities producing

2346
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:45,780
what they consume.

2347
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:48,620
Those are all nodes in this network.

2348
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,380
So you can learn with Fabacademy

2349
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:53,060
and you can perhaps launch or help launch

2350
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:54,700
or participate in launching a fab lab.

2351
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:59,220
Well, in particular, from one to a thousand,

2352
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,740
we carefully counted labs.

2353
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:03,100
Now we're going from a thousand to a million

2354
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:05,340
where it ceases to become interesting to count them.

2355
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,300
And in the thousand to the million,

2356
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:12,900
what's interesting about that stage is technologically,

2357
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,300
you go to a lab not to get access to the machine,

2358
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,940
but you go to the lab to make the machine.

2359
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:20,220
But the other thing interesting in it

2360
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:22,620
is we have an interesting collaboration

2361
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:26,460
on a fab lab in a box.

2362
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:30,740
And this came out of a collaboration with SolidWorks

2363
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:34,980
on how you can put a fab lab in a box,

2364
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:37,820
which is not just the tools, but the knowledge.

2365
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:42,100
So you open the box and the box contains the knowledge

2366
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:45,660
of how to use it as well as the tools within it

2367
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,340
so that the knowledge can propagate.

2368
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,860
And so we have an interesting group of people

2369
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:52,020
working on the original fab labs.

2370
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:54,020
We have a whole team to get involved

2371
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,300
in the setting up and training.

2372
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:58,740
And the Fabacademy is a real in-depth,

2373
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:01,100
deep technical program in the training.

2374
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:05,020
But in this next phase, how sort of the lab itself

2375
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,220
knows how to do the lab.

2376
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:13,060
We've talked deeply about the intelligence in fabrication,

2377
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:14,620
but in a much more accessible one

2378
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:19,540
about how the AI in the lab in effect

2379
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:23,380
becomes a collaborator with you in this nearer term

2380
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:24,500
to help get started.

2381
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:28,380
And for people wanting to connect,

2382
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:31,140
it can seem like a big step, a big threshold,

2383
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,940
but we've gotten to thousands of these

2384
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:35,300
and they're doubling exactly that way

2385
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,660
just from people opting in.

2386
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:40,540
And in so doing, driving towards this kind of idea

2387
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:43,900
of personal digital fabrication.

2388
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:46,580
And it's not utopia, it's not free,

2389
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:51,580
but come back to today, we separately have education,

2390
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:55,540
we have big business, we have startups,

2391
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:59,700
we have entertainment, each of these things are segregated.

2392
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:01,940
When you have global connection

2393
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:04,140
to one of these local facilities,

2394
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:07,820
in that you can do play and art and education

2395
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:09,460
and create infrastructure.

2396
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:13,700
You can make many of the things you consume.

2397
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,980
You could make it for yourself,

2398
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:16,740
it could be done on a community scale,

2399
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:19,140
it could be done on a regional scale.

2400
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:24,260
It really, I'd say the research we spent

2401
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:27,740
the last few hours talking about, I thought was hard.

2402
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:32,740
And in a sense, I mean, it's non-trivial

2403
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:35,300
but in a sense, it's just sort of playing out

2404
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:36,500
we're turning the crank.

2405
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:39,100
What I didn't think was hard is

2406
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:42,900
if anybody can make almost anything anywhere,

2407
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,500
how do you live, how do you learn,

2408
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,460
how do you work, how you play,

2409
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:50,980
these very basic assumptions about how society functions.

2410
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:54,820
There's a way in which it's kind of back to the future

2411
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:59,820
in that this mode where work is money is consumption

2412
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:03,660
and consumption is shopping by selecting

2413
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:07,380
is only a kind of a few decade old stretch.

2414
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:13,020
In some ways, we're getting back to a Sami village

2415
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:17,300
in North Norway is deeply sustainable,

2416
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:22,060
but rather than just reverting to living

2417
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,320
the way we did a few thousand years ago,

2418
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:28,760
being connected globally, having the benefits

2419
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:32,020
of modern society, but connecting it back

2420
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:34,500
to older notions of sustainability.

2421
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:40,020
I hadn't remotely anticipated just how fundamentally

2422
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:42,980
that challenges how a society functions.

2423
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:46,300
And how interesting and how hard it is to figure out

2424
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,900
how we can make that work.

2425
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:50,540
And it's possible that this kind of process

2426
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:54,940
will give a deeper sense of meaning to each person.

2427
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:58,180
Let me violently agree in two ways.

2428
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:03,180
One way is this community making

2429
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:09,460
crosses many sensitive sectarian boundaries

2430
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:11,900
in many parts of the world where there's just,

2431
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:15,660
implicit or explicit conflict,

2432
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:20,660
but sort of this act of making seems to transcend

2433
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:22,740
a lot of historical divisions.

2434
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:24,460
I don't say that philosophically,

2435
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:26,420
I just say that as an observation.

2436
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:30,020
And I think there's something really fundamental

2437
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:34,020
in what you said, which is deep in our brain

2438
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:35,980
is shaping our environment.

2439
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:41,900
A lot of what's strange about our society

2440
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,100
is the way that we can't do that.

2441
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:49,020
The act of shaping our environment

2442
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:51,260
touches something really, really deep

2443
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:53,980
that gets to the essence of who we are.

2444
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:57,820
That's again why I say that in a way,

2445
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:00,260
the most important thing made in these labs

2446
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:01,500
is making itself.

2447
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:06,300
What do you think if the shaping of our environment

2448
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,260
gets to something deep?

2449
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,660
What do you think is the meaning of it all?

2450
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,260
What's the meaning of life, Neil?

2451
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:17,220
I can tell you my insights into how life works.

2452
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:19,620
I can tell you my insights

2453
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:23,820
in how to make life meaningful and fulfilling

2454
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:26,740
and sustainable.

2455
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:31,340
I have no idea what the meaning of life is,

2456
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:33,740
but maybe that's the meaning of life.

2457
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:35,860
Naha, the uncertainty, the confusion.

2458
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:38,860
Because there's a magic to it all.

2459
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,140
Everything you've talked about

2460
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:42,940
from starting from the basic elements

2461
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:45,420
with the big bang that somehow created the sun

2462
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:49,220
that somehow set a few to thermodynamics

2463
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:52,740
and created life in all the ways that you've talked about

2464
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:54,860
from ribosomes that created the machinery

2465
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:55,980
that created the machine

2466
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:59,140
and then now the biological machine creating

2467
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:00,420
through digital fabrication,

2468
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:02,420
more complex artificial machines,

2469
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:05,860
all of that, there's a magic to that creative process.

2470
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:09,540
And we humans are smart enough to notice the magic.

2471
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:13,220
So you haven't said the S word yet.

2472
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:14,060
Which one is that?

2473
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:14,900
Singularity.

2474
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:19,700
Yeah, I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is listening

2475
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:20,700
if he is high Ray,

2476
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:23,220
but I have a complex relationship with Ray

2477
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:28,220
because a lot of the things he projects, I find annoying,

2478
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:31,740
but then he does his homework

2479
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:33,820
and then somewhat annoyingly,

2480
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:35,980
he points out how almost everything I'm doing

2481
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:37,860
fits on his roadmaps.

2482
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:44,820
And so the question is,

2483
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:47,540
are we heading towards a singularity?

2484
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:52,980
So I'd have to say I lean towards sigmoids

2485
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:54,700
rather than exponentials.

2486
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:59,020
But we've done pretty well with sigmoids.

2487
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:02,460
Yeah, so sigmoids are things grow and they taper

2488
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:04,820
and then there can be one after it and one after it.

2489
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:09,820
So I'll pass on whether there's enough of them

2490
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:13,020
that they diverge,

2491
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:18,020
but the selfish gene answer to the meaning of life

2492
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:23,900
is the meaning of life is the propagation of life.

2493
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:28,900
And so it was a step for atoms to assemble into a molecule,

2494
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:33,100
for atoms to assemble into a molecule,

2495
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:38,580
for molecules to assemble into a proto cell,

2496
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:41,860
for the proto cell to form, to then form organelles,

2497
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:44,540
for the organ cells to form organs,

2498
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,660
the organs to form an organism.

2499
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:51,180
Then it was a step for organisms to form family units,

2500
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:53,460
then family units to form villages.

2501
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:56,180
You can view each of those as a stack

2502
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:57,540
and the level of organization.

2503
02:03:57,540 --> 02:04:02,100
So you could view everything we've spoken about

2504
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:06,500
as the imperative of life,

2505
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:10,100
just the next step in the hierarchy of that

2506
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:12,580
in the fulfillment of the inexorable drive

2507
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:14,380
of the violation of thermodynamics.

2508
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:17,980
So you could view, I'm an embodiment of the will

2509
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:20,340
of the violation of thermodynamics speaking.

2510
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:24,780
The two of us having an old chat, yes.

2511
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,900
Yeah.

2512
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:29,020
And so it continues and even then the singularity

2513
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:31,500
is just a transition up the ladder.

2514
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:34,540
There's nothing deeper to consciousness

2515
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:39,540
than it's a derived property of distributed problem solving.

2516
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:44,020
There's nothing deeper to life

2517
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:49,020
than embodied AI in morphogenesis.

2518
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:53,860
So why so much of this conversation in my life

2519
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:57,260
is involved in these fab labs.

2520
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:00,020
And initially it just started as outreach,

2521
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:02,620
then it started as keeping up with it.

2522
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:05,020
Then it turned to,

2523
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:09,380
it was rewarding.

2524
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:12,820
Then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs

2525
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:14,260
in as goes out to them.

2526
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:16,700
It began as outreach, but now more knowledge

2527
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:19,420
is coming back from the labs that is going into them.

2528
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:24,420
And then finally it ends with what I described

2529
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,140
as competing with myself at MIT,

2530
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:30,220
but a better way to say that is tapping

2531
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:31,840
the brain power of the planet.

2532
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:35,340
And so I guess for me personally,

2533
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:37,620
that's the meaning of my life.

2534
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:39,700
And maybe that's the meaning for the universe too.

2535
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:44,700
It's using us humans and our creations to understand itself

2536
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:50,060
in the way it's whatever the creative process

2537
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:53,220
that created Earth is competing with itself.

2538
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:56,460
Yeah, so you could take morphogenesis

2539
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,180
as a summary of this whole conversation

2540
02:05:58,180 --> 02:06:02,420
or you could take recursion that in a sense,

2541
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:05,580
what we've been talking about is recursion all the way down.

2542
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:08,920
And in the end, I think this whole thing is pretty fun.

2543
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:12,420
It's short life is, but it's pretty fun.

2544
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:13,980
And so is this conversation.

2545
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:15,820
I mentioned to you offline that I'm going

2546
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:17,340
through some difficult stuff personally

2547
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:20,620
and your passion for what you do is just really inspiring.

2548
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:23,820
And it just lights up my mood and lights up my heart.

2549
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:27,500
And you're an inspiration for I know thousands of people

2550
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:30,220
that work with you at MIT and millions people across the world.

2551
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:31,940
It's a big honor to use it with me today.

2552
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:32,780
This is really fun.

2553
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:33,780
This was a pleasure.

2554
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,300
Thanks for listening to this conversation

2555
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:37,700
with Neil Gershenfeld.

And now let me leave you with some words

2559
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:45,820
from Pablo Picasso.

2560
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:48,260
Every child is an artist.

2561
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:51,420
The challenge is staying an artist when you grow up.

2562
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:55,680
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
