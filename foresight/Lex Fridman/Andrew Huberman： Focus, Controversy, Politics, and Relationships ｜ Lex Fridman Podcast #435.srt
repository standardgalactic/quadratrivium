00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure. Can you read the quote once more?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,400
Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,840
The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman his fifth time on the podcast

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,720
He is the host of the Huberman lab podcast and is an amazing scientist teacher human being and

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
Someone i'm grateful to be able to call a close friend

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,840
Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now called protocols and operating manual for the human body

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,200
This is the lex freeman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Here's andrew Huberman

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,320
You think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting? Definitely

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,720
I mean I

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,000
came up

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
within and then on the periphery of

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,200
skateboard culture

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,120
And for the record, I was not a great skateboarder

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
I always have to say that because skateboarders are relentless

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
If you call something you didn't do or whatever

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
I mean, I could do a few things and I loved the community

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
And I still have a lot of friends in that community jim feebo at deluxe. You can look him up

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
He's kind of the man behind the whole scene. I know tony

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,760
hawk, dany whale these guys I got to see them come up and get big and stay big in many cases start huge companies like

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Danny and calling the case our dc

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,960
Some people have a long life and something some don't but one thing I observed and learned a lot from in skateboarding

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,160
At the level of observing the skateboarders and then the ones that started companies

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
and then what I also

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
observed in science

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
and still observe is

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
You do it for a while

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
You do it at the highest possible level

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,720
for you

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,320
and then at some point

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
You pivot and you start

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
supporting the young talent coming in

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,840
In fact, the greatest scientists people like richard axl

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
Catherine do lock

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
There are many other labs in neuroscience carl diceroth

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,320
They're not just known for doing great science. They're known for

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,320
Mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
and I think in podcasting

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,720
I am very fortunate. I got in in a fairly early wave not the earliest wave

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
But thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,680
And I'll continue to go as long as it feels right and I feel like I'm doing good in the world and providing good

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
But I'm already starting to scout talent

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,120
My company that I started with rob more psychom media

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
A couple other guys in there too. Mike play back our photographer ian macky

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
chris ray martin fobes

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
We are a company that produces podcasts right now. That's huberman lab podcast

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
But we're launching a new podcast perform a dr. Andy galpin

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Nice

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,000
And we want to do more of that kind of thing finding a really great talent highly qualified people credential people

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,760
and I've got

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
A new kind of obsession with scouring the internet

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,240
Looking for the young talent in science in health and related fields

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,960
And so will there be a final episode of the

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,880
hlp

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Yeah, I mean bullet buster cancer

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,720
Aside, you know someday they'll be the very last and thank you for your interest in science

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
And i'll clip out

58
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah, I love the idea of walking weight and not be dramatic about it

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,760
Right when it feels right you can leave and you can come back whenever the fuck you want, right?

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,080
John steward did this well with the daily show

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,920
I think that was during the 2016 election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Dave chappelle for different

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Reasons walked away disappeared came back gave away so much money

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,320
Didn't care and then came back and was doing like stand-up in the park in the middle of nowhere

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,880
Genius you have habib who undefeated walks away at the very top of of a sport. Is he coming back? No

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,160
It's the least we don't know. Yeah, right. You don't know. I don't know if he bears everywhere or words

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,080
Yeah, I think you know, it's um, it's always a call, you know, you know the last

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,400
Few years have been tremendous growth. We launched in january 2021 and even this last year

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
2024 has been huge growth

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
you know in all sorts of ways it's been wild and

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
We have some short form content planned

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
That's 30 minute shorter episodes that really distill down the critical elements. We're also

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,320
so there's always the thought and the discussion but when it comes to like when to hang up your cleats, you know, it's like

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
There just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in

76
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,960
Then focusing on self and so there will come a time for that

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
And I think it's critical. I mean, again, I saw this in skateboarding like danny

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,480
And callin and danny's brother daemon started dc with ken block the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
rally car driver

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
and

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,080
They eventually sold it. I think to quicksilver or something like that, but

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,920
They're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
but they brought in the next

84
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,000
You know on the next line of amazing riders for the plan b thing, you know, paul rodriguez for skateboarders

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They know who this is now in science

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,360
There are scientists like fine men for instance. I don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So there are scientists who are phenomenal

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Like beyond world class, right multi-generational world class who don't make good mentors

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm not saying he wasn't a good mentor, but that's not what he's known for and then there are

90
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
scientists who are known for being excellent scientists and and great mentors and I think there's no higher

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
Um celebration to be had at the end of one's career if you can look back and like hey

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,040
I put some really important knowledge into the world people made use of that knowledge

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
And guess what you spawned all these

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
other

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
scientific offspring or sport

96
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
offspring or

97
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
podcast offspring

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
I mean in some ways we look to rogan and to some of the other earlier podcasts is like they

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,520
You know, they paved the way ronda patrick first science podcast out there

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,440
so

101
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
You know it eventually

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
The baton passes but fortunately right now everybody's active and it and it feels really good

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,760
Yeah, well you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Uh

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,360
a different kind of way where you have uh, something like uh

106
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
Grisha gregory perlman the mathematician who refused to accept the fields medal

107
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,000
So he's one of the greatest living mathematicians and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the fields medal

108
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
What did he do after he left mathematics?

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
life

110
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Private 100% I respect that he's become essentially a recluse is these photos of him

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,080
Looking very broke like he could use the money. He he turned away the money. He turned away everything

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
you know, there's there's

113
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
You just have to listen to the inner voice

114
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,000
You have to listen to yourself and make the decisions that don't make any sense for the rest of the world and make sense to you

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,960
I mean bob dillon didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. Yeah. Yeah, he probably grew in

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
no variety for that

117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah, maybe just doesn't like going in sweden, but it seemed like a big fun trip

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,200
I think they do it in a nice time of years, but hey, that's his right. He earned that right

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,840
I think the best artists aren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for the fame or the money

120
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,880
They're doing it because they love the heart. Yeah, that's the the rick ruven thing. He got a verb it through

121
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Download your inner thing

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I don't think we've talked about this that

123
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
this obsession that I have about how

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
rick

125
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
has this

126
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,880
way of being very very still in his body

127
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
But keeping his mind very active

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,560
as a practice

129
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
When spent some time with him in italy last june

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,640
And we would tread water and his pool in the morning and listen to

131
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
history of rock and roll and hundred songs

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
Um amazing podcast by the way. It is yeah

133
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,920
And um, and then he would spend a fair amount of time during the day, you know in this kind of meditative state

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Where his mind is very active body very still

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,600
And then carl dice roth when he came on my podcast talked about how he forces himself to sit still and think in complete sentences late at night

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
after his kids go to sleep

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
and

138
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,840
You know, there's a state of mind rapid eye movement sleep

139
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,000
Where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active and people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more

140
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,400
elaborate emotion filled dreams and the source of many ideas

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
and there are other examples

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Einstein

143
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,680
People described him as taking walks around the princeton campus then pausing

144
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
and

145
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,800
Would ask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a high rate

146
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
um

147
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,200
So, you know, this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about some incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,980
Stilling the body while keeping the mind deliberately very active

149
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,340
Very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report, you know

150
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,900
Great ideas coming to them in the shower while running

151
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,420
So it can be the opposite as well where the body is very active and the and the mind is perhaps more on

152
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,940
Kind of like a default mode network not really focusing on any one specific thing

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,460
You know interesting as a there's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians have talked to they talk about

154
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,940
sleep deprivation

155
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,860
And going crazy hours through the night obsessively pursuing a thing

156
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,540
And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get

157
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:58,740
rest right and and we know we just did this sixth episode special series on sleep with matt walker

158
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,300
we know

159
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
that

160
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,540
When you deprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep you get a rebound in rapid eye movement sleep

161
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,700
You get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep

162
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,060
And matt talks about this in the podcast and he did an episode on sleep and

163
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,740
Creativity sleep and memory and rapid eye movement sleep comes up multiple times in that series

164
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,580
There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep people are coming off cannabis often will suffer from

165
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,220
Insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping they like dream like crazy

166
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,940
Cannabis is a very controversial topic right now. Oh, yeah, I saw that what happened

167
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
There's a bunch of drama around

168
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,620
Episode you did on cannabis. Yeah, we did a episode about cannabis talked about the health

169
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,180
Benefits and the potential risks right it's neither here nor there

170
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,700
It depends on the person depends on the age depends on genetic background a number of other things

171
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,060
We

172
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,420
published that episode well over a year ago and it had no issues online so to speak

173
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,500
And then a clip of it was put to x where you know

174
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,180
The real action occurs as you know your favorite

175
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,460
box

176
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,020
Yeah, yeah, the the the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves

177
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,020
That is x versus instagram or youtube

178
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
there was

179
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,780
Kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the cannabis research field to phds and mds

180
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah, there were people on our side. There were people on our side. I mean

181
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,420
You know the the statement that got

182
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,180
Things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals

183
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,060
there's a

184
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:54,420
High potential for inducing psychosis with high thc containing cannabis for certain individuals not all

185
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
That sparked some issues

186
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
There was really a split, you know

187
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
See this in different fields it

188
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,820
There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that

189
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,820
In my opinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university

190
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,300
venue

191
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,220
Especially among colleagues, but that's fine. You know, we're all grown-ups. Well for me from my perspective. It was strangely rude

192
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,620
and it

193
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,860
had an era of like elitism

194
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,140
that

195
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,820
to me

196
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,260
Was it the source of the problem during covet that led to the distrust of science

197
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,940
And the the popularization of disrespecting science because so many scientists spoke with an arrogance and a douche baggery

198
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,140
That I wish we would have a little bit less of yeah, it's tough because most academics

199
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,420
Don't understand that people outside the university system

200
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,580
are

201
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,580
they don't they're not familiar with

202
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,300
like the inner workings of science and

203
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,100
And the culture and so you have to be very careful how you present when you're a university professor

204
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,180
And when yeah, so, you know, he came out swinging at some, you know

205
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,220
A four letter word type language and he was obviously upset about so I simply said what I would say anywhere

206
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,860
Which was hey look you come on the podcast. Let's chat

207
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,540
and

208
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,820
Why don't you give your tell me where I'm wrong and let's discuss and

209
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,900
and

210
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Fortunately, he agreed

211
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,500
And initially he said well, no, how can I be sure you're not going to misrepresent me and so I said we got on a

212
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,340
Dm then an email then eventually phone call and just said hey listen like you're welcome to record the whole conversation

213
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,420
We've never done a gotcha on my podcast and let's just get to the heart of the matter. I think this this little controversy is

214
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,740
perfect

215
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,700
kindling for for a really great discussion and

216
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,180
And he had some other conditions that we worked out and and I and I felt like

217
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,900
Cool like he's really interested although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on twitter

218
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,580
I will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule

219
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,020
I said it will fly you out or put you up. He said no he wants to fly himself

220
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,300
He really wants to make sure that there's like kind of a space between

221
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,740
um

222
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,300
I think some of the perception of science and health podcasts in the academic community is that

223
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,220
It's all designed to sell something. No, we run ads so it can be free to everyone else

224
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,740
Yeah, but I think look in the end. Um, he agreed and I'm excited for the conversation

225
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
It was interesting because

226
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,780
In the wake of that little exchange

227
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,220
There's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol

228
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,780
in many in many cultures as

229
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,500
Within the united states as when I say cultures. I mean demographics

230
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
The united states as the as the drug of choice

231
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,580
um

232
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,900
There have been people highlighting the issues of potential psychosis in high thc containing

233
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,820
and so it's

234
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,700
Kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of on board certain elements that you know, I put forward and

235
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,660
I think there's some controversy as to whether or not the different strains the indicas and sativas

236
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,140
I have are biologically different, etc. So we'll get down into the weeds pun intended

237
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,340
During that one and I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to

238
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
A direct criticism online about

239
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Um scientific content in a way that really promoted like oh here the idea of inviting a particular guest

240
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,580
And so it's great. Let's get a guest to um his expert in cannabis

241
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,700
I I believe I could be wrong about this that he's a behavioral neuroscientist is slightly different training

242
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,220
but look he seems highly credentialed to be fun and we

243
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,260
You know, we welcome that kind of exchange

244
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,860
I

245
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,660
I'm not being diplomatic. I'm just saying like it's cool. Like he's coming on

246
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
No, you you know, and he was friendly on the phone, right?

247
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,820
Like he literally came out online and was like basically like kind of like fu

248
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,460
Like f this and fu, but you get someone on the phone. It's like, hey, how's it going? And then like, oh, yeah

249
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,460
Well, you know, I there was an immediate apology of like, hey, listen. I came out. Normally. I'm like not like that

250
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,340
But online, you know, you got a different. Yeah. Okay, so it's a little bit like it's a little bit like jiu-jitsu, right?

251
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,460
People say all sorts of things I guess but if they if you're like, all right, well

252
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,020
Let's go then it's probably a different story

253
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,060
You know, it's not like jiu-jitsu because the jiu-jitsu people don't talk shit because they know what the consequences are

254
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,860
Let me let me just say on mic and off mic. You have been very respectful towards this person

255
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,220
And I'm look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been

256
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,180
That said to me that guy was being a dick and when you graciously politely invited him on the podcast

257
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,260
He was still talking down to you the whole time. So I really admire and look forward to listening to you talk to him

258
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
But I hope others

259
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,700
don't do that

260
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,460
like you are

261
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,820
a positive

262
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,580
humble voice

263
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,980
Exploring all the interesting aspects of science like you want to learn if there you've got anything wrong

264
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,060
You want to learn about it the way he was being a dick

265
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,380
I was just

266
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,780
Hurt a little bit not because of him but because like there's some people I really really admire

267
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,460
Brilliant scientists that are not their best cells

268
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,020
On twitter on x definitely. I don't understand what happens to their brain. Well, they regress

269
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,460
They they regress and and they also are protected, you know, you know, when you remove the

270
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,340
I mean no scientific argument should ever come to physical blows, right?

271
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,220
But when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody, um

272
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,620
People will throw all sorts of stones at a distance, you know an over a wall

273
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,380
and they've got their

274
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,460
Their wife or their husband or their boyfriend or their dog or their cat to go cuddle with them afterwards

275
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,980
um

276
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,780
But you get in a room and it's like, you know

277
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
confrontational people

278
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
In real life are are pretty rare

279
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,860
But hopefully if they do it they're like willing to back it up with knowledge in this case, right?

280
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,260
We're not talking about physical altercation. Yeah, he kept coming and he kept putting on conditions

281
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,660
How do I know you want this and I was like, well, you can record the conversation

282
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,540
How do I know you want that? Listen, we'll pay for you to come out. How do you know and eventually he just kind of relented?

283
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,460
and um

284
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,780
And it to his credit, you know, he's agreed to come on

285
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,220
I mean he still has to show up

286
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,980
But once he does, you know, we'll treat him right like we would any other guest

287
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,020
Yeah, you treat people really well and I I just hope that people are a little bit nicer on the internet

288
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,340
Yeah, well, you know x is an interesting one because you it thickens your skin

289
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,380
You know to just to go on there. I mean you have to be ready to deal with sure

290
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:37,780
But I can still criticize people for for being douchebags because like that's still not good inspiring behavior like especially for scientists

291
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,380
That should be sort of symbols of

292
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,140
Scientific thinking which requires intellectual humility

293
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,740
Humility is a big part of that and twitter is a good place to illustrate that

294
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,460
Yeah, eight years ago. I used to I was a student in ta then

295
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,020
Instructor and then directed a cold spring harbour course on visual neuroscience. These are summer courses that

296
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,140
Explore different topics and at night we would host

297
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,060
Um, what we hoped were battles in front of the students

298
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,460
Where you'd get two people on it, you know, would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that would first, you know

299
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,340
Restore vision to the blind kind of arguments

300
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,540
You know, kind of like it's kind of a silly argument because there's gonna be a combination of both, right?

301
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,060
but

302
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,900
You'd get these great arguments

303
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:32,180
But the arguments were always couched in data and occasionally you'd get somebody would go like or would curse or something

304
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,460
But it was the rare very um very well placed

305
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,220
You know, um insult it wasn't you know coming out swinging

306
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,060
Um, I think ultimately, you know twitter is a record of people's behavior

307
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,500
That the internet is a record of people's behavior and here i'm not talking about news reports about people's behavior

308
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I'm talking about how people show up

309
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,980
Online up is really important. You've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect and

310
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,660
You know, you just you would hope that people would grow from that example

311
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,260
Well, I'll tell you that the the podcasters that i'm scouting it's their energy

312
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,540
But it's also how they treat other people how they respond to comments and um, you know

313
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,060
We're blessed to have pretty significant reach when we put out a podcast like someone else's podcast

314
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:21,220
It goes far and wide so like a skateboard team like a laboratory where you're selecting people to be in your lab

315
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,700
You're you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and they're collegial

316
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,420
Etiquette and etiquette is is lacking nowadays

317
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
But you're in the suit and tie bringing it back

318
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,980
bringing it back

319
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,700
Uh, you said that your conversation with james hollis

320
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,460
A union psychoanalyst had a big impact on you. What do you mean?

321
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,340
james hollis is a

322
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,020
84 year old union

323
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,860
psychoanalyst who's written 17 books including under Saturn shadow

324
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,660
Which is on the healing and trauma of men the eating eden project. Excuse me, which is about relationships and creating a life

325
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,180
I discovered james hollis in an online lecture that was recorded. I think in san diego. It's on youtube

326
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,500
The audio is terrible called creating a life

327
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,980
And this was somewhere in the 2011 to 2015 span

328
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,820
I can't remember and I was on my way to europe and I called my girlfriend at the time

329
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,380
I was like, I just found the most incredible lecture i've ever heard

330
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,620
and I

331
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,300
he talks about

332
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,500
the shadow

333
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
he talks about

334
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,620
Your developmental upbringing and how you either align with or go 180 degrees off your

335
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,940
Parents tendencies and values in certain areas. He talked about

336
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,740
The specific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life

337
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,020
so it's always been a dream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast

338
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,940
and

339
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,780
He wasn't able to travel so our team went out to dc and sat down with him

340
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,220
we rarely do that nowadays people come to our studio and

341
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,820
He came in he had some surgeries recently and he kind of came in with some assistance from a you know a cane and then

342
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
sat down and just

343
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,420
Just blew my mind it from start to finish

344
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
He didn't miss a syllable

345
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,020
and every sentence that he spoke was

346
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,860
like a quotable sentence of with real potency and

347
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,620
Actionable items. I think one of the things that was most

348
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,860
striking

349
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,260
To me was how he said when we take ourselves out of stimulus and response

350
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,020
And we just force ourselves to spend some time in the quiet of our thoughts

351
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,100
While walking or while seated or while lying down doesn't have to be meditation, but it could be

352
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,500
that

353
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,780
We access our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want

354
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,180
And that if we do that practice repeatedly 10 minutes a day here 15 minutes a day there

355
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
that we start to really touch into

356
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,540
Our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take

357
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,740
But that so often we just stay in stimulus response. We just do do do do do, which is great. We have to be productive

358
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
um, but we miss those

359
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,340
um

360
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,340
important messages and

361
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
interestingly he also

362
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:19,060
Put forward this idea of what is this like get up shut up suit up. Yeah something like that like get out of bed suit up

363
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,820
And shut up and get to work. He also has that in him kind of a Goggins type mindset

364
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,580
So be able to turn off all this self-reflection and self analysis and just get shit done get shit done

365
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,660
But then also take dedicated time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind

366
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,860
and he quotes shakespeare and he quotes yung and he quotes

367
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,420
Everybody through history with with incredible accuracy and um

368
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,380
and in exactly the way

369
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,220
Needed to drive home a point, but that conversation to me was one that I really felt like okay, you know

370
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,260
If I don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason

371
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,460
That one's in the can and I feel really great about it. It's it to me. It's the most important

372
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
guest recording we've ever done

373
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,820
um

374
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,540
In particular because he has wisdom

375
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
And while I hope he lives to be

376
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,580
204

377
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,700
Chances are he's got another what 20 30 years with us. Hopefully

378
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,540
More but I really really wanted to capture that information and get it out there

379
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,540
So I'm very very proud of that one

380
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,820
um

381
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,500
And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him young old male female whatever and you're gonna get something of value

382
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
What do you think about this idea?

383
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,100
of the shadow

384
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,460
that uh

385
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
The good the bad that we were press

386
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,300
That hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves. That's there. You think there's like a ocean

387
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
We don't have direct access to yes

388
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,540
Yeah, young said it we have all things inside of us and we do and some people are more in touch with those than others and

389
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,060
Some people it's repressed. I mean does that mean that we could all be

390
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,900
You know horrible people or marvelous people

391
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,100
Benevolent people perhaps I think that

392
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,740
um

393
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,980
Thankfully more often than not people lean away from the like violent and

394
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,460
harmful parts of their their shadow, but I think spending time

395
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,180
thinking about

396
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
you know ones

397
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,980
Shadow shadows is super important. How how else are we going to grow otherwise?

398
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,660
you know, we have these unconscious blind spots of denial or

399
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,500
um

400
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,900
Repression or whatever, you know, the psychiatrists tell us

401
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,060
But yeah, it clearly exists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do we have neural circuits for

402
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,220
altruism

403
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,700
um, and no one's born without these things

404
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,300
and some people they're atrophied and some people they're hypertrophied but

405
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,460
Looking inward and and recognizing what's there is

406
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,220
key

407
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,940
Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what rick rubin is accessing when he goes silent

408
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Silent body active mind

409
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
That's interesting. What is it for you?

410
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
What place do you go to?

411
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,300
That generates ideas that helps you generate ideas. I have a lot of new practices around this

412
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,100
I mean, I'm all like always exploring for protocols. I have to it's like in my nature

413
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,540
um

414
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:31,300
When when I went and spent time with rick, I I tried to adopt his practice of staying very still and just letting stuff

415
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,900
You know come to the surface or the dystherothian way of

416
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,980
Formulating complete sentences and while being still in the body

417
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,300
what I

418
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,140
I found works better is what my good friend tim armstrong

419
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Does to write music he writes music every day. He's a music producer. He's obviously a singer guitar player for rancid

420
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
um, and he's helped

421
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,940
dozens and dozens and dozens of

422
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,260
female pop artists and punk rock artists

423
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,780
write great songs and many of the

424
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,460
famous songs that you've heard from other artists

425
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Tim helped them write

426
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,980
Tim

427
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,780
Wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night and what he does is he'll start drawing or painting

428
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,060
So what he's done and joni mitchell talks about this too. You find some creative outlet

429
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,380
that's

430
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,620
like 15 degrees off center from your

431
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,860
Main creative outlet and you do that thing. So for me, that's drawing. I like doing anatomical drawings

432
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,820
Neuroscience based drawing drawn neurons that kind of thing and if I do that for a little while

433
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,140
My mind starts churning on the the nervous system and biology and then I come up with

434
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Areas I'd like to explore for the podcast

435
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,860
Ways I'd like to address certain topics right now

436
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,620
I'm very interested in autonomic control of beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to control their pupil sizes

437
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,300
And without changing luminance through a bio feedback mechanism

438
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
um, and that gives them

439
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,060
control over their so-called automatic autonomic nervous system

440
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,500
And I've been looking at what the circuitry is and it's it's beautiful. So I'll draw the circuitry

441
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,340
That we know underlies autonomic function and as I'm doing that I'm thinking

442
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,180
Oh, like what about autonomic control and those people that supposedly can control their pupil size

443
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,780
Then you go in and there's a paper published in nature press one of the nature journals

444
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,540
And there's a recent paper on this like oh cool

445
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,180
And then we talk about this and then how could this be put into a kind of a post or how could this?

446
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,540
You know, so doing things that are about 15 degrees off center from your main thing is a great way to access

447
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,620
I believe that the circuits for in tim's case painting goes to songwriting

448
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
I think for

449
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,300
Joni Mitchell that was also the case, right? I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting

450
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
For rick. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's

451
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,580
listening to podcasts. I don't know that that's his business. Do you have anything that you like to

452
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,780
Focus on that allows you then an easier transition into your main creative work

453
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,220
No, I'd really like to focus on emptiness and silence

454
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,100
So I pick the dragon. I have to slay. So whatever the problem I have to work on and I just sit there

455
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,420
And stare at I love how fucking linear you are

456
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,580
And I just and if there's no if you're tired, I'll just sit

457
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,780
I believe in the in the power of just waiting

458
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,620
and

459
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Usually I'll stop being tired

460
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,780
Or the energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere

461
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,420
But there needs to be a silence and an emptiness. It's an empty room. Just me and the dragon and

462
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,460
We wait, that's it. Like if it's a usually with programming you're thinking about a particular design like how do I design this thing

463
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
To solve this problem

464
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,060
Any cognitive enhancers? I've got it quite the gallery in front of me. Well, that's right. Yeah

465
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,900
Should we walk through this? Yeah, this is not there's not a sales thing. It's just

466
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:55,060
Um, I tend to do this bounce back and forth your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices

467
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,860
So water all my refrigerator. I know right. There's no food in there. There's water

468
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,380
There's element which they now have canned. Yeah, and yes, they're a podcast sponsor for both of us

469
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,340
But that's not why I cracked one of these open. I like them provide their they're cold

470
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,540
And that's by the way, my least favorite flavors. I was saying that's that's the reason it's still left in the fridge

471
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,860
The cherry one is really good. The black cherry. There's an orange one

472
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,500
Yeah, I pushed the um the sled this morning and pulled the sled for my workout at the gym

473
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:30,340
And and it was hot today here in austin. So um some salt is good and then matina urba mate zero sugar full confession

474
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:36,260
I helped develop this i'm a partial owner, but I love urba mate half argentine been drinking mate since i was a

475
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,540
Little kid there's actually a photo somewhere on the internet when i'm like three sitting on my grandfather's lap sipping mate out the

476
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,940
Gourd and then this my fun interesting. This is just a little bit of coffee

477
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,260
With a scoop of brian johnson gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened cocoa

478
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,220
So I put that in chocolate and I like it it just for the taste

479
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,500
Well, actually nukes my appetite and since i'm we're not going out to dinner tonight until later. I figure that's good

480
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,700
Yeah, brian's an interesting one, right? He's really pushing this this thing the optimization of everything

481
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,660
Although he just heard his ankle. He posted a photo. He heard his ankle

482
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,940
So now he's injecting bpc body protection compound 157 which many many people are taking by the way

483
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
I did an episode on peptides

484
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,660
I should just say, you know bpc 157 one of the known effects in animal models

485
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,020
Is angiogenesis like development of new vasculature, which can be great

486
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,980
In some context, but also if you have a tumor you don't really want to vascularize that tumor anymore

487
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,260
So I worry about people taking bpc 157 continually

488
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,900
but um

489
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,420
And there's very little human data. I think there's like one study and it's a lousy one. So a lot of animal data

490
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,220
Some of the peptides

491
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,980
Are interesting. However, there's one that I've experimented with a little bit called pinealyn

492
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,020
Which um, I find even if I've just taken it twice a week before sleep

493
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,300
Then it times it seems to do something to the

494
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,020
Circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other days when I don't take it

495
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,660
I get unbelievably tired at that time that normally I would do the injection

496
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,140
These are things that I'll experiment with for a couple weeks and then typically stop maybe try something else

497
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
but I stay out of

498
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,660
Things that really stimulate any of like a major hormone pathways

499
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,460
When it comes to peptides, there's actually a really good question of how do you experiment?

500
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,500
Like how long do you try to think to figure out if it works for you?

501
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,300
Well, I'm very sensitive to these things. So I and I have been doing a lot of things for a long time

502
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,900
So if I add something in it's always one thing at a time and I notice right away

503
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,580
If it does not make me feel good like there's a lot of excitement about some of the

504
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,140
so-called growth hormone secretogogs

505
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
hypermoralin, testemoralin, sermoralin

506
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,140
Um, I've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've

507
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Nuked my rap and eye movement sleep

508
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,620
But given me a lot of deep sleep, which doesn't feel good to me, but other people like them

509
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,180
I also

510
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,300
just

511
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,060
Generally try and avoid

512
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into all sorts of issues

513
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,740
But some people take them safely

514
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,500
But usually after about four or five days

515
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,180
I know if I like something or I don't and then I move on, but I am not super adventurous with these things

516
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,660
I know people that will take cocktails of peptides with multiple things. They'll try anything

517
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
That's not me and I do blood work

518
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,660
um, but also I'm you know, I'm mainly

519
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,820
reading papers and podcasting and um, I'm

520
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,540
Teaching a course next spring. Stanford. I'm gonna do a big undergraduate course

521
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,140
um, so I'm trying to develop that course and things like that so

522
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:40,500
Um, I don't need to lift more weight or run further than I already do which is not that much weight or far as it is

523
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,300
All right, you're not going to the olympics. You're not trying to no truly maximize some aspect of your performance

524
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,260
No, and I'm not and I'm not trying to get down below whatever, you know, seven percent body fat or something

525
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
I don't have those kinds of goals

526
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,580
So hydration electrolytes caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing and then and then here's one that I think

527
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,740
I brought out for discussion. This is a piece of Nicarat. They're not a sponsor

528
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,260
um

529
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
nicotine is an interesting compound

530
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,740
it will raise blood pressure

531
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
and it um

532
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,900
Is probably not safe for everybody, but you know, the nicotine is gaining in popularity like crazy mainly these um

533
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,420
Pouches that people put in the lip not we're not talking about. I'm smoking vaping dipping or snuffing

534
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,500
you know, my

535
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,940
interest in nicotine started this was in 2010

536
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:34,660
I was visiting columbia medical school and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist richard axl won the noble prize

537
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,260
Co-recipient with linda buck for the um discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction

538
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,540
Brilliant guy. He's probably in his late 70s now probably. Yeah, and he kept popping nicorette in his mouth

539
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,300
And I was like, what's this about and he said, oh, well, this was just anecdote, right?

540
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,780
But he said but he said this he said, oh, well, you know, it protects against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

541
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,500
I said it does and he goes, yeah, I don't know if he was kidding or not

542
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,780
He's known for making jokes and then he said that when he used to smoke

543
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,940
It really helped his focus and creativity

544
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,700
But then he quit smoking because he went lung cancer and he found that he couldn't focus as well

545
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,740
So he would choose nicorette. So occasionally like right now

546
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,580
Well, each I do a half a piece, but I'm not russian

547
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,020
So I'm a little, you know, you know, did you spot the whole thing in your mouth?

548
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,460
So I'll do a couple milligrams every now and again

549
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,180
And it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular, but you fast all day

550
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,620
You're still doing one meal a day one meal a day. Yeah. Yeah, I did a nicotine pouch with Rogan at dinner

551
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,580
And I got high. Yeah, that's a lot

552
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,060
That's like usually six or eight milligrams

553
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,220
I know people that

554
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
get a canister of zin

555
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,660
Take one a day pretty soon. They're taking a canister a day. So you have to be very careful. I will only allow myself

556
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
two pieces of nicorette total

557
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,300
per week

558
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
And you will notice that

559
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,220
You know in the day after you use it, you know, sometimes your your throat will feel a little bit like

560
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Like a little spasmy like you might want to cough once or twice

561
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,700
And so, you know, if you're a singer or your podcast or something you have to do a long podcast

562
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,900
You want to just be mindful of but yeah, you're supposed to kind of like keep it in your cheek and

563
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
Now here we go, but it did make me

564
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,180
Intensely focused in a way that was a little bit scary because um the nucleus basalis

565
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,900
Is in the you know, basal forebrain nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out

566
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,020
axons little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere

567
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,820
and when you focus on one particular

568
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,740
Topic matter or one particular area of your visual field or listening to something and focusing visually

569
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,820
We know that there's a an elaboration of the amount of acetylcholine release there and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites there

570
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,220
So it's a kind of an attentional modulation

571
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,620
by acetylcholine. So you're getting in with nicotine. You're getting a

572
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,340
Exogenous or artificial

573
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,700
heightening of that

574
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,020
circuitry and the time I had talk of Carlson on the podcast. He told me that apparently

575
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
It helps him as he said publicly

576
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860
keep his

577
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,020
Love life vibrant really it caused a visa constriction

578
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,940
Like he literally said it makes his dick very hard. He said that publicly also

579
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,900
Okay, well as little as I want to think about Tucker Carlson's

580
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,460
sex life

581
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,140
no disrespect

582
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
uh the

583
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,940
Major effect of nicotine on the vascular my understanding is that it causes vasoconstriction not vasodilation

584
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
drugs like cialis to dallafill

585
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,820
Viagra etc vasodilators they allow more blood flow

586
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,820
Um

587
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:48,740
Nicotine does the opposite less blood flow to the periphery, but provided dosages are kept low and I don't recommend people use it frequently

588
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,940
Or at all and I don't recommend young people use it, you know, um, you know

589
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:00,660
25 and younger brain's very plastic at that time and um, and certainly smoking dipping

590
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,620
Vaping it's nothing aren't good because you're gonna run into we were running into trouble

591
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,700
For other reasons, but in any case, um, well and even there vaping is a controversial topic

592
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,700
Probably safer than smoking but has its own issues and

593
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,060
I said something like that and boy did I catch a lot of heat for that

594
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,340
You can't say anything as a health science educator not piss somebody off

595
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,900
You know, it just depends on where the the center of mass is and how far outside that you are

596
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,020
For me the caffeine is the main thing

597
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,340
And actually it's a it's a really big part of my life and one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning

598
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Oh, yeah to consume caffeine if

599
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,740
they

600
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,420
Experience a crash in the afternoon that this is one of the misconceptions. I

601
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,820
um

602
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,380
I regret maybe even discussing it for people that crash in the afternoon

603
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,420
Oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by 60 and 90 minutes in the morning, they will offset some of that

604
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,060
But if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep all the night before you're not gonna avoid that

605
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,820
afternoon crash

606
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,780
But I'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration caffeine, especially if I'm gonna work out. Here's a weird one

607
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
If I exercise before

608
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,100
8 30 a.m

609
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,660
Especially if I start exercising when I'm a little bit tired

610
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,140
I get energy that lasts all day

611
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,420
If I wait until my peak of energy, which is mid morning 10 a.m. 11 a.m.

612
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:32,500
And I started exercising then I'm basically exhausted all afternoon and I don't understand why I mean it depends on the intensity of the

613
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,380
Workout, but so I like to be done showered

614
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,300
and

615
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,220
Heading into work by 9 a.m. But I don't always meet that much

616
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,980
So you're saying it doesn't affect your energy if you start out with exercising

617
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:51,780
I think you can get energy and wake yourself up with exercise if you start early and it and then that fuels you all day long

618
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,380
I think that if you wait until you're feeling at your best to train

619
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,980
Sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing like the work we get paid for

620
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:07,860
Like research podcasting, etc. Then oftentimes, you know, your your brain isn't firing as well

621
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,780
That's interesting. I haven't really rigorously tried that wake up and just start running or this is the gioco thing

622
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:20,660
And then there's this phenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise or eat

623
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:27,140
Or socialize or if you bright light at a certain time of day for three to seven days in a row pretty soon

624
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,740
There's an anticipatory circuit that gets generated. This is why

625
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,540
anyone in theory can become a morning person

626
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,660
to some degree or another and this is also

627
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,260
Beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off, you know

628
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,860
People wake up and all of a sudden it goes off

629
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:49,060
It wasn't because it clicked it's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep

630
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,860
And there's some papers that have been published in the last couple of years

631
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:59,300
Nature neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math problems in their sleep simple math problems, but math problems nonetheless

632
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,020
This does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're going to answer accurately

633
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
like they might screw up the whole

634
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:16,660
A cumulative probability of 20 across multiple months. All right, listen, what happened? What happened? Here's the deal

635
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:23,060
A few years back. I did a four and a half hour after editing four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility

636
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
The entire recording took 11 hours

637
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,140
and

638
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,340
At one point during the and by the way, I'm very proud of that episode

639
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,140
There's many couples have written to me

640
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:41,300
And said they now have children as a consequence of that episode and my first question is what were you doing during the episode?

641
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,580
But in all seriousness, um, we should say that it's four and a half hours

642
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,500
and

643
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,980
People then they should listen to the episode. You're it's extremely technical episode

644
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:59,380
Like you're not stopped dropping facts and and referencing huge number of papers. It must be exhaust

645
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,220
I don't understand how you can possibly that's about sperm health sperma genesis. It talks about

646
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,860
The ovulatory cycle it talks about things people can do that are that are considered

647
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,540
Absolutely supported by science that talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental

648
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,860
It talks about IVF. It talks about xt. It talks about

649
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,500
Um, all of that it talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age

650
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,980
et cetera

651
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,780
um, but there's this one portion there in the podcast where I'm talking about the

652
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,660
uh, probability of a successful pregnancy

653
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,220
as a function of age and

654
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,300
so

655
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,220
There was a clip that was cut in which I was describing cumulative

656
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,740
probability

657
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,300
And by the way, we've published cumulative probability historians in many of my laboratory's papers

658
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,820
Including one that was a nature article in 2018. So we run these all the time

659
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,300
And yes, I know the difference between independent and cumulative probability. Okay, that's like I do

660
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,180
um, the way the clip was cut

661
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,740
And what I stated unfortunately combined to like a pretty great gaffe

662
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,780
Where I say you're just adding percent

663
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,420
I said you just adding percentages 20 20 to 120 percent and then I made us kind of

664
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,500
Unfortunately, my humor isn't always so good and I made a joke. I said

665
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,780
um 120 percent, but that's a different thing altogether. What I should have said was

666
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,140
um, that's impossible

667
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,460
You know and here here's how it actually works

668
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,220
but then that it continues where I then described the cumulative probability histogram for um

669
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:38,260
Successful pregnancy, but somewhere in the early portion. I I misstated something right. I made a math error

670
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,900
Um, which implied I didn't understand the difference between independent and cumulative probability

671
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:50,260
Which I do and it got picked up and and run and people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense

672
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,100
And so what I did in response to it was rather than

673
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Just say everything I just said now

674
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,620
I said

675
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,780
I just came out online and said hey folks

676
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,940
In an episode

677
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,420
They did this on fertility. I made a math error

678
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,620
Here is the formula for cumulative probability

679
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,260
Successful pregnancy at that age. Here's the graph. Here's the you know, and I

680
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:17,060
Offered it as a teaching moment in two ways one for people to understand cumulative probability

681
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,660
It was sort of interesting to a number of people that had come out critiquing the gaffe

682
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,820
also, um like biology and folks came out pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability

683
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,060
So there was a lot of posturing, you know, the dog pile oftentimes people are quick to dog pile

684
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,740
They didn't understand but a lot of people did understand some smart people out there, obviously

685
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,420
I called my dad and he was just laughing. He goes. Oh, this is good

686
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,100
This is like the old school way of of hammering academics. Um

687
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,820
But the point being there was a teaching moment

688
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:51,460
Um, give me an opportunity to say hey, I made a mistake. I also made a mistake in another podcast where I

689
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:58,340
Did a micron to millimeter conversion and or centimeter conversion, but and we always correct these in the show note captions

690
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,340
We correct them in the audio now

691
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:05,780
um, unfortunately on youtube, it's harder to correct you can't go and edit in segments we put in the captions, but

692
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,340
That was the one teaching moment if you make a mistake that's substantive and relate to data

693
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,540
You you apologize and correct a mistake use this teaching moment

694
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,540
The other one was to say, hey, you know

695
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,420
In all the thousands of hours of content we've put out. I'm sure I've made some small errors

696
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,940
I think I once said serotonin 1m and dopamine and you know, you're going you're you're riffing and

697
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
It's a reminder to be careful

698
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,420
To edit double check but the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections

699
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,980
But it didn't feel good at first but ultimately, you know, I can laugh at myself about it

700
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,900
Long ago at Berkeley when I was teeing my first

701
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,180
Class it was a biopsychology class between 1998 or 1999

702
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,060
I was drawing the pituitary

703
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,540
Gland it which is you know, it has an interior and a posterior lobe actually is a medial lobe too

704
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,180
I have five six hundred students in that lecture hall and I drew it was chalkboard

705
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,500
And I drew the two lobes of the pituitary and I said my back was to the audience

706
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,220
I said, you know, and so they just sort of hang there

707
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,020
And everyone just erupted in laughter because it looked like a scrotum with two testicles

708
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
And I remember thinking like oh my god

709
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,380
I don't think I can turn around like in face this

710
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,540
You know and like I only got to turn around sooner or later

711
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,540
So I turned around and we just all had a big laugh together. It was embarrassing

712
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,300
I'll tell you one thing though. They never forgot about the two lobes of the pituitary

713
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah, and you haven't forgotten about that either right. There's a high

714
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,060
High salience for these kinds of things and it also was

715
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,940
kind of fun to see

716
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,700
How excited people get to see people trip

717
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,620
It's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid like, you know

718
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,100
Runs the opposite direction out of the blocks or something like that and and or uh, you know

719
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,580
I recall it one world cup

720
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:59,380
Match years ago a guy scored against his own team. I think they killed the guy. Do you remember that?

721
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,780
Some South American or Central American team. Yeah, and they killed the guy

722
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,820
But yeah, let's let's look it up. I just said

723
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,540
World cup. Yeah, he was gunned down

724
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:16,820
Andres Escobar, yeah scored against his own team in 1994 world cup in the United States

725
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:25,140
Just 27 years old playing for the Colombia national team. Yeah, last name Escobar. It's a good name

726
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,540
I think it would protect you

727
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,700
listen, you know, so

728
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,860
There are some gaffes that get

729
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,860
people

730
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,980
killed

731
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,500
right, so

732
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,100
you know

733
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,820
How forgiving are we for online mistakes?

734
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,740
You know, I said just the nature of the mistakes people were quite gracious about the

735
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,580
the gaff and some weren't and you know, it's interesting that

736
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,420
We

737
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,980
As you know public health science educators

738
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,620
You know, we'll do long podcast sometimes and and you need to be really careful. What's great is AI

739
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,100
Allows you to check these things now more readily

740
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,100
so

741
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
that's cool and

742
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,140
There are ways that it's now going to be more self-correcting. I mean, you know, I think

743
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,180
There's there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool

744
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,460
Like things are getting cleaned up. Yeah, but mistakes nevertheless will happen. Are you do you feel the pressure?

745
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,020
of

746
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,020
Not making mistakes. Sure

747
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:34,580
I mean, you know, I try and get things right to the best of you know, to the best of my ability

748
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,420
Um, I check with experts. It's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast

749
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:47,860
A lot of times I chuckle because I'm you know at Stanford. We have some amazing scientists, but I talk to them else people elsewhere

750
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,740
um, and

751
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,740
it's always interesting to me

752
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,780
how

753
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,900
You know, I'll get divergent information

754
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,660
And then I'll find the overlap in the Venn diagram and I have this like question

755
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,820
Do I just stay with the overlap in the Venn diagram?

756
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,060
They I didn't episode on oral health. I didn't know this until I researched that episode, but

757
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,060
Oral health is

758
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:20,660
critically related to heart health and brain health that there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus, you know

759
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,580
that

760
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,020
can make its way into other parts of the body through the mouth that

761
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:33,060
Can cause serious issues. There's the idea that some forms of dementia some forms of heart disease are start in the mouth

762
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,260
basically

763
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,260
I talked to no fewer than four

764
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,540
Dentists dental experts and there was a lot of convergence. I also learned that

765
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,780
Teeth can demineralize that's the formation of cavities

766
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,860
They can also remineralize as long as the cavity isn't too deep it can actually fill itself back in

767
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,900
Especially if you provide the right substrates for it

768
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:59,380
That saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth provided the milieu is right

769
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,100
Things like alcohol-based mouth washes killing off some of the critical things you need

770
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,220
This is fascinating and I put out that episode thinking oh, I'm not a dentist

771
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:13,060
I'm not an oral health episode. I talked to a pediatric dentist. There's a terrific one doctor downscore stacy

772
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,700
staci on

773
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,940
Instagram does great content talk to some others

774
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,700
Um

775
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,420
And like and then I just waited for the attack. I was like here we go and it didn't come

776
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,140
And dentists were thanking me. I was like, whoa

777
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,660
You know

778
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,860
That's a rare thing more often than not if I do an episode about say psilocybin or mdma

779
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,700
You get some people liking it or adhd and the drugs for adhd

780
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,740
We did a whole episode on the riddle and vivants adder all stuff

781
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,940
You get people saying thank you, you know, I prescribe this to my kid and it really helps and and this and

782
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,540
But they're

783
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:51,140
Private about the fact that they do it because they get so much attack from other people

784
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,140
so

785
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,140
I like to find the center of mass

786
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,060
report that

787
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,060
Try and make it as clear as possible

788
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,260
And then I know that there's some stuff where I'm going to catch shit

789
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,780
What's frustrating for me is when

790
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,300
Like I see claims that I'm like against fluoridization of water, which I'm not right

791
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,620
Like we talked about the benefits of fluoride it builds a hyper strong bonds within the teeth

792
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,700
I went and looked at some of the

793
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,020
the literally the crystal struck not excuse me not the crystal structure, but the they

794
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:30,500
Essentially the like micron and sub micron structure of teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds

795
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,100
And you can also form them with things like hydroxyapatite. And why is there fluoride in water? Well, it's the best

796
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,140
Okay

797
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,620
You get you say some things that are interesting

798
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,740
But then somehow it gets turned into like your against fluoridization

799
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:48,260
Which I'm not or I've been accused of being against sunscreen. I wear mineral based sunscreen on my face

800
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,860
I don't want to get skin cancer or I use a physical barrier

801
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,780
There is a cohort of people out there that think that all sunscreens are bad. I'm not one of them

802
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,780
I'm not what's called a sunscreen truther

803
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,820
But then you get attacked for like if you so we're talking about there are certain sunscreens that are problematic

804
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:09,300
So what and ronda patricks now starting to get vocal about this and so there are certain topics. It's interesting for which

805
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,260
You have to listen

806
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,660
carefully to

807
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:21,380
What somebody is saying, but there's a lump or or lumping as opposed to splitting of of what health educators say

808
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:27,780
And so it just seems like like with politics. There's this like urgency to just put people into a camp of

809
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:35,460
Expert versus like renegade or something and it's not like that. It's just not like that. So the short answer is I really strive

810
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,900
Really strive to get things right, but I know that I'm going to piss certain people off and you've taught me

811
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,460
and

812
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,460
joe's taught me and

813
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,940
Other podcasters have taught me that like if you worry too much about it

814
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,900
Um, then you aren't going to get the newest information out there like peptides

815
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,820
There's very little human data unless you're talking about by lisi or the melana

816
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,540
You know the stuff in the alpha melana site stimulating hormone stuff

817
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,060
which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or

818
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:11,140
Um, sermorellen which is for certain growth hormone deficiencies with with rare exception. There's very little human data

819
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,060
But people are still super interested and a lot of people are taking and doing these things

820
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,620
So you you want to get the information out do you try to

821
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,820
Not just look at the science but research what the communities are talking with the various communities

822
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:28,340
They're talking about like maybe research what the conspiracy theorists are talking about just so you know

823
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,540
All the armies that are going to be attacking your castle

824
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,140
Yes, so like for instance

825
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:40,820
There's a community of people online that believe that like if you consume seed oils or something that like

826
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,380
You're setting up your skin for sunburn and if you don't you know, like there's all these like

827
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,780
Theories, but I liked so I like to know what the theories are. I like to know what the extremes are

828
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:57,700
But I also like to know what the standard conversation is, but there's generally more agreement than disagreement. I think where um

829
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,300
You know, I've been kind of bullish actually is you know, or like supplements like people go

830
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,340
Oh supplements. Well, there's food supplements like a protein powder

831
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,540
Just different than a vitamin and then they are compounds

832
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,620
There are compounds that have real benefit

833
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,740
But people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated

834
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:22,020
But some of them are are vetted with for potency and for um safety with with more rigor than others

835
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,900
You know, and it's interesting to see

836
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,300
How

837
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,300
people who take care of themselves

838
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,100
And put a lot of work into that are often attacked that's been interesting

839
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:41,620
Also, one of the most controversial topics nowadays is ozampic munjaro. I'm very middle of the road on this. I don't understand why the

840
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,020
Quote-unquote health wellness community is so against these things

841
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,180
I also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route for some people

842
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:55,620
They've really helped them lose weight and yes, there can be some muscle loss and other lean lean body loss

843
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,220
But that can be offset with resistance training. They've helped a lot of people

844
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,260
And other people are like, no, this stuff is terrible

845
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,260
I think the most interesting thing about ozampic munjaro is that they are glp one

846
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,820
They're in the glp one pathway glucagon like peptide one

847
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,780
and it was discovered in healer monsters, which is a

848
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,540
uh

849
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,260
Lizard basically and someone what the now the now the entomologists will dive on me

850
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,540
It's a big big lizard looking thing that doesn't eat very often

851
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,820
And they figured out that there's this peptide that allows it to

852
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,700
curb its own appetite

853
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,180
At the level of the brain and the gut

854
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,180
And it has a lot of homology to sequence homology to what we now call glp one

855
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,860
So I love anytime there's animal biology links to cool human biology links to a drug

856
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:47,540
That's powerful that can help people with obesity and type 2 diabetes and there's evidence that can even curb some addictions

857
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,300
um

858
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,820
Those are newer data

859
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:56,260
But I don't see is it either or in fact, I've been a little bit disappointed at the way that the um

860
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,580
Whatever you want to call it health wellness biohacking community has like slammed on ozampic munjaro

861
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,900
It's like they're like just get out and run and listen

862
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,300
There are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them

863
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,180
They get on these drugs and they can improve and then hopefully they're also doing resistance training and eating better

864
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,180
And then you know, you're bringing all the elements together

865
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,420
Well, why do you think the criticism has happened? Is it that ozampic became super popular?

866
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,740
So people are misusing it or that kind of thing? No, I think what it is is that people

867
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:29,700
Think if it's a pharmaceutical, it's bad. Yeah, and then or if it's a supplement

868
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:35,780
It's bad depending on which camp they're in and and it wouldn't be wonderful to kind of like fill in the gap between this divide, you know

869
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,620
um, what I would like to see in politics and in health is

870
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:46,500
Um, neither right nor left, but what we can just call a league of reasonable people that looks at things on an issue by issue basis

871
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:52,660
And fills in the center because I think most people are in that are I don't want to say center in a political way

872
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,540
But I think most people are reasonable. They want to be reasonable, but that's not what sells clicks

873
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,420
That's not what that's not what drives interest

874
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:05,540
Um, but I'm a very like like I look at issue by issue person by person

875
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,940
I don't like in group out group stuff. I never have I've got friends from all walks of life

876
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,420
I said this another podcast and it always sounds like a like a political statement, but like the the

877
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,060
push towards like

878
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:23,380
You know polarization is it's so frustrating if there's one thing that's discouraging to me as I get older each year

879
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,180
I'm like, wow, are we ever going to get out of this?

880
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,460
like

881
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,220
polarization

882
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,300
Speaking of which, how are you going to vote for the presidential election?

883
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:40,100
I'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people involved and do it. Well, what do you think the role of podcast is going to be in this

884
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,940
year's election

885
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,460
I would love

886
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,460
a long-form conversations to happen with

887
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,540
With the candidates. I think it's going to be huge. I would love trump to go on rogan

888
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,300
I would I'm embarrassed to say this, but I would love to

889
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,780
Honestly, we'd love to see Joe Biden go on Joe Rogan also

890
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:05,540
I would imagine that both would go on but separately separately. I think it's I think a debate

891
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,900
Joe does debates, but I think Joe at his best is one-on-one conversation really intimate

892
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:18,100
Um, I I just wish that Joe Biden would actually do long-form conversations. I thought he had done it

893
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,260
It wasn't me. I think it was on

894
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:24,740
Jay Shetty's podcast. He did Jay Shetty. He did he did a few but what I mean long form. I mean

895
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,460
Um, really long form like two three hours and more relaxed

896
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,100
It was much more orchestrated because what happens when it's the interviews a little bit too short

897
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,820
It becomes into this generic

898
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,340
Political type of

899
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,460
NBC cnn type of interview you get a set of questions and you don't get to really

900
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,700
Feel the human

901
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:53,380
Expose the human to the light in it the full we talked about the shadow the good the bad and the ugly

902
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,740
So I think there's something magical about two three four hours

903
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,860
But it doesn't have to be that long, but it has to have that feeling to it

904
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:07,220
Where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous and you're going to be

905
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,060
Uh

906
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,980
Strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel but just shooting shit

907
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:19,700
Which Rogan is the best by far in the world at that. I don't think people really appreciate

908
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,580
how

909
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,940
skilled

910
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,220
he is

911
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,060
at what he does

912
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:31,860
And the number I mean the three or four podcasts per week plus plus the ufc announcement saying plus

913
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,580
comedy tours and stadiums plus

914
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,900
you know

915
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,380
doing comedy shows in the the middle of the week plus

916
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,260
You know husband and a father and a friend and

917
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,620
Jiu-Jitsu the guys got like superhuman levels of output

918
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:50,340
I I agree that long-form conversation is a whole other business

919
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,260
And I think that people want and deserve to know the people that are

920
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:59,380
Running for office at a in a different way and to really get to know them

921
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,140
Well, listen, you know, I I guess you

922
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,140
I mean, is it clear that he's going to do jail time or maybe he gets away?

923
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,180
No, I don't think I'm because I was gonna say I mean that does that mean you're gonna be podcasting from imprisonment

924
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,260
Yeah, we're going to back down going to

925
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:21,140
Figure out how to commit a crime so I can get in prison. Please don't please though. Well, that's I'm sure they have visitors

926
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Right. That just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview. But yeah, I understand

927
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,580
You wouldn't be able to wear that suit. You'd be wearing a different suit. That's true. Yeah

928
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:35,540
Um, it's gonna be interesting and and you do I'm not just saying this because you're my friend

929
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:42,900
But you would do a marvelous job. I think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and um and see what

930
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,820
What happens?

931
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,820
Here's one thing that I found really interesting

932
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,460
In this whole political landscape

933
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,820
When I'm in Los Angeles, I often get invited to these like

934
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,340
They're not dinners, but gatherings where you know a local

935
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,700
Um, you know, a bunch of podcasters will come together

936
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:03,380
But a lot of people from the entertainment industry big agencies

937
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,380
Big tech like big big tech many of the people have been on this podcast

938
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,140
and

939
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:14,980
They'll host a discussion or debate and what you find if you look around the room and you talk to people is that

940
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,460
About half the people in the room

941
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:22,820
Are very left leaning and very outspoken about that and they'll tell you exactly who they want to see in the

942
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,620
When the presidential race and the other half

943
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,700
We'll tell you that they're for the other side a lot of people that

944
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,060
People assume are on one side of the aisle or the other

945
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,340
Are in the exact opposite side now some people are very open about who that who they're for but

946
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,820
it's been very interesting to see how

947
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,140
Um when you get people one on one

948
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:50,180
They're like telling you they want x candidate to win or y candidate to win and sometimes like really?

949
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,740
I can't believe it like you like yep, and so it's what people think about

950
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,620
um

951
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,620
People's political lean is as often

952
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,260
Exactly wrong and and that's been

953
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,180
eye-opening for me

954
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,980
And I've seen that um in university campuses too

955
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:15,300
And and so it's going to be really really interesting to see what happens in in november in addition to that as you said

956
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,540
Most people are close to the center

957
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,540
Despite what twitter makes it seem like

958
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:23,380
Most people whether they're sent a lot to center right they're kind of close to the center

959
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,460
Yeah, I mean here's to me the most interesting question who is going to be the next

960
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,580
big candidate in years to come

961
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,300
Like who's that going to be right now? I don't I don't

962
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:39,860
I don't see or know of that person. Who's it going to be? Yeah, the young promising candidates. We're not seeing them

963
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,300
We're not seeing like who another way to ask that question

964
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,620
Who would want to be?

965
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,060
Well, that's the issue right?

966
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,900
You know it who wants to live in this 12 hour news cycle where you're just trying to

967
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:56,740
You know dunk on the other team so that nobody notices like that you're the shit that you fucked up

968
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,580
You know like that that's not like that's not only not fun or interesting. It also is just like

969
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,300
it's got to be psychosis inducing at some point and

970
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,100
I think that

971
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,140
You know god willing we're gonna you know

972
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,380
some young

973
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,500
guy or woman is like on this and refuses to

974
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,060
to back down

975
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:24,260
And was just like determined to be president and will make it happen

976
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,660
But like I don't even know who the

977
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,020
Bible candidates are

978
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,020
Maybe you lex, you know, we should ask sagar sagar would know

979
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,340
Yeah, yeah

980
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,340
Maybe sagar himself

981
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,420
Sagar's show is awesome. Yeah, he and crystal do a great thing. He's incredible

982
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,420
Especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on things. Yeah, that's what makes it so cool. He's great

983
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,580
He looks great in a suit looks real sexy. He's taking real good care of himself. I think he's getting married soon

984
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:57,620
Congratulations sagar forgive me for not remembering your wife a future wife's name. He uh, he won my heart by giving me

985
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,860
A biography of hitler as a president. That's what he gave you. Yeah, I gave you a hatchet

986
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,780
With a poem and that just shows the fundamental difference with a poem inscribed in it

987
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
Which was pretty damn good

988
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,580
I realized everything we bring up on the screen is like really

989
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,260
Depressing like the soccer player getting killed

990
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:26,180
Can we bring up something happy? Uh, sure. Let's go to uh nature's metal instagram

991
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:32,980
Those are pretty intense. We actually did a collaborative post on a on a shark thing. Really? Yeah, what kind of shark thing?

992
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:38,100
so to generate the fear vr stimulus for my lab in 20

993
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,340
Was it yet 2016 we went down to guadalupe island off the coast of mexico

994
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,980
Me and a guy named michael muller who's a very famous

995
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,940
portrait photographer, but also takes photos of sharks and

996
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,580
we

997
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,700
used

998
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,860
360 video to build vr of great white sharks brought it back to the lab

999
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,340
We published that study in current biology

1000
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,900
in 2017 went back down there

1001
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,220
um

1002
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,420
and

1003
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,260
That was the year that

1004
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,260
I exited the cage

1005
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,740
That you lower the cage with a crane and that year I exited the cage

1006
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:19,220
I had a whole mess with a air failure the day before I was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage

1007
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,220
I had no scuba on divers were out

1008
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,420
The thing got bow constricted up and I had an air failure and I had to actually share air and it was a whole mess

1009
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,860
Story for another time

1010
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:32,660
But the next day because I didn't want to get ptsd and it was pretty scary the next day I cage exited

1011
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,260
Um with some other divers and it turns out with these great white sharks

1012
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,940
In guadalupe the the water's very clear and you can swim toward them

1013
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,700
And then they'll they'll veer off you if you swim toward them. Otherwise, they see you as prey

1014
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,060
Well in the evening you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive

1015
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,700
and we

1016
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:57,140
We're hanging out fishing for a tuna. Uh, we had a one of the the crew on board had

1017
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,820
um

1018
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:03,940
A line in the water was fishing for tuna for dinner and a shark took the tuna off the line

1019
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:10,020
And it's a it's a very dramatic take and you can see the the just absolute

1020
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:14,420
Size of these great white sharks the the waters there are filled with them. That's the one

1021
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:20,420
But so this video just the neural link link was shot by matt mcdougall

1022
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:24,500
Who is the um head neurosurgeon at neural link there it is takes it now

1023
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:29,220
Believe it or not looks like it missed like it didn't get the fish it actually just cut that thing like a band saw

1024
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,860
So i'm up on the deck with matt

1025
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,660
Yeah, and so when you look at it from the side you you really get a sense of this

1026
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,860
Of the the girth of this freaking thing

1027
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,740
So as it comes up

1028
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,860
Size of that thing and they move through the water with such speed just a couple

1029
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,140
So when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered down below the surface

1030
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:55,380
There they're going around you're not allowed to chum the water there. Some people do it

1031
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,820
um

1032
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,860
But and then when you cage eggs sit they're like, well, what are you doing out here?

1033
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:02,980
And then you know they you swim toward them they veer off

1034
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,980
But what's interesting is that if you look at how they move through the water

1035
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,020
All it takes for one of these great white sharks when it sees

1036
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,620
A tuna or something it wants to eat is like two flicks of the tail

1037
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,140
And it becomes like a missile. It's just unbelievable economy of effort

1038
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:25,860
And ocean ramsey who is in my opinion the greatest of all cage exit shark divers this woman who dealt with

1039
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,340
enormous great white sharks

1040
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:33,300
She really understands their behavior when they're aggressive when they're not going to be aggressive. She and her husband Juan

1041
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,860
I believe his name is do they understand how the tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks?

1042
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,700
We were down there basically

1043
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:44,420
Like not understanding any of this we never should have been there and actually the air failure of the day before

1044
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,900
Plus cage eggs in the next day

1045
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:51,380
I told myself after coming up from the cage exit. That's it. I'm no longer taking risks with my life

1046
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,540
I want to live got back across the border

1047
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:58,020
Um a couple days later and I was like, that's it. I don't take risks with my life any longer

1048
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,700
But yeah, mcdougal not mcdougal shot that video and then it went

1049
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,860
quote-unquote viral

1050
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,180
through uh, nature is metal we passed them that video actually, uh

1051
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,340
I saw a video

1052
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,500
Where an instructor was explaining how to behave with a shark in the water

1053
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,020
And that you don't want to be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey

1054
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:23,620
And then you want to be acting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it right towards them and they'll bank off

1055
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,700
Now if you don't see them they're ambush predators

1056
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,100
You know, you're swimming in the surface and apparently if they get close you should just like guide them away by

1057
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,700
Like grabbing them and moving some people will actually roll them

1058
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,140
Um, but if they're coming in full speedy, you're not going to roll the shark

1059
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:43,700
But here we are back to dark stuff again. I like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that

1060
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:47,780
Um, you know, northern california. There were a couple actually a guy's head got taken off

1061
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:52,740
Um, he was swimming north of san francisco. There's been a couple of northern, uh, california

1062
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:57,140
That was really tragic, but most of them are in florida in australia florida

1063
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:02,820
The surfrider foundation shark attack map. There it is. Yeah, they have a great map. There you go

1064
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,980
So they look like they have all the scars on them. So if you if you zoom in on

1065
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,340
I mean, look at this if you go to the north america

1066
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,380
Um, look at skulls. There's there's a yeah where they're where they're deadly attacks

1067
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,420
Um, but in yeah, northern california. Sadly, this is really tragic if you zoom in on this one

1068
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,140
Um, I read about this

1069
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,620
This guy if you can click the link

1070
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:32,020
50-year-old male he was in chest high water. This is just tragic. I feel so sad for him and his family

1071
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,660
you know, he's just um

1072
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,060
Three members of the party chose to go in he was you know

1073
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:42,180
Nine gai was in his chest high water 25 to 50 yards from shore

1074
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,020
Great breached water seized his head and that was it, you know, so it does happen. It's very infrequent

1075
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:49,780
um

1076
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:56,340
If you don't go in the ocean, it's a very very very low probability. Um, but but if it doesn't happen

1077
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,540
Six times in a row

1078
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:05,460
120 chance. Yeah, who do you think wins a saltwater crocodile or a shark? Okay?

1079
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:11,220
I do not like saltwater crocodiles. They scare me to no end moller michael moller who dove all over the world

1080
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,060
He sent me a picture of him

1081
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,060
diving uh with

1082
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:21,540
Salty saltwater crocs in cuba. It was a smaller one. But goodness christ. Have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs?

1083
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:26,580
Yeah, um, I'm thinking that I'm thinking the the sharks are so agile. They're amazing

1084
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,380
They've head cammed one or body cammed one

1085
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,100
moving through the kelp bed

1086
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:38,100
And you look and it's just they're so agile moving through the water and and it's looking up at the surface like the camera's

1087
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,100
Looking at the surface and you just realize if you're out there, um, you're not

1088
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:49,300
In your swimming and you get hit by a by a shark you're not gonna talk shit and say that a salty has way

1089
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,260
more bite force, but according to the internet

1090
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,180
Recently data indicates that the shark has a stronger bite

1091
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:02,660
So I was I was assuming that a crocodile would have a a stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter

1092
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,580
But apparently a shark

1093
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:09,300
Yeah, and turning one of those big salties this is probably not that you know turning around

1094
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,140
It's like a battleship. I mean those sharks are unbelievable. They hit from all sorts. Oh, and they

1095
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,220
They do this thing

1096
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:20,500
We saw this you're out of the cage or in the cage and you and you'll look at one and you'll see its eye kind of like

1097
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,580
Looking at you. They can't really fove it

1098
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:27,940
But they'll look at you and you're tracking it and then you'll look down and you'll realize that one's coming at you

1099
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,180
They're they're they're ambush prayers. They're working together

1100
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,220
They're fascinating. I like I like how you know

1101
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,020
That they can't fovee

1102
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:40,980
You're already considering the vision system there. Yeah, it's a very permanent eyes on the very primitive eyes on the side of the head

1103
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,980
Their vision is decent enough. They're mostly obviously sensing things with their

1104
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,020
Electro sensing in the water, but also

1105
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,060
Oh faction

1106
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,060
Yeah, I spend far too much time

1107
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:58,020
Thinking about and learning about the the visual systems of different animals if you get me going on this like we'll be here all night

1108
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,780
See, this is what I have this my blood out too. I saw this in a store and I got it

1109
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,820
Because this is from a shark

1110
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:10,100
Goodness. Yeah, I can't say I ever saw one of teeth this big, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful

1111
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,060
Yeah, it's probably you know

1112
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:16,580
Probably your blood pressure just goes and you you don't feel feel a thing. Yeah

1113
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,620
Before we went down for the cage exit a guy in our crew

1114
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,260
pat dosos

1115
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,500
Very experienced diver

1116
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,740
asked one of the south african divers that

1117
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,620
So, you know, like what's the contingency plan if like somebody catches a bite and they were like

1118
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,580
He was like every man for himself and they're like basically saying like if somebody catches a bite like that's it

1119
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,660
Yeah, you know

1120
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
Anyway, I thought we were gonna bring up something happy

1121
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:48,500
Oh, that is happy. Well, we nature is beautiful. Yeah, what nature is beautiful. Uh, we lived

1122
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:54,900
But you know that there are there are happy things you brought up nature is metal. This is this is the difference between

1123
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,740
russian

1124
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,580
Yeah, americans and americans is like maybe there's actually a good time to bring up

1125
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,620
Your ayahuasca journey. I've never done ayahuasca

1126
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,300
But i'm curious about it. I'm also curious about

1127
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,940
ibogaine iboga

1128
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,500
But you told me that you did ayahuasca and

1129
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,580
That for you, it wasn't the dark scary ride that it is for everybody else. Yeah, it was an incredible experience for me

1130
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:28,180
I did it twice actually and have you done high dose psilocybin? Never. No, I just did small dose psilocybin a couple times

1131
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:32,260
So I was you know nervous about it. I was very yeah, I understand myself

1132
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,820
I've done high dose psilocybin. It's terrifying, but I've always gotten something very useful out of it

1133
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:42,980
So, I mean I was nervous about like whatever demons might hide in the shadow in the yungi in the shadow

1134
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,460
like I was I was nervous

1135
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:50,020
But I think it turns out. I don't know what the lesson is to draw from that but my experience

1136
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,180
Be boys russian

1137
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:55,860
It must it must be the russian thing. I mean, there's also something to the jungle

1138
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:00,820
There it strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there

1139
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,860
I I forgot the outside civilization exists. I forgot time because like

1140
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,660
When you don't have your phone

1141
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:14,180
You don't have meetings or calls or whatever you you lose the sense of time the sun comes up the sun comes down

1142
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:19,220
That's the the fundamental biological timer. You know every mammalian species

1143
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,460
has a short wavelength. So you think like blue uv type but like

1144
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:28,900
Absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone and the and it does this interesting

1145
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:35,300
Subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky, you've got short wavelength and long wavelength light

1146
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,660
Like when you look at a sunrise, it's got blues and yellows orange and yellows

1147
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:42,260
You look in the evening reds orange and and blues and in the middle of the day

1148
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:47,220
It's like full spectrum light now. It's always full spectrum light but because of some atmospheric

1149
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,660
Elements and because of the low solar angle you like that difference between

1150
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:58,420
The different wavelengths of light is is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your eye pay attention to

1151
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:04,020
And signal to your circadian timekeeping mechanism like we are that the core of our brain and the suprachiasmatic nucleus we are

1152
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,700
we are

1153
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,980
like

1154
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,580
Wired to be

1155
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:15,300
Entrained to the rising and setting of the sun like that's the biological timer which makes perfect sense because you know obviously as the planets

1156
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,260
Um as the planets spin and revolve

1157
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:23,940
I also wonder like how that is affected by you know in the rainforest the sun is not visible often

1158
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:28,260
So you're under the cover of the trees. So maybe that affects

1159
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,180
Well, there are social rhythms

1160
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:36,980
They're feeding rhythms sometimes in in terms of some species will signal the timing of activity of other species and

1161
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:38,500
um

1162
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,460
But yet getting out from the canopy is is critical

1163
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:46,740
Of course, even under the canopy during the daytime, there's far more photons than at night

1164
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:50,820
You know, there's always when i'm telling people to get sunlight in their eyes in the morning and in the evening

1165
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:55,460
People say there's no light no sunlight this time here. I'm like it go outside on a really overcast day

1166
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:01,220
It's far brighter than it is at night, right? So um, there's still lots of sunlight even if you can't see the sun as an object

1167
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,220
but I I love

1168
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:09,940
Time perception shifts and you mentioned that in the jungle it's linked to the rising and setting of the sun

1169
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,700
You also mentioned that on ayahuasca you zoomed out from from the earth

1170
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:18,660
These are like to me the most interesting aspects of having a human brain as opposed to another brain

1171
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,420
Of course, only ever had a human brain, but which is that you can

1172
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,300
consciously set your

1173
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,820
time

1174
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,460
Domain window like you can we can be focused here

1175
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,500
We can be focused on all of austin or we can be focused on the entire planet

1176
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,900
You can make those choices consciously

1177
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:41,460
But in the time domain it's it's hard like different activities bring us into fine slicing a more or more broad binning of time

1178
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,620
depending on what we're doing

1179
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:47,380
programming or exercising or researching or podcasting but

1180
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,860
um, just how unbelievably

1181
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,740
um fluid the human brain is in terms of its

1182
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:58,900
The aperture of of the time space window of our cognition and of our experience

1183
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,020
And I I feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable

1184
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:08,740
Tools that we have access to that we don't really leverage as much as we should which is when things are really hard

1185
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,180
you

1186
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:15,460
Need to zoom out and see it as one element within your whole lifespan and that there's more to come

1187
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,940
um

1188
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:23,220
You know, I mean people commit suicide because they can't see beyond the time domain they're in or they think it's going to go on forever

1189
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:31,060
Um, when we're happy we rarely think this is going to last forever, but uh, which is interesting contrast in its own right

1190
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,140
but I think that

1191
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,820
Psychedelics while I have very little experience with them

1192
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,860
I have saw them and it sounds like they're just a very interesting

1193
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,820
Window into the the different apertures

1194
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,100
Well, how to surf that wave is probably a skill

1195
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:51,380
One of the things I was prepared for and I think it's important is not to resist

1196
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:53,780
I think

1197
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:57,940
I understand what it means to resist the thing a powerful wave and it's not going to be good

1198
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:03,940
So you have to be able to surf it so I was ready for that to relax through it. Maybe because I'm quite good at that

1199
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,580
from

1200
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,460
knowing how to relax and all kinds of disciplines

1201
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,180
playing piano and uh

1202
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:17,540
Guitar when I was super young and then through jiu-jitsu knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports

1203
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:24,980
Should be able to relax the body fully just accept whatever happens to you that process is probably why it was a very positive experience for me

1204
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:29,140
Do you have any interest in iboga? I'm very interested in ibogaine iboga

1205
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:32,420
There's a colleague of mine and researcher at Stanford Nolan Williams

1206
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,260
Who's been doing some transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people who have

1207
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,060
taken the ibogaine ibogaine

1208
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,900
um

1209
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:47,860
As I understand it gives a 22 hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open, but you close your eyes and you get a

1210
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,500
um a very high resolution image of actual events that happened in your life

1211
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:55,940
But then you have agency within those movies. I think you have to be

1212
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:00,180
Of healthy heart to be able to do it. I think you have to be on a heart rate monitor. It's not trivial

1213
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,180
It's not like these other psychedelics

1214
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,980
But there's a wonderful group

1215
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,940
called veteran solutions

1216
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,700
um that

1217
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:13,140
has used iboga combined with some other psychedelics

1218
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,700
um in the veterans community to

1219
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:19,940
to great success for things like PTSD and

1220
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:26,020
It's a group. I've really tried to support in in any way that I can mainly by being vocal about the great work they're doing

1221
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:30,500
but um, you hear incredible stories of people who are just like

1222
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:37,060
Like near cratered in their life or zombied by PTSD and other things post war

1223
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:41,380
um get back a lightness or achieve a lightness and a clarity

1224
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:47,220
Um that they didn't feel they had so I'm very curious about these compounds. Um, the state of Kentucky

1225
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:50,740
We should check this but um, I believe it's taken money from the

1226
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:58,500
Opioid crisis settlement for ibogaine research. I mean, so this is like no longer. Yes. If you look here, let's see

1227
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,620
Did they do it? Oh, no. No. Oh, no

1228
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:06,180
They backed away Kentucky backs away from the plan to fund opio treatment research

1229
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,180
They were going to use the money

1230
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:15,300
To treat opio. Now officials are backing off 50 billion. What is on its way over the coming years 50 billion dollars

1231
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:19,220
50 billion dollars is on its way to state and local government over the coming years

1232
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:25,700
The pool of funding comes from multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid

1233
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:29,860
Painkillers, Kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid

1234
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:33,700
So they were going to do psychedelic research with ibogaine

1235
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,860
Supporting research on illegal illegal folks

1236
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,220
Psychedelic drug called ibogaine. Well, I guess they backed away from it. Well

1237
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,220
Sooner or later, we'll get some happy news up on the

1238
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,180
Internet during this episode

1239
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,580
Talk about the the the shark and the crocodile fighting. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true

1240
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,380
And you survived the jungle. Well, that's the the thing

1241
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:00,020
I was I was I was writing to you on what's that multiple times because I was going to put on the internet

1242
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:03,300
Are you okay? And if you're like alive and then I was going to just like put it to twitter

1243
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:08,580
Just like he's alive, but then of course you're far too classy for that. So you just came back alive

1244
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,580
Well jungle or not

1245
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:17,060
One of the lessons is also, you know, when you hear the call for adventure

1246
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:24,260
Just fucking do it. I was gonna ask you it's kind of silly question, but like give me a

1247
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,060
Small fraction of things on your bucket list

1248
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,100
Bucket list. Yeah

1249
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,060
Go to mars

1250
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,060
Yeah, what's what's the status of that?

1251
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:40,580
I don't know. I'm being patient about the whole thing red planet ran that cartoon of you guys

1252
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:46,260
Going to my that was pretty funny. That's true. That was pretty funny. One where Goggins is already up there. Yeah

1253
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:48,420
That's a great. That's a funny one

1254
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,820
Probably also true. Uh, I would love I would love to die in mars

1255
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:59,220
But I just love humanity reaching onto the stars and doing this

1256
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:04,180
Bold adventure and taking big risks and exploring. I love exploration

1257
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:09,300
What about seeing different animal species? I'm a huge fan of this guy Joel Sartori

1258
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:15,220
Um, where he he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of all these different animals

1259
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:18,900
If people aren't already following him on instagram. He's doing some really important work

1260
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,980
um

1261
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,500
this guy's

1262
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,500
instagram is

1263
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,300
Amazing like portraits. Well, look at it. Look at these portraits the amount of um,

1264
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:35,220
I must say personality because we don't want to project anything onto them. But yeah, the the like the eyes

1265
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:40,740
And he'll occasionally put him a movie. No, there's a little owl. I delight in things like this

1266
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:45,860
I've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes

1267
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,900
And now dogs or all kinds of all animals

1268
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,380
um, and I'm very interested

1269
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,180
in um

1270
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:58,180
Kids content that that incorporates animals. We have some things brewing there

1271
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,340
Like I could look at this kind of stuff all day long

1272
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:05,300
Look at that bat like bats people think about bats is kind of like little flickering a little annoying disease carrying things

1273
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,300
But look how beautiful that little sucker is

1274
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,100
How's your uh podcast with the cookie monster coming?

1275
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,940
Oh, yeah, we've been in discussions with cookie the um

1276
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:22,180
It's uh, can't say too much about that. But um, cookie monster embodies dopamine, right? Cookie monster wants cookie

1277
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,100
Right wants cookie right now, you know, like it was that it was that one tweet cookie monster

1278
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,180
I bounce because cookies come from all directions

1279
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:35,140
You know, it's like it's just embodying the the desire for for something and and which is an incredible aspect of ourselves

1280
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,540
The other one is you remember a little while ago

1281
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,260
Elmo put out a tweet

1282
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,380
Hey, how's everyone doing out there and it went viral

1283
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:47,620
And you know the surgeon general of the united states have been talking about the loneliness crisis

1284
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:53,060
He came on the podcast and you know a lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness mental health issues with loneliness

1285
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:57,140
Elmo puts out a tweet. Hey, how's everyone doing out there? And

1286
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,860
Everyone gravitates toward it, you know

1287
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:06,180
So that the different sesame street characters really embody the different that kind of aspects of self through very like narrow

1288
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,660
Neural circuit perspective

1289
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,860
You know snuffle off against the shy and um oscar the grouch it's grouchy, right and the count

1290
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:20,420
Won a tool the archetypes of yeah, the archetypes is very young in once again. Yeah, and I think that um

1291
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:25,780
You know the creators of sesame street clearly either understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that

1292
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:31,220
So yeah, there are some things brewing on on uh conversations with sesame street characters

1293
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,780
It's not I know you'd like to talk to vladimir putin. I'd like to talk to cookie monster

1294
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:42,580
It illustrates the differences in our like a sophistication or something. Well, that's illustrates a lot. Yeah

1295
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,740
But yeah, I also I love animation

1296
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:52,500
So I'm not anime. That's not my thing but animation. So I'm very interested in the use of animation to get

1297
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,940
Uh science content across so there are a bunch of things brewing

1298
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,260
but um, but anyway, I delight in

1299
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:04,340
Sartori's work and and and it's there's a conservation aspect to it as well. But I think that um

1300
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:09,780
Mostly want to thank you for finally putting up something that like where something is not being killed or like let some sad

1301
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:15,780
Sad outcome. Well, these are all really positive. They're really cool. They're really cool and every once in a while look at look at that

1302
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,340
mountain line

1303
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:22,420
But I also like to look at these and and some of them remind me of certain people

1304
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:27,380
Right, so let's just scroll through like for instance. I think when we don't try and process it too much

1305
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:32,020
So like like okay, look at this cat this is amazing

1306
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,020
Like I feel like that somebody I feel like this is like a like someone I met once

1307
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:39,700
as a curiosity and curiosity and a playfulness

1308
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,700
um carnivore

1309
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,700
Carnivore frontalized eyes

1310
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:48,340
Found in forces the area right so then you go down, you know, it's like

1311
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,620
This beautiful fish neon pink

1312
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:58,820
Right, so it reminds you of some of the like the influencers you see on instagram, right? Except this one's natural. Just kidding. Um

1313
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:02,900
Uh, let's see no filter. Um filter. Yeah

1314
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,660
um

1315
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
Let's see like I feel like

1316
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,580
Bears I'm a big fan of bears. Yeah bears are beautiful. This one kind of reminds me of you a little bit

1317
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:13,140
There's like a stoic nature to it a curiosity

1318
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:17,940
So you can kind of feel like the essence of animals. You don't even have to do psychedelics to get there

1319
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:21,540
Oh, look at that. He's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually yeah

1320
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
and then there's um

1321
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,300
Wow, yeah

1322
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:30,900
Yeah, the in the jungle the diversity of life was also stark

1323
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:36,660
From a scientific perspective just the the fact that most of those species are not identified was fascinating

1324
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:41,300
Right. It was like a little every little every little insect is a kind of discovery

1325
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,340
Right. I mean one of the reasons I love new york city so much

1326
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:50,020
Just by its problems at times is that um everywhere you look there's life

1327
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:54,900
It's like a tropical reef if you've ever done scuba diving or snorkeling you look on a tropical reef and it's like

1328
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:58,340
There's some little crab working on something and like everywhere you look there's life

1329
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,860
You know the bay area if you go scuba diving or snorkeling it's like a kelp bed

1330
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:06,100
You know the bay area is like a kelp bed every once in a while some big fish goes by it's like a big IPO

1331
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,820
But like most of the time not a whole lot happens

1332
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:12,980
Actually, the bay area it's interesting as I've been going back there more and more recently

1333
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,500
um

1334
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:20,180
There are really cool little subcultures starting to pop up again. Nice. Um

1335
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:25,620
There's incredible skateboarding the gx-1000 guys are these guys that that bomb down hills

1336
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:26,900
They're in

1337
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,740
Nuts like they're just going like that's just speed not tricks

1338
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,180
You gotta see gx-1000 these guys going down hills in san francisco

1339
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:40,340
They are wild and occasionally unfortunately occasionally someone will get hit by a car, but gx-1000

1340
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,940
Look into intersections. They have spotters. You can see someone there

1341
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,900
Um, oh, I see there's uh

1342
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:53,220
Into traffic. Yeah into traffic. So in san francisco. Yeah, this is crazy. Like this is unbelievable and

1343
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,460
um, and they're

1344
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,460
They're just wild

1345
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,460
But in any case

1346
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:04,100
What's on your bucket list that you haven't done? Well, I'm working on a book. So I'm actually going to

1347
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,260
Head to a cabin for a couple weeks and right which I've never done

1348
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,980
People talk about doing this, but I'm gonna do that

1349
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:17,380
That's I'm excited for that just the mental space of really dropping into writing like jack dickelson in the shining cabin

1350
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,860
Let's hope not. Okay. Let's hope not, you know before

1351
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:24,260
I mean only started doing public facing anything for posting on instagram in 2019

1352
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,500
But I used to head up to walla la on the northern coast of california

1353
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:31,060
um, sometimes by myself

1354
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:35,540
um to a little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just

1355
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:39,140
Read and write papers and things like that. I used to do that all the time

1356
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,100
I I I missed that so some of that

1357
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:48,500
Um, I'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in argentina relatives in on the east coast

1358
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:54,260
See my parents more. They're in good health. Thankfully. I want to get married and have a family. That's an important priority

1359
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:59,140
And put a lot of a lot of work in there. Yeah, that's a big one. Yeah. Yeah, I'm putting a lot of work

1360
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,940
Into the the the runway on that

1361
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,500
um, what are advice

1362
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,820
for people about

1363
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:12,580
That or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world how to find how to build a family

1364
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:16,580
Get there and and then I'll listen to it someday and see if I hit the marks

1365
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,260
um

1366
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,340
Yeah, but well, obviously pick the right partner

1367
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,540
But also like do the work on yourself. No know yourself

1368
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,820
That the oracle know thyself and I think

1369
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,780
um, listen

1370
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:34,100
I have a friend. He's a new friend, but he's a friend uh who I met

1371
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,580
for uh a meal

1372
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,140
He's a very very well known actor overseas

1373
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:43,780
And his stuff has made it over here and um, we become friends and we went to lunch

1374
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:48,660
And we were talking about work and being public facing and all this kind of thing and

1375
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:53,060
And then I said you have kids, right? He says he has four kids. I was like, oh, yeah, you know

1376
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:57,300
I see your posts with the kids. You seem really happy. He said he just looked at me leaned in and he said

1377
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,020
It's the best gift

1378
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,020
you'll ever give yourself

1379
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:07,060
And he also said and pick your partner the mother of your kids

1380
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,220
very carefully

1381
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:16,100
So, you know, that's good advice coming from excellent advice coming from somebody who's, you know, very successful in work and family

1382
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:20,660
So that's the only thing I can pass along. We hear this from friends for ours as well, but

1383
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,460
um kids are amazing and family is amazing and um

1384
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,180
You know, that's the different

1385
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:32,500
People all these people who want to like be immortal and like live to be 200 or something, you know

1386
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:37,140
There's also the the old fashioned way of you know, having children that

1387
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,100
Live on and evolve a new legacy

1388
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:46,100
But they have, you know, half your dna. So that's exciting. Yeah, I think you make an amazing dad. Thank you

1389
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:50,500
It seems like a fun thing and you know, I've also gotten advice from friends who are

1390
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:54,500
Super high performing and have a lot of kids

1391
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,220
They'll say just don't overthink it

1392
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,300
All right, start having kids

1393
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,340
Let's go right. Well the chaos of kids is kind of the like

1394
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,260
You can either bury you or it can or it can give you energy

1395
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:12,420
But I grew up in a big pack of boys always doing like wild and crazy things and so that kind of energy is great

1396
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,980
And and if it's not a big pack of wild boys, it's you know

1397
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:20,100
You have daughters and they can be you know, different form of chaos sometimes same form of chaos

1398
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,900
Um, how many kids do you think you want? Hmm?

1399
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,740
You know, it's either two or five

1400
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:32,100
Yeah, very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You know the other yeah

1401
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,820
Um, I mean, I'm very close with my sister

1402
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:39,540
I couldn't imagine having another sibling because it there's so much richness there. We talk almost every day

1403
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,740
Sorry, you know three four times a week, you know

1404
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,180
Sometimes just briefly but we're we're tight, you know, we're

1405
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,980
Really look out for one another

1406
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,180
um

1407
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:53,860
She's an amazing person like truly an amazing person and has like

1408
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,060
Raised her daughter in an amazing way. She's like

1409
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,620
You know, my niece is like

1410
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,060
Going to head to college in a year or two and like my sister's done an amazing job

1411
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:07,380
And her dad's done a great job too. They they both really put a lot into

1412
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,060
um

1413
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:13,460
The family aspect and she has to spend time with a really amazing person in the

1414
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:19,620
In peru in the amazon jungle and he is one of 20 kids. Wow. So he's got

1415
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:24,820
It's mostly guys. That's just a lot of brothers and I think two sisters

1416
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:30,100
I just said jonathan height on the podcast the guy who's talking about the anxious generation causing the american mind

1417
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,060
He's great, but he was saying that you know in order to keep kids healthy

1418
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,820
They need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're 16

1419
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,700
I've actually been thinking a lot about

1420
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,020
Getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties, you know, everyone talks about this

1421
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:50,260
Not creating a commune or anything like that, but I think I think jonathan's right. We were more or less

1422
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:54,020
Our brain wiring does best when we I'm raised in

1423
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:58,340
Small village type environments where kids can forage the whole free range kids idea

1424
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:02,980
And I grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt clawed wars and all that stuff

1425
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:07,140
Um, it would be so strange to have a childhood without that

1426
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:10,420
Yeah, and I think more and more

1427
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:17,380
As we wake up to the negative aspects of the digital interaction will put more and more value to in-person interaction

1428
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:20,660
So I mean it's cool to see for instance kids in new york city

1429
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,740
I'm just kind of moving around the city with so much sense of agency. It's really really cool

1430
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,900
The suburbs like where I grew up

1431
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:32,740
Like as soon as we could get out take the 7f bus up to san francisco and hang out with you know

1432
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:35,380
Wild ones like you know while there were dangers

1433
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,740
I mean we couldn't wait to get out of the suburbs the moment that you know

1434
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:44,900
Forts and dirt clawed wars and stuff didn't didn't cut it. We just like wanted into the city. So I um bucket list

1435
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:49,700
I will probably move to a major city not los angeles or san francisco

1436
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,620
um

1437
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:53,620
In the next few years

1438
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,060
new york city

1439
01:33:55,060 --> 01:34:00,980
Potentially there's all such different flavors of experiences. Yeah, so I'd love to live in new york city for a while

1440
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,380
I've always wanted to do that and I and I will do that

1441
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:06,740
I've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural

1442
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:12,180
Some area so colorado montana are high on my list right now and to be able to

1443
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:16,900
Pivot back and forth between the two would be great just for such different experiences

1444
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,060
I and also I like a very physical life

1445
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:24,180
So the idea of getting up in the sun with the sun in the montana or colorado type environment

1446
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,100
um

1447
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,860
And I've been doing some putting some effort towards finding a spot

1448
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,900
Um for that and new york city to me

1449
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:37,060
I know it's got its issues and people say it wasn't what it was. Okay. I get it but listen

1450
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,940
I've never lived there. So for me would be entirely new and um

1451
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,180
You know

1452
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,020
Schultz seems full of life

1453
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:47,620
There is an energy to that city and he represents that I mean there's yeah

1454
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,140
And and the full diversity of weird that is

1455
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,420
represented in new york city is great. Yeah, you walk down this tree

1456
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:57,620
There's like a person with like a cat on their head and no one gives a shit. Yeah, that's great

1457
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:01,220
All right, San Francisco used to be like that the joke was like

1458
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:05,540
You have to be naked and on the fire and San Francisco before someone takes it but now it's changed

1459
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:11,940
But again, it recently I've noticed that San Francisco. It's not just about the skateboarders. It's there's um some community

1460
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:15,780
Houses of people in tech that are super interesting. There's some community housing

1461
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,340
of people not in tech

1462
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:25,300
That I've learned about him and um known people have lived there and and it's it's cool like there's stuff happening

1463
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:31,700
Um in these cities that's new and different. I mean, that's what youth is for they're supposed to evolve evolve things out

1464
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,340
uh

1465
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,380
So amidst all that you still have to get shit done. I've been really

1466
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:40,020
obsessed with tracking time recently

1467
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:44,900
Like making sure I have daily activities of habits that I'm maintaining

1468
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:47,860
and I'm very

1469
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:54,020
Religious about making sure I get shit done. Do you use an app or something like that? No, just google sheets

1470
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:58,180
So basically a spreadsheet and I'm tracking daily and I write scripts that

1471
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:02,100
That uh, whenever I achieve a goal it glows green

1472
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:09,540
Yeah, do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too? No, just the fact that I got the workout done

1473
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:14,100
Yeah, so I just it's a checkmark thing. So I I'm really really big

1474
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:19,860
On making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. I have a rule for myself that I

1475
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:24,500
Do a set of tasks, uh for at least five minutes every day

1476
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:30,660
And it turns out that many of them I do way longer, but just even just doing it

1477
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:34,020
I have to do it every day and there's currently

1478
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,420
11 of them

1479
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:39,140
It's just a thing like one of them is playing guitar, for example

1480
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:45,220
So do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do uh, like daily habits? Yeah, I do my um

1481
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,060
I wake up if I don't feel I slept enough

1482
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:53,060
I do this non-sleep-deep-rest yoga nidra thing that I've talked about a bunch

1483
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,500
We actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on spotify

1484
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:57,700
um

1485
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:02,980
10 minute 20 minute ones puts me back into a state that feels like sleep and I feel very rested

1486
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:07,860
Actually matt walker and I are gonna run a study. He's just submitted the IRB to run a study on nsdr

1487
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:12,260
And what is actually doing to the brain? There's some evidence of increases in dopamine, etc

1488
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,380
But those are older studies still cool studies, but um, so I'll do that

1489
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:17,940
get up hydrate and if I've

1490
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,220
Got my act together. I punched some caffeine down

1491
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,900
Like some matina some coffee maybe another matina and

1492
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:30,580
Resistance train three days a week run three days a week and then take one day off

1493
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:31,860
um

1494
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:35,780
And like to be done by 839 and then I want to get into some real work

1495
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,580
I actually have a sticky note on my computer

1496
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:43,620
It's like just like reminding me how good it feels to accomplish some real work and then I go into it right now

1497
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,380
It's the book writing

1498
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,380
researching a podcast and just

1499
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:49,380
fight tooth and nail to stay off

1500
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:54,020
Social media text message. What's app youtube all that?

1501
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,540
Get something done. How long can you go? Can you go like?

1502
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,700
three hours

1503
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:05,300
Just deep focus if I hit a groove. Uh, yeah 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove

1504
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:06,980
um

1505
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:12,260
That's tough for me. I start the day actually that's why I'm afraid I'd really prize that

1506
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:17,380
Those morning hours I start with the work. Yeah, and it's it's it's uh

1507
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:22,420
I'm trying to hit the four hour mark of deep focus great

1508
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:27,540
I love it. Then it often can't work. It's important. I'm really really deeply. Yeah

1509
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:33,300
It's it's often torture actually. It's really really difficult. Oh, yeah the agitation but I've

1510
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:37,860
Sat across the table from you a couple years ago when I was out here in austin doing some work

1511
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:41,940
And I was working on stuff you were and I noticed you're just like stare at your notebook sometimes just like

1512
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,420
pen at the

1513
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:49,780
Same position and then you'll get back into it like there are those won't you're building that hydraulic pressure and then go

1514
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:55,380
Yeah, I try and get something done of value then it the communications start and

1515
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:03,460
Talking to my podcast producer. My team is everything. I mean like the the magic potion in the podcast is rob more

1516
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,380
right

1517
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:08,260
Who's in the has been in the room with me every single solo

1518
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:13,460
Costello used to be in there with us because that's it people have asked journalists have asked can they sit in friends have asked

1519
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,820
Nope

1520
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,340
just rob

1521
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:17,300
and

1522
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:21,700
For guests interviews. He's there as well. And I talk to rob all the time

1523
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:25,460
all the time we talk multiple times per day and

1524
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,460
You know in life

1525
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:32,900
I've I've made some errors in certain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that and

1526
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:38,420
Certainly don't blame all of it on them. But you know, I played my role but but in terms of picking

1527
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,740
business partners

1528
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:43,220
And friends like you know to work with I mean rob

1529
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:49,220
It's just it's been bull's-eyes and it's just rob has been amazing my play back our photographer and the guys I mentioned earlier like

1530
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:51,140
We just

1531
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:53,140
Communicate as much as we need to

1532
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:58,980
And we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we make we put anything out there and

1533
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,220
So including like even created decisions of like topics to cover all that

1534
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:07,140
Yeah, like a photo for the book jacket the other day Mike shoots photos then

1535
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:10,020
And then we look at them. We pour over them together

1536
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:15,380
Logo for the perform podcast with Andy Gallop and then we're launching like is that the right contour Mike's the real

1537
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:19,380
He's got the aesthetic thing because he was at DC so long as a portrait photographer

1538
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:22,020
And his cute with close friends with

1539
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,300
Ken block

1540
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:29,140
To Jim conna like all the car jumping in the city stuff like I mean Mike is a master. He's a he's a true master of that stuff

1541
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,540
and um

1542
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:37,220
And we just pour over every little decision, but even which sponsors, you know, there are dozens of ads now

1543
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:41,860
By the way that that whole josser-sizer thing of me saying oh a guy went from a two to a seven

1544
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,780
I never said that that's AI

1545
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:49,540
Like I would never call it number off somebody a two to a seven. Are you kidding me? It's crazy. So it's AI if you bought the thing

1546
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:50,900
I'm sorry

1547
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:55,700
But like our sponsors we list the sponsors that we have and why on our website and like the decision

1548
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:58,580
Do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product?

1549
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:03,300
I mean we've we've got ways with sponsors because of like changes in the product or change, you know

1550
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:06,180
Most time it's amicable all good

1551
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:10,500
But you know like just every detail and that just takes a ton of time and energy

1552
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,580
but I try and

1553
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:16,500
Work mostly on content and my team is constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions

1554
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:24,500
But I because I obsess but um, yeah, you you have to you have to have a team of some sort someone that you can run

1555
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:27,860
Things bot for sure, but one of the challenges the larger the team is

1556
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:34,020
And I I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff including engineering stuff robotics work research

1557
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:41,220
All of those interactions at least for me take away from the deep work the deep focus

1558
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,700
Unfortunately, I get

1559
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:48,260
Drained by social interaction even with the people I love and really respect and all that kind of stuff

1560
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:51,620
You're an introvert. Yeah, like fundamentally an introvert. So

1561
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:55,220
To me it's a trade-off getting shit done versus

1562
01:41:55,940 --> 01:42:00,340
Collaborating and I have to choose wisely because without collaboration without a great team

1563
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:02,580
Which I'm fortunate enough to be a part of

1564
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,820
Like you wouldn't get anything really done

1565
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:08,980
But as an individual contributor to get stuff done like to do the hard work of

1566
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:13,700
Researching or programming all that kind of stuff. You need the hours of deep work

1567
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,940
I used to spend a lot more time alone

1568
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:19,700
That's that's on my bucket list spend a bit more time dropped into work alone

1569
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:22,420
it I think social media like

1570
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,300
It causes our brain to go the other direction

1571
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:30,180
I try and answer some comments and then and then get back to work. I'm really

1572
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,220
After going to the jungle, I

1573
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,620
appreciate not using the device

1574
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,500
I've played with the idea of

1575
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:43,220
Like spending certainly maybe like one week a month not using social media at all

1576
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:49,220
I used it. So after that morning block, I'll eat some lunch and I'll usually do something while I'm doing lunch or something

1577
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:52,900
And then a bit more work and that real work deep work and then

1578
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:58,180
Around 2 30 I do a non-sleep deep rest to go short nap wake up. Boom

1579
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:01,780
Maybe a little more caffeine and then lean into it

1580
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:06,900
Again, and then you know if you I find if you really put in the deep work

1581
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,820
Two or three bouts per day by about five or six p.m. It's over

1582
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:15,860
I was down at Jaco's place not that long ago and in the evening did a sauna session with him and

1583
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,660
Some family members of his and some of their friends

1584
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:22,580
And it's really cool like they all work all day and train all day and then in the evening

1585
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:26,900
They get together and they they sauna and cold plunge. I'm really into this

1586
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,380
whole thing of

1587
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:31,220
gathering with other people

1588
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:36,100
At a specific time of day. I have a gym at my house and I you know tim will come over and train or

1589
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:37,780
you know

1590
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,980
That we've kind of slowed that down in recent months, but I think

1591
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:47,140
Gathering in groups once a day being alone for part of the day. It's like very fundamental stuff

1592
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:51,700
We're not saying anything that hasn't been said millions of times before but how often do people actually do that?

1593
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:56,900
And and and call the party, you know, like be the person to like bring people together if it's not happening

1594
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,500
That's something I've really had to learn

1595
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:02,020
Even though I'm an introvert like hey, I'm like gather people together

1596
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:05,060
You came through town the other day and there's a lot of people at the house

1597
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:08,980
Yeah, Brad actually I was playing because I was getting a massage when you walked in

1598
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:11,780
I don't sit around getting massages very often

1599
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:16,980
But I was getting one that day and then everyone came in and the dog came in like everyone's piled in. It was very sweet

1600
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:21,460
Again, no devices, but choose wisely the people

1601
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,660
You gather with right right and I was clothed

1602
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,980
Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't which is very weird

1603
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,020
Uh

1604
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:36,900
Yeah, yeah, the the the frenzy surround yourself with that. That's another thing. It's like

1605
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:42,020
I understood that from my Alaska and from just the experience in the jungle is like

1606
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:44,740
Just select the people

1607
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,100
Just be careful how you allocate your time. I just saw on

1608
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:53,780
Somewhere Conor McGregor has this good line. I wrote it down about loyalty

1609
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:57,300
He said don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with

1610
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:03,860
That guy's I mean, he's being on loyalty all the shit talk all of that set that aside

1611
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,500
To me like loyalty is really big

1612
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:11,060
because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them and

1613
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:17,140
What what else is life about? Yeah, well hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure

1614
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:18,980
and

1615
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,300
um, you know, we're fortunate to have a lot of them

1616
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:27,460
It'll also show you who you know, who really like has put in the time to try and understand you and

1617
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,260
And understand people like people are complicated. I love that. So

1618
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,820
Can you read the quote once more?

1619
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,940
Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with

1620
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,620
Yeah, so in that way a hardship is a gift

1621
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:51,780
It shows you definitely and it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger

1622
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:58,660
Let's go get some food. Yeah, you're one meal a day guy. Yeah, I actually ate something earlier

1623
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:03,140
But it was like a protein shake and a couple pieces of bil-tongue. I hope we're eating a steak

1624
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:09,140
I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine. Yeah. What do you think? How you feel? I feel good

1625
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:12,740
Yeah, I was I was thinking you'd probably like I only did a half a piece

1626
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:17,220
And I won't have more for a while, but a little too good. Yeah

1627
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:22,260
Thank you for talking once again, brother. Yeah, thanks so much Lex. Um

1628
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:27,380
It's been a great ride this podcast thing and you're the reason I started the podcast you inspired me to do it

1629
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:32,900
You told me to do it. I did it and you've also been an amazing friend. You showed up in some

1630
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:41,940
Some very challenging times and you've shown up for me publicly. You've shown up for me in my home and my life and you know

1631
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:48,340
It's an honor to have you as a friend. Thank you. I love you brother. Love you too

1632
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:53,620
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman to support this podcast

1633
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:58,980
Please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung

1634
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:03,380
Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life

1635
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:05,940
And you will call it fate

1636
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,700
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
