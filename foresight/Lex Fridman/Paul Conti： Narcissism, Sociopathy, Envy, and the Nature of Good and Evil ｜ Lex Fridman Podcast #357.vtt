00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
Narcissism is not arrogance.

00:01.840 --> 00:04.240
Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.

00:04.240 --> 00:08.280
There is such a deep sense of inadequacy

00:08.280 --> 00:10.800
and incompetence in the self

00:10.800 --> 00:14.120
that the defensive structure around that

00:14.120 --> 00:18.480
becomes dominated by like rocket-fueled envy.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.600
The following is a conversation with Paul Conti,

00:24.600 --> 00:28.120
a psychiatrist and a brilliant scholar of human nature.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.440
My friend, Andrew Huberman,

00:30.440 --> 00:33.660
told me that Paul and I absolutely must meet and talk,

00:33.660 --> 00:35.600
not just about the topic of trauma,

00:35.600 --> 00:38.320
which Paul wrote an amazing book about,

00:38.320 --> 00:40.080
but broadly about human nature,

00:40.080 --> 00:42.960
about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy,

00:42.960 --> 00:47.360
good and evil, hate and love, happiness and envy.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.360
As usual, Andrew was right.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.480
This was a fascinating conversation.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.880
As the old meme goes,

00:52.880 --> 00:55.940
one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.

00:56.860 --> 00:58.820
Allow me to also quickly mention

00:58.820 --> 01:02.260
that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode

01:02.260 --> 01:05.260
as I do in other episodes, even with experts.

01:05.260 --> 01:06.900
In part for fun and in part

01:06.900 --> 01:10.100
because I think the tension of ideas and conversation

01:10.100 --> 01:12.440
is what creates insights and wisdom.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.420
My goal is to always empathize, understand

01:14.420 --> 01:17.820
and explore ideas of the person sitting across from me.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.660
Disagreement is just one of the ways

01:19.660 --> 01:21.780
I think it's fun to do just that.

01:21.780 --> 01:25.700
As long as I do so from a place of curiosity

01:25.740 --> 01:27.380
and compassion.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.300
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.100
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:31.100 --> 01:32.420
in the description.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.880
And now, dear friends, here's Paul Conti.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.700
Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally a study

01:39.700 --> 01:42.260
of the human mind and not just the set of tools

01:42.260 --> 01:43.940
for treating psychological maladies?

01:43.940 --> 01:44.780
Absolutely.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.940
I think psychiatry is our best way

01:46.940 --> 01:49.340
to understand who we are as people.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.020
I mean, it looks at our biology.

01:51.020 --> 01:52.340
You know, how does our brain work?

01:52.340 --> 01:54.740
How does it connect the parts with one another?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.460
How does the chemistry in it work?

01:56.460 --> 01:59.340
It's the very foundational aspects of who we are

01:59.340 --> 02:01.500
and then it manifests as psychology.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.340
What do we think?

02:02.340 --> 02:03.180
What do we feel?

02:03.180 --> 02:04.020
What are our strivings?

02:04.020 --> 02:05.260
What are our fears?

02:05.260 --> 02:08.380
So yeah, I think psychiatry provides tools

02:08.380 --> 02:10.740
that we can use to help each other,

02:10.740 --> 02:12.300
but those tools come through it being

02:12.300 --> 02:14.340
a discipline of understanding.

02:14.340 --> 02:17.060
So with every patient you see,

02:17.060 --> 02:18.940
with every mind you explore,

02:18.940 --> 02:20.700
are you picking up a deeper understanding

02:20.700 --> 02:21.540
of the human mind?

02:22.780 --> 02:23.780
I think I'm trying to.

02:23.820 --> 02:25.260
I think we should learn,

02:25.260 --> 02:27.140
we should be able to take something away

02:27.140 --> 02:28.940
from everything we do,

02:28.940 --> 02:31.420
you know, every interaction to some small degree.

02:31.420 --> 02:32.620
Every conversation,

02:32.620 --> 02:34.740
it doesn't have to be a patient just anywhere.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.740
At Starbucks, getting a coffee,

02:36.740 --> 02:38.820
you can learn something from that little experience.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.100
Yeah, even if you just reinforce sort of gentle kindness

02:42.100 --> 02:45.700
and gratitude and decent human interaction,

02:45.700 --> 02:46.940
there's a reinforcement of that

02:46.940 --> 02:49.620
that even if we don't take away memories or lessons,

02:49.620 --> 02:52.420
so to speak, we can reinforce who we choose to be.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.660
So understanding ourselves from those interactions too,

02:55.660 --> 02:58.220
not just the general sort of philosophical human mind,

02:58.220 --> 03:01.420
but understanding our own mind,

03:02.340 --> 03:05.740
and respect on how our own mind works.

03:05.740 --> 03:06.980
Yeah, because everything we understand

03:06.980 --> 03:09.020
about anyone or anything else

03:09.020 --> 03:10.380
is coming through here, right?

03:10.380 --> 03:12.980
So yeah, we're understanding others,

03:12.980 --> 03:15.220
we're also understanding ourselves,

03:15.220 --> 03:17.860
it's all feeding through us.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.780
Yeah, but it's a tricky thing to step away

03:19.780 --> 03:21.100
and look in your own mind,

03:22.100 --> 03:24.540
and understand that it's just a machine.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.340
You can kind of control the way the machine processes

03:27.340 --> 03:28.900
the external environment,

03:28.900 --> 03:32.540
and the way that machine converts the things

03:32.540 --> 03:34.900
it perceives into actual emotions,

03:34.900 --> 03:37.900
like how it interprets the things it perceives.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.060
You just sort of step away and analyze it in that way,

03:41.060 --> 03:42.260
and then you can control it.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.500
You can, you can oil the machine,

03:44.500 --> 03:47.300
you can control how it actually interprets the perceptions

03:47.300 --> 03:49.540
in order to generate positive emotions,

03:49.700 --> 03:51.060
and be like a, what is it?

03:51.060 --> 03:55.740
Like a mechanic for the gears in the machine.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.660
I mean, I think to some degree, to some degree,

03:57.660 --> 04:01.740
but the difference, I think, at least as I understand,

04:01.740 --> 04:05.180
I think of machines as not being inscrutable, right?

04:05.180 --> 04:07.860
That if there's enough study,

04:07.860 --> 04:10.020
there's enough acumen applied

04:10.020 --> 04:12.540
that we can understand whatever it is

04:12.540 --> 04:13.860
we're trying to figure out,

04:13.860 --> 04:16.500
whereas part of understanding ourselves

04:16.540 --> 04:19.700
is understanding that there are things we can't understand.

04:19.700 --> 04:24.460
And I think that's indispensable important

04:24.460 --> 04:25.540
to health and happiness,

04:25.540 --> 04:28.580
and also to having enough humility

04:28.580 --> 04:31.300
to see how people can be different from us,

04:31.300 --> 04:34.260
how we can be different from ourselves at times.

04:34.260 --> 04:37.780
So knowing that we don't know a lot,

04:37.780 --> 04:40.180
and having some idea of what that might be,

04:40.180 --> 04:43.180
I think is an indispensable part of the process,

04:43.180 --> 04:46.060
which I think is different from machines, I think.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.060
Yeah, the machines, you're basically saying,

04:48.060 --> 04:51.260
machines generally, because they're engineered

04:51.260 --> 04:53.700
from a design, they're usually going to be simpler,

04:53.700 --> 04:55.420
therefore understandable.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.620
And you're saying the complexity of the human mind

04:57.620 --> 05:02.020
is, at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.380
Is there a meta-phenomenal,

05:03.380 --> 05:06.140
what sometimes gets described as sort of levels of emergence,

05:06.140 --> 05:09.380
where at increasing levels of complexity,

05:09.380 --> 05:13.020
you have novelty evolve that you can't predict

05:13.020 --> 05:15.900
from lower levels of complexity,

05:16.260 --> 05:20.860
for example, atoms to molecules, it's just one example.

05:20.860 --> 05:25.860
I think neurons to consciousness, consciousness to culture,

05:26.140 --> 05:28.500
that there are meta-phenomenal that separate

05:28.500 --> 05:31.740
from the phenomenon underneath of them,

05:31.740 --> 05:35.900
and they're brought by an entire aspect of novelty.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.500
So I think we are, I mean, I really think this is true,

05:39.500 --> 05:41.460
that we are all infinitely fascinating,

05:41.460 --> 05:44.300
because these levels of emergence of novelty

05:44.300 --> 05:46.260
that are inscrutable, because you can't predict

05:46.260 --> 05:49.660
from one level to the next or understand fully

05:49.660 --> 05:51.980
are what make us, and not just us,

05:51.980 --> 05:55.340
but I think sentient creatures, human beings,

05:55.340 --> 05:59.220
but sentient creatures, inestimably more interesting

05:59.220 --> 06:00.980
than creatures that aren't sentient.

06:00.980 --> 06:04.620
And I don't know, I think when we think about machine learning

06:04.620 --> 06:07.060
and artificial intelligence, I think it's that

06:07.060 --> 06:09.500
that we're trying to create, the levels of emergence

06:09.500 --> 06:13.100
that now we don't fully understand anymore,

06:13.100 --> 06:15.700
which I guess is both exciting and maybe scary too.

06:16.860 --> 06:20.140
Yeah, so you start at the physics of atoms,

06:20.140 --> 06:24.420
quantum mechanics, go into chemistry, go into biology,

06:24.420 --> 06:27.540
from the biology, you have the functional phenomena,

06:27.540 --> 06:30.260
especially as manifested in the human brain,

06:30.260 --> 06:32.860
and then multiple brains connecting together

06:32.860 --> 06:36.220
through consciousness and intelligence creates civilizations.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.100
It's pretty interesting.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.740
Where do you think the magic is?

06:38.740 --> 06:40.460
At which layer of the cake?

06:40.460 --> 06:43.220
Every layer, because every time you emerge

06:43.220 --> 06:46.140
from one thing to another, I see it as an analog,

06:46.140 --> 06:48.060
like the concept of the dialectic, right?

06:48.060 --> 06:49.420
Where I think it was Hegel, right?

06:49.420 --> 06:54.420
Who realized, hey, when you have like thing A and thing B

06:55.020 --> 06:57.380
and they're complicated and they come together,

06:57.380 --> 07:00.100
you know, you don't get a hybrid of A and B, right?

07:00.100 --> 07:03.460
You end up getting something that's new, that's novel.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.100
And I think that describes to some degree

07:07.100 --> 07:12.100
that like what emergence is, except there's a whole new,

07:12.580 --> 07:14.980
and it's a universe of novelty, right?

07:14.980 --> 07:17.980
That comes at each layer of emergence

07:17.980 --> 07:19.740
that allows infinite possibilities

07:19.740 --> 07:21.620
that weren't possible before.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.180
And I think that's why we're so complicated,

07:23.180 --> 07:26.060
that we're our functional neuroscience, right?

07:26.060 --> 07:27.260
Which I think is psychology, right?

07:27.260 --> 07:29.020
Our ability to think about ourselves,

07:29.020 --> 07:32.820
about others to be reflective is sitting on top of

07:32.820 --> 07:35.140
so many layers of emergence.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.220
Like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants

07:37.220 --> 07:39.820
that we're, you know, each of us, our consciousness

07:39.820 --> 07:42.700
is standing on the shoulder of a giant

07:42.700 --> 07:47.540
of many, many, many levels of emergence, of novelty,

07:47.540 --> 07:49.100
so many of which we don't understand.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.540
I mean, about subatomic particles,

07:50.540 --> 07:53.180
everything that quantum physics means, you know,

07:53.180 --> 07:56.180
when does time become important, right?

07:56.180 --> 07:58.860
As opposed to things happening outside of time

07:58.860 --> 08:02.140
and outside of space, when do we slot into one

08:02.140 --> 08:04.220
temporal perspective and then the complexity

08:04.220 --> 08:06.820
just, I think, grows and grows and grows?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.220
Yeah, the interesting word he uses, novelty.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.780
If true, this really blows my mind.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.900
In some, either shallow or deep sense, it is true.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.300
I'm trying to figure that out.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.420
I don't know if you know something about cellular automata

08:20.420 --> 08:23.500
is this very simple mathematical objects

08:23.500 --> 08:25.620
where you have rules that govern each individual

08:25.620 --> 08:27.860
little cell and they interact locally.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.980
And then, you know, you understand the very simple

08:29.980 --> 08:31.340
operation of those individual cells,

08:31.340 --> 08:33.980
but at another layer of abstraction

08:33.980 --> 08:36.780
when you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision,

08:36.780 --> 08:39.820
these meta-objects starts appearing.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.940
That function, you could build a torn machine

08:42.940 --> 08:44.860
whether you can build an arbitrary complexity

08:44.860 --> 08:49.860
of computation on top of this kind of very simple object.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.320
Yes.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.260
It's an interesting question whether

08:53.260 --> 08:55.580
that was always there.

08:56.620 --> 09:01.500
The atoms somehow know about love, right?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.460
Like about consciousness.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.980
About war and violence and evil and hate and all that.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.580
That's already laid in the possibility of that,

09:10.580 --> 09:12.980
the capacity for that, it's already in the atoms.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.880
It's already in the physics, it's already in them.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.860
And all the different chemistry and it builds up.

09:18.860 --> 09:22.540
Like even the origin of life, still a mystery.

09:22.540 --> 09:27.020
That's known, that's in the physics.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.140
That's known to the universe,

09:28.140 --> 09:31.060
the basic background physics in the universe.

09:32.060 --> 09:34.620
Because if that's not the case,

09:34.620 --> 09:35.740
it's like where does that come from?

09:35.740 --> 09:37.460
Where's that magic?

09:37.460 --> 09:40.060
And how many layers can the cake possibly have?

09:40.060 --> 09:41.660
How many are we gonna keep building?

09:41.660 --> 09:46.660
If we're constantly through this process of abstraction

09:46.700 --> 09:50.340
of adding a layer to the cake, adding novel things,

09:50.340 --> 09:51.660
like where's the ceiling?

09:53.180 --> 09:54.980
As we expand on into the cosmos,

09:54.980 --> 09:56.460
if we successfully can do that,

09:56.460 --> 09:58.260
are we gonna keep building like

09:58.260 --> 10:01.220
more miraculous, complex objects?

10:01.220 --> 10:05.580
And then the brain is just like a middle layer thing.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.740
We tend to think of ourselves

10:06.740 --> 10:09.380
as a truly, truly special manifestations

10:09.380 --> 10:10.860
of what's possible in the universe.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.620
But maybe we're just like the basic,

10:12.620 --> 10:16.900
like tiny building block of something much, much, much bigger.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.900
We're in the early days of being a brick

10:19.900 --> 10:21.660
and a very large building.

10:21.660 --> 10:22.660
Sure.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.620
Look, I think that's entirely possible.

10:24.660 --> 10:29.100
I mean, I think the only emergent thing, so to speak,

10:29.100 --> 10:33.060
that we build is culture, the aggregation of us.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.860
So you have individual human minds,

10:35.860 --> 10:39.020
which are entirely unique.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.660
I mean, even the fact that time is different

10:40.660 --> 10:43.860
for you and me, it may be by picoseconds, right?

10:43.860 --> 10:48.860
But we can engage because our perceptions of time

10:49.300 --> 10:52.020
are parallel enough, they're close enough, right?

10:52.020 --> 10:54.060
That we can share a reality, right?

10:54.060 --> 10:58.060
But we're all living in a different dimension of time, right?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.140
I mean, we know that, right?

10:59.140 --> 11:01.740
So we're unique in that way.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.180
And then the unique individuals that we are,

11:04.180 --> 11:05.420
just like the cells, right?

11:05.420 --> 11:09.540
Start to create not just one thing, not just a culture,

11:09.540 --> 11:13.460
but culture on top of our individuality, right?

11:13.460 --> 11:14.860
There are uniqueness,

11:14.860 --> 11:17.980
our even dimensional uniqueness of time

11:17.980 --> 11:20.600
and experience and consciousness.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.060
So we create cultures on top of us,

11:23.060 --> 11:25.580
but what could be beyond culture, right?

11:25.580 --> 11:30.460
And what is different from us either on underlying levels,

11:30.460 --> 11:33.340
like quantum physics or chemistry or biology,

11:33.340 --> 11:36.620
or entirely different and unconceived, I think,

11:36.620 --> 11:39.460
is it's an immense question.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.700
And I think it's one that should create humility in us, right?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.780
That look, look how much we don't know,

11:44.780 --> 11:47.420
and then how reckless we are with ourselves,

11:47.420 --> 11:50.660
with our resources, with human life.

11:50.660 --> 11:53.820
And I think there it's important to say,

11:53.820 --> 11:56.820
I mean, think about how entropy rules

11:56.820 --> 11:57.900
the universe around us.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.820
I mean, how over selected are we?

12:00.820 --> 12:05.020
How many, not just hundreds or thousands of times,

12:05.020 --> 12:07.380
but how many millions of times

12:07.380 --> 12:09.460
does there have to be a selection branch point

12:09.460 --> 12:13.420
before we get into a sort of eddy pool of counter entropy,

12:13.420 --> 12:17.100
right, where you can begin to create, right?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.540
Which I think is why I say,

12:18.540 --> 12:20.980
okay, the atoms know about love, right?

12:20.980 --> 12:23.980
The fact that anything is being created, right,

12:23.980 --> 12:26.900
means there's this over selection for counter entropy,

12:26.900 --> 12:30.740
where there can be a building of greater complexity,

12:30.740 --> 12:32.980
of ultimately of novelty.

12:32.980 --> 12:35.020
And we don't often think about that,

12:35.020 --> 12:37.540
of how far removed we are,

12:37.540 --> 12:39.420
maybe light years, so to speak,

12:40.540 --> 12:44.300
from any other location,

12:44.300 --> 12:47.260
temporally, physically in the universe

12:47.260 --> 12:48.300
where this could happen.

12:48.780 --> 12:52.140
We don't think about, what does that mean?

12:52.140 --> 12:54.100
Everything that you said, love,

12:54.100 --> 12:57.020
everything is a counter entropy,

12:57.020 --> 13:00.500
goes against the way the basic physics of the universe.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.340
So maybe actually the atoms really don't like

13:02.340 --> 13:05.260
what we're doing, they want us to stop.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.140
They've been trying really hard to stop.

13:07.140 --> 13:10.980
And despite that, we somehow started this whole bacteria thing

13:10.980 --> 13:13.420
for like a billion years and now we're here.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.620
I actually think of it kind of the other way.

13:15.660 --> 13:18.980
I don't think there's any purpose to purposelessness, right?

13:18.980 --> 13:21.860
So why would anything be here

13:21.860 --> 13:26.860
if the drive weren't towards creativity, right?

13:28.060 --> 13:30.980
If it drive weren't towards those subatomic particles,

13:30.980 --> 13:34.060
not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence,

13:34.060 --> 13:36.500
like we think is going on an empty space,

13:36.500 --> 13:38.500
for light years upon light years, right?

13:38.500 --> 13:43.500
But is there a design, either natural or intentional,

13:44.500 --> 13:46.660
for a schema, right?

13:46.660 --> 13:50.660
A scenario that allows for the incredibly rare,

13:50.660 --> 13:54.540
but not non-existent, any pull of counter entropy

13:54.540 --> 13:56.460
where good can happen, right?

13:56.460 --> 13:58.220
Where creativity can happen,

13:58.220 --> 14:00.700
where ultimately something can grow,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.660
something novel can happen.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.820
There's no novelty in the vastness of space,

14:04.820 --> 14:07.380
even though there's not nothing there.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.060
There's novelty here,

14:09.060 --> 14:12.980
because I think the layers of emergence

14:12.980 --> 14:15.460
start stacking very, very, very high

14:15.460 --> 14:18.620
when we're in a place of counter entropy,

14:18.620 --> 14:21.500
which then could provide even thoughts

14:21.500 --> 14:22.740
about like good and evil, right?

14:22.740 --> 14:26.780
The idea that creating, that preserving is good, right?

14:26.780 --> 14:27.780
It's what we build upon.

14:27.780 --> 14:30.540
It's how we get to the eddy pool of counter entropy, right?

14:30.540 --> 14:33.580
So then destruction is not good.

14:33.580 --> 14:38.300
What good comes of aggression and destruction, right?

14:38.300 --> 14:39.340
Unless we're protecting,

14:39.340 --> 14:41.660
or even if you think of outlying cases,

14:41.660 --> 14:43.380
let's just think in general concepts, right?

14:43.380 --> 14:45.620
Destruction destroys.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.860
It brings us towards a state of entropy,

14:47.860 --> 14:49.260
towards a state of nothingness,

14:49.260 --> 14:54.180
whereas goodness, commonality, collaboration, right?

14:55.300 --> 14:56.380
Nurturing, right?

14:56.380 --> 14:58.460
Brings novelty.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.060
It brings new existence into the universe.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.140
And I think we don't think about that.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.460
The word is we're in the middle of something so vast

15:05.460 --> 15:07.220
and built on top of so many layers.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.100
And I think it leads us to be cavalier,

15:10.100 --> 15:14.060
you know, with human life, including often our own.

15:14.060 --> 15:16.780
So you think there's an underlying creative force

15:16.780 --> 15:20.620
to the universe that might even have

15:20.620 --> 15:24.180
a kind of built in morality to it,

15:24.180 --> 15:27.900
where creating is better than destroying.

15:27.900 --> 15:31.420
And then that somehow maps on onto our society,

15:31.420 --> 15:32.460
where we kind of try to figure out

15:32.460 --> 15:35.820
what that actually means in terms of good and evil.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.740
So that something is there like that.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.900
But it has to be, it's like so nice.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.260
It's so perfect, cause it's rare.

15:45.260 --> 15:47.380
It's sufficiently rare where we have our own space.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.180
Like you can like close the door and it's like,

15:49.180 --> 15:50.580
I need to be alone right now.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.540
It's our human civilization to work on my thing.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.060
So it's sufficiently rare that there's not

15:55.060 --> 15:56.220
other alien civilizations.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.020
They're just like constantly knocking on our door,

15:58.020 --> 16:01.300
destroying us, but it still exists.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.420
That's weird.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.420
Right, right.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.580
It's so fantastically improbable that I think

16:06.580 --> 16:09.180
we should be very respectful of it.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.340
And I think you said there's a creative force

16:11.340 --> 16:13.340
that values creativity.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.220
This will be, well sure, if it's a creative force,

16:16.220 --> 16:19.860
its existence, its ability to exist and to create

16:20.820 --> 16:23.300
comes from something other than entropy,

16:23.300 --> 16:25.100
something other than so much dispersion

16:25.100 --> 16:26.380
that there's nothingness.

16:26.380 --> 16:29.180
So the creative force will value

16:30.340 --> 16:32.020
the sanctity of things,

16:32.020 --> 16:34.740
keeping things together, not destroying things,

16:34.740 --> 16:37.900
building novelty, including novelty of knowledge,

16:37.900 --> 16:38.940
novelty of sentience.

16:38.940 --> 16:43.020
I mean, it fits with the idea that we're not nothing,

16:43.020 --> 16:45.260
that that's incredibly improbable

16:45.260 --> 16:48.180
and that there are these many, many layers of emergence

16:48.180 --> 16:49.980
that we're standing upon.

16:49.980 --> 16:51.820
And I think it tells us something

16:51.820 --> 16:56.220
that we're not doing ourselves a service to ignore, right?

16:56.220 --> 16:58.220
It's not just a jump to saying,

16:58.220 --> 16:59.900
oh, there's a religious answer to everything.

16:59.900 --> 17:03.820
It's just, no, it's saying science isn't a God either, right?

17:03.820 --> 17:07.060
So if we think of science as a tool

17:07.060 --> 17:09.020
and not as an endpoint in and of itself,

17:09.020 --> 17:10.660
what is the science telling us?

17:10.660 --> 17:13.220
Like, I remember showing up at medical school

17:13.220 --> 17:14.180
and it really is true.

17:14.180 --> 17:17.500
I mean, I knew so little about the human body.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.420
I'd only been in hospitals to visit people.

17:19.420 --> 17:20.660
I'd taken pre-med classes,

17:20.660 --> 17:23.660
but sort of intensely at once after I didn't take any

17:23.660 --> 17:24.780
and I was working in business.

17:24.780 --> 17:27.620
I knew next to nothing and I had this idea

17:27.620 --> 17:30.020
that was so naive in retrospect

17:30.020 --> 17:31.940
that I was gonna learn so much, right?

17:31.940 --> 17:33.180
I was gonna answer these questions

17:33.340 --> 17:34.460
and I was gonna learn what's going on in the body.

17:34.460 --> 17:35.460
What are these organs doing?

17:35.460 --> 17:36.660
What are these cells?

17:36.660 --> 17:41.660
And what I learned was there was so much more

17:41.780 --> 17:45.660
that was amazing and mysterious and seemingly impossible.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.020
Like even how a cell functions, right?

17:48.020 --> 17:49.860
Like what is going on inside of a cell?

17:49.860 --> 17:52.780
The transport mechanisms and energy functions

17:52.780 --> 17:54.100
and diffusion functions.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.340
And then you can go down to smaller levels than that.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.820
But when you come back out and you say,

17:58.820 --> 18:01.020
how all those cells make a kidney?

18:01.020 --> 18:04.020
It's not explanatory.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.340
I remember asking the OB who had delivered

18:06.340 --> 18:07.580
my first child, right?

18:07.580 --> 18:10.300
I was so amazed and I asked him like,

18:10.300 --> 18:11.260
what do you think?

18:11.260 --> 18:12.180
Like, what do you know?

18:12.180 --> 18:13.180
You do this, right?

18:13.180 --> 18:15.340
You're seeing this life created.

18:15.340 --> 18:19.460
And his thought was nothing, I just marvel.

18:19.460 --> 18:22.180
I mean, I get to do this, but I just marvel at it.

18:22.180 --> 18:26.020
And I think the more we know about us,

18:26.020 --> 18:29.060
the more we respectfully marvel.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.060
And we should do that.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.260
We should proactively marvel at every aspect,

18:33.260 --> 18:38.260
at every layer that where the novelty emerges.

18:38.940 --> 18:39.780
Yes.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.580
We'd be a lot less likely to say,

18:41.580 --> 18:44.180
hey, I don't like you because of something, whatever it is.

18:44.180 --> 18:47.260
You know, race, religion, culture, sexuality,

18:47.260 --> 18:48.900
gender identity, whatever it is, you know?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.260
Or I want to say, I want rights that you don't have, right?

18:51.260 --> 18:53.340
Or I want what you have, right?

18:53.340 --> 18:54.860
I mean, there's so much of this.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.900
And I understand it's driven by scarcity

18:56.900 --> 18:59.540
and by human insecurity and envy

18:59.540 --> 19:01.500
and all of these things that I think drive us

19:01.500 --> 19:05.100
towards destruction, but all of that recklessness

19:05.100 --> 19:09.820
comes from not having this initial appreciation

19:09.820 --> 19:11.580
and respect that you're referring to

19:11.580 --> 19:14.460
and just marveling at like, wow, okay, we're here.

19:14.460 --> 19:15.300
That's amazing.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.980
Let's start with that.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.340
But if we marvel at this whole thing,

19:20.340 --> 19:22.380
the human project, the human condition,

19:22.380 --> 19:25.500
all the different kinds of human beings that are possible,

19:25.620 --> 19:29.300
what do you then make of that some humans

19:29.300 --> 19:31.580
do evil onto the world?

19:31.580 --> 19:34.540
First of all, are all human beings capable of evil?

19:34.540 --> 19:37.020
If we're in the process, now we've got a little bit

19:37.020 --> 19:38.900
of momentum in terms of marveling.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.940
Yeah. The layers of the cake.

19:40.940 --> 19:43.180
Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil

19:43.180 --> 19:44.060
in all of us?

19:44.060 --> 19:45.380
Yes. Is that capacity there?

19:45.380 --> 19:46.780
I believe that it is.

19:46.780 --> 19:47.620
Yes.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.740
So what do we understand about the psychology of evil?

19:49.740 --> 19:52.300
Where does that originate in the human mind?

19:52.300 --> 19:54.300
Is it there in the neurobiology?

19:54.300 --> 19:56.900
Is it there in the environment and the upbringing?

19:56.900 --> 19:57.740
Can I clarify first?

19:57.740 --> 20:01.100
I think the capacity for evil I do believe is in all of us.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.140
There's a difference between enacting evil

20:04.140 --> 20:09.140
and a sort of preset, followed, developed plan of evil.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.940
I don't believe that all of us are capable of doing

20:13.940 --> 20:17.900
what the people who perpetrate the most evil do.

20:17.900 --> 20:22.900
But I do believe that we're capable of perpetrating evil.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.940
And the thought, one thought would be that

20:25.940 --> 20:27.820
there are drives in us.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.460
I mean, there certainly seem to be drives in us

20:30.460 --> 20:34.820
towards survival, towards gratification,

20:34.820 --> 20:36.820
in some ways towards pleasure.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.260
And that can get very complicated

20:38.260 --> 20:41.300
because pleasure inside can be relief of distress.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.600
So if I feel very badly about myself

20:44.600 --> 20:46.740
and I can feel a little better about myself

20:46.740 --> 20:49.100
by making you feel worse about yourself, right?

20:49.100 --> 20:51.660
Which that plays out in a lot of human beings.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.300
Is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure, right?

20:54.300 --> 20:58.020
So it gets very complicated what's going on inside of us.

20:58.020 --> 21:01.020
And sometimes the perpetration of evil things

21:01.020 --> 21:04.020
can be through misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity.

21:04.020 --> 21:07.220
I mean, there are things that we can have in us.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.980
And other times there can be other things going on

21:10.980 --> 21:14.340
which are through the lens of unhealthy human psychology.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.820
So for example, the psychology of envy,

21:16.860 --> 21:20.020
which I think drives the lion's share

21:20.020 --> 21:21.900
of the orchestrated evil, right?

21:21.900 --> 21:25.380
There's a difference between impulsive, reflexive,

21:26.500 --> 21:29.700
evil and highly orchestrated evil,

21:29.700 --> 21:33.500
which I think is driven by envy.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.580
Highly orchestrated evil.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.260
Are we talking about a scale of societies

21:37.260 --> 21:38.740
like totalitarianism?

21:38.740 --> 21:43.060
So if we're thinking about somebody like Hitler.

21:43.060 --> 21:48.060
So at scale orchestration of evil envy driving that.

21:48.060 --> 21:51.300
So I mean, that's really interesting to think about.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.540
I'd love to hear more about it.

21:52.540 --> 21:55.860
So some of it, there might be some psychological forces

21:55.860 --> 21:58.660
that are in tension with each other.

21:58.660 --> 22:02.440
So one is if you look at something like Hitler,

22:04.340 --> 22:08.020
it's difficult to know what was going on in his mind,

22:08.020 --> 22:09.940
but it's possible to imagine if you just look

22:10.140 --> 22:12.300
at dictator's thought history

22:12.300 --> 22:14.860
that he thought he was doing good,

22:14.860 --> 22:18.740
not just for himself, but for the people

22:18.740 --> 22:20.660
he believed have value.

22:20.660 --> 22:25.220
So one way you can achieve what we consider as evil

22:26.180 --> 22:30.020
is by devaluing some group of people.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.020
And that could be all group of people.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.540
So it could have sort of a narcissistic type of idea

22:35.540 --> 22:38.700
that you basically don't care about other human beings.

22:38.740 --> 22:41.620
That's one, envy is different.

22:41.620 --> 22:44.500
I mean, maybe they can collaborate together

22:44.500 --> 22:46.220
or even like you mentioned,

22:46.220 --> 22:50.020
you can actually enjoy doing bad to others.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.180
That's almost like different

22:51.180 --> 22:54.900
because if all it is is like narcissism,

22:54.900 --> 22:58.420
you disregard, you don't care what how others feel,

22:58.420 --> 23:02.180
then you can just have make cold calculated military

23:02.180 --> 23:04.260
almost economic decisions.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.740
And you don't care if a million people die here or there.

23:07.780 --> 23:10.580
But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that

23:10.580 --> 23:13.020
or there is like a resentment that fuels it,

23:13.020 --> 23:15.260
it's not just cold calculation.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.740
It's like fueled by some kind of personal

23:17.740 --> 23:20.180
or cultural resentment as different.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.740
I think it's all fueled by that.

23:21.740 --> 23:22.580
You think so?

23:22.580 --> 23:23.420
I think it's all fueled by that.

23:23.420 --> 23:26.300
I think the idea that the Hitler thought he was doing good.

23:27.300 --> 23:32.300
It is like that is such a thin facade

23:32.300 --> 23:35.500
that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane.

23:35.780 --> 23:36.620
Right?

23:38.380 --> 23:39.220
Okay, yeah.

23:39.220 --> 23:40.060
Thank you.

23:40.060 --> 23:40.900
That's wow.

23:40.900 --> 23:41.740
That's beautiful.

23:41.740 --> 23:42.580
Yeah.

23:42.580 --> 23:45.540
It's built upon like it says,

23:45.540 --> 23:47.300
I'll explain logical lies, right?

23:47.300 --> 23:52.140
Because people can build lies upon specious logic, right?

23:52.140 --> 23:54.660
So the idea that, okay, I am doing good

23:54.660 --> 23:59.740
because I believe that this ethnicity of people is good

23:59.740 --> 24:00.900
and this is bad.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.180
And now I'm going to do this

24:02.180 --> 24:03.460
and I'm gonna make the world different

24:03.460 --> 24:05.340
and it's gonna bring better to the world

24:05.340 --> 24:06.900
and now I'm raising armies

24:06.900 --> 24:08.380
and I'm building concentration camps.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.140
And I think like this is all in the service of good

24:10.140 --> 24:14.060
is I don't think anyone ever thinks that, right?

24:14.060 --> 24:15.940
Or they think that but with,

24:15.940 --> 24:19.020
because they're living in the surface patina, right?

24:19.020 --> 24:20.860
Like they're not allowing the hurricane

24:20.860 --> 24:22.420
and that blows away the handkerchief

24:22.420 --> 24:25.700
and says like this is all evil, right?

24:25.700 --> 24:29.260
I mean, how do you decide that some group of people is good

24:29.260 --> 24:31.060
and some is bad and like what is it

24:31.060 --> 24:35.300
that you take upon yourself to play God

24:35.300 --> 24:36.620
or make decisions about the world?

24:36.620 --> 24:38.220
And I think what really is going on

24:38.220 --> 24:40.100
is that people are not doing that, right?

24:40.100 --> 24:42.540
There's something cobbled together to say like,

24:42.540 --> 24:44.540
why this is right and this is okay, right?

24:44.540 --> 24:46.060
And this is even good, right?

24:46.060 --> 24:49.660
But it is all a lie, right?

24:49.660 --> 24:53.300
It's a lie that's adorning that what I believe

24:53.300 --> 24:56.420
is the fact I believe that what's going on

24:56.420 --> 25:00.100
is the gratification of envy inside of the person.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.220
And whether someone says,

25:01.220 --> 25:02.460
oh, I think this is good and it's okay

25:02.460 --> 25:05.260
if a million people die or I'm gonna enjoy

25:05.260 --> 25:07.500
that a million people die, I think is the same.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.300
I think the enjoyment, the gratification

25:10.300 --> 25:13.060
of the orchestrated evil is there

25:13.060 --> 25:17.140
and that it all comes from vulnerability and insecurity.

25:17.140 --> 25:21.900
It all comes from deficits in the sense of self, right?

25:21.900 --> 25:23.780
I'm gonna have to process that.

25:25.420 --> 25:28.780
My slow penny and PC is processing that.

25:28.780 --> 25:30.900
So envy underlies all of it.

25:30.900 --> 25:35.180
The psychological concept of envy, what is that?

25:35.180 --> 25:37.900
I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.620
That has nothing to do.

25:39.620 --> 25:43.620
It doesn't have to do with Jews or Slavic people.

25:43.620 --> 25:48.140
Does it have to do with specific amorphous other

25:49.140 --> 25:51.700
in his mind that he's envious of?

25:51.700 --> 25:55.900
I think it has all to do with him, all to do with him.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.780
There's not a love of the people with whom he allied

25:58.780 --> 26:00.460
or even a sense of the people

26:00.460 --> 26:02.660
who he persecuted were worse than him.

26:02.660 --> 26:06.340
It's all projections out of what was going on inside of him,

26:06.340 --> 26:10.220
which was an intense sense of inadequacy,

26:10.220 --> 26:15.220
a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser than.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.060
That's the difference.

26:17.060 --> 26:18.820
So we can define words in different ways

26:18.820 --> 26:21.780
even within psychology, but let's say we take the definition

26:21.780 --> 26:24.820
here of sort of jealousy as being sort of benign, right?

26:24.820 --> 26:26.380
The idea that, oh, I might see something

26:26.380 --> 26:27.580
that you have that I don't.

26:27.580 --> 26:28.980
And I might think, I'd like that.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.940
Maybe I'll work harder to get it, right?

26:30.940 --> 26:32.140
Or maybe I can't get it.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.820
Maybe it's that you're younger than I am.

26:33.820 --> 26:36.780
They say, okay, you have that and I don't.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.300
I mean, I have other things too, I'm okay anyway.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.100
But I might want those things,

26:41.100 --> 26:42.660
but it's very benign, the jealousy.

26:42.660 --> 26:43.500
I'd like to be younger.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.620
I'd like to be richer, whatever it is that we people think,

26:45.620 --> 26:46.460
right?

26:47.460 --> 26:48.580
But it's just a thought.

26:48.580 --> 26:51.580
And it's a thought that can result in strivings

26:51.580 --> 26:53.260
or acceptance, right?

26:53.260 --> 26:54.540
It's very, very different.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.940
It's completely different than envy, which is destructive.

26:58.940 --> 27:02.060
It's a thought of I see something that you have

27:02.060 --> 27:03.180
that I don't have, right?

27:03.180 --> 27:05.540
And instead of me working for it

27:05.540 --> 27:07.340
or accepting that I don't have it,

27:07.340 --> 27:10.420
what I like to do then is bring you down,

27:10.420 --> 27:13.060
take you down to where I am, and then I'll feel better,

27:13.060 --> 27:13.900
right?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.180
Because from the perspective of envy,

27:16.180 --> 27:18.780
it is all relative.

27:18.780 --> 27:20.500
So is jealousy a kind of,

27:20.500 --> 27:23.060
is it because he said completely different,

27:23.060 --> 27:26.460
but is jealousy potentially like a gateway drug to envy?

27:26.460 --> 27:29.020
Like, is it a slippery slope?

27:29.020 --> 27:31.820
I think no, I think that jealousy is a natural,

27:31.820 --> 27:33.340
just part of the human phenomenon

27:33.340 --> 27:34.860
that we go through life and we see like,

27:34.860 --> 27:35.700
oh, I'd like to have that.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.700
I think it's probably part of our incentives, right?

27:37.700 --> 27:42.700
If I'm farming and I have one row of crops

27:42.700 --> 27:44.500
and I look over and I see that you're working harder

27:44.500 --> 27:46.620
and you have two, and I'd like to have two,

27:46.620 --> 27:48.420
that can make me work harder to have two.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.660
You don't think it's a slippery slope

27:49.660 --> 27:51.300
from one to the other to,

27:51.300 --> 27:52.980
at first you're like, I'd like to work harder,

27:52.980 --> 27:54.780
but then you keep failing and the weather sucks

27:54.780 --> 27:56.180
and you keep failing and the other person

27:56.180 --> 27:57.460
becomes more successful.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.700
Plus he's got a new hot wife now,

27:59.700 --> 28:01.860
there's a nice tractor,

28:01.860 --> 28:03.020
there's a field that's all working,

28:03.020 --> 28:04.420
and then you get this idea that,

28:04.420 --> 28:07.380
you know what, I'm gonna steal all this stuff,

28:07.380 --> 28:08.980
I'm gonna murder him,

28:08.980 --> 28:12.140
and that, do you think that's just like a leap

28:12.140 --> 28:13.540
of the same phenomenon?

28:13.540 --> 28:14.380
No.

28:14.380 --> 28:15.980
No, because I think there are things

28:15.980 --> 28:17.780
that are in us as humans, right?

28:17.780 --> 28:20.540
So the things are just by being human,

28:20.540 --> 28:23.620
like we can, for example, feel compassion, right?

28:23.620 --> 28:25.340
We can feel interest, right?

28:25.340 --> 28:27.660
We can feel jealousy in that benign sense,

28:27.660 --> 28:30.060
like it's all part of just being human.

28:30.060 --> 28:33.860
If we start going from, hey, you have more crops

28:33.860 --> 28:35.980
than I have, and that seems like actually

28:35.980 --> 28:37.780
I have a better life in a lot of ways than I have,

28:37.780 --> 28:40.260
I'm gonna kill you, that's not,

28:40.260 --> 28:43.100
that is not a progression of something benign, right?

28:43.100 --> 28:44.100
That is-

28:44.100 --> 28:44.940
But wait, wait a minute,

28:44.940 --> 28:47.620
but that is a human leap of the same thing, isn't it?

28:48.220 --> 28:51.220
Is you're drawing a line, stuff,

28:51.220 --> 28:52.460
you're saying like this is the,

28:52.460 --> 28:55.980
this human stuff, it's regular life, it's benign,

28:55.980 --> 28:57.420
but it feels like this benign thing

28:57.420 --> 29:00.020
is just a low magnitude thing,

29:00.020 --> 29:02.660
version of the thing that's not benign.

29:02.660 --> 29:05.540
Like there's probably a gray area where it stops being,

29:05.540 --> 29:08.540
but like jealousy, you can have like healthy jealousy,

29:08.540 --> 29:10.700
you can have a little bit slightly unhealthy,

29:10.700 --> 29:12.940
there's like, I think Jealous Guy,

29:12.940 --> 29:15.220
there's John Lennon song that I love, it's just beautiful.

29:15.260 --> 29:18.500
I mean, there's like, this jealousy inside relationships

29:18.500 --> 29:21.900
can make you feel like, take your minds

29:21.900 --> 29:25.580
in all kinds of silly directions, and it's crazy,

29:25.580 --> 29:28.340
but like it feels like that's an extra neighbor

29:28.340 --> 29:30.940
to like being really crazy and toxic

29:30.940 --> 29:32.660
and all that kind of stuff inside relationships,

29:32.660 --> 29:34.460
and then that feels like an extra neighbor,

29:34.460 --> 29:35.540
it's like an apartment building,

29:35.540 --> 29:37.860
that feels like an extra neighbor

29:37.860 --> 29:39.340
that eventually gets the Hitler

29:39.340 --> 29:43.260
with envy and resentment of an entire population of people.

29:43.260 --> 29:45.300
You're right, that there's a causal,

29:45.300 --> 29:47.100
there can be a causal chain,

29:47.100 --> 29:48.900
like if I'm not feeling jealous,

29:48.900 --> 29:51.180
maybe I won't ever feel envious, right?

29:51.180 --> 29:53.620
So you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead

29:53.620 --> 29:55.500
to it can open gates to, huh,

29:55.500 --> 29:57.140
how much do I dislike that you have things

29:57.140 --> 29:58.420
that I don't have, right?

29:58.420 --> 30:01.420
So yes, in that sense, but, and I think,

30:01.420 --> 30:03.100
this is the part that I think is so important,

30:03.100 --> 30:06.380
that I think there is a disjunction, right?

30:06.380 --> 30:08.620
There's an asymptotic shift, right,

30:08.620 --> 30:10.820
from one thing to another, because it is there.

30:10.860 --> 30:12.660
I'm just speaking my language, mathematically.

30:12.660 --> 30:13.500
Yeah.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.340
Statotically, yep.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.620
Yes, that's, it's a way to convey, right?

30:16.620 --> 30:18.260
Something that's entirely different,

30:18.260 --> 30:21.500
because if I start thinking, you know,

30:21.500 --> 30:23.700
I'm not gonna try and make things better, right?

30:23.700 --> 30:25.300
I'd like instead to harm you,

30:25.300 --> 30:27.900
that's qualitatively different.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.780
Oh, it's almost like, you know what it is?

30:29.780 --> 30:31.860
It could be, I don't know what you think about this,

30:31.860 --> 30:36.860
but it's in which direction your motivation is pointing.

30:37.700 --> 30:41.420
So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy,

30:41.420 --> 30:45.980
your sort of, the motivation says,

30:45.980 --> 30:49.460
okay, I understand this feeling, I wanna do less of it.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.700
I think there must be a threshold

30:51.700 --> 30:53.140
to which you actually wanna do more,

30:53.140 --> 30:55.460
like it becomes a vicious downward cycle.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.100
So that's what envy becomes.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.260
Like the first feeling, this idea

31:00.220 --> 31:02.660
that I'm gonna kill the farmer,

31:02.660 --> 31:04.620
turns into like more and more and more,

31:04.620 --> 31:05.460
and you can't sleep,

31:05.460 --> 31:06.820
and you're visualizing the farmer,

31:06.820 --> 31:08.100
and he becomes the devil,

31:08.100 --> 31:10.620
and like you have this very, you know,

31:10.620 --> 31:12.660
it's basically a thing that builds

31:12.660 --> 31:13.660
into the negative direction,

31:13.660 --> 31:16.620
versus returns to the stable center.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.020
And now a person is cultivating evil, right?

31:19.020 --> 31:20.940
They're saying, hey, there can be seeds of evil

31:20.940 --> 31:23.260
in all of us, let me take that seed out,

31:23.260 --> 31:26.300
dust it off, plant it, nurture it, right?

31:26.300 --> 31:27.980
And then grow that seed of evil,

31:27.980 --> 31:31.140
which will affect all other parts of the person's life, right?

31:31.140 --> 31:34.500
They won't behave the same towards others in their life.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.980
They'll become different

31:36.980 --> 31:39.300
as they nurture fantasies of evil,

31:39.300 --> 31:43.780
as they begin to create with inside of themselves

31:43.780 --> 31:48.100
the motivation and the will to enact evil, right?

31:48.100 --> 31:49.660
The Hitler analogy would say,

31:49.660 --> 31:51.980
look, you take someone who had a bad childhood, right?

31:51.980 --> 31:55.740
Who was not loved, who was taught

31:55.740 --> 31:57.460
and told that he was less than.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.660
Okay, like that, we know that happens.

31:59.660 --> 32:02.500
I mean, that's why child abuse is so evil, right?

32:02.500 --> 32:06.820
It's telling children the worst possible wrong lessons, right?

32:06.820 --> 32:07.660
They're not good enough.

32:07.660 --> 32:08.940
They'll always be hurt, you know,

32:08.940 --> 32:10.180
they can't keep themselves safe.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.940
They don't deserve safety, right?

32:11.940 --> 32:16.860
So then you take someone who then nurtures that seed of evil,

32:16.860 --> 32:18.100
which is a choice.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.660
And it says, well, I can't paint well enough

32:19.660 --> 32:21.540
and no one appreciates me and I don't like how I look

32:21.540 --> 32:24.020
and I don't fit in with the people I wanna fit in with

32:24.020 --> 32:27.180
and then and on and on and on and on and on.

32:27.180 --> 32:31.900
And there's a hatred of self through that lens

32:31.900 --> 32:35.620
of misery, of just being repulsed by the self,

32:35.620 --> 32:38.460
but that's unacceptable to the self.

32:38.460 --> 32:42.100
So, oh, it has to be someone else's fault, right?

32:42.100 --> 32:44.420
It's not my fault, who's fault is it, right?

32:44.420 --> 32:47.580
And then you see en masse, the enaction of evil

32:47.580 --> 32:51.180
towards groups of people who somehow

32:51.180 --> 32:52.740
in this person's mind, right,

32:52.740 --> 32:55.300
are responsible for his misery.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.460
And there's the justification of evil

32:57.460 --> 33:00.100
and then all the, you know, whether it's,

33:00.100 --> 33:01.420
this will be better for the economy,

33:01.420 --> 33:02.540
this will be good, this will be that.

33:02.540 --> 33:06.140
Like that's all lies built to justify the evil.

33:06.140 --> 33:07.740
Those are surface level narratives.

33:07.740 --> 33:08.980
Yes.

33:08.980 --> 33:13.700
And the envy is the deep down mechanism that enables.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.420
And that's the endpoint that's being served.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.820
What's being served is destruction, right?

33:17.820 --> 33:21.180
Which is why it always brings more destruction, right?

33:21.180 --> 33:24.420
I mean, how many times do wars that were started

33:24.420 --> 33:26.060
for purposes that we would look and say,

33:26.060 --> 33:27.540
like those were evil purposes?

33:27.540 --> 33:30.460
Like how many times does good come of that?

33:30.460 --> 33:32.020
Even if we look at the modern world,

33:32.020 --> 33:36.020
what comes of it is more evil, is more destruction.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.180
You know, Hitler's outward destruction

33:38.180 --> 33:40.260
eventually came inward and, you know,

33:40.260 --> 33:42.020
you see pictures of what Berlin

33:42.020 --> 33:43.860
looked like after the Second World War, right?

33:43.860 --> 33:46.660
It wasn't just destruction perpetrated outward

33:46.660 --> 33:50.820
as awful as that is, it's catchy, right?

33:50.820 --> 33:52.420
Like people used to worry if you, you know,

33:52.420 --> 33:54.620
before the, during the time of the Manhattan Project, right?

33:54.620 --> 33:56.500
If you start this chain reaction, you know,

33:56.500 --> 33:58.540
will you blow the whole world up, right?

33:58.540 --> 34:00.900
Or will it stop within this bomb or not?

34:00.900 --> 34:04.060
And we see, okay, the chain reaction of evil

34:04.060 --> 34:06.140
hasn't yet blown the whole world up,

34:06.140 --> 34:10.100
but look at the, look at how the catastrophe spreads.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.220
You think 50 to 60 million people dead

34:12.220 --> 34:15.980
in the Second World War, which truly was a world war.

34:15.980 --> 34:19.500
What destruction was spread around the globe?

34:19.500 --> 34:22.220
And this is something that can't be stopped

34:22.220 --> 34:24.220
once the chain reaction starts.

34:24.220 --> 34:26.700
Like if Hitler was successful,

34:26.700 --> 34:27.900
like he would just keep going.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.460
If he had been-

34:29.460 --> 34:31.380
On his personal psychological level, I mean.

34:31.380 --> 34:32.780
Right, because if we think from the perspective

34:32.780 --> 34:35.460
of destruction, success would have needed,

34:35.460 --> 34:37.020
led to the need to conquer more,

34:37.020 --> 34:38.660
then there's factions and infighting,

34:38.660 --> 34:41.340
and then eventually you get the same mass destruction, right?

34:41.340 --> 34:44.660
And never does the inaction of evil

34:44.660 --> 34:46.980
satisfy what the person is initially seeking.

34:46.980 --> 34:49.060
Like people want to feel better about themselves, right?

34:49.060 --> 34:54.060
We, you know, Winnecott, who was a British pediatrician

34:54.980 --> 34:57.580
who wrote about children and adults

34:57.580 --> 34:59.020
from very deep perspectives,

34:59.020 --> 35:01.220
he wrote about the idea of good enough, right?

35:01.220 --> 35:03.420
And then you can sort of extrapolate that to like,

35:03.420 --> 35:05.020
we all want to feel good enough,

35:05.020 --> 35:07.100
like not just limp over the line, good enough,

35:07.100 --> 35:08.620
but I want to feel good enough

35:08.620 --> 35:10.180
that I'm a decent person in the world

35:10.180 --> 35:11.480
and like what I do matters.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.980
And, you know, I can have an impact on people

35:13.980 --> 35:16.740
and, you know, people can like me and care about me.

35:16.740 --> 35:20.180
It's, there's a simplicity there that people want

35:20.180 --> 35:21.860
that when people don't have,

35:21.860 --> 35:23.300
and there's certain other factors,

35:23.300 --> 35:26.140
maybe their temperamental factors or historical factors

35:26.140 --> 35:30.980
can lead to trying to soothe that deficit, right?

35:30.980 --> 35:32.700
Through envy.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.700
And I think it starts with that.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.620
And it often starts in childhood, not always,

35:38.620 --> 35:40.180
but it often starts in childhood

35:40.180 --> 35:44.420
when the child's brain and psychology are so vulnerable.

35:44.420 --> 35:47.340
And, you know, you see salient child abuse.

35:47.340 --> 35:49.260
If you look at what was Hitler's background

35:49.260 --> 35:50.660
and what was Stalin's background,

35:51.020 --> 35:53.420
I mean, you could look at almost anyone

35:53.420 --> 35:56.100
who's perpetrated evil or they're serial killers

35:56.100 --> 35:57.740
or whatever it may be.

35:57.740 --> 35:59.780
The majority, not everyone,

35:59.780 --> 36:02.940
but the majority had these lessons in childhood

36:02.940 --> 36:04.540
that said, you're not good enough,

36:04.540 --> 36:06.860
you can't keep yourself safe, no one cares about you.

36:06.860 --> 36:11.060
And in a subset of people, that's gonna generate envy.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.780
And that, you know, that seed of evil

36:12.780 --> 36:14.380
then gets planted and nurtured.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.140
As a fighter jet.

36:18.140 --> 36:18.980
Roars above us.

36:18.980 --> 36:21.340
The sound of a fighter jet above us.

36:21.340 --> 36:23.260
You've been good by an orchestra jet.

36:23.260 --> 36:25.700
If you get, you quickly forget

36:25.700 --> 36:27.500
the comfort of being in a peaceful place.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.340
That's one thing I saw in Ukraine.

36:30.780 --> 36:34.260
Is, hey, you quickly get comfortable here.

36:34.260 --> 36:38.580
The whole trip back, I was thinking,

36:38.580 --> 36:41.700
it's so damn good to be in America.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.100
The whole, just the whole like,

36:43.100 --> 36:45.580
it's like a three day trip back.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.100
It's so good to be American.

36:49.620 --> 36:52.540
We might take that for granted as a population,

36:52.540 --> 36:53.500
but I do agree.

36:54.660 --> 36:57.300
So the destruction never alleviates the envy.

37:00.020 --> 37:03.180
Are all humans capable of envy?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.420
I believe the answer is yes.

37:06.420 --> 37:09.460
If you think, do we all have the possibility of evil in us?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.900
I think the answer to that is yes,

37:11.900 --> 37:15.020
but we have free will, we have choice.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.940
We can choose what we do with that,

37:17.940 --> 37:22.020
which is why just because someone is a sociopath,

37:22.020 --> 37:24.660
for example, it doesn't mean that they're not responsible.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.700
I mean, our medical legal jurisprudence,

37:28.700 --> 37:33.220
has absolutely borne that out, that legally, medically,

37:33.220 --> 37:36.740
we think, okay, we're responsible,

37:36.740 --> 37:37.780
presuming we're healthy.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.300
We're not unhealthy in other ways

37:39.300 --> 37:42.700
that eliminates our ability to be circumspect,

37:42.700 --> 37:45.340
but that we're responsible for what we do

37:45.340 --> 37:47.780
and don't nurture inside of us.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.340
I mean, there are plenty of things we could decide

37:49.340 --> 37:52.060
to nurture anger and hatred about.

37:52.060 --> 37:54.100
I could think of slights, difficulties,

37:54.100 --> 37:55.820
whether it's something someone else has done to me,

37:55.820 --> 37:57.820
or I could blame fate, or I could be mad at God,

37:57.820 --> 38:01.180
or the world, we can all make those choices,

38:01.180 --> 38:03.140
and we're responsible for them,

38:03.140 --> 38:04.620
or if we're recognizing things in us,

38:04.620 --> 38:07.220
they're like, oh, I too have that in me,

38:07.220 --> 38:10.780
but I don't wanna nurture that, I don't wanna foster that,

38:10.780 --> 38:13.180
or do I choose to nurture and foster that?

38:13.180 --> 38:16.940
And I think ultimately, in our subject of Hitler as evil,

38:17.060 --> 38:19.540
if Hitler had kept winning and winning,

38:19.540 --> 38:21.060
I think ultimately, he would have been

38:21.060 --> 38:23.860
the only person on earth, and I really do believe it.

38:23.860 --> 38:27.060
Ultimately, everyone, everything else would be killed

38:27.060 --> 38:30.140
because it's such destruction, destroy everything.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.540
And probably when that didn't work,

38:32.540 --> 38:34.460
then there's the destruction of the self

38:34.460 --> 38:39.460
because nothing soothes envy

38:40.900 --> 38:44.540
that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil,

38:44.540 --> 38:46.660
and what you see is more and more anger

38:46.660 --> 38:47.820
and more and more frustration,

38:47.820 --> 38:50.540
which is why I really do believe someone like that,

38:50.540 --> 38:52.940
who nurtured evil in themselves that way,

38:52.940 --> 38:54.420
ultimately would destroy.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.020
They'd be like him and one other person,

38:56.020 --> 38:57.380
then he'd kill the other person.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.940
I think that's really powerfully said,

38:59.940 --> 39:03.420
but even just to return to the jealousy versus envy,

39:03.420 --> 39:07.160
I still think that it's the same flame,

39:08.700 --> 39:11.060
and envy is just the bigger version of it.

39:11.060 --> 39:15.200
So I think, I just, in my own personal life,

39:16.200 --> 39:19.240
I've felt jealousy towards others, like you said,

39:19.240 --> 39:24.000
like, oh, this person has, I don't know, a cooler thing,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.240
trinket, whatever trinket I cared about,

39:26.240 --> 39:28.280
and usually it's when somebody's really close

39:28.280 --> 39:30.200
to the trinket you're building.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.760
And early on, like in my teens,

39:37.940 --> 39:42.320
I realized that just empirically speaking,

39:42.320 --> 39:44.720
that jealousy over a period of a week

39:44.720 --> 39:48.880
just doesn't feel good, and it's not productive.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.880
It doesn't help me build a better trinket,

39:52.720 --> 39:57.720
or it does if I turn it not into jealousy

39:57.760 --> 39:59.360
towards another person,

39:59.360 --> 40:02.880
but into a love for building a better trinket.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.160
It's like, oh, cool, almost, you know what?

40:05.160 --> 40:08.440
Like proactively speaking, and later in life,

40:08.440 --> 40:11.160
people like Joe Rogan actually have been really powerful

40:11.160 --> 40:13.680
in this for me, just as a fan of his,

40:13.720 --> 40:15.320
to celebrate other people.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.800
So it's almost as opposed to ignoring that other person

40:18.800 --> 40:21.800
with a cool trinket, it's like celebrating their awesomeness

40:21.800 --> 40:25.000
in my mind, like just saying how awesome

40:25.000 --> 40:26.520
the humans are able to do that,

40:26.520 --> 40:29.880
and actually just how awesome is that exact person

40:29.880 --> 40:31.160
at being able to do that,

40:31.160 --> 40:33.280
and that somehow made me more capable

40:33.280 --> 40:36.800
to build my own trinket better, and it feels good also.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.280
Like it makes me feel happy.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.840
And now you're not jealous anymore.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.120
You're not jealous anymore, right?

40:41.120 --> 40:43.040
So that's why I think jealousy is different, right?

40:43.400 --> 40:44.760
You're saying there's a week of jealousy,

40:44.760 --> 40:45.920
like, I don't like this, right?

40:45.920 --> 40:48.520
I don't like, but if you take that in a way that says,

40:48.520 --> 40:50.080
wait a second, actually, this is awesome.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.040
This is fabulous, and this person did this.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.720
That person's awesome, right?

40:53.720 --> 40:58.320
Then you're not reigning on anyone's parade, right?

40:58.320 --> 41:01.080
And in not doing that, even inside your own mind,

41:01.080 --> 41:04.680
you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability, right?

41:04.680 --> 41:07.960
Well, if he can do that, or she can do that, why can't I too?

41:07.960 --> 41:10.560
Like I want to make the better trinket too, right?

41:10.560 --> 41:12.440
Now you're thinking creatively,

41:12.440 --> 41:17.440
nowhere in there was the emergence of evil.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.280
I just disagree with that.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.480
I think there was a choice made,

41:21.480 --> 41:26.480
where I looked at my, if my life was darker, more difficult,

41:26.720 --> 41:30.480
I think it has nothing to do with the actual little flame

41:30.480 --> 41:32.080
of jealousy I felt.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.640
I think it has to do a lot more with the other context.

41:34.640 --> 41:39.640
If my life were more difficult,

41:39.640 --> 41:43.120
there was more abuse, there was more challenges.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.640
I think that decision,

41:44.640 --> 41:46.600
I could have made that decision in a different direction.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.440
Yes.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.800
Maybe, I don't know, you've written brilliantly about trauma.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.840
If there's a bit more trauma,

41:53.840 --> 41:56.780
as the background noise of my decision-making,

41:56.780 --> 42:00.920
I'll be more likely to not be able to pull away

42:00.920 --> 42:03.040
from the gravitational field of that jealousy,

42:03.040 --> 42:04.840
and it would build and build and build and build.

42:04.840 --> 42:08.880
So I think, not to disagree with the brilliant,

42:09.640 --> 42:12.040
the person, but I feel like that flame,

42:12.040 --> 42:15.720
that flame has the capacity to engulf the whole world.

42:15.720 --> 42:19.000
I guess the initial flame of jealousy, the little bit,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.600
like especially the younger you are,

42:21.600 --> 42:25.320
it's almost like a habit that you get to build

42:25.320 --> 42:26.480
in either direction,

42:26.480 --> 42:29.920
because I've early on built a habit of saying,

42:29.920 --> 42:34.920
I'm going to channel that jealousy into productivity,

42:35.320 --> 42:36.800
and into celebrating other people,

42:36.800 --> 42:38.360
and that jealousy disappears.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.960
That was like a little discovery for me.

42:40.960 --> 42:41.920
I discovered that.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.720
I get it, that doesn't come, nobody tells that to you.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.200
You kind of discover that little thing.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.000
I could have easily not discovered it.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.120
I could have easily discovered

42:50.120 --> 42:55.000
that it kind of feels good to mess with that other person,

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
to think shitty thoughts, think negative thoughts,

43:00.320 --> 43:02.440
do negative things to that other person,

43:02.440 --> 43:03.280
because that could also,

43:03.280 --> 43:07.120
I just think the capacity in that initial feeling is there,

43:07.200 --> 43:08.640
and I think it's a decision we make,

43:08.640 --> 43:13.640
because otherwise, I think it dissolves responsibility,

43:14.840 --> 43:17.280
like, well, surely I'm not Hitler,

43:17.280 --> 43:19.840
therefore, this jealousy is normal.

43:19.840 --> 43:21.440
No, I just feel like every jealousy

43:21.440 --> 43:23.920
is the capacity to turn into, maybe not Hitler,

43:23.920 --> 43:27.640
but a toxicity that destroys in a small way,

43:27.640 --> 43:30.440
in your own little private life, but it could destroy.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.920
I agree that jealousy brings us,

43:34.920 --> 43:37.760
can bring us dangerously close to envy.

43:37.760 --> 43:42.560
I mean, maybe, let's see if heuristic we could agree on.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.680
Let's see, so let's say,

43:44.680 --> 43:48.160
okay, if we look at the terrain of the mind as geography,

43:48.160 --> 43:51.000
so if I'm feeling happy, satisfied,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.880
probably like I'm pretty far from envy land,

43:53.880 --> 43:57.120
right, but if I'm feeling jealousy now,

43:57.120 --> 44:01.520
I'm coming kind of closer to that border, right?

44:01.520 --> 44:04.880
And I still, I think there's,

44:04.880 --> 44:06.840
it's a big thing to go over the border, right?

44:06.840 --> 44:09.040
That the border isn't a gray area, right?

44:09.040 --> 44:10.840
There's a border to go over,

44:10.840 --> 44:13.680
and I think that you, I agree completely once,

44:13.680 --> 44:16.760
certainly about trauma, that the more trauma there is,

44:16.760 --> 44:19.240
because then the more misunderstandings there are about self,

44:19.240 --> 44:20.520
and feelings that I'm not good enough,

44:20.520 --> 44:22.360
and then that can be anger about why,

44:22.360 --> 44:23.600
and who might be oppressing me,

44:23.600 --> 44:25.400
and you know, I mean, I hate myself,

44:25.400 --> 44:26.800
and everyone else who seems to be better,

44:26.800 --> 44:30.680
like so trauma can drive us in these negative directions,

44:30.680 --> 44:33.320
but we're still crossing over something, right?

44:33.320 --> 44:36.360
So if you have the trinket, and I think that's awesome,

44:36.360 --> 44:38.920
I want that, I want to work harder,

44:38.920 --> 44:39.760
you know what I could do though,

44:39.760 --> 44:42.360
is I could sneak in tonight when no one's around,

44:42.360 --> 44:43.920
and I could move something, right?

44:43.920 --> 44:45.400
No, no way, I don't want to do that, right?

44:45.400 --> 44:47.320
But it's like I came over the border a little bit,

44:47.320 --> 44:49.360
and I thought maybe that's a better way,

44:49.360 --> 44:51.080
but then I came back, right?

44:51.080 --> 44:54.240
And we're responsible for that, right?

44:54.240 --> 44:56.640
Because it is a choice to say, I don't want to work hard,

44:56.640 --> 44:58.000
I'm already working hard,

44:58.000 --> 44:59.240
I don't want to make my trinket better,

44:59.240 --> 45:01.080
I want to think mine's the best one,

45:01.080 --> 45:02.680
I could destroy yours, right?

45:02.680 --> 45:05.400
Then, you know, we're letting our mind go over that border,

45:05.400 --> 45:08.160
and do we say, right, run that forward, right?

45:08.160 --> 45:09.080
Let's run that forward,

45:09.080 --> 45:10.760
and put people around us who feel the same way,

45:10.760 --> 45:12.960
and start doing it so we think less of ourselves,

45:12.960 --> 45:16.120
and we debase ourselves, do we run headlong in,

45:16.120 --> 45:18.360
or do we come over that boundary,

45:18.360 --> 45:20.360
and that's maybe the capacity for evil in us,

45:20.360 --> 45:24.160
that we come over that boundary, all of us, right, at times,

45:24.160 --> 45:25.840
but do we come over it, and then say,

45:25.840 --> 45:27.720
you know, that's not my choice,

45:27.720 --> 45:30.400
that's not my self-definition, and I'm coming back.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.760
But I'm trying to justify,

45:31.760 --> 45:34.360
maybe there's certain other sociological forces

45:34.360 --> 45:36.120
that help us cross the border too.

45:36.120 --> 45:39.520
So in Nazi Germany, we've been talking about Hitler,

45:39.520 --> 45:43.320
but then there's also the German people,

45:43.320 --> 45:45.800
and so maybe when there's a bit of a mass hysteria,

45:45.800 --> 45:49.120
so all these effects of like,

45:49.120 --> 45:53.000
combination of propaganda with the small jealousies

45:53.000 --> 45:55.800
and resentments of the people that don't cross the border,

45:56.600 --> 46:00.160
together they can, with great charismatic leaders

46:00.160 --> 46:03.160
that sort of really fuel that fire

46:03.160 --> 46:05.120
that we feel when we're a part of the crowd.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.880
So maybe those individual kind of psychological barriers

46:07.880 --> 46:11.280
we have to take that leap from jealousy to envy,

46:11.280 --> 46:13.280
those can be made easier.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.440
The leap can be catalyzed through this mass hysteria.

46:15.440 --> 46:20.440
100%, 100%, I think that to me is a massive point,

46:20.600 --> 46:22.120
we're talking about layers of emergence, right?

46:22.120 --> 46:24.400
So if there's individual consciousness,

46:24.400 --> 46:25.920
then there's culture, right?

46:25.920 --> 46:28.400
And we're products of the soup we swim in, so to speak.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.240
People would say that when I was growing up, right?

46:30.240 --> 46:32.200
We're products of the soup we swim in.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.160
So if the soup that we're swimming in

46:34.160 --> 46:36.680
is the soup of hatred, right?

46:36.680 --> 46:38.800
Then it's gonna foster all of those things.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.080
So then you think about,

46:40.080 --> 46:42.400
just in a painting with a very broad brush,

46:42.400 --> 46:44.160
the culture created in Germany

46:44.160 --> 46:45.960
prior to the Second World War,

46:45.960 --> 46:48.720
and like, what was the impact of the reparations

46:48.720 --> 46:50.080
after the First World War, right?

46:50.080 --> 46:52.840
Of the punishing reparations, impoverishment,

46:53.680 --> 46:55.080
and basically humiliation, right?

46:55.080 --> 46:56.840
That people were feeling okay,

46:56.840 --> 46:59.200
like there were a whole bunch of decisions

46:59.200 --> 47:01.920
that impacted that cultural perspective, right?

47:01.920 --> 47:04.560
Then there must have been aspects just like I see

47:04.560 --> 47:08.000
in many ways parallels in America now

47:08.000 --> 47:09.520
of what are our standards

47:09.520 --> 47:12.720
for what we're communicating to others, right?

47:12.720 --> 47:14.680
How is the media deciding like what's real

47:14.680 --> 47:17.280
and what's not real, what's true, what's not true,

47:17.280 --> 47:21.320
what's hatred that is only gonna do evil

47:21.360 --> 47:22.860
versus what's hatred that's okay

47:22.860 --> 47:26.320
because I might sell something by putting it out there.

47:26.320 --> 47:29.200
I mean, that was, we know that was going on

47:29.200 --> 47:31.960
in Germany during the rise of the Nazis.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.360
And I think there's a parallel to,

47:34.360 --> 47:36.000
do we value truth?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.240
Can we stand together and say,

47:37.240 --> 47:39.560
no matter how much I might disagree with you politically,

47:39.560 --> 47:41.480
right, we can still understand

47:41.480 --> 47:43.480
like that there's right and there's wrong, right?

47:43.480 --> 47:45.360
There's truth and there's lies, right?

47:45.360 --> 47:48.100
So I think those are just two examples

47:48.100 --> 47:49.760
of determinants of culture.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.080
And then the culture is a determinant of,

47:53.080 --> 47:56.240
is someone like Hitler marginalizes,

47:56.240 --> 47:58.560
like that's a crazy evil person.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.720
Oh my goodness, like whoa, right?

48:00.720 --> 48:03.320
Or is that someone who gains a greater following

48:03.320 --> 48:06.460
and more adherence and then there starts to be a momentum

48:06.460 --> 48:09.240
because why, because what the demagogues do?

48:09.240 --> 48:10.960
I think they have a giant lasso

48:10.960 --> 48:15.280
and they harness the envy of thousands upon thousands

48:15.280 --> 48:16.540
upon thousands of people.

48:16.540 --> 48:18.440
That's right, you feel worse about yourself too.

48:18.440 --> 48:19.840
Doesn't matter what the reasons are.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.720
Maybe it's your childhood, maybe it's not,

48:21.720 --> 48:23.720
maybe it's job failings, maybe it's professional,

48:23.720 --> 48:25.160
maybe it's personal, doesn't matter.

48:25.160 --> 48:28.200
Like you have envy too, let's put it together

48:28.200 --> 48:29.400
and do some destruction

48:29.400 --> 48:32.360
because that'll make us feel better, which is a lie.

48:33.320 --> 48:35.120
So we've talked about envy,

48:35.120 --> 48:38.120
where does from the leader perspective,

48:38.120 --> 48:40.840
things like narcissism or sociopathy,

48:40.840 --> 48:42.900
psychopathy come into play?

48:42.900 --> 48:46.680
What can you make of the world we live in,

48:46.680 --> 48:49.360
maybe the leaders that run the world

48:49.360 --> 48:52.440
from the perspective, from the lens of narcissism?

48:52.440 --> 48:57.440
So I am struck 20 years of doing what I do now.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.080
I've been a psychiatrist for 20 years

48:59.080 --> 49:01.000
and I practice in so many different settings

49:01.000 --> 49:02.440
and I consult in different settings.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.080
I've been fortunate to have a very wide purview

49:05.080 --> 49:06.560
of like what's going on in people

49:06.560 --> 49:08.320
and in the world around us.

49:08.320 --> 49:11.160
And I am struck with amazement

49:11.160 --> 49:14.960
that of all the things I see that are say abnormal,

49:14.960 --> 49:16.880
let's say from the mental health perspective,

49:16.880 --> 49:19.360
this could be depression, panic attacks,

49:20.360 --> 49:22.280
hearing voices, addiction,

49:22.280 --> 49:24.920
but there's so many things that cover everything

49:26.000 --> 49:30.560
that narcissism is not frequent

49:30.560 --> 49:32.200
compared to a lot of other things.

49:32.200 --> 49:36.480
So it's small in terms of say narcissistic diagnosis, right?

49:36.480 --> 49:38.640
It's much less than many other things,

49:38.640 --> 49:41.440
but it causes the lion's share.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.760
I don't just mean the most compared to anything else,

49:43.760 --> 49:45.680
but I think more than 50%,

49:45.680 --> 49:49.800
the majority of bad things,

49:49.800 --> 49:51.640
evil things, destructive things

49:51.640 --> 49:53.600
that I see in the world around us.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.080
I think narcissists are wildly destructive

49:57.080 --> 49:59.600
because they are driven completely,

49:59.600 --> 50:04.600
they are lodged completely in the lane of envy.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.960
Can you try to sneak up,

50:08.960 --> 50:10.960
and we don't wanna be lost in definitions,

50:10.960 --> 50:13.520
but can you try to sneak up to a definition,

50:13.520 --> 50:15.520
non-clinical definition of narcissism

50:15.520 --> 50:17.240
that we're talking about?

50:17.240 --> 50:22.240
So narcissism is a deep, pervasive,

50:22.800 --> 50:27.800
and unquestioned sense of inadequacy in the self

50:28.800 --> 50:32.600
that comes along with anger and fear and vulnerability,

50:33.600 --> 50:36.080
fear of destruction, fear of annihilation

50:36.080 --> 50:41.000
that is compensated for by aggression,

50:41.960 --> 50:44.280
by the mechanics of envy,

50:44.280 --> 50:49.200
by trying to make the self seem better

50:49.200 --> 50:53.560
at the expense of others, by taking from others,

50:53.560 --> 50:55.840
by being completely cavalier

50:55.840 --> 50:58.240
to the thoughts and feelings of others,

50:58.240 --> 51:00.160
that narcissism is not arrogance.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.560
Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.

51:02.560 --> 51:06.600
There is such a deep sense of inadequacy

51:06.600 --> 51:09.120
and incompetence in the self

51:09.120 --> 51:12.400
that the defensive structure around that

51:12.400 --> 51:16.760
becomes dominated by like rocket-fueled envy.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.480
So the machinery of narcissism is envy,

51:21.480 --> 51:25.960
but what do you make of the kind of more popularly discussed

51:25.960 --> 51:28.840
kind of symptom of narcissism,

51:28.840 --> 51:33.400
which is a seeming not caring about other people,

51:34.480 --> 51:38.200
sort of a very inward-facing focus

51:38.200 --> 51:40.120
in terms of the calculation you make

51:40.120 --> 51:42.400
when making decisions about the world?

51:42.400 --> 51:46.360
Narcissistic people definitely care about other people.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.480
It's the people who are schizoid and say

51:48.480 --> 51:51.800
that don't necessarily register other people.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.240
But narcissism, people care about other people,

51:54.240 --> 51:57.280
but it's entirely vis-a-vis the self.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.760
If I'm schizoid, I don't really notice

51:58.760 --> 52:00.400
or care much who you are.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.320
But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care

52:03.320 --> 52:05.280
because I'm watching every last detail of you,

52:05.280 --> 52:08.320
what might you have that's better than me, right?

52:08.320 --> 52:13.240
It's an incredibly intense focus upon individuals

52:13.240 --> 52:15.400
and demographics of people,

52:15.400 --> 52:20.400
but the priority, the goal is entirely about the self,

52:20.760 --> 52:22.640
which is why they can become easy to say,

52:22.640 --> 52:24.680
I don't care if a million people die, right?

52:24.680 --> 52:27.000
That's how different is that from going out

52:27.000 --> 52:30.440
and destroying one person or a million people, right?

52:30.440 --> 52:33.840
It's in the same category of those people only,

52:33.840 --> 52:35.480
their existence is only meaningful

52:35.480 --> 52:37.240
in how it relates to me.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.840
But it's still meaningful.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.320
It just seems like a very difficult leap to take

52:44.320 --> 52:46.700
that I don't care that a million people die.

52:47.840 --> 52:52.840
That seems to be, even with envy,

52:53.080 --> 52:58.080
that seems to be a big feeling and thought to have

52:58.360 --> 53:00.800
if you at all care about them.

53:00.800 --> 53:05.800
Are other people, I guess, tools for alleviation

53:06.680 --> 53:08.800
of your sense of inadequacy?

53:08.800 --> 53:10.320
Right, I mean, I don't even care about

53:10.320 --> 53:12.320
in that like being caring at all.

53:12.320 --> 53:16.680
I mean, care about in that noticing that a person exists,

53:16.680 --> 53:17.520
right?

53:17.520 --> 53:18.920
I mean, someone who wants money

53:18.920 --> 53:21.520
and notices that there's a $100 bill out,

53:21.520 --> 53:22.360
cares about that.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.280
I mean, they don't care about the $100 bill

53:24.280 --> 53:25.560
and that doesn't mean anything to them.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.240
It's just have thoughts and feelings,

53:27.240 --> 53:28.700
but it's gonna attract attention.

53:28.700 --> 53:29.540
They care about it

53:29.540 --> 53:32.300
because it's something that they want, right?

53:32.300 --> 53:34.180
The same way people will care about others,

53:34.180 --> 53:35.660
but only from the perspective of,

53:35.660 --> 53:37.340
do you have things that I want?

53:37.340 --> 53:39.620
Or can I feel better about myself

53:39.620 --> 53:40.860
by taking something from you

53:40.860 --> 53:43.100
by making things worse for you?

53:43.100 --> 53:44.660
People often talk about narcissism

53:44.660 --> 53:46.360
as like the opposite of empathy.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.860
But sort of empathy, again, depends how you define it,

53:51.860 --> 53:56.860
but is a careful consideration

53:57.380 --> 54:00.020
of the mental space of another person,

54:00.020 --> 54:02.420
of how the other person sees the world.

54:02.420 --> 54:05.980
And so you're kind of saying that narcissism,

54:05.980 --> 54:09.420
narcissistic people would also be very good at that

54:09.420 --> 54:12.780
in order to understand how maybe the other person

54:12.780 --> 54:14.340
can be manipulated or something

54:14.340 --> 54:16.700
to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.

54:16.700 --> 54:17.660
Right, so there's a difference

54:17.660 --> 54:19.580
between the mechanics of empathy.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.940
So let's say, again, we can define things different ways.

54:21.940 --> 54:25.260
Let's say empathic attunement is the ability to be attuned

54:25.380 --> 54:27.300
to think, okay, what's going on in you?

54:27.300 --> 54:28.420
What might you be thinking?

54:28.420 --> 54:30.020
What might you be feeling?

54:30.020 --> 54:32.460
Some people have a lot of empathic attunement,

54:32.460 --> 54:36.020
but we could look at that as mechanistic, right?

54:36.020 --> 54:39.020
It doesn't equate to care, right?

54:39.020 --> 54:43.580
An empathic attunement can come along with empathy or not.

54:43.580 --> 54:46.300
Right, so yes, people who are narcissistic,

54:46.300 --> 54:47.540
they can mentalize well.

54:47.540 --> 54:49.580
So you mentalize meaning the ability

54:49.580 --> 54:54.020
to understand or to consider thoughts, feelings,

54:54.060 --> 54:56.460
motivations, and other people, right?

54:56.460 --> 54:59.980
So people who are narcissistic

54:59.980 --> 55:02.220
can have empathic attunement or mentalization

55:02.220 --> 55:04.420
depending upon how we wanna describe those things,

55:04.420 --> 55:08.420
but that has nothing to do with care,

55:08.420 --> 55:12.580
with actual empathy or kindness or consideration.

55:12.580 --> 55:16.380
So in that sense, empathy usually popularly used

55:16.380 --> 55:19.780
means that you care, like your happiness is aligned.

55:19.780 --> 55:22.260
This is, I need to read this book.

55:22.260 --> 55:23.820
I've read so little science fiction

55:23.820 --> 55:25.780
that's been one of my goals for this year

55:25.780 --> 55:27.580
to catch up on some science fiction.

55:27.580 --> 55:31.100
So Robert Highland from Stranger in a Strange Land

55:31.100 --> 55:32.620
has this quote about love,

55:32.620 --> 55:34.540
which is love is that condition

55:34.540 --> 55:38.300
where another person's happiness is essential to your own.

55:38.300 --> 55:40.140
So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy,

55:40.140 --> 55:42.340
where you're very sensitive,

55:42.340 --> 55:44.060
so mechanistically very sensitive

55:44.060 --> 55:46.460
to the state of another person's mind,

55:46.460 --> 55:50.380
and your goal is to maximize their happiness.

55:50.380 --> 55:52.500
It's like essential to your own happiness.

55:52.540 --> 55:54.940
So the happinesses are aligned,

55:54.940 --> 55:57.020
and when that's elevated to its highest form,

55:57.020 --> 56:00.740
you can call that love, romantic love, friendship, and so on.

56:00.740 --> 56:01.580
Okay.

56:01.580 --> 56:03.580
There's one more thing about the narcissist.

56:03.580 --> 56:05.980
Some people can be sort of benign narcissists

56:05.980 --> 56:10.100
where they want great things for themselves, right?

56:10.100 --> 56:12.540
But if they have enough great things,

56:12.540 --> 56:15.580
they can sort of tolerate others being happy too.

56:15.580 --> 56:18.020
And these are people who sometimes

56:18.020 --> 56:19.780
are actually quite highly liked, right?

56:19.780 --> 56:21.860
Because they have to have the most money,

56:21.860 --> 56:23.740
the most power, the most of anything,

56:23.740 --> 56:26.020
anything more than anyone else could challenge.

56:26.020 --> 56:27.020
But as long as I have that,

56:27.020 --> 56:29.020
it's okay that you have some too, right?

56:29.020 --> 56:30.500
And then that can make you happy,

56:30.500 --> 56:32.180
and can make you like me, right?

56:32.180 --> 56:35.580
So benign narcissists can be well liked

56:35.580 --> 56:37.100
from that perspective,

56:37.100 --> 56:40.500
but it's still all about them,

56:40.500 --> 56:42.340
and that can change if, for example,

56:42.340 --> 56:44.780
there's a scarcity of resources now, right?

56:44.780 --> 56:45.940
But they're generally,

56:45.940 --> 56:48.100
they're not people who are being overtly destructive,

56:48.100 --> 56:50.420
although that they're over the border

56:50.420 --> 56:53.820
into the envy territory, right?

56:53.820 --> 56:55.780
Malignant narcissists are very different

56:55.780 --> 56:58.140
where they then want to have everything.

56:58.140 --> 57:00.900
So even if I have 1,000 times more than you,

57:00.900 --> 57:02.580
do I still envy you what you have?

57:02.580 --> 57:05.420
Because I don't think I can feel good enough

57:05.420 --> 57:07.580
about myself unless I have everything.

57:07.580 --> 57:08.420
And once I have everything,

57:08.420 --> 57:09.780
I won't feel good enough about myself either,

57:09.780 --> 57:10.980
and I don't have to have more, right?

57:10.980 --> 57:13.700
It's like, that's malignant narcissism,

57:13.700 --> 57:16.220
which we think of as sociopathy, right?

57:16.220 --> 57:18.060
And again, we can define these words in different ways,

57:18.100 --> 57:20.820
but they're very, very negative concepts.

57:20.820 --> 57:24.260
That's profound sociopathy, malignant narcissism,

57:25.420 --> 57:26.500
envy writ large.

57:26.500 --> 57:29.380
So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.

57:29.380 --> 57:31.340
That's a convenient way to think about it.

57:32.460 --> 57:35.340
No, because we can do sort of sociopathic things,

57:35.340 --> 57:37.740
but not be sociopathic, like, well,

57:37.740 --> 57:39.140
you know, the tele-white lie,

57:39.140 --> 57:41.420
it's like sort of sociopathy on steroids, right?

57:41.420 --> 57:45.420
Is then envy writ large is malignant narcissism.

57:45.420 --> 57:46.260
Just like you're saying,

57:46.260 --> 57:49.420
like there's empathic attunement, as you said.

57:49.420 --> 57:52.860
So there's the mechanistic aspect of empathy

57:52.860 --> 57:55.420
and sociopathy, and then there's the big label

57:55.420 --> 57:58.100
you get attached if you're just doing that thing regularly,

57:58.100 --> 57:59.420
I guess.

57:59.420 --> 58:01.580
Living your life through that lens, right?

58:01.580 --> 58:02.460
Yeah.

58:02.460 --> 58:04.540
And is there a nice spectrum

58:04.540 --> 58:08.620
that's like narcissism, sociopathy, and psychopathy?

58:08.620 --> 58:11.340
Is it all the same kind of nice stroll

58:11.340 --> 58:13.900
through the woods, off the cliff?

58:13.900 --> 58:15.220
Not really, because the words

58:15.220 --> 58:16.620
don't have clear definitions,

58:16.620 --> 58:18.340
like psychopathy and sociopathy.

58:18.340 --> 58:23.340
There's no real definition of psychopath or psychopathy.

58:23.340 --> 58:25.980
Does that mean someone's sociopathic, but psychotic?

58:25.980 --> 58:27.140
Like there's really not a,

58:27.140 --> 58:29.780
we end up using those words colloquially, right?

58:29.780 --> 58:32.580
Which is why, you know, concepts that we can define,

58:32.580 --> 58:36.540
like envy, empathic attunement, narcissism,

58:36.540 --> 58:38.780
even though there might be nuances and definitions,

58:38.780 --> 58:42.620
like we can define them in ways that are widely accepted,

58:42.660 --> 58:45.420
including within psychology and psychiatry.

58:45.420 --> 58:46.980
So it's nice to just think about this

58:46.980 --> 58:48.420
a broad umbrella of narcissism

58:48.420 --> 58:52.060
and the levels to which it's benign or malignant,

58:52.060 --> 58:55.580
and then also separating into the different mechanisms,

58:55.580 --> 58:57.380
like interaction by interaction,

58:57.380 --> 58:58.940
which sometimes can be narcissistic,

58:58.940 --> 59:00.460
but broadly speaking,

59:00.460 --> 59:03.300
do you do everything through the lens of malignant narcissism

59:03.300 --> 59:08.300
that makes you a sociopath or a malignant narcissist?

59:09.300 --> 59:10.860
Yes, and the thing I would add to that

59:10.860 --> 59:12.420
is the thought about culture, right?

59:12.540 --> 59:14.340
Like how does the cultures we're in,

59:14.340 --> 59:16.500
whether it's the culture of a household, right?

59:16.500 --> 59:17.660
The culture of a community,

59:17.660 --> 59:19.780
the culture of a nation or the world, right?

59:19.780 --> 59:23.900
How does that impact what unfolds in that person?

59:23.900 --> 59:26.260
And then how does what unfolds in that person

59:26.260 --> 59:27.380
impact that culture?

59:27.380 --> 59:30.580
Well, that's the question is what unfolds in that person?

59:31.660 --> 59:33.220
Yeah, how does culture affect it?

59:33.220 --> 59:37.820
But how does your own psychological development unfold that?

59:37.820 --> 59:42.060
Because narcissism in leaders is the most impactful thing,

59:42.900 --> 59:45.220
who are the most impactful individuals?

59:45.220 --> 59:47.780
What is the most impact of individual psychology we have?

59:47.780 --> 59:49.940
It's usually leaders of countries

59:49.940 --> 59:52.580
or leaders of major organizations and so on.

59:52.580 --> 59:56.220
And one of the things you mentioned with benign narcissism,

59:56.220 --> 59:59.540
that seems to be aligned with success, right?

59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.780
If you care about your own success,

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.700
that's going to be,

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.660
you're more likely to have narcissistic tendencies,

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.500
I suppose.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.700
And so my question is,

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.140
when you follow that thread of narcissism

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.780
to become the leader of a country,

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.620
now you have a lot of new interesting

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.060
psychological complexities to deal with, like power.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.100
I don't cliche that power corrupts.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.820
Does that, is it possible for power to corrupt a human mind?

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.180
To where it pushes you farther and farther

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.260
into malignant narcissism,

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.500
into this destructive envy.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.180
What are your thoughts on power?

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.540
Like the effect of power in the human mind?

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:49.540
Yeah, I think power is an accentuator, right?

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.460
An intensifier, right?

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:57.460
So I think it is true that there are people who can be

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.340
sort of in a gray area where there are

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:04.060
malignant narcissistic tendencies and behaviors,

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.340
but there are also ways in which that person

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.700
can think outside of themselves

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.940
and think in a broader way

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.260
and think sort of kindly about others.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:14.900
And they're sort of trying to navigate,

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.980
whether they're aware or not,

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.100
that they're trying to navigate

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.140
between one and the other.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.020
And then the allure of power is,

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.700
well, just look, just exercise that power

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.020
and you'll feel better, right?

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.780
It'll show you, right, that you're good enough.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.820
Look at the power you have.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.460
And whatever may be going on in the person's mind,

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.340
that then power, yes, can corrupt, yes.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.060
I think that's why we have to have checks and balances, right?

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.620
Because we are all inscrutable to ourselves,

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.580
let alone to others.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.900
So we must have checks and balances

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.060
and we should always have them on ourselves

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.180
as well as on others.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.460
We should want that for the health of ourselves

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.480
and the world around us.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.820
So I think all of that is true,

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.500
but there are also people who don't necessarily

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.460
become corrupted by power, right?

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.100
That there can be an understanding and a grounding

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.820
that they're a steward of power, right?

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.100
A shepherd, I mean, there are ways people describe

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:10.180
utilizing power and utilizing it in a benign way

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.980
that then fosters the healthy aspects of self, right?

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.340
So like gratitude and humility, right?

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:21.460
If we could add a healthy dose of gratitude and humility

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.380
to everyone or to our society,

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.940
there would be a sea change, right?

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.560
But how do you feel gratitude?

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.060
How do you feel humility?

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.340
Those things are incompatible with narcissism, envy, right?

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.260
With really the bad pole of things that we're talking about.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.620
And part of the reason I'm so focused in my work

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.820
and in really what runs through all of my thoughts about life

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.540
is the impact of trauma, right?

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.300
Because trauma creates these false lessons

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.940
and it walls us off from truth.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.940
Then it starts to point towards the unhealthy ways

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:57.060
of trying to feel better about ourselves.

01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.180
But we have the health in us too.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.860
We have those seeds of health too

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.140
that can grow into being a steward of power

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.540
and sharing power, being considerate and kind.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.420
And we see a lot of that in the world too, right?

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.420
It's not all just the evil.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.620
We see plenty of people who do good

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.980
and who are generous of spirit.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.340
And we have both in us and it is,

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.540
as I think you're talking about our culture

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.860
and what the seeds that we sow

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.420
and the climate that we set,

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.620
including putting governors and boundaries around like,

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.300
how do we reign in or say that the more aggressive,

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.300
the more envious or destructive is unacceptable, right?

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.380
How do we foster the part that's kind

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.620
and considerate and reflective and slow to judge of like,

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.740
hey, let's learn a little bit more.

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.980
Like, how do we foster that?

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.100
And I think a lot of that comes back

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.540
to early childhood education.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.100
I mean, I think we don't do nearly enough

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.020
to protect children.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.140
And as a corollary to that,

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.460
we don't do nearly enough to educate children.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.020
I mean, I said, I wanna write a book.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.100
Second book I write is gonna be everything

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.260
I needed to know about life.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.060
I learned as a second year postgraduate psychiatry resident.

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.700
I was like, why?

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:08.220
Why then did I learn so much about unconscious motivation,

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.900
about the impact of trauma,

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.180
about how we can be envious and how we can act out,

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.900
even about how our emotions trump logic in us.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:19.660
Like, why don't we teach these things

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.340
when we're young enough to understand?

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.820
Like, why is that other kid bullying me, right?

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.460
Or why, just because I'm a little bit bigger,

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.820
do I wanna go thump that other kid on the head?

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.140
Like, what's going on?

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.380
That we don't do those things, you know?

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.540
We're just tripping ahead of ourselves

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.820
and we don't stop and think, how are we using our resources?

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.180
How are we shepherding forward the next generation,

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.260
which by the way is a generation

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.980
that's gonna determine our fates too, right?

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.620
As we get older, but we don't, you know, do that.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.020
I often think of like in the Olympics,

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.620
you know, you see like the great sprinters, right?

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.580
They've gotta come out of the blocks perfectly, right?

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.460
So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast,

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.460
they're gonna fall over, right?

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.540
They're gonna just fall forward.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.420
And I often see that in my head about us as humans

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.220
and as a culture that we're rushing so far forward.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.340
We don't stop and say, wait, let's keep the basics here.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.660
The basic techniques of like,

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.660
how are we navigating forward in life?

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.940
Or do we just throw all those away?

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:18.820
Because I can get some benefit by saying that you're bad,

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.620
even though what's being leveled against you is wrong, right?

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.780
Like why do I take that?

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.540
Or do I say, no, there's something more important here

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:29.020
that we wanna shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.640
And I think preventing childhood trauma

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.300
and changing the ways that we educate children and adults

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.020
would could again, make a sea change

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.900
and maybe set us on a course towards a greater likelihood

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.540
of survival as a species.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.540
Yeah, so talking to like people in elementary school

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.860
about human nature and teaching them

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.500
is so how people can be resentful and envious

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.500
and how to deal with your emotions, how to, yeah.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.460
So these basic interaction things about human relationships,

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.220
about friendships, about betrayal, about love,

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.580
about all those things.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.660
Like it just, it's actually strange that we don't,

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.660
we kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff,

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:21.660
but then the parents often need therapy themselves.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.580
The parents didn't learn it, right?

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.420
Yeah, the parents didn't learn it.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.100
I mean, I'm not joking that I was mad,

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.140
second year after medical school, like how is it?

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.980
Like I think of things in my own life and how I,

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.340
how much shame I felt after my brother's suicide.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.180
Like I was already an adult, right?

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:41.140
I was a young adult, but I felt so much shame.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.820
I didn't, like I had no understanding that,

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.660
oh, like it's a reflex to trauma, right?

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.100
To feel guilt and shame.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.260
And that of course I was feeling that.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.340
It didn't mean it was true because I felt it,

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.460
but I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.020
to the fact that I should have felt guilty and ashamed.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.020
And I like led to some very negative things in my life

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.820
that I had to sort of pull myself back from

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:04.660
and recover from.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.780
And like, I didn't know that, right?

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.660
I didn't know the automaticity of the reflex

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.820
and how pervasive it can be

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.220
and how it can put blinders on us.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.420
And I mean, it's just one example,

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.820
but you know, it's an example of something big

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.860
that happens to people that we don't learn about.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.740
And I find myself sometimes having conversations

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.580
with a person.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.120
I still do a lot of clinical care of having conversations

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.380
with a person after a tragedy.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.060
And I'm saying, I can't believe, right?

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.300
Again, I'm saying the things that this person

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.220
didn't learn in elementary school

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.800
because like none of us did, right?

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.740
And then look at the misery and the suffering.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.020
And then I think this is one person

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.180
among how many millions among us

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.060
who try and go about their way

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.620
without knowing things that are easily knowable

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.940
because they don't even know that they're knowable

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.540
because we don't teach them to ourselves.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.660
So how to deal with trauma.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.580
That trauma happens, first of all,

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.420
that suffering can happen.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.700
And small trauma and big trauma, all of it can happen.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.100
And there's natural ways to deal with it.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.580
So in the case of trauma, as you write about,

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.940
and we can also just talk about

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.260
some more of the details of that,

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.980
but it's good to bring it to the surface,

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.300
to talk about it, to not be ashamed to hide it inside,

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.220
to be some kind of secret that it's actually,

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.220
I mean, there's a lot of positive things to say here,

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.340
at least from my perspective.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:30.340
One is it's discussing trauma and dealing with trauma

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.860
together with other human beings by talking about it.

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.220
There's a path to deep friendship and intimacy

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.240
with those people.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.440
There's a dark aspect to trauma, to war,

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.440
that communicating it or sharing it bonds you.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.840
So like the other side of trauma is like love,

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.040
is you need that hardship, not you don't need it,

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.560
but hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.000
for a deep human connection.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.160
If you bring it to the surface,

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.200
it's supposed to kind of hide it on the inside.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.800
I mean, if we can just linger on it

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.160
because you've been through a few very traumatic events

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.840
in your life, when you were 25 years old,

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.620
as you mentioned, your brother committed suicide,

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.720
what did that event teach you about life,

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.760
about death and about the human mind?

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.240
What certainly brought me face to face

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.800
with the truths of life and death,

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.440
because I had not had a major trauma before then,

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.560
so there wasn't a major trauma sort of in my

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.160
developmental years, that what can carry forward

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.960
is a sort of omnipotence defense, right?

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.040
I mean, the thought is that when we're toddlers,

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.120
we all have like an omnipotence defense,

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.680
which is like, I can just try and get up and run and move,

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.960
and if I run into something, I'll get up and do it again,

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.560
right, that we kind of have to,

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.520
and it's partly the protection of the parent, et cetera,

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.400
but we think we can get out there in the world

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.600
and do things and we just do.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.200
And if we don't have major traumas,

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.800
we can sort of carry through that,

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.320
oh, like bad things aren't gonna happen to me, you know?

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.880
Like, I know that they're there

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.840
and I know they happen to people,

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.000
but they don't happen to me, right?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And sometimes what will happen is being confronted

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.440
with such a tragedy wipes that away very, very quickly,

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.280
and then that person feels extremely exposed,

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.640
like, oh, I thought that I was gonna be okay,

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.560
and now I know that I'm not,

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.360
and then, and that can start to lead to,

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.200
and what does that mean?

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.480
And now, is this all coming for me now, you know?

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.640
Did I get so lucky for 25 years?

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.480
Nothing bad happened,

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.880
nothing but bad things are gonna be happening.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.840
Am I cursed?

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.680
Is my family cursed, right?

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.760
And I think that leads to, you say,

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.640
what the learning about the human mind, in retrospect,

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.860
I think I understood at the time to some degree,

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.600
but not like I do now, I can put words to it now, right?

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.600
Like, how incredibly important, powerful,

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.680
powerfully important negative emotion is, right?

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.920
That how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.840
can just pervade our entire life perspective.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.760
So all of a sudden we're swimming in a very different soup,

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.160
and it's a frightening soup, and it's a toxic soup,

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.120
and I'm most struck by that.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.320
And that goes along with the idea that we're not taught

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.400
that emotion always beats logic.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.320
You know, like, I think the idea of Descartes,

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.520
Daniel, the idea that we're rational creatures,

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.960
you know, that kind of comes down to us

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.480
through Western thought is like completely not true.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.720
Like we're rational creatures,

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.560
only if there is an emotion grabbing for our attention,

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.400
right?

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.440
Like, you know, we're attending to one another,

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.640
we're being very logical, right?

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.880
What we're doing now, if we heard a frightening noise

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.400
right outside the door, like we'd be entirely different,

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.240
right?

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.080
The emotion would trump everything,

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.720
is they stop paying attention to this, right?

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.080
Now safety is at stake, and we think differently,

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.240
feel differently, behave differently, right?

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.920
And this is what happens to us, not just in situations

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.200
where something drags us from,

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.360
yanks us from one emotional state to another,

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.160
but it can be very, very pervasive.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.160
So my sense of anger, frustration, inadequacy,

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.800
and then soothing in unhealthy ways,

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.120
you know, soothing by drinking too much,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.160
and then kind of hating myself in the first place,

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.840
and then hating the world around me,

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.200
and then, you know, starting to think,

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.920
well, who cares, you know, what happens?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.640
Like, you know, there's some very dark thoughts

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.440
and choices that came from a changed perspective

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.400
of self in the world.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.280
So what do you do in that, because of trauma,

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.840
again, small or large,

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.160
you find yourself swimming or drowning

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.240
in a soup of negative emotion.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.080
What do you do?

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.760
What do you do with that emotion?

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.040
I mean, we don't have to even talk about trauma,

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.160
I think the interesting thing is, you know,

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.880
any one of us throughout the day can find ourselves

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.520
taking a bit of a dip in the pool of negative emotion.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.960
What do we do with that?

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.000
The first thing is to separate how we feel

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.920
from what's true.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.280
Because we don't do a good job of that as humans.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.400
If I feel bad about myself, it's very easy to,

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.920
then I conclude like, I'm bad, right?

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.120
If I feel ashamed of myself,

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.360
I conclude I'm a terrible person who's shameful, right?

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.480
This is that, you know, there's an old psychodynamic concept

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.640
of what they used to call it, an observing ego.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.800
It still gets called that.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.200
It's not ego in the sense of arrogance, right?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.880
It's the ability to step outside and to see ourselves, right?

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.080
So that's what lets us keep the difference

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.480
between our feelings, right?

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.600
And what we know to be true.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.960
Like we could be very angry at someone.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.240
And so I think that person's terrible.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.640
I think the person's stupid.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.560
I think that right now,

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.960
because like something negative just passed between us,

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.320
this inside of me, it's just because of how I feel.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.760
Like when I can separate that,

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.160
how do I actually think about that person, right?

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.320
And, you know, we get driven so, so frequently

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.640
by how we feel, because how we think,

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.800
therefore what we believe, right?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.320
Just kind of comes on its heels

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.760
as if the feeling is dragging it along.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.440
And I've been struck by that.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.320
It's one of the things that has struck me so the most, right?

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.080
Among the very most in 20 years of working as a psychiatrist

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.320
is how we are led by our feelings, our emotions,

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.600
as if they are truth.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.400
And then they create truth

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.960
because we embrace what they're telling us as true.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.080
And that is, I think, incredibly,

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.720
I think it's how people learn prejudice.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.200
I think it's how people learn self-hatred.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.200
I think it's how we learn so many destructive behaviors.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.680
And then the blinders on us come in more and more

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.120
and more and more.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.400
So separate, you know, we're driven by what we feel

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.960
unless we understand that what we feel

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.320
is different from what we know to be true

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.480
or what we can decide on one way or another.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.840
And that requires realizing and catching

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.840
the emotions themselves, realizing that it's an emotion.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.840
A feeling comes into your mind, overtakes you,

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.560
a feeling of anger, dislike, hatred, all of that.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.000
It just comes in.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.080
It's like, why did that person just cut me off

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.560
in traffic or something like that, that feeling?

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.120
So wait, you just kind of take it as a feeling

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.120
and realize it's a feeling that doesn't represent

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.480
some deep reality about the world that's fundamental.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.480
Or you, they just kind of watch it and let it pass,

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.800
which is the natural way of things.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.440
Yeah, we'll decide if it means anything, you know?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.280
If I'm mad, right, someone cut me off

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.240
and I feel hatred and I want to destroy them, right?

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.480
Just stop and think, look, I've got that in me.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.240
I can, you know, are the stressors running too high

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.720
in my life, like is it really good?

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.760
Should I be on this road, 10 minutes behind schedule?

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.120
Like is it, what am I really doing?

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.920
So we can learn, but yes, it's an observation skill, right?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.200
And it's an observation skill that we can develop, you know?

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.480
I often think about, you know, there was something called

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.840
the tapestry theory, which I think initially was a theodicy

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.280
of explaining, I believe this is true.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.520
I'm not sure of this, that the idea was that,

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.160
oh, we don't see God's plan because we're up too close

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.000
to it, right?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.200
Like as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.480
and we're standing right up it,

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.640
we're only gonna see one part of it,

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.040
we need to stand back from it.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.760
And, you know, I remember learning that religion studies

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.680
class made me really fascinated with that at the time.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.440
And I think that there are a lot of things we do that about,

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.280
right?

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.280
And in training ourselves to have an observing ego,

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.200
what we're saying is, hey, like just the busyness of life

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.360
or my own impulses or the pool of emotions are trying

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.640
to pull me up right close to whatever tapestry

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.480
there is there.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.320
And I want to sort of resist that.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.600
I mean, I'm better off if I really stay further behind it.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.400
And then I make a choice if I want to come close to it.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.200
If there's some really positive emotion,

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.600
it's friendship, it's love, it's nurturing,

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.160
you know what, let me come right up to this, right?

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.600
But I want to choose when I'm doing that.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.920
I don't want some drive.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.320
I didn't decide to like take me by the back of the head

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.320
and put me up against that tapestry.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.360
So the interesting exercise for me,

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.640
and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.280
is the internet with social media,

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.040
that it's almost like going to the gym or something like that.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.640
At least that's the way I see it.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.040
Because there's a bunch of forces on social media

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.920
that are trying to make you feel things.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.560
Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.920
Because there is actually a strong gravity pull

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.080
to negative feelings for some reason.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.640
And so the, and the brain notices them more.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.080
I don't know what that pull is, but it's there.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.720
And you get to observe it on social media.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.520
Like if you actually just scroll through social media,

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.680
you feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.480
And I just see it as a kind of exercise of like,

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.400
you feel the pull just like when you go to the gym,

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.640
there's a resistance.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.160
And I practice like a stepping way to look at the tapestry,

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.280
and there's different mechanisms

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.120
I think all of us have to learn.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.480
For me, there's a kind of,

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.720
you mentioned gratitude and humility.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.040
So like if somebody, if it's me personally,

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.160
I've recently gotten attacked, if you place it here and there.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.320
If they're saying that they're much smarter than me,

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.040
I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.040
And I kind of imagine that they are smarter than me.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.880
Those things like helped me to kind of like,

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.200
pull away and then maybe they have a lesson to teach me.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.280
Like I don't take their sort of negative comments to heart,

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.600
but I imagine the human being

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.360
and like that they might have a lesson to teach me.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.480
And in general, when it's more amorphous,

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.680
kind of negative feeling,

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.160
I'll think the other thing is that gratitude.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.760
Just like different versions,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.560
almost memifiable versions of like,

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.000
oh, this is pretty cool.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.560
Like we got a thing going here.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.800
There's like human civilization,

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.920
bickering and having a little fun like lunch, food fight.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.080
And it's kind of cool.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.920
Like we get to interact in this way

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.680
and there's a bit of humor.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.920
There's like Thanksgiving dinner.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.160
Like if you, like Thanksgiving dinner,

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.600
if you're arguing about politics,

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.000
you can feel like really intense.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.280
Like I can't believe you said this,

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.640
but if you zoom out, it's like family.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.520
This is like, this is amazing.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.440
So that kind of feeling really helps.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.880
But it's like, it really is like going to the gym.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.000
It's like building up a muscle

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.120
to be able to pull away from those emotions.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.720
I don't think I get to practice

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.080
that kind of emotion in regular day-to-day life.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.520
Cause like, it's hard to get those reps.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.560
On social media, you can really get the reps in.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.400
It's kind of cool.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.600
Like that's the way I see social media

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.680
is a chance to sort of practice that stoicism

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.240
of like, of gratitude, of humility,

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.160
of loving other people in the face

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.160
of this negative emotion, all that.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.920
Yes, and, you know, there's a certain kind of psychotherapy

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.200
that talks a lot about this idea that like,

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.200
oh, everything is as it should be, right?

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.600
Which doesn't mean from some moral or justice point.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.160
It's just that often if you look at things,

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.040
one thing leads to another to another to another

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.040
in a way that's actually very, very predictable,

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.600
even though we might be surprised about it, right?

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.600
And so an example, so I would say that gratitude often does

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.200
come along with a healthy pride, right?

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.400
So you could say in the example you gave,

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.360
I'm being assailed on social media, okay?

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.200
So you could say, well, you know, there was a time I sat at,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.560
I set forth to impact people, right?

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.200
To be able to reach people and to impact them, right?

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.400
And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.640
that I've done that, right?

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.680
Because look, you did it because of your effort, right?

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.400
Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts,

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.480
like you're responsible for it, right?

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.400
But also you feel gratitude because any one of us

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.040
who's here and has any opportunity

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.240
has reason to feel immense gratitude, right?

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.080
So then you can say, okay, what's actually gone on here

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.600
is something successful.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.600
I set out to do something and I'm doing it, right?

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.200
And what it brings with it absolutely includes being assailed.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.600
There's no surprise there, right?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.000
That because of, you know, people who have anything good

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.160
to serve as lightning rods for envy.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.880
So then, yes, there will be people who want to make up lies

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.040
or whatever they want to do

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.520
because you become a lightning rod for envy

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.520
by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.880
about which you can feel a healthy pride and gratitude, right?

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.560
And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.280
I mean, you're still gonna make decisions about it,

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.120
but it makes sense then,

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.920
like you have a mechanism of understanding it

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.360
that not only makes sense to you,

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.480
but reflects the truth of what you actually have done

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.920
and achieved and what's going on in the world around you.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.840
Well, I wonder if we're all kind of a little bit unique

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.120
in this because for me,

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.400
I mean, maybe it's useful to kind of talk

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.800
through my own experience of it is for me,

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.160
I try to avoid, especially in those situations,

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:18.160
to feel pride because I'm just looking empirically.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.120
I feel way happier if I focus on humility.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.920
If I ever think of like,

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.280
oh yeah, when you do something meaningful

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.920
or you become more popular,

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.520
you're going to experience these kinds of,

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.320
I feel the attacks more

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.080
and it's like me versus the world.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.720
That's the feeling that you start getting

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.000
and that does not create a pleasant feeling.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.880
So to me, the pleasant feeling is like stepping away,

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.120
like kind of laughing at it at all with a smile

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.200
and not like in a negative, like laughing at people

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.080
but just like laughing at the theater of it,

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:52.920
the circus of it,

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.320
like this whole absurd existence we've got going on

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.720
and then just having a humility in like,

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.200
everybody has a lesson to teach me.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.520
It just makes me feel good.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.760
The pride thing I do like feeling

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.800
in a positive pool of emotion.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.200
So if I'm building a trinket and I finish it,

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.640
I'm like really happy with myself.

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.760
Like I finished this thing

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.880
and I usually actually like to do that alone.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.600
Like I don't need an audience for pride.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.440
I like to sit there and just like,

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.320
ooh, this is cool.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.000
I did that, you know?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.920
But I just, I find that in social interactions,

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.440
pride is just a dangerous,

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.320
I guess it's a dangerous drug for me

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.160
because like it's such a small,

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.040
it's a small step away

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.920
from then losing all the humility

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.440
and then you started getting very defensive

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.640
and that's not going to,

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.560
that just starts you on a spiral of negative emotion.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.560
But I also, I mean, with everybody,

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.400
you mentioned this,

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.040
it will probably sneak up to it in different directions.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.360
I do think there's different brains that we all have.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.080
Like my brain is exceptionally self-critical,

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.720
like non-stop.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.240
It's like an engine that's always there.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.400
But at the same time,

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.240
I'm able to zoom out and have gratitude

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.080
as if there's like two brains

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.360
and they're like cohabitating happily.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.480
And I can, the better I get at this,

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.920
the more I can use the one that's self-critical

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.440
when I'm trying to be productive

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.080
because naturally I'm super lazy.

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.360
So I'm trying not to be less lazy, I'll be self-critical.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.720
And then when I'm not being lazy,

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.320
when I just, there's a special moment,

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.320
I want to enjoy that moment,

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.680
I'll turn on the gratitude engine.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.760
I feel like generic advice that people would give

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.200
if your brain is self-critical, that's not a good thing.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.440
Like you should probably get rid of that.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.160
I don't know about that because it seems to be working.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.000
Yeah, like I kind of like it.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.640
I kind of like this grumpy old man that's in there

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.800
that's like, that thing you did, that really sucked.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.920
I was like, and I kind of,

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.160
there's a movie grumpy old man.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.080
Like I like that grumpy boy, the grumpy cat is in there.

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.320
And it's nice, but yeah,

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.440
it can have bad effects on relationships

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.360
and on maybe my wellbeing,

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.080
maybe as you get older and all that kind of stuff.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.960
So you have to monitor all this kind of stuff,

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.000
but I don't know.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.720
I don't know which one is like,

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.240
cause you've kind of highlighted,

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.040
it's good to have gratitude and humility,

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.680
but it's also good to have a little bit of pride.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.800
I wonder what that like set of ingredients

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.840
for a healthy life looks like for each of us.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.040
Whether we have to customize and figure out what that is.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.240
Cause some of the cake is already baked is the problem.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.760
And because of the trauma,

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.560
like if I was like eight years old,

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.200
maybe I could be a little more flexible.

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.000
But at this point, like you got the thing you got

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.840
and it's hard to like fix it.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.000
You can do a lot with it.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:51.840
You could.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.360
It may not be easy, but there's a lot of plasticity

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.360
and a lot of pliability there.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.880
Across all ages.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.320
People are different and there may be idiosyncrasies

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.160
of why one person is in a different place.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.960
But as a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely yes.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.600
I mean, people have evolved and I've worked with people

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.600
who've really changed themselves

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.520
and brought in their conception and understanding,

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.600
you know, they're in their 80s or, you know,

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.520
I think we can do it at any stage of life.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:21.360
And I would make a case for, for intracyclic.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.960
So not between people necessarily, right?

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.480
But inside of oneself or the feeling of pride.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.200
And maybe if we call it self-esteem, right?

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.320
Like let's say we call it self-esteem, right?

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.840
Or we could call it healthy pride.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.320
We could put either word to it.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.160
But if you think about what we're trying to avoid

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.720
is say a sense of inadequacy,

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.040
then it is good to sort of own what's ours.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.720
We can put ourselves a little bit out of balance

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.680
either in terms of building up resentments

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.640
or in terms of decreasing self-confidence, right?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.120
If we're not owning everything, that's ours, right?

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.880
So a thought, thought I would have about,

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.720
let's say about some pride or some self-esteem, right?

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.800
Is it can work against vulnerability, right?

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.160
Which we know can also in some situations

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.280
push us towards jumping the boundary into envy

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.120
and all of that.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.280
So think about vulnerability.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.720
If you conceive, okay, people are assailing me

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.160
and you just go to a place of gratitude,

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.120
you know, it can send a message that,

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.800
okay, I'm just lucky and I hope I continue to get lucky

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.000
as opposed to like, that's not true, right?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.640
Like there's ability inside of me

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.080
and discernment inside of me that tells me

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.240
I can have a greater sense of confidence

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.880
that I'll navigate what comes my way, right?

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.100
So because the pride or the self-esteem part

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:44.040
is owning what we've contributed

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.200
to the goodness we've created, right?

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.760
Which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.600
And it also helps us feel armed against say

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.800
the slings and arrows of, you know,

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.040
whatever outrageous fortune may come next.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.880
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.760
Again, disagreeing with an expert here.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.920
Yes, I think that's generally good advice,

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.480
but I think you mentioned vulnerability.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.600
I think it's like, I've just been doing a lot of research

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.840
on rocket engines and fuel.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.800
And speaking of fuel, I just think I get a lot

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.120
from being vulnerable because vulnerable leads

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.080
to intimacy in friendships and relationships.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.640
I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings,

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.200
just on a friendship, on like a ideal level

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.080
in conversations and so on.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.080
And so I would rather err on the side of vulnerability.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.600
Like to me, pride is destructive.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.540
I think I already,

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.120
yeah, I already have a pretty good engine that says like,

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.240
life is awesome.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.960
I don't need help for that.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:51.800
That's fine.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.800
That one is working.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.800
It's the, I just feel like the way to face the world

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.160
that's full of uncertainty that could be full of cruelty

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.920
is with humility and gratitude.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.920
I don't know, this pride thing, it feels like,

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.760
I know that for a lot of people,

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.760
it's really important to really work on pride

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.920
to make sure they don't crumble under the pressure

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.120
of like, they don't give into the sense of security

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.200
that destroys them.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.160
But I just, for me, empirically speaking,

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.080
I seem to be happier facing the world with humility

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.120
and just being grateful.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.360
The pride I'm really worried about.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.960
Like, it just, it feels more destructive than anything.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.080
See, what I think, as you're telling me that,

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.120
and I wanna be presumptuous,

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.200
but I make some thoughts or some conclusions that tell me,

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.440
hey, you're in a pretty healthy place, right?

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.560
And the reason I say that is because

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.720
I agree completely about vulnerability.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.040
I mean, think about humility and gratitude

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.200
make us vulnerable, right?

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200
If you're like, wow, I'm grateful.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.480
Thank you, I'm grateful for you.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.440
You know, we could get shot down or something,

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.480
you know, something bad could happen

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.120
and something could make us feel bad.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.880
So yes, we need vulnerability.

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.880
If we try and eliminate vulnerability,

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.200
we're living miles into the envy, you know, land, right?

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:11.420
So you're describing a healthy vulnerability,

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.280
but then my brain says that's because on the other side

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.280
of the seesaw, so to speak,

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.920
has to be a healthy sense of self,

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:21.280
whether we call it self-esteem or healthy pride.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.320
And then I'll say what I think is the evidence for that

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.240
is you describe the negative voice, right?

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.280
As like the grumpy cat, right?

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.240
But that's a good negative voice to have, right?

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.640
Because it's telling you like, hey, that wasn't your best.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.440
Like, come on, do better or, right?

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.280
Like you can do better.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.080
Like this, you know, there's a negative voice in some ways,

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:42.920
but it believes in you, right?

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.680
It's where that voice could be.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.120
It could be a negative voice that says,

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.280
you didn't do that well because you suck.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.760
You don't deserve anything.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:52.880
Good, right?

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.240
Well, I should even be alive, right?

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.440
I mean, that's the negative voice

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.040
that can gain so much force

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.280
if there isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.560
So I think because you're well-balanced,

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.680
you know, you have what you need,

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.240
and then having more of it seems like,

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.500
oh, that's not so good,

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.080
but there are people whose negative voice

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.480
isn't the grumpy cat, it's hateful, right?

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.760
And then that's a person who needs to bring

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.120
that into greater balance.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.240
Yeah, I think my negative voice is like a grumpy cat.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.800
That's like a French existentialist,

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.760
maybe a little bit of a nihilist,

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.200
but just kind of is-

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.200
Sartre's cat.

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.720
Yeah, Sartre's cat, so it doesn't get hateful.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.480
It's not like a Hitler cat, so it's a little more,

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.680
yeah, I guess there is kind of like this line

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.760
that we've come across a couple of times

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.360
between the benign and the malignant.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.280
Right.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.880
But of course, you have to monitor that line.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.600
I just, I think you have to be careful

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.140
when you face really difficult situations of,

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.960
as you go on through life, more and more difficult,

01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.960
you face a lot of loss and suffering,

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.160
especially later in life.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.160
Oh, you have to be careful with that voice.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.680
That grumpy cat can get awfully confident,

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.480
and then if you don't have any source of positive emotions

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:14.440
in your life, you can become too heavy of a burden.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.840
Yeah, which I think this leads us to,

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.600
well, I think it's a really important fact, right?

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.920
That there are some people,

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.160
like a significant subset of people

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.960
who get happier as they get older.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.600
They have more contentment, a stronger sense of self.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.760
You might think, how could that ever happen, right?

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.560
Like we're getting closer to death,

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.360
we're accumulating insults, right?

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.680
Like everything hurts a little bit more

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.560
and we have less energy and we accumulate losses and traumas.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.960
Why would anyone be healthier across time,

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:43.720
if you're happier across time?

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.160
And what we see is it's linked to the things

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.360
that we're talking about, right?

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.200
It's linked to say, let's say vulnerability versus pride.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.520
Like there's a good balance there, right?

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.400
There's a lot of humility, there's a lot of self-esteem.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.560
The person is spending a lot of time standing back

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.960
from the tapestry and looking at it, right?

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.800
And what can come into people

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.560
is in sort of a sense of equanimity.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.560
Like I sort of understand, you know,

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.680
I'm being the best person I can be, you know,

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.520
and that's not always even great.

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.280
And there are things that I don't feel great about

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.600
even while I'm trying to do that.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.880
But look, I'm being who I'm choosing to be, right?

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.640
And that doesn't have to be in some big way.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.280
I'm not saying that means any one specific thing.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.280
You know, that can mean the person

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.680
who's taking care of their cat and tending their garden.

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.840
Like that's enough.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.520
We have to have, you know, love the ability

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.440
to put good things out in the world, right?

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:34.480
And to put our ability to work and be,

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.360
to make things different out into the world

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.580
and make things better.

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:41.000
And if we're doing that, we get happier across time

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.480
because we come to a sense of peace with ourselves.

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.720
I'm not supposed to be everything.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.880
I'm not supposed to do everything.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.920
I'm not supposed to fix everything, right?

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.600
I'm also not supposed to suffer all the time

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.480
for the things I haven't gotten, right?

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.480
You know what?

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.320
I guess I'm kind of, and it leads back to Winnicott, right?

01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.960
The British physician, you know, I'm good enough.

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.360
And that seems to help people feel happy, you know,

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.480
contentment and be generative and productive

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.400
into later life.

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.000
It's like, that's what we all should be wanting.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.720
But it's even, it's kind of an afterthought though.

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.520
Some people are like that as opposed to,

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.600
wait a second, right?

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.840
Like, what's going on with them?

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.160
And let's do all of that.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.600
Albert Camus writes in Mythocisophus, quote,

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.200
there's only one real serious philosophical problem

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.240
and that is suicide.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.920
Deciding whether or not life is worth living

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.640
is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.640
All other questions follow from that.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.320
So basically, to be or not to be.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.120
Do you think there's a truth to that statement?

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.920
This question of why live at all?

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.920
Do you think there's truth to that statement

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.480
being a really, really important question for us to answer?

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.520
Yes.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.360
Yes.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.840
And what's the answer?

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.760
I think the answer is yes.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.760
And I think Camus answered it.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.840
Yes, too.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.040
You know, I love his writing and,

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:12.040
you know, I think there was a streak of nihilism

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.400
that I think grew in his writing over the years

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.320
and the thought is, I think that Camus died by suicide.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.560
I think we're not sure of that because it was a car accident.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.400
But I've always read that as the primary scholarly opinion.

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.960
And I think it's interesting that after his death,

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.760
a book called The First Man was published,

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.760
which I don't know if he had intended to publish.

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.280
I don't remember the specifics about it,

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.560
but it's about him as a child, right?

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.000
And it's interesting, The First Man,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.320
even he was the first man in his existence, right?

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.240
The most, you know, the one that felt and experienced

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:47.640
everything and there's sadness and distress

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.840
and all in that book, but there's a beauty of life

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.320
and living and experience.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.800
And I think to compare that beauty, like that's life,

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.880
even if something's difficult and scary and sad,

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.480
like there's something beautiful around the corner

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.840
and he's a kind person in the new discovery.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.240
You know, more what was in him as a child.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.960
And I think that we can get jaded as we get.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:09.520
As you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago,

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.200
we can accentuate the negative and foster the negative

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.960
and come to a place where we're looking for

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.520
some in-depth philosophical answer, you know,

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.360
some thick book, you know, that's gonna explain all that

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.920
to us instead of the simplicity

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.640
that we've been talking about.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.640
I think humility, gratitude helps us have just simple,

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.480
positive experiences, feelings of contentment,

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.320
feelings of connection with another person,

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.680
learning, discovery.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.280
And I think the answer to Keimu's question is yes.

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.320
And I think it lies in his writing about when he was a child,

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.960
which I think he saw as less important

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.800
than his later writings and the intellectual heaviness

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.360
when I think maybe he had lost his way a little bit

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.880
from the things he understood when he was younger.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.880
So another way to talk about it,

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.760
and I'd love to hear what you think is

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.480
about these broad categories.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.360
Let me be started with Kierkegaard

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.000
of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.200
And I think Keimu considered himself an absurdist,

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.800
not actually an existentialist.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:16.880
It's kind of a middle ground where I think existentialist,

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.120
I don't wanna characterize it in the wrong way

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.520
and there's a lot of different definitions,

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.160
but I think existentialists ultimately do think

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.320
that there is meaning in sort of pursuing

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.360
the passion of life, like pursuing the mode,

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.240
like in living life, that's where you discover the meaning

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.680
at that individual level of fully embracing life.

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.080
And I think sort of nihilism is again,

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.080
it's kind of like a spectrum,

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:52.040
but nihilism basically says there's no meaning

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.600
and it doesn't matter, nothing matters.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:00.920
I don't even know, but somehow that lands you in a place

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.920
that's totally uninspired.

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:05.560
Maybe nihilists would disagree with that.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.320
Maybe there's a way to live a creative life

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.280
in a nihilistic mindset.

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.560
And I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.560
where pursuing meaning at all is not a good idea.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.960
So kind of, I think existentialists say

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.600
you should be looking for meaning

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:28.120
and it's to be discovered in your own actions,

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.200
in your own life in the moment.

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.480
And absurdism says life is absurd, nothing makes sense.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.640
Don't look for the meaning, just live, just be.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:42.640
I think that's kind of the later Camus kind of philosophy.

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.360
I don't know if you can sort of comment

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.400
on these kind of nuanced ideas here

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.400
if there is no religious guide to your life.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.860
What do you think about this kind of search for meaning?

01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:58.520
Do you see that there's some wisdom

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.680
in the existentialist perspective of discovering it

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.760
in your own life and this passion

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.280
and this kind of day-to-day existence

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.200
in the moments of your life that bring you joy,

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.040
that kind of thing.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.800
Bringing different sort of perspectives

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.240
and trying to tease apart like, well, wait,

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.520
what are the differences in those perspectives?

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.120
And I think what it points out is that,

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.800
okay, we tend to conflate things as human beings

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.160
and to take two different things

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.760
and try and make them into one.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.880
But we also, I think on the other end of the spectrum

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.040
get very overly reductionist.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.400
And I think that when we get to overly reductionist,

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.440
we lose the ability to learn from anything

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.480
or to generate meaning, right?

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.080
I mean, the thing about Sartre,

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.200
who is the thought of existentialism

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.680
is so consistent with him, right?

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.200
Who on the one hand, wrote about very clear terms,

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.680
like this is what it is and this is what it isn't.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.040
And here's how you're gonna make your meaning

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.840
in a very like academically proscribed way.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.400
But he also wrote short stories like The Wall, right?

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.960
Where there's something totally absurd happens, right?

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.440
As part of the story, right?

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.800
So I think what ends up happening

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.320
is people either reduce themselves

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.240
or get associated with something

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.240
that by being overly reductionist

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.000
takes us away from meaning, right?

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.720
The idea that, look, we don't know

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.320
if there is an overarching religious meaning

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.720
or what we call a religious meaning or purpose.

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.920
Like we don't know that, right?

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.800
So, okay, if we take that as a given

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.560
that people who say that they know are having faith,

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.160
like Al Spinoza described faith, right?

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.200
Faith is that you don't know, but you believe anyway, right?

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:30.840
It's not because you have faith now you know something, right?

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.920
Because I think that's a slippery slope

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:35.280
to the persecution of others, right?

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.600
So if we say, okay, we don't know,

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.440
then, you know, we're left either deciding,

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.760
okay, well then the hell with everything, you know?

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.320
Like there's that movie, a strange brew, right?

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.920
That Bob and Doug McKenzie were like,

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.600
the brakes don't work on the car.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.160
And one of them says, oh, why bother steering, right?

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.680
So if we don't know that there's meaning,

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.520
like why bother steering?

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.000
Let's just give up the ghost, right?

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.240
And I don't think that's even what the nihilist said.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.880
I mean, I think the Coonan said,

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.800
we should get rid of everything that we've ever created

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.600
except Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.240
and start over from there.

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.360
But so even people who are very nihilistic

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.120
or associated with that,

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.600
a lot of them were just not liking what we had built, right?

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.760
So if we accept that a lot of what we have built

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.800
as humans inside of us and outside of us

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.080
is really counterproductive and doesn't help us.

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:23.160
And that absurd things happen in the world, right?

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:26.200
And that often the way social structures and systems build up,

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.080
you build themselves up is absurd.

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.160
I think our healthcare system operates

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.160
in a way that's absurd, right?

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.560
So if we accept that there are absurdities

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.640
that we don't know if there's truth,

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.840
then what are we left with?

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:40.840
But like, well, let's try and make meaning, right?

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.760
Or Tega Igasset said,

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.840
yoso yo e mi circunstancia, right?

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.920
I'm myself in my circumstances, right?

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.240
He was like, look, we can't control everything.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.000
We live in circumstances around us,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.120
but within those circumstances,

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.080
we can make decisions and define ourselves.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.760
And I think the brilliance of that,

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.920
and I think tying it all together, right?

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.160
In a way that's not trying to be,

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.360
in a sense it ties it all together

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.280
by not trying to answer everything concisely,

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.960
that yes, we can make meaning.

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.600
Like we see that if someone trips in front of me,

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.440
I could walk around them or I could help them up.

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:17.840
I mean, no one can tell me that it doesn't matter what I do.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.960
I absolutely reject the idea that,

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.280
oh, I could step over them or on them,

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.120
or I could help them up and it doesn't matter.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.360
Oh yeah, try being the person on the ground, right?

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.600
So we create meaning, but we live in our circumstances

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.200
and there are absurdities both within us

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.480
and outside of us in our social structures.

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.400
And there are a lot of things

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:40.080
that pretend to have meaning that don't.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.120
And there's the shades of nihilism,

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.360
but ultimately there's something going on here

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.640
that's doing the best we can

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.440
in the context of just not knowing.

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.600
Yeah, I tend to see, I don't know if it's genetic,

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.880
I tend to think just observing the internet,

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.400
the number of memes there are.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.960
I think many other people are like me.

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.000
I tend to see the humor in the absurdity.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.400
I see the Kafkaesque nature of society,

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.960
different aspects of society,

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.400
and just kind of notice the magic with a smile.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.880
And just laugh at the circus of it all.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.000
Cause it is magical that the circus all comes together.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.160
It's like a little bit out of sync

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.440
and then just a guy playing trombone,

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.360
but like overall it's pretty good.

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.400
It's pretty good.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:28.400
And we can look at that and just kind of marvel go, huh.

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.560
Which I think is a relation to at least a lot of what we

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.680
in the Western world think of as Eastern,

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.400
is like as non-attachment, right?

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.640
Because then if there's something absurd,

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.320
and it's like not good for me,

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.640
then I accept that too,

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.000
instead of getting angry about it,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:44.840
and railing about it,

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.160
or seeing some cosmic meaning in it, right?

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.120
I think there's also a healthy non-attachment

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.640
in what you're saying too.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:53.440
So there's a, I mean, you mentioned Eastern thought.

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.760
There's, just to ask in each year,

01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.480
but also Buddha have kind of spoke of life as suffering.

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.020
Do you think there's truth to that?

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:06.120
That suffering is a fundamental part of life.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.680
I think it is a fundamental part of life.

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:11.840
I don't think that means that life is suffering, right?

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.800
If we say, well, life is suffering, then what am I doing?

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.760
That I'm trying to erase from my mind

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.480
like the birth of my children, right?

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.760
Things that were filled with joy, right?

01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.520
Like life is not entirely suffering,

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:26.080
but life brings a lot of suffering.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.000
And for some people,

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.720
it brings such disproportionate suffering

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.520
and the people don't survive the suffering.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.680
And I think when people are conscientious and empathic,

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.800
that really bothers us, right?

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.080
The suffering in our own lives

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.240
and the fact that others at times could,

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.480
could it seem to be so overwhelmed by suffering

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.120
that they don't even get a chance to see good.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.600
And I think that there's,

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.120
I do think there's truth to that

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.360
and there's sadness and distress to that,

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.960
but to say therefore life is suffering,

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.880
I think is completely untrue.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.000
And, you know, it ignores the fact

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.600
that someone even made a trombone, right?

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.240
Let alone that there's a little bit out of sync

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.520
and someone's playing the trombone, like that's cool.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.400
There's, you know, there's elements of the absurd

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.040
that you said are neat and interesting.

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.680
And if we start accepting that we can't understand

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.120
or control everything,

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.200
then we can accept and I think really love

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.520
and foster the beauty in our lives.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.560
Yeah, I think the word suffering

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:24.120
is doing a little bit too much work.

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.320
Because I think it's probably referring

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:28.000
to the philosophical concept of that,

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.880
yeah, there's the absurd, the absurdity.

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:32.720
Right.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.880
That stuff just happens randomly.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.920
Evil people succeed, good people fail.

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:41.560
There's a seeming random injustice on occasion.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.400
Right.

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:44.680
And on occasion there's justice in,

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.280
yeah, all of it that feels like,

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.960
and maybe because often there's a lot of loss

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:57.960
and then there's a kind of matching complimentary aspect

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:02.640
to any good feeling that all comes crashing down,

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.200
like every hello.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.080
From a physics perspective, ends in a goodbye.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.800
That's a really sad thing,

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.800
like of all the amazing people I get to meet in my life,

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:23.560
all the amazing experiences eventually they have to end.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.200
And that's part of what makes them amazing.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.840
But why is that sad?

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:30.360
Is it because we're taught to think that it's like,

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360
look, at some point you and I are gonna say goodbye today.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.840
Like I hope we're richer for it.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.760
And then we take that goodness off with us.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.200
Like I wanna celebrate that

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.880
because it's all part of the goodness.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.680
I think we're taught to think, oh, that's so bad.

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.720
And it equates to death and misery.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.480
And I think it's often not that way.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.680
I think there is a sadness too,

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.440
but I also don't think that sadness is a negative thing.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.320
It's a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320
So there's a melancholic nature to it,

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.200
there's something passing of it leaving.

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.640
I think it's that old Louis C.K. thing

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.080
that I go back to over and over from his show, Louis,

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.200
where he was all heartbroken,

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:16.200
that he just broke up with somebody he loved.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.000
And he told about that to an old man.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.720
And the old man said, you're a fool.

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.920
That's the best part.

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:26.560
I miss that part where you sort of are lingering

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.000
in that loss, you're feeling the pain of that loss.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.240
Because that lasts the longer, it's the most intense,

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.760
it's the most reliable.

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.040
And it's the kind of celebration of the love you had.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.760
Like losing the love is still a celebration of the love.

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.960
I think you don't wanna over romanticize that,

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.280
but there's some aspect of truth to that.

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.920
Like that melancholic feeling of remembering

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:54.720
a beautiful time that's no longer there

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:57.360
is a kind of celebration of it.

01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.360
And is a kind of joyful experience,

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:04.360
even though it's very easy to experience it

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.280
as a negative emotion.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.560
I think it's just like you said,

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.440
I mean, it's up to our mind to determine

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.320
how that emotions really felt.

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.440
But it's a tricky one,

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.280
because it's like heartbreak to experience that

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.400
as a positive thing.

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.120
People can reminisce at funerals, right?

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.800
And laugh, because people can be very, very, very sad

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:23.240
and perceive that this person has died

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.040
and perceive the sadness of it.

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.000
But in perceiving that and really living in it,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.840
then you can have people who wanna remember that person

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.680
by like telling a funny story.

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.520
Why?

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.320
Because each of those people carries that with them.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.080
So I think what you're saying is consistent

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.320
with healthy function as human beings,

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.440
because we're gonna encounter sadness and loss.

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.400
Like what do we do with that, right?

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.280
And do we do things that ultimately create some redemption

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.560
or even reparation inside of us?

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.400
And like reparation is a big word in psychology, right?

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.200
It's how we repair damage and loss.

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.320
So if we lose someone and we're sad,

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.800
can we by telling funny stories

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.440
about that person remind ourselves

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:01.760
that, hey, they're still inside of us,

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.360
whether they're out there looking at me, I don't know,

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.760
but I can call that person to mind inside of us.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.280
And then we have something that's good and beautiful

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.440
that comes of that too.

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.280
In the introduction to your book on trauma,

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.120
Lady Gaga wrote it, she wrote the forward the intro.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.520
She said this about you, quote,

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.520
I can now say with certainty

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.280
that this man saved my life.

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.160
He made life worth living.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.160
This goes to our discussion about

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.400
the the myth of Sisyphus Kamu question about why I live.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.600
So I think at least to me,

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.160
she's one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:47.400
So it's a difficult question, but a question of creativity.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.560
What role does trauma play

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.720
in somebody like that, in this artist

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.840
that has created some incredible things?

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.840
What positive, constructive role does trauma serve

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.160
and what limiting role does it serve

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.960
in preventing that person from flourishing more?

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.720
Trauma can certainly drive us to creativity, right?

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.960
To even to push against or to protest against

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.080
what the trauma tells us.

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.280
Trauma tells us lessons like nothing matters

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.720
and you don't matter and nothing will ever be good

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:27.400
and then nothing is beautiful

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.000
and we can push against trauma.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.240
They know there is life in me.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.600
There's something, there's goodness for me

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.520
to spread in the world, to express and spread.

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.760
So I think trauma fuels creativity in many, many, many ways.

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.320
Trauma also shuts down creativity, right?

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.400
To people who are, for one example,

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:47.440
trauma that escalates to the point

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.960
where now the person is soothing it with alcohol,

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.560
one example, and now the impact of the alcohol

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.040
shuts down any creativity.

01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:58.680
So can people be creative and outward thinking without trauma?

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.640
I think sometimes, if I remember correctly,

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.720
people will use Immanuel Kant as an example,

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.360
someone I think hadn't traveled much,

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.040
didn't have trauma and like look at what he knew.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.960
So okay, there are gonna be exceptions, right?

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:11.840
But a lot of our creativity is in some ways

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.400
fueled by our suffering,

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.840
although it's complicated

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.120
because it comes from generative places in us, right?

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.280
So those places are there,

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.080
they're not created by suffering,

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.800
but maybe suffering makes an incentive

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.960
or a passion inside of us.

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.440
And a person, Stephanie, who you referred to

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:33.180
is just such an incredible astounding creative force.

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.200
And sure, some of that comes from trauma,

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.940
some of it comes from trauma fueling

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:40.640
the generative creative places in her.

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.040
But what I helped her to do,

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.640
she's very generous with her words,

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.640
but what I helped her to do was to see all that she is

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:51.160
and all that the creativity in her is

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:56.160
and all that there is to create through love and caring

01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:00.720
and compassion and to again see that.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:03.320
I mean, a lot of time that's what I'm doing clinically.

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:04.720
I think it's what good psychiatrists

01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.680
or mental health professionals do is

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:09.680
we help people see the beauty that is there, right?

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.120
Because oftentimes we're way too close up to that tapestry.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.760
And what brings us close is often the sad thing.

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:18.360
So we're up close and all we see is the negative.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.200
I mean, it's easy then to get classically nihilistic,

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.760
but by helping someone take a step back

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.680
and to see who they are and what's in them,

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.320
that's how people get better

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:31.360
and it's how people re-engage in life.

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.360
It's such a difficult thing

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:38.160
because if you were to, from studying human beings,

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.600
it seems like the optimal trajectory

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.840
is having some trauma that doesn't destroy you

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.480
that forces you early in life to really struggle

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.920
with the intricacies of the human condition.

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:56.480
And then later in life, as you form

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:59.880
and like you build an expertise around in mastery,

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.200
start to do exactly what you said,

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.560
which is step back and look at the tapestry.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:08.560
So if you don't have the trauma,

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.680
it seems like just empirically speaking,

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.600
there's of course just a huge amount of data

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.360
and all kinds of anecdotal evidence,

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.880
but I'm gonna be careful here

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:22.600
because maybe I'm romanticizing hardship,

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.880
but it does seem that hardship in childhood,

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.480
if it doesn't break you, can be constructive.

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:31.440
It's like you said, having that trauma,

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:33.880
one of the ways to fight it is to say,

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.360
I am worth something, I am,

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.920
and this is, David Gages talks about this,

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:45.920
it's like, I am somebody, I can't be somebody special

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.640
and I'm gonna prove it to you, I'm gonna do this,

01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:49.920
I'm gonna do this big thing,

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.240
it's this engine that drives you forward.

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:56.440
Yeah, comment on that because from a parent's perspective,

01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:01.440
you want a child to have an easy life, right?

01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:05.280
You want them to not have hardship,

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:09.400
certainly not have trauma, but that's such a difficult dance

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:13.440
because in some ways, a little bit of hardship

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.320
and a gradually increasing amount of hardship

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.760
that doesn't break you can really develop you

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:23.800
into a really interesting, complicated person

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.680
and it helps you flourish as a creative being.

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:29.120
I don't know if there's a question there,

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.080
I just keep saying random things.

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.680
No, it makes, look, I think it makes good sense to me,

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.080
I think you're trying to get at,

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:39.840
look, we need trauma and how are we defining it, right?

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.880
Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties,

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:45.840
I mean, we could set aside, we could set apart,

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.040
say, and differentiate things that are difficult

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:51.160
but that are overcomeable, right?

01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:53.800
Versus things that we could use trauma,

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:56.200
the word trauma this way, if we chose to,

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.000
that are just entirely negative,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.240
like someone saying, oh, you can't do that

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.840
and you'll never succeed because,

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.720
well, and then they tell you something about yourself,

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:06.560
because you're from here

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.680
or you're this race, religion, whatever it is, right?

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:11.480
We say, well, you know, that could make someone say,

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.800
hey, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna overcome, right?

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.920
But then they're overcoming something bad, right?

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.320
Like it's just like, there's nothing good

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.560
or helpful about that, right?

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.400
If someone's saying that,

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.160
so the person has to overcome it.

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.120
That's different than something

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:26.200
that is placed in front of a person

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:31.200
where the whole conception of it is something positive

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.320
that you can make through effort, right?

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.520
So, you know, I remember, I don't know,

01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.600
I think I was 15 years old, there was some rule

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.240
like where you could then go,

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.440
I don't think it was picking raspberries or blueberries, right?

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.400
And I think, and my parents wanted me to see, like,

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.960
okay, go see how that works as you.

01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.920
And now you got 50 cents at the end of it, right?

01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:49.760
And then you think about that when, you know,

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:52.600
you wanna buy baseball cars or you think about it

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.560
and you work hard and I could remember like it was hard

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.040
and I was sweating and I was tired and,

01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.280
but I learned from it.

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.880
I mean, it's the reason I remember it today.

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:03.720
So, yes, parents might want their kids to have like

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.560
a good life, right?

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.640
But not necessarily an easy life, you know?

01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:09.000
And I think that was done,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.440
they took me to do that to,

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.160
so I had a greater sense of responsibility

01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:14.080
in a sense of like hard work is meaningful

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:14.920
and it's important.

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.320
And I think that that kind of thing is good,

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:20.400
but if we separate that from something

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:22.560
that's just denigrating, prejudicial,

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.400
like I think those things aren't good,

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.760
but they're unavoidable.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.400
So it's not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.680
I would look at it more that some trauma is unavoidable.

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.400
I mean, it's hard to go, how do you go through life

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:36.400
and not have any losses or anything negative

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.080
or anything sad.

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.080
And then people are people,

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:41.080
there may be people who have not a lot of that

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:42.840
and then there's a sort of complacency

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:44.840
and they don't do it as much as they could

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.200
or feel as good as they could.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.360
You know, then there's other people

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:49.080
who have a highly attuned emotional,

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.400
is there people with very highly attuned emotional compasses

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:56.000
for which a little bit of trauma becomes so intrusive.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.360
So it's so much of it is person driven,

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.200
but I do want to distinguish between things

01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:03.160
that are just purely bad that we might overcome

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.840
or find some fire in our belly about

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.320
or whatever the case may be.

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.760
And things that may be boundaries or barriers

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.880
either directly purposely placed or not,

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.280
that in a sense, invite us or inform us

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.560
of the possibility of striving and overcoming.

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:20.640
Finally, in tuned emotional compasses,

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.960
it's so true that there is, that's a component of it too.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.960
It's, there's almost genetic,

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.400
how sensitive you are to particular trauma.

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.680
So little things can have a huge impact

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.320
or gigantic things, serious abuse in childhood

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.960
can be by some people overcome more easily.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:42.480
It's not just what's the trauma.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:44.800
It's what's the trauma that makes certain problems.

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.760
You have to match the trauma to the person.

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.680
And a big part of what you're matching to is that,

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.480
you know, genetically based characteristic

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.880
of how finely attuned is that empathic attunement

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:55.720
to that compass.

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.840
So when you think about, just return to childhood,

01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.840
when you think about trauma and childhood,

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.840
what can we say about the impact of child abuse

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:13.280
on the development of a human being?

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:18.280
I think the impact of it is so disproportionately bad

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.960
and hurtful compared to things that happen

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.560
when we're not children.

01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.960
And I wanna be very careful about how I'm saying that

01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:33.320
because people can, through their strength

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:36.800
and resilience and human interconnectedness

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.200
can overcome that.

01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:42.200
I don't mean to say that anyone who's experienced

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:45.960
those things is can't make it through it or over it.

01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.120
That part is not true.

01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:51.880
But it is true that the impact is so disproportionate

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:53.560
to anything else that can happen

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.920
because the brain is formulating, right?

01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:00.760
So if we say psychology is like applied neurobiology, right?

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:05.760
And we look at both of those as different ends, right?

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.840
Even though there's a lot of gray in the middle,

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:10.480
you know, the neurobiology is changed.

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.160
So just one example of a much greater salience

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:20.160
of vigilance mechanisms, of mechanisms of self-protection,

01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:24.720
mechanisms that can make a person feel more fear

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.600
and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:28.960
and not trust the world.

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:31.600
And I mean, I mean, not trust the world even enough

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.600
that, oh, I'd like to have a better job

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.560
and another one is here that I could take,

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.280
but maybe it could be worse.

01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.920
You know, and then being afraid of that, right?

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.520
Like there are all sorts of ways

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.000
in which the changes to those pathways impact someone.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.960
And that's just one of, you know,

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:49.760
we could bring trauma experts together

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.440
that could talk about that for days, right?

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.080
Like what is the impact upon the brain biology?

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.680
So that then gets changed inside the person.

01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:00.080
And from the perspective of those changes,

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:01.920
the psychology on top of it changes.

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:03.320
Like what do I think about myself?

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.000
Do I think that I'm worthwhile?

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.680
You know, even in my mid-20s,

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:10.040
after, you know, without formative traumas

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:13.080
and a pretty strong sense of self and some achievements,

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:16.160
there's a big trauma then with the death of my brother

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.240
and I start questioning, am I cursed?

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.520
Am I worth anything?

02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.960
I mean, I was 20-something years old

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:23.800
and doing reasonably well at the time.

02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.800
You know, how does this impact a child of six, seven,

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.840
10, 12 years old, right?

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.360
We're sending such powerful messages

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.440
that then change conception of self

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.880
and that negatively change conception

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.440
sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology.

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.400
And I think if we really thought,

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.880
hey, let's do the best we can just for humans in general,

02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.800
for the human race, for our species in general,

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.080
is we would handle children

02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.240
and caring for children so much differently

02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:57.600
in terms of protection mechanisms, intervention mechanisms.

02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.120
How many times do you see where,

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.400
where like there's now there's been some tragedy

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.560
and the child gets a little bit of support

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:06.120
and you know, they had some therapy, you know,

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.920
that was provided by some insurance carrier,

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:12.720
you know, that they got once a week for 16 weeks or whatever.

02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:16.600
I mean, we should be wrapping our societal resources

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.440
around children, but we don't use our resources well.

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.280
You know, I was just reading,

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:22.200
it's a little bit of an aside,

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:26.040
but about 300 and something billion dollars a year

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.480
in cost to the U.S. economy, just from schizophrenia.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:33.720
And you think, and it cost a fraction,

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.120
what do we actually put into caring for people

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.400
who have schizophrenia?

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.760
So first there's a moral imperative,

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.200
but let's say we put that aside

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.920
and we only care about the economy, right?

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:46.080
Because there are mechanisms of thinking

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:46.920
that look at it that way.

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.600
How could we not amend that, right?

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.600
But we are so reckless with our resources

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.400
and we're tripping ahead of ourselves

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.320
that we don't think, oh my goodness,

02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.560
there is no better place on God's earth for prevention

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.960
than here, prevention in terms of human suffering

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:05.280
and also where do people like that go?

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.320
I mean, more often people like that

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:09.000
go to a place of increased suffering,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.680
inability to take care of themselves

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:13.400
or to be in supportive relationships.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.680
Okay, we know there's a higher prevalence of that,

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.160
but we're also creating the pool of people

02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:21.680
through which the envy, the narcissism,

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:24.880
the sociopathy, the destruction arises.

02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:27.000
So again, if we care about people,

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.440
we would be so focused on that.

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:31.240
If we don't care about other people

02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.200
and just ourselves or just economic costs,

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.880
we would still be so focused,

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.560
but we're not and we tend to just kind of call it good

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:41.440
because we don't see anything disastrous happening

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.280
at the moment.

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.760
And I think there's a societal negligence there

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:47.360
to the shame really of all of us

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.480
when child abuse and the impact neurobiologically

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:56.040
and psychologically is potentially the greatest cause

02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:57.880
of suffering directly and indirectly

02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:59.160
on the face of the planet.

02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:04.840
How much this trauma of that kind

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.840
and later in life affect your ability

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.960
to love another human being,

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.840
say inside a relationship,

02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:13.400
connect with another human being?

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.880
It can impact it a lot.

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.160
And I wanna say, can people overcome

02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:20.800
and be as loving to a partner or a child or anyone else?

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.800
Yes, but we're talking across society,

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:25.720
how are we setting the odds, right?

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:29.160
We're setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance,

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.680
a decreased sense of self-confidence,

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.280
an increased sense of vulnerability, right?

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.680
Decrease comfort interacting with others, right?

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.320
What we're doing is we're pushing towards isolation

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:41.840
and misery and depression and resentment.

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.440
I mean, those factors push towards that.

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.560
We know that the research is so strong

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:49.200
that adverse childhood experiences

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:50.840
of these things that happen,

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.600
the more the worse, the more prolonged,

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.040
the more that person is up against

02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.440
as they try and navigate life.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.280
And I suppose one of the elements of intimacy

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:06.480
like what we're talking about is vulnerability.

02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:11.480
And maybe there's a, is there a fear of being vulnerable,

02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:14.280
of being hurt again?

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.360
Is that ultimately the barrier to intimacy?

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.280
Yeah, if you're taught a lesson that says

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:21.480
the world is not safe

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:24.320
and you're not good enough for someone to keep safe

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:27.320
and you're not strong enough to keep yourself safe,

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.920
that's a final common pathway

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.920
of the vast majority of child abuse

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.160
or as it's telling those lessons to people,

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.720
then how can that not change the lay of the land

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.840
against openness, against the ability

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.440
to rationally consider trust and mutuality

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.600
and to protect oneself, but also take chances

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.920
and do the things that we have to do

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:52.800
to create the greatest happiness in our lives.

02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:56.160
We set the odds so much against them.

02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:00.360
There's another pathway which I think is really interesting

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:04.240
because I've seen it in people is this kind of ability

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:08.840
to detach yourself from feeling any emotions

02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:11.640
to like protect yourself.

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:14.280
It's almost like you're not quite there.

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.440
Yeah, there's a word for this, isolation of affect.

02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:17.880
This is a defense mechanism.

02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.160
Yeah. Isolation of affect.

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.400
Is that a common way,

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:25.040
another common way to deal with trauma?

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.480
Well, isolation of affect can cut both ways.

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.040
So if there's been a major trauma,

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.120
let's say someone has seen something terrible

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.920
and they're isolated from their affect

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.160
and at one time it was thought,

02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.400
well, maybe that's good, right?

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.600
They're not hysterical, they're not distraught,

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:42.480
but we see that is not good, right?

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:46.960
Because what needs to be beheld, processed,

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:49.080
we need to get our arms around in some way, shape, or form

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.520
has just been separated off, right?

02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.800
So we know that is not good, right?

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:57.840
But isolation of affect can also serve us very well.

02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:01.080
And when I think back to being an intern,

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:02.400
medical intern in the hospital,

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:06.920
and you might have to go and pronounce someone dead

02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:11.200
with hysterical family members.

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.920
And then 10 minutes later, five minutes later,

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.120
maybe two minutes later, really,

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.280
you have to go to another room

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:22.800
and you've got to maybe do some procedure that involves

02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:25.320
having your focus on a certain thing

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.320
and making sure your hand movements are the right way

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:31.040
or talking to a person in a way that's very different

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.120
than where you just came from, that's very hopeful.

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.560
And so then you have to isolate the affect

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:36.960
of what's going on around you.

02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.000
And it happens not just in, it's just one example,

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.960
but we have to do it in life

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:45.840
so that we can put affect aside to process later

02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.280
or not feel the full weight of affect

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:49.480
where we know the meaning,

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:51.040
like I know the meaning of the tragedy

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.040
of the person I just pronounced dead,

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.760
but I wanna separate that for myself

02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:56.760
because I'm also aware that it's not my tragedy

02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.320
so that I can then, okay, put that affect aside

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:01.040
and go do the next thing that I have to do.

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.580
So that I think can cut both ways.

02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:08.440
Right, but then you have to reattach it,

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:11.360
understand that it's good to be close with emotion,

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:14.520
even painful emotion, right?

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.480
Because that's the human experience.

02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:20.320
It's, I feel like if you build up a skill

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.760
that you can detach yourself from emotion,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.280
I think that can become its own kind of addictive quality.

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.280
It can become too easy to do it, right?

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:33.360
And to reinforce, that's when people are suffering too much

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.800
over too long a period of time,

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.400
then we're creatures of habit, right?

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.200
And even though our brains are,

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:42.120
you can talk about our brains are sitting on the shoulders

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.080
of the giant of the maybe 1,000 levels of emergence

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:47.720
that come underneath of them.

02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:52.000
Our brains are also working very simple habit-based ways.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.240
Like if you and I chose a word right now

02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:56.880
and said it 500 times, we would know.

02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:58.380
It's just a silly experiment,

02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:01.120
but we'd both be saying it tonight, right?

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:03.600
Because our brains are also creatures of habit.

02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.580
So if you over and over and over have to isolate yourself

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:09.720
from affect and you develop those mechanisms,

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:11.560
well, you develop those mechanisms

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.720
then they don't go away any easier

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:17.240
than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.

02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:19.240
We won't forget no matter what we decided.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.080
So how do we find our way back?

02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:27.280
How do we overcome trauma?

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:28.520
What are the different pathways?

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:30.640
The first thing, the very first thing

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:35.640
is to acknowledge to ourselves and often to others,

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:37.760
which might be one other person, it might be in words,

02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:42.400
spoken, it might be written, what the trauma has been, right?

02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.400
Because the lessons of trauma, the evil lessons of trauma.

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:49.640
I'll use the example of my own life,

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:54.360
the lesson that told me that I was shameful,

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.760
cursed and hopeless, right?

02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.760
It's a very evil lesson, right?

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.360
But my brain will say it over and did say it

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.200
over and over and over to me.

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.520
And if that just sits inside,

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:09.000
that's how trauma festers,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.360
that's how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions.

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:16.080
So being able to say to ourselves and to another,

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.560
like this is what's happened, right?

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:19.640
Okay, this is what's happened.

02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:22.600
We're built to massage words

02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:24.400
and to create meaning through words, right?

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.040
Like we don't massage pictures, right?

02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:29.160
Images, we talk and massage meaning with words.

02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:31.960
So when I finally went to see a therapist

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.880
and I could say, you know,

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.240
my brother, whatever words I would have said,

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:43.240
like he killed himself and I can't accept it

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:45.600
or I can't imagine it and like I let it happen.

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.440
Like, so I had to say those things, right?

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:51.720
So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it,

02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.560
you know, and I think it was a long time ago

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.200
but the therapist probably said something like,

02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.440
okay, probably sees on you, you let it happen.

02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.280
It's your fault, right?

02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.000
Because you got to get at those things

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.760
so that one can begin to bring into focus

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.000
what does the trauma mean and what does it not mean?

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.160
I mean, a classic example is that,

02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:11.000
what would you say to someone else example?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.560
You know, you'll say, well, I,

02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.160
how many times have I,

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:16.440
it's just, I could cry if I stop and think about it enough.

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.000
You have to stop and talk to someone

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.320
who is sexually assaulted through no fault of their own

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:22.880
who comes in and tells the story,

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.080
they've been telling themselves about how it's their fault.

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:26.240
They should have walked home a different way,

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.120
they should have addressed differently,

02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:28.680
they should have left it earlier, right?

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.520
I wrote about it in the book over and over and over.

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:34.160
And they have a person who,

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.280
let's say you take a person who's intelligent,

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.960
engage in the world who's like capable

02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.760
of understanding lots and lots and lots of things,

02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:42.280
but doesn't understand that, right?

02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:43.120
If it were someone else,

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.360
that person would understand in a moment,

02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:45.600
that's not that person's fault, right?

02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:48.760
So, what you want to do is overcome the fact

02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:50.160
that the negative emotions,

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:52.840
that the hijacked emotion systems of trauma

02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:54.720
are telling that person a lie

02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:59.480
and they're telling them so strongly and so awfully,

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:02.440
so meanly that the person just takes it inside

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.600
and starts to see it as true, right?

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:07.720
So, you begin to hold that up to the light of day.

02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:09.560
And again, one example could be, okay,

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:11.960
so someone, the person who's coming in next

02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:13.640
has actually been through something similar, right?

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:17.920
And can you stay and just tell her how it's her fault, right?

02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:20.280
And like, oh my God, no, I could never,

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.000
like then they see, right?

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.800
I mean, again, this is not always how you do it,

02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.040
but sometimes you can get a person to see like,

02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:28.400
well, that would be the most horrible.

02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:29.640
How could you do that?

02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:31.040
Right, and the person can maybe commit,

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.040
they're doing it to themselves.

02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.480
So, you begin to put words in a structure and say,

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:38.440
okay, let's look at what's going on inside of you.

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:39.640
You don't have to be scared of anything

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:40.680
you're thinking and feeling.

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:43.920
In fact, the fear is in not exposing it

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:44.920
to the light of day.

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:46.680
That's where it gets the best of us.

02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:48.880
And now, like everything is different.

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:51.720
And whether that involves use of medications

02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:53.960
for intrusive thoughts and depression,

02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.160
or there's no medicines needed, but it's all reframing,

02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:58.840
whatever it may be that comes next,

02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:00.800
the whole world has changed

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.160
when the person has acknowledged what's happened,

02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:08.000
exposed it to themselves and to trust it,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.520
others around them and begun to look at it in some way,

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:16.160
other than the stuff in an evil box place

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.680
that the trauma initially puts us through our,

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:20.520
the reflexes it creates in us.

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:22.080
It's interesting that there's powers

02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:23.640
that you're saying it out loud.

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:24.600
Right.

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:28.520
So first saying your perception of it out loud,

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:31.120
other than in that case, that might be your fault.

02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.920
And then working through out loud,

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:37.600
working through that it may not be.

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.640
Any experienced therapist will tell you this,

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:43.040
that every now and then it will happen

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:46.680
that someone will come and they'll say something.

02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:48.760
Usually it's very early on in the process,

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.640
they'll say something they've never said before,

02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:55.000
and they immediately are in an entirely different place

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.160
and they may have been for decades, right?

02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:59.000
And I can remember a person saying

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.920
that the coach had raped him and just saying it.

02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.920
This was decades before and everything was different.

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:08.800
I'm not saying everything is now as perfect,

02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:10.000
but his life was in a different way.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.760
As soon as he said it, he could see how daily he thought

02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:15.240
that person did that to this child.

02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:16.480
The child was me.

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:18.560
He'd never thought it until he said it out loud

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.040
because his mind was going over and over

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:22.720
with why it was his fault, what he did to deserve it,

02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.920
how he kept going back, so it must be his fault.

02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:28.080
It was as soon as he put words to it,

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.640
he saw the truth of it

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:32.920
and it was a bifurcation in the path of life then.

02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:35.360
And any therapist has stories like that,

02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:36.880
which just shows the immense power

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:40.320
that it can even be that just uttering the words

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.160
makes just a cascade of change all at once.

02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:46.560
Just saying those words to another human being.

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:51.600
It makes you wonder what that compulsive loop

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.160
that happens in our heads

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.600
until it's brought to the surface.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.840
It's so interesting.

02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.640
Entirely non-productive the loops.

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:03.080
And sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another?

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:04.360
Let me write it down.

02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.880
It can get rid of those loops in our brains.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:09.560
Is it any even thought of outward expression

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:11.840
is the enemy of those internal

02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:14.280
persecutory negative thought loops?

02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:15.980
How do you find a good therapist?

02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:22.360
I tend to think of, listen, I'm a fan of podcasts.

02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:23.920
I'm a fan of conversations.

02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:25.960
It feels like a, you know,

02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:29.160
it's like finding a good friend or something.

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.760
It feels like a difficult journey.

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:32.760
Maybe I'm wrong in that,

02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.600
but it just feels like such a,

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:38.560
it feels like a partnership, a journey together

02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:43.560
versus like some very simple clinical procedure.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.440
Well, the first thing I would say

02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:47.720
is to change the entire paradigm.

02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:50.000
Like most people like, okay, I need a therapist.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.800
So people feel often like they're in a weakened position

02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:56.040
because they need, you know, quote unquote, a therapist.

02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:58.920
Then therapists are rationed, right?

02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.120
I mean, how many insurance panels have lists

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:04.720
a mile long of qualified therapists

02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:07.680
who could be on that insurance panel,

02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:09.520
but there's a certification process.

02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:10.600
Like these is making no sense, right?

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:12.760
The state's already certified the person, right?

02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:14.440
But there's so many barriers to entry

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.920
that now we're rationing this resource,

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:19.080
which we should all stop and pause for a second

02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:21.400
and think like we're okay with that as a society.

02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:23.360
And by the way, everything else is like that too,

02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:25.520
when we're trying to get help for our health.

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.880
So let's step back from that for a second.

02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.920
Now it's a resource that's not in great supply.

02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.400
And then a person begins to think, you know,

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:34.840
essentially I'll take what I can get.

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:35.760
Like I just gotta get somebody

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.960
and I don't know enough to know anyway, right?

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:40.600
And those are very disempowering thoughts

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:42.040
as opposed to saying, look,

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:43.680
I'm gonna be an empowered consumer

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:47.560
and I'm gonna need to choose someone who gets over

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:48.960
just some basic hurdles

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.040
of what I think are reasonable human interaction, right?

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.720
So like as a person making eye contact,

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:55.120
do they seem interested, right?

02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:57.640
Like these are basic points about any human interaction,

02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.440
including a therapist, right?

02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:01.200
Then you can say, okay, is there a word of mouth?

02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:02.360
Anyone else who has something good?

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.240
Nothing better than a word of mouth recommendation

02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:06.000
from someone you trust, right?

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.880
Or anybody can have a good website,

02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:09.200
but you say, let me look at the website.

02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:11.200
What is it saying if there is one, right?

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:15.520
Does it resonate with me or not, right?

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.840
But after all of that,

02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:19.040
then you go to see the person

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.760
with the idea that you're interviewing them, right?

02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:24.000
The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.840
and if so, great, I'm with the program,

02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:27.160
but I'm thinking about it.

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.680
Do I want this person?

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:29.800
Do I feel heard?

02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:31.560
Do I feel cared for?

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:33.440
Which doesn't mean, is it easy, right?

02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:34.680
It might mean, is it hard?

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:38.720
And I leave and I feel like emotional for a couple of days

02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:41.720
but I see that I'm facing new things.

02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:43.800
No, this process of assessment

02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:46.840
so that one isn't settling for something

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:48.960
that is formulaic over-packaged

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:51.240
and I'm not trying to be overly critical of therapists.

02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:53.160
I mean, there are people everywhere who do their jobs well

02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:55.280
and people who don't do their jobs well,

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:58.680
but most therapists are working in systems

02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:01.800
that push against doing the job well, right?

02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:03.040
Because they're rationing care

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:04.600
and there's a lot of number of sessions

02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:07.120
and there's enough in such time before a person can return.

02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:09.200
So often it's an uphill battle

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.960
because we're trying to be helped

02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:14.320
within systems we've created and tolerate

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:17.640
that are pushing against helping us.

02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.040
Yeah, but that interview process is tricky.

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:25.400
I mean, if you're in a rough place mentally,

02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:29.280
just like with any kind of interview,

02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:33.000
it's hard not to think that a failed interaction,

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.440
failed interview, there's something wrong with you.

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.800
Sure, right.

02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:41.000
There is an authority to a therapist, I think,

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.720
where you think like they've got it all figured out.

02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:49.400
And I'm a mess and therefore if there's something off,

02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:51.680
it's all my fault, right?

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:54.360
So it's a very tricky and then it's easy to then give up

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:56.480
and then, because it's like that step

02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:00.160
to try to get a therapist, the first step to get help,

02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.920
if I get a therapist, like any kind of help,

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:04.080
that's a big leap to take.

02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:05.720
Especially when you're in a rough place.

02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:06.920
I agree completely.

02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:11.560
We should not make people swim against such a strong current

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:12.920
to get their needs met.

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.240
I mean, we see this in such obvious places

02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.320
where you have an elderly, homebound person

02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.160
who can't get their medicine

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:21.520
because oh, there's been some change

02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:24.200
and they didn't put the new number into the form

02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:25.040
or Lord knows what.

02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:28.760
I mean, it's incredible how we force people

02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:30.840
to swim against strong currents

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:33.040
to get things that are just basic

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.000
at times for their survival.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.320
And with that in mind, I don't have a lot of respect

02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.000
for where healthcare is at or where mental health is at.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
The field that I work in has accepted all sorts of aspects

02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:50.400
of how things go, someone else controlling

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:53.560
how long the interaction can go on,

02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.080
how the interaction is bounded,

02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:56.160
what can be said and done,

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.160
what medicines can be prescribed.

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:00.840
There's so many external controls

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:04.000
in the systems we work in that we,

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.920
and I say me included, like all of us in the field

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:09.840
have let it get to a place

02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:13.280
where it's obscenely difficult to get help.

02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:15.040
Obscenely difficult.

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:18.920
And we should say that's not okay.

02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:21.840
I think psychiatrists and therapists

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:24.760
and masters level social workers, psychologists

02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:27.440
and you name it, I think we should all say

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.520
this is not okay.

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.400
And then we as a society should be saying

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.320
this is not okay, otherwise what you're saying

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.440
which is I think completely true

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:38.680
will only become worse as there's more and more barriers

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.120
to getting the help a person needs.

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:42.280
And each time a person isn't helped,

02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:44.640
it sets the odds against them getting more help.

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:47.760
I should say here that when I started working

02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.360
there were times I would send people

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:50.360
to an emergency room, right?

02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:52.960
If there was some emergency in their mental health

02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:54.240
and they were at risk.

02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:55.680
And there were times I'd send somebody

02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:58.240
to an emergency room where if you stopped and looked

02:19:58.240 --> 02:20:01.400
it would have been malpractice not to do that, right?

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:06.400
Now it's not just me who has an incredibly high threshold

02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:09.960
for sending someone to an emergency room

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:12.600
because you just send someone who's in a lot of distress

02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:15.480
and oftentimes they're sitting on a gurney in a hallway

02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:17.520
or they're locked in a small white room

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:19.280
and all they had was depression.

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.280
They're scared when they go in and 36 hours later,

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:23.400
oh, they're feeling a little better.

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:24.920
Wags are desperate to get out of there.

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:26.280
And someone sends them home.

02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:29.840
I mean, so our systems have shifted so much

02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:33.200
that we tolerate now en masse.

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.360
What is egregious to the individual?

02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:42.320
So you are a psychiatrist in terms of doing therapy,

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:46.240
psychotherapy, what does the successful interaction

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.240
look like?

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:50.680
Perhaps a fun question, perhaps not.

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:52.280
What do you think of the psychiatrist Sean

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:55.400
in Goodwill Hunting played by Robin Williams?

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:58.160
So what is the full range of interesting interactions?

02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:59.840
Can there be an intimacy, a friendship,

02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:04.600
a kind of varied interaction that kind of blends the lines

02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:09.360
of 30 minutes session once a week or whatever

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:14.360
versus like a really kind of deliberate long-term project

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:17.760
that cares about the well-being of a person

02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:20.240
across the months and years?

02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:24.120
Or is the, what can you say about a successful

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:27.000
interaction between therapist and patient?

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.240
I think we're much better served by the latter, right?

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:32.360
And again, it doesn't have to be over years.

02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:35.000
We may be, a person might need that over weeks.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.080
They might need it over months.

02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.760
They might need it over years.

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.800
But if I'm understanding correctly,

02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:42.000
you're describing something that is

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.600
like a real human engagement, right?

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:49.160
And I work in a field that for years and years and years,

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.560
the patient didn't get to see the therapist was sitting

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:55.000
in a place that was sitting behind the person, right?

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.480
So that's not, of course, the only tradition

02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:59.480
and there are aspects of that tradition

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:01.080
that can be very humanized,

02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:04.640
but the idea that we're supposed to not be human.

02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:06.600
I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right?

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:07.840
That the doctor's supposed to be God

02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:09.280
and it protects the doctor.

02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:11.200
And that makes its way into therapy

02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:15.100
and the idea of the superiority the therapist knows more.

02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:18.440
I mean, in some ways, yes,

02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:21.320
but the idea is like to know more about mechanical things,

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:25.080
like to know more about like facts and knowledge,

02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:26.720
not as a human being, right?

02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:30.720
If we approach therapy as a collaborative human endeavor,

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:31.560
right?

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:33.160
Where if we're gonna do it together,

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:35.360
of course I'm gonna learn from you too, right?

02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:36.680
I mean, we're two human beings

02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:38.280
and we're talking about things that are deep

02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:41.720
and personal and intimate and I'm not gonna participate

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:44.680
in a way that makes it like about me as much as it's

02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:46.440
about you, but we're two humans

02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:48.800
and what's gone on in me may have relevance

02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:50.480
and sharing it may have relevance.

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:53.280
And at times you doing something back

02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:54.720
for me may have relevance.

02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:56.040
I'll give you an example of a person

02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:58.600
who would not let me help him.

02:22:58.600 --> 02:22:59.680
It was a young man.

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:02.360
So when I was in training, who was very, very sick

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:05.760
and needed to change certain choices and habits

02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:07.560
or he was not gonna survive.

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:11.640
And I had no ability to help him whatsoever.

02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:13.320
And I went and I saw a supervisor

02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:14.800
who was existentially trained.

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:16.880
We're here, it's different from existentialism

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:17.920
in the classic sense,

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:20.440
but it's about really human connection, right?

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:23.560
And the guy was always wanting to teach me something, right?

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:25.160
Cause I can get by in Spanish,

02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:26.400
but he was fluent in Spanish.

02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:28.880
And he wanted to, he'd, oh, you traveled here

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:31.560
and he'd say, you know, a word to see if I knew.

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:34.080
And I was always directing back to what I was supposed to do,

02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:34.920
right?

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:35.760
And the supervisor, I'll never forget,

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.880
he said, let him teach you Spanish.

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:39.320
Like, okay, come on.

02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.200
So we had a couple of sessions where if you looked

02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.040
from the outside, he said, what is going on there?

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:45.840
Like, right, like this, it was their Spanish lessons

02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:46.920
to me, right?

02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:49.400
And then at some point he had, he brought in his mother

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:51.440
and it was, he hadn't brought her in yet.

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:54.920
And he was in part showing off that he taught me something,

02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:55.760
right?

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.160
And I said a couple of things and he felt more powerful.

02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.120
Like he was younger than me and he felt sick

02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:02.760
and disempowered, but he didn't feel that way

02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:03.960
once he taught me something

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:06.200
and we showed it off to his mother, right?

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:07.880
And his behavior started to change.

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:10.000
He started taking better care of himself.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.960
He could see a little more what I was saying.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.360
He was like, you're a wonderful person.

02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:15.880
Look, you love your mother and your aunt and they love you.

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:18.400
And like, look, he could start seeing that about himself.

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.160
But that came from humanness.

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:23.760
And I think that's the way we help people.

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.800
I don't understand why we don't do everything that way.

02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:27.680
It's like, we're two humans,

02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:29.160
but if you're doing something for me,

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:31.400
then there's something you have an expertise and I don't.

02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:32.840
That's why you're doing it for me.

02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:35.120
The reverse could be true, but it doesn't mean we're not.

02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:37.720
Just two humans doing something together.

02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:39.840
And the healthcare system and the legal system

02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:40.920
should not get in the way of that.

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:43.520
I mean, there's liability and all these kinds of things

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:48.440
that can get in the way of the humanness.

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:50.760
I mean, some of that is justified.

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:51.640
You have to be careful.

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:54.720
You have to make sure there's a force for irresponsible,

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.960
but a little too much can destroy the humanness.

02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:58.840
I'll use it where I don't.

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.840
You usually say something is insane.

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:02.720
Like it's not consistent with sanity.

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:07.480
And the presence of the legal system, look, I'm all four.

02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:09.360
Of course, physicians have to be held,

02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:12.120
but to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:15.120
and people have to be accountable for their mistakes,

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:17.320
I understand all of that.

02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.760
But what we see now, it's so absurd that,

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:24.720
oh, like everyone is frightened, right?

02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:25.800
Everyone is frightened.

02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:26.920
And then just looking to like,

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.280
how do I slot into the box,

02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:31.040
check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.880
and not get in trouble?

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:37.000
People get sued because someone was at that hospital

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.640
and that doctor touched their care.

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:39.800
This happens in the VA system.

02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:41.560
It happens in other systems too.

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:42.880
So you might have touched their care

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:44.560
and no one's even saying you did anything wrong,

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.000
but they say the next person did.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.680
Oh, someone settled on your behalf

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:49.360
and now you have a malpractice.

02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:51.880
Dang, and maybe you can't get a license somewhere else.

02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:56.000
Like doctors are terrified and they're terrified for good,

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.320
they're terrified for good reason

02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:00.080
because the same society that has given doctors

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:02.000
in many ways too much power over time

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.400
and treated doctors maybe too much like gods now

02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:09.000
is I think enacting some of society's anger and envy

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.680
out on the physicians.

02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:13.840
Even the idea that like a person would know what medicine,

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:16.520
like I saw a couple of TV commercials give me this.

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.680
It's like, it's interesting, right?

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:21.640
Because even if, let's say I take myself out of it,

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.680
it doesn't feel good obviously,

02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:24.600
but it takes about, it's like, wow,

02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:26.640
like I went to school for like eight years for this

02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:28.600
and you don't even want to hear my opinion, right?

02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:30.480
You're not taking good care of yourself, right?

02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:32.520
It doesn't mean you should think my opinion is gospel

02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:36.280
as I said it, but people then don't have an understanding

02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:37.640
of like, what is expertise?

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.120
What do people learn?

02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:42.760
How can people help us understand and make better decisions?

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.480
It kind of goes out with the wash

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:47.520
and then the position of the expert.

02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.920
I mean, a lot has been written about this, right?

02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:52.840
It gets diminished over time very much to our own peril.

02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:56.080
And then often with aggression in the medical world

02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:59.880
coming back towards the alleged expert.

02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:03.920
Yeah, expertise is a tricky one, such a tricky thing

02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.920
because couple with expertise,

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:13.000
the attention is this arrogance

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.920
that can come with expertise.

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:18.040
The arrogance can make the expert feel

02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:22.080
like they're more of an expert and there's a vicious cycle

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:25.080
and then the arrogance in the current in the 21st century,

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:26.000
especially with the internet,

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.680
the arrogance can completely force the public

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.960
to distrust the expert

02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:34.000
because all they see is the arrogance versus the expertise.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.960
So ultimately you have to have,

02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:41.160
I think the greatest experts and masters I know

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.360
are the ones that have complete humility.

02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:45.880
Right, humility and gratitude.

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:46.720
And gratitude.

02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:47.560
Be this back.

02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.480
Which is usually a really good sign

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:53.280
that somebody is at the top of their field.

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:54.120
Right.

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:55.640
And they'll acknowledge that they don't know everything.

02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:56.480
Right.

02:27:56.480 --> 02:27:57.400
Which is hilarious, right?

02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:01.520
So like the best experts I know are the ones

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.640
that will say that they don't know.

02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:06.480
Right.

02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:08.160
They would not call themselves an expert.

02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:09.000
Right.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:09.840
Right.

02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:10.680
It's very confusing.

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:11.520
Right.

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:12.360
Or know that they know a lot

02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:13.480
but don't know the answer to this.

02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:14.640
You see that a lot in medicine.

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:16.680
That person knows they're an expert surgeon

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:18.520
but they also acknowledge they don't know

02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:20.280
if this is the right time to operate.

02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:21.760
That's how you get to the best answer

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:23.240
instead of someone who is an expert

02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:24.560
and always knows the answer.

02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.680
Yeah.

02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:28.200
If we actually rewind to the beginning

02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:29.920
of our conversation, we talked about,

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:33.400
you mentioned something I wanted to return to.

02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:36.560
So there's layers that are,

02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:38.760
there's an emergent novelty.

02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:40.720
And you mentioned that we as human beings

02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:43.960
and we introspect on our own mind,

02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:46.220
we really can't know most of it.

02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:50.160
Which of course makes me think of this,

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.520
the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind

02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.520
and Carl Jung.

02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:55.560
How much is hiding there in the shadows?

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:58.960
You've investigated a lot of trauma.

02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:00.880
How much is there in our mind

02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:03.520
that's not directly accessible to us?

02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:06.520
Like what can you say maybe philosophically

02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:11.520
about how much is there lurking in the Jungian shadow?

02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:15.880
I think there's a tremendous amount there.

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.640
But I wouldn't, I don't immediately go to

02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:21.960
an ominous perspective, right?

02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:23.440
Because if it's lurking there, right,

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:24.720
it can come get us, right?

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:26.760
And to some extent, that's true, right?

02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.320
Because the seeds of evil are there

02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.000
if we want to plant and nurture them.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.200
You think good things can't lurk?

02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:34.880
I guess so, I was being poetic.

02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:35.960
But you're right, you're absolutely right.

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:38.160
And the Jungian shadow is supposed to not just be

02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:39.840
dark things, it's supposed to be everything.

02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:42.100
It's supposed to be a lot of positive things as well, yeah.

02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:46.080
Right, which I think brings us to self-knowledge to truth

02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:49.320
where I think the opposite of envy,

02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:53.560
narcissism, sociopathy, I do think is all rooted in truth.

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:55.960
It's both the truth of the good things about us

02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:58.760
or the ways we're not, we're not blameable

02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.960
for the, blame worthy for the things we're blaming ourselves

02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:02.240
for, et cetera.

02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:04.760
But the self-knowledge and the truth

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:09.100
and getting away from the reflex of anger, frustration,

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:13.280
envy, shame, what I think happens then is all of that

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:14.320
underneath the surface.

02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:16.160
If we look at like the consciousness is the top

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.240
of the iceberg, you know, outside the top.

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:19.720
So well, outside the water.

02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:22.320
So is what's underneath like shifting

02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:24.200
and it can pull the top under, right?

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:26.080
Or is it supporting the top?

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:30.240
And really, I believe is honesty, truth,

02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:32.120
self-knowledge, humility, gratitude,

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:34.760
all this simple stuff, good mental health

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:36.600
is always consistent with simplicity.

02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:39.600
You know, humility, gratitude or easy things to say.

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:41.280
Like we know what that is, right?

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:42.680
We understand what that is.

02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:46.400
Soothing envy by having immense power

02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:49.040
and subjugating others is getting very, very complicated,

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:51.560
right, what that is and how that plays out.

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:54.200
So if we are in touch with ourselves,

02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:57.280
if we're honest with ourselves, if we own what's ours,

02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.680
we don't try and own what's not ours, right?

02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:02.360
What happens then is something isn't waiting inside of us

02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:06.760
to sort of jump us with some new fact of self

02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:08.400
or challenge of self, right?

02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.800
Then I think what happens are phenomena

02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:13.480
like intrinsic learning, like the way that so much happens

02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:15.560
inside of us automatically, right?

02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:18.880
How people who have high levels of expertise

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:23.800
know the answer to complex questions more rapidly, right?

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:25.760
It doesn't take them longer to think through it,

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:27.480
but they have more knowledge to think through.

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:30.600
It's that more happens rapidly and unconsciously

02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:33.360
so they know the more complex answer

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.240
more quickly and readily, right?

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:37.080
And we can build that in ourselves,

02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:39.480
not just in terms of factual knowledge,

02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:42.280
but in terms of how we respond to things, right?

02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:46.040
If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame, right?

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:47.640
If I see someone has something I'd like,

02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:49.160
how do I respond?

02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:51.800
We're more in accord with ourselves

02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:56.480
and then the automaticity in us is serving us better.

02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:57.520
So that's in the positive.

02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:59.360
Do you think, do you draw some wisdom

02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:03.800
from the early pioneers of psychotherapy

02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:05.840
like Freud and Jung?

02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:06.680
Yes.

02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:07.680
That there's some repressed,

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:12.440
there's some stuff to work through

02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:15.760
that is in the unconscious mind.

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:20.400
Yes, I think there's always like 100% of the time.

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:21.440
If you have a living human,

02:32:21.440 --> 02:32:24.680
you have things to work through in the unconscious mind, right?

02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.560
There's too much that goes on around us

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.200
that we might find unacceptable and suppressed, right?

02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:33.800
There can be smaller but important examples, right?

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:38.520
Someone who feels that they're not a good enough parent

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:43.520
and they, I don't know, they dropped the child's plate, right?

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:48.760
And there's a feeling about that of badness in them

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:53.520
that the person that can't tolerate and pushes away, right?

02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:55.520
And maybe they become a little bit less confident,

02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.640
a little bit less assertive.

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:59.720
Like those small examples are important

02:32:59.720 --> 02:33:01.240
because they may be low valence,

02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:04.240
but there can be many, many, many, many, many of them, right?

02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:06.240
Then you can look at the opposite end of the spectrum

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:09.880
where someone, for example, feels or they're repressing

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.440
their sexuality unconsciously.

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:15.480
Something that is so important, say,

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:16.920
to how a person feels about themselves,

02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:18.400
to whether they can seek fulfillment,

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:20.840
to how they feel about their ability to interact

02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:23.040
and engage with others in ways that are loving

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.800
and generative over time.

02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:28.000
So from smaller things that accumulate

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.880
often at a rapid pace to really big things,

02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:33.200
we are pushing things into the unconscious

02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:36.520
because they're not acceptable and we need to explore.

02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:38.000
Like why is that not acceptable?

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.440
Maybe there's a non-acceptable urge

02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:41.440
because it's really not acceptable to me, right?

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:42.720
Like a violent urge.

02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:44.760
Maybe there's an unacceptable urge

02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:47.720
because I'm actually listening to the lie society

02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:50.520
is telling me about what's okay and what's not okay, right?

02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:52.680
So in exploring those things,

02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:54.960
yes, we become happier and healthier

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:58.000
and that could mean if we're already happy and healthy,

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.240
it gets better, we get more insulated against the negative

02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:03.680
or it can mean the person who's really nurturing

02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:07.360
some of those seeds of evil and envy does that less

02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:08.840
or steps away from it.

02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:10.440
So whether it's good or it's bad,

02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:13.760
it's in there inside of us and we benefit

02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:16.880
from understanding that idea of the observing ego, right?

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:18.680
Like I said, the part that can stop and say,

02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:22.240
hey, this is what's, I see what's going on in me.

02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:25.360
What have you learned about exploring the human mind

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:27.480
about the art of conversation?

02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:29.560
Is ultimately therapy is conversation.

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:30.600
Yeah.

02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:33.280
Is there something you can put into words?

02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:34.120
Yeah.

02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:37.400
Like what makes a good conversation?

02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:41.680
I think language is among the most amazing gifts we have.

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:45.360
And it's also one of the most like clunky routes

02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:47.040
to misunderstanding, right?

02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.120
I think of like, there's a concept of facticity,

02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:50.600
you know, things that are like, I guess,

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:52.960
a necessary evils and from the religious perspective,

02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.520
I think is where the word started,

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:57.400
but of language being like a facticity, right?

02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:59.560
That we need to communicate with one another,

02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:01.600
we want to communicate so we develop words

02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.720
and we have these amazing brains that can have language

02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.640
and that's all well and good,

02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:08.600
but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock, right?

02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:10.000
You know, the Vulcan mind meld.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.520
It was like, I communicate with you

02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:12.840
because we put our hands on one another

02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:15.040
and we know, you know, by doing this,

02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:17.340
what we're thinking and what we're feeling

02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:19.540
and we won't have misunderstanding.

02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:22.480
So because I think we can approximate that,

02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:25.360
we can come kind of close with language, right?

02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:28.120
Or we can be so far away from it

02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:31.280
that we can say the same word and have opposite meanings

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:34.000
and have it generate immediate animosity, right?

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.360
That we need to be very, very careful

02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:40.320
with language, with communication, with conversations.

02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:43.280
And I've come to understand that much, much more

02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:46.480
as I've gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful,

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:49.880
you know, reckless speeches,

02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.440
which is why I'm horrified by so much of what we see

02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:53.920
in our political discourse, right?

02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:57.240
The slurs, the negativity that's attached to something,

02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.200
to some word, you know, how one can utter something

02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:02.920
and it can go into another person just into the ear,

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:05.040
but then goes through so many parts of the meaning

02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:07.400
of the brain that that person feels a pervasive sense

02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:10.440
of shame or beleagueredness, right?

02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:15.000
So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts people

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.820
and we see that all the time in ways

02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:18.560
that I think are just atrocious.

02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.520
And also how bad miscommunication harms us.

02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:24.440
I mean, I really learned that through a lot

02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:26.480
of different ways, but in the work as a therapist

02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:28.520
of like really wanting to make sure

02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:30.560
that I'm really understanding you

02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:32.480
and you're really understanding me.

02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:34.840
And a lot of work goes into that communication.

02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:36.440
I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:38.120
and then it happens more easily,

02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:41.560
but I think it's like, it's a life and death difference

02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:44.120
at times, you know, lots of times, right?

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:46.080
In the world around us between clear

02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:47.280
and accurate communication.

02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:48.440
And just so I said a word because like,

02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:51.000
I think you know what I mean or something like that.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.640
Yeah, so to that, I mean, there's the Camus quote

02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.320
that I like as much unhappiness as coming to the world

02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:00.320
because of things left unsaid.

02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:05.120
So that has to do with clear communication.

02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:11.560
But there's also a dance to a conversation,

02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:17.680
a poetry to it, there is ambiguity to language.

02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:20.640
And if you have a kind of awareness of that ambiguity

02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:23.520
and you play with it, that's where wit and humor come in.

02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.680
That allows you to sneak up to difficult topics

02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:30.480
without sort of trampling on them.

02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:34.200
I don't know, there's an art to it as well.

02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:36.520
There's an art to the silence, you know?

02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:40.320
Just allowing both human beings,

02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:41.920
one of the most intimate things you can share

02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:43.480
with a human being is silence.

02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:45.040
Yeah, that's communication.

02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:46.800
It's a different communication,

02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:48.880
but it ties in more powerful.

02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:53.320
Yeah, giving a person space to accumulate,

02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.040
to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts,

02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:58.840
enough to say a word, maybe a memory is sparked

02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:00.960
so they can think about that memory

02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:03.240
and process that memory.

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:04.560
So it's not just words, sorry to do quick,

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:05.480
it's not just words, right?

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:06.760
Because now you're talking about communication

02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:11.080
as it's body language, it's expressions of empathy,

02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:13.440
it's movements, it's pauses, right?

02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:17.240
The communication process is very, very complicated

02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:18.720
and deep.

02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:20.800
Yeah, and some of that is building trust

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.960
but also challenging a person.

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:24.600
I wonder about that whole process

02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:26.600
with strangers, for example,

02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:29.560
of how you do that successfully.

02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:31.680
Like you and I just met today.

02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:37.280
But I think a lot of our interaction is very free.

02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:39.800
We can get to know each other in any way we want.

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:42.920
There's a few conversations I have coming up

02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:44.920
in general where there's a lot of other pressures

02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:46.680
and constraints on those conversations.

02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:49.800
There's a danger to it, there's risks.

02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:51.560
There's the political forces involved,

02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:54.360
like not from my perspective,

02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:58.200
but probably from my as well of how do you say this thing?

02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:00.560
What are the words that are going to offend?

02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.840
And you're learning that about a stranger

02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:04.920
at the same time, and you don't.

02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:10.880
It's an interesting dance because you have to walk

02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:12.760
carefully but deliberately, right?

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.200
Carefully because I've learned this about myself,

02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:18.400
about others.

02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:21.560
There's certain words that can trigger a person

02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:25.600
that can make a person feel poorly,

02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:28.160
like shitty about themselves.

02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:32.040
So you can push, you can challenge a person

02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:34.800
about something and they're totally okay with it,

02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:36.880
but if you use a certain word to do it,

02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:40.280
it's gonna, it's maybe it maps it to some childhood thing

02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:43.080
that their father or mother used to say or something like this.

02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:46.360
And I mean, part of the art of conversation

02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:49.160
is actually being a little bit free

02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:52.000
and using those words, but being extremely sensitive

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.560
in detecting when a person reacts to a particular word

02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:57.600
and like storing that away.

02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.560
It's like, okay, then we might wanna return to that later

02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:03.240
because there might be an interesting,

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:04.480
that could be a tip of an iceberg

02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:06.640
that's actually representing something beautiful,

02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:09.800
or you might wanna just, it's a nothing word

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:12.720
that you just wanna avoid because it's a distraction.

02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:15.120
And so all of that kind of has to be integrated

02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.600
into the dance of language, which is really interesting,

02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:19.120
especially when the stakes are really high.

02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:20.800
When you get one conversation,

02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:24.360
when you sit down, you have one conversation

02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:26.960
and it makes the difference between,

02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:29.240
like say you had one conversation with a patient,

02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:31.440
this is the only conversation you get to help them.

02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:32.640
Sometimes it is the case.

02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:35.680
Yeah, this is pretty high stakes.

02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:37.500
Yeah. Oh man.

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:39.720
Yeah, it's tough.

02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.360
I guess you get over, and like over time,

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:47.520
I guess you get used to the high stakes nature

02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:49.840
when you develop an ability

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:52.680
and all that unconscious processing, right?

02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:54.160
All that part of the iceberg

02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:56.320
that's underneath the surface is doing all of that, right?

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:59.360
It's reading, behavioral cues, verbal cues,

02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:03.800
and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right?

02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:05.840
If we're all logic, it'd be different.

02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:06.920
Okay, we're gonna talk about this thing.

02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:08.420
I'll say things, you say things back,

02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:10.600
even if it's politically contentious, say.

02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:12.120
It's okay, we're just gonna talk logically,

02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:13.920
but that's not the case, right?

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:17.420
There could be a word that raises a certain emotion

02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:18.860
and you don't wanna tread there

02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:20.340
because the emotion will color

02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:22.060
the person's ability to engage,

02:41:22.060 --> 02:41:24.660
and so you're aware of all of this.

02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:27.300
And then I think from the perspective of all of that,

02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:29.500
I mean, it's like standing on the shoulders

02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:31.660
of your own internal giant, right?

02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:35.020
That understands language and emotions

02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:38.300
and body language and attunement and history

02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:40.100
and triggering and all of that.

02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:41.900
And then on top of that,

02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:43.340
as you're standing up on those shoulders,

02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:45.540
you're trying to be effective, right?

02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:48.340
And then I think that's where effectiveness

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:51.180
can be unilateral or it can be together.

02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.700
I mean, I think some of what emerged

02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:54.940
from Victor Frankl's writing

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:58.300
after the Second World War was how much

02:41:58.300 --> 02:42:00.340
a shared humanness means to us,

02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:02.860
how much of that can be an incentive

02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:05.480
for survival beyond all others, right?

02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:07.980
So the idea of are we doing something

02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:09.580
if we're communicating unilateral,

02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:12.580
like I want information from you

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:14.620
or I want you to do a certain thing

02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:16.860
when we're done talking, right?

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:17.940
Done communicating.

02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:20.820
That's a very unilateral type of effectiveness

02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:21.860
which can make sense.

02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:23.500
Sometimes I want information out of a patient

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:25.100
because I want to know what to do next, right?

02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:26.980
So it doesn't have to always be negative

02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:29.420
but it can also be a tool of manipulation, right?

02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:31.900
If someone would say coming from envy or narcissism,

02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:33.460
I want to communicate with you

02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:36.060
in a way that makes you do what I want you to do, right?

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:39.620
Different from that is where it's a shared communication

02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:42.780
where there's like an umbrella, so to speak over us

02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:46.100
and we're doing something that can only happen together

02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:48.420
because we're us, we're each person, right?

02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:50.380
And we come together to do something

02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:51.900
that's a shared effectiveness.

02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:54.540
Like I think we're doing now of like elucidating

02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:57.420
and pursuing thoughts and getting ideas out.

02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:59.180
And I think the best situations

02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:01.260
are shared effectiveness situations

02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:03.220
because you call upon the resourcefulness

02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:05.980
and the internal resources of both people.

02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:09.340
But you, especially with strangers,

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:12.100
especially when it's not labeled a therapy session,

02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:18.420
you kind of actually stumble into that cooperative state.

02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:23.740
Like you have to organically develop a trust together

02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.420
and almost lose yourself.

02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:32.420
Ultimately, I do, I think you put it really nice.

02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:34.100
I think successful conversations,

02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:38.980
even when it's with like, even if it's like with world leaders

02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:42.740
or logicians, people that operate in the space of reason,

02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:46.260
the most successful conversation will ultimately be

02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:49.980
in the layer and the landscape of emotion.

02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:52.260
Like that's where the interesting stuff will happen.

02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:53.780
That's where you discover anything.

02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:55.540
And that's where you get to actually meet,

02:43:55.540 --> 02:43:58.060
to start getting an understanding of each other.

02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:01.460
Or what you actually mean even by the statements

02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:04.260
that are supposed to be kind of rationally based.

02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:06.940
It's like you lose yourself.

02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:08.380
You lose yourself in the way you do

02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:12.180
when you're children and you're just not shooting the shit

02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:14.780
about whatever topic and you just forget yourself.

02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:15.620
Forget the things you're supposed to say.

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:17.140
You lose yourself in the context, right?

02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:20.940
Yeah, where you kind of plug into the unconscious mind

02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:24.740
a little bit and you get to speak maybe indirectly,

02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:27.980
but to the things that really drive you,

02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:31.940
to the things, to the emotions, I suppose,

02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:35.180
that underlie your worldview.

02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:38.340
I feel like that's where productive conversations

02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:41.660
can happen, whether it's a patient or just a stranger

02:44:41.660 --> 02:44:45.220
you're talking to at a bar about geopolitics.

02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:47.740
You mentioned Victor Frankel.

02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:50.460
What do you make of his work, Man's Search for Meaning?

02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:53.540
What are the lessons you draw from his work?

02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:56.820
Of him as a psychologist, but also from that

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:59.540
very powerful work that reflects on his experience

02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:02.060
in a Nazi concentration camp.

02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:03.020
Yeah.

02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:08.020
I think that it was almost a profound

02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:11.940
reinvention of humanness, right?

02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:16.940
After something so awful, so bleak and so despairing

02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:22.740
to speak anew about shared humanness, human connection,

02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:30.660
meaning, compassion, that I think it was an intellectual

02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:36.860
direction that was adorned with all of the emotions

02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:39.660
that we need to adorn the logic with

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:42.340
in order to make real change in the world.

02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:47.340
And I think that his work has fueled so many branches

02:45:47.580 --> 02:45:51.740
have come from his work, the existential psychotherapy

02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:56.060
and its place in helping human activities today, right?

02:45:57.220 --> 02:46:02.220
A trend away from the idea that we're all quite isolated

02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:04.300
and that what's going on between us

02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:05.860
is all very transactional, right?

02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.300
Putting something out and you take it in,

02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:09.020
you put something out, I take it in, right?

02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:10.540
The idea that, no, there's a difference there.

02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:13.860
There's a shared humanness that creates a meaning

02:46:13.860 --> 02:46:15.340
beyond the transactional.

02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:16.340
Kind of like you were just saying,

02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:18.740
the logical stuff isn't really that interesting

02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:21.500
because the logic is there's an answer

02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:22.420
to whatever logic is.

02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:23.780
We can do math, right?

02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:27.380
It's where does the surprises come in, right?

02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:30.700
Either in terms of wonderful behavior

02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:32.220
or destructive behavior, right?

02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:34.020
They're coming from people's emotions.

02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:36.580
So that's what we want to understand.

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:39.180
And that occurs in the context of a person

02:46:39.180 --> 02:46:40.380
and other humans, you know,

02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:42.180
even if it's the conception of someone

02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:44.900
and all and other humans as enemy, you know,

02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:49.220
or it's the conception of two people sitting together,

02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:51.060
the idea that there's a shared humanness

02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:52.900
and it's not all transactional

02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:57.900
and that he could take that out of the pinnacle

02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:01.380
of human tragedy and utilize it in a way

02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:05.820
that informs us being better as a species going forward,

02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:08.060
I think is really monumental.

02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:10.740
What do you think is the role of emotion

02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:15.060
in the human mind, in the human condition?

02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:18.140
Because you've, we've talked several times

02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:21.860
in different ways that emotion matters

02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:23.860
and it's a big part of who we are.

02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:28.340
But why is it there?

02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:29.620
Why is it useful?

02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:30.900
What's good about it?

02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:35.460
We've almost said it's almost like a negative thing

02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:37.380
that we just have to live with.

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.660
But why is it also maybe a beautiful thing?

02:47:39.660 --> 02:47:40.500
Yeah.

02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:42.020
Well, I think you said, what's the role of emotion?

02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:43.340
I think emotion is the king

02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:44.500
if we want to use that analogy.

02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:47.060
It's the CEO if you want to use that analogy, right?

02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:49.940
Emotion rules all.

02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:51.740
We're taught that we're logical creatures,

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:54.100
but we have innumerable pieces of data

02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:55.940
even over the course of just a day,

02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:57.780
let alone a human experience

02:47:57.780 --> 02:47:59.500
to tell us that is not the truth.

02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:02.500
Is it ever logical to run into a burning building?

02:48:03.380 --> 02:48:04.340
No, right?

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:06.140
I mean, logic is never gonna tell one to do that.

02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:07.500
Okay, so many love is in the building.

02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:10.620
The person's already sprinted halfway to the building, right?

02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:15.420
Emotion rules us and so the thought,

02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:18.820
a thought is some of that is evolutionary, right?

02:48:18.820 --> 02:48:21.980
That strong negative emotion stays with us

02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:24.220
very, very profoundly, right?

02:48:24.220 --> 02:48:26.780
So example I'll give is if we're hunter-gatherers

02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:29.140
and like I find a new berry and it tastes good

02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:32.300
and it seems nutritious and then, and it is, right?

02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:34.780
Everything's fine, it'd be good to remember that, right?

02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:36.660
But if I find a new berry and it tastes good

02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:39.060
and it seems nutritious and we both eat it

02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:43.260
and almost die of sickness, we better remember that, right?

02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:48.260
So the primacy of emotion is in us for reasons

02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:49.900
that are about survival,

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:52.460
that the emotion of it's my child in that building

02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:55.180
or my loved one is why I don't give a damn about logic

02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:56.860
and run into the building, right?

02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:58.900
The emotion of I thought that was good

02:48:58.900 --> 02:49:01.460
and I got really sick and I better never forget

02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:02.980
is also about survival.

02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:04.380
And the same applies to humans.

02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:06.660
If we're from different tribes back then

02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:09.260
and in my tribe, when you put your hand out,

02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:11.420
it's a greeting in your tribe,

02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:13.580
if someone puts their hand out, it means,

02:49:13.580 --> 02:49:16.100
hey, I'm gonna attack you and take your stuff, right?

02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:19.660
Then I put my hand out and you slug me, right?

02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:22.460
Then I was like, I better remember that, right?

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:26.020
But you see how that can lead into our,

02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:27.380
are the constructs around that?

02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:30.140
So I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent, right?

02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:33.100
We start then to make stories around that.

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.540
But the primacy of emotion, whether it's berries

02:49:35.540 --> 02:49:37.500
or it's humans who might threaten us

02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:39.060
or it's humans we love,

02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:42.020
I think it's hard to even look at that

02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:44.100
anthropological psychological literature

02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:46.100
to look at what's out there

02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:47.580
and I think the face validity,

02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:49.900
and that's part of survival, right?

02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:50.740
It's part of survival.

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:53.860
But it's so cool that you get also things like love,

02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:57.140
which are not often rational or grounded in logic

02:49:57.700 --> 02:50:01.020
and so on, if you look from a transactional perspective,

02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:03.460
a lot of times falling in love

02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:08.060
or whether it's with friends or friendship

02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:10.740
or romantic love, it doesn't really make sense.

02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:14.980
I'm still not sure what the hell it is.

02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:19.980
Because I mean, it's the thing that is one of the things

02:50:20.220 --> 02:50:22.820
or love for your kids when they're born.

02:50:22.820 --> 02:50:26.040
Like that love, the parental love,

02:50:27.940 --> 02:50:29.420
what is that?

02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:31.420
That's so cool that we get to have that.

02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:32.980
Like if you're looking for the,

02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:36.060
in the menu of items that give life meaning,

02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:37.780
that seems like a pretty good one.

02:50:37.780 --> 02:50:40.460
Yeah, so my response,

02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:42.180
you just said that gives life meaning,

02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:43.700
my response initially was gonna be,

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:45.860
it's the meaning of life, right?

02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:48.260
Because saying, okay, emotion is about survival,

02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:49.820
that's one part, right?

02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:51.060
And it's a very important part, right?

02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:52.860
If we don't survive,

02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:55.100
then we're not there to have emotions, right?

02:50:55.100 --> 02:50:57.100
So yes, it's about survival,

02:50:57.100 --> 02:50:58.860
but as important as that is,

02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:00.500
that's the small part of it, right?

02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:02.860
I think it is about the meaning of life

02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:04.980
because it's about the beyond self.

02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:07.700
And I think it relates back to what we talked,

02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:08.860
we're talking about the very beginning

02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:11.540
and the sort of levels of emergence, right?

02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:14.620
And when we feel love, we feel happiness

02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:17.380
because that person feels happiness, right?

02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:19.180
There's something that's so generative,

02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:20.540
so creative about that.

02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:22.300
Like we wanna bring order to things

02:51:22.300 --> 02:51:25.900
and we, you know, happiness is consistent with simplicity,

02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:26.740
right?

02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:27.620
If we're healthy, there's nothing negative

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:28.780
to say about our health, right?

02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:30.940
If we have health problems, there's a lot to say, right?

02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:35.340
And it's emotion that pushes us towards the goodness

02:51:35.340 --> 02:51:38.060
that I think makes all the meaning for us.

02:51:38.060 --> 02:51:39.140
I mean, it's interesting,

02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:41.300
I actually was wondering your thoughts about this

02:51:41.300 --> 02:51:42.540
as a scientist, right?

02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:46.180
Because we accept it by and large that we have free will, right?

02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:47.220
We think we have free will,

02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:49.660
but then we get upset that there's not justice, right?

02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:52.460
So, but how is it like if we have free will,

02:51:52.460 --> 02:51:54.140
I could act in an unjust way

02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:55.300
and then you're surprised

02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:57.100
or vice versa, like why, right?

02:51:57.100 --> 02:51:59.860
We have these thoughts because I think

02:51:59.860 --> 02:52:03.220
because we're rooted, we want logic to rule.

02:52:03.220 --> 02:52:04.860
Like there's a way in which I can understand logic,

02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:06.780
I can manage it, I can manipulate it.

02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:08.960
We sort of want it to be that way.

02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:13.960
So then we glorify logic and then we misapply it.

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:16.500
Like ideas, like, oh, I know we have free will,

02:52:16.500 --> 02:52:19.260
but I'm now, you know, shaking my fist at the heavens

02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:21.260
because there's no justice, right?

02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:23.420
And I think maybe what we're looking for

02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:25.540
is we should go back and look at the givens.

02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:28.020
Like why is there, there's only goodness if there's justice?

02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:30.900
I mean, that doesn't make, I think the goodness,

02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:32.820
why is the goodness have to be tied to that, right?

02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:35.180
Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:37.140
and the fact that when there is something,

02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:38.620
there is not nothing, right?

02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:40.860
And where there is something, there can be awareness,

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:44.300
there can be goodness, there can be compassion, right?

02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:48.860
Is it that what's really going on is not about justice?

02:52:48.860 --> 02:52:50.400
Yes, we have free will,

02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:55.400
but it's that goodness, creating, shoring up, making better.

02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:01.440
That is the meaning, that is the good, right?

02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:04.360
And that the evil is the destruction

02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:07.280
as evidenced by the fact that it's over determined

02:53:07.280 --> 02:53:08.520
probably a million times

02:53:08.520 --> 02:53:11.080
that we're in this eddy current of counter entropy

02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:13.640
and we could destroy that quite readily, right?

02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:15.440
And then we're nothingness,

02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:19.120
like everything else that we know of that's not us,

02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:21.240
that doesn't have the ability to do something

02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:24.000
that's creative or constructive.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:27.280
I mean, I think that that's the answer

02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:29.880
and I think that our science really tells us

02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:30.880
that that's the answer.

02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:33.200
And I think it beckons us with ideas,

02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:36.680
like we know that things happen outside of space and time,

02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:37.520
right?

02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:38.360
I mean, they're physics experiments, right?

02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:40.800
Like we know this from the science of it,

02:53:40.800 --> 02:53:44.400
yet we don't stop and look and say, wait, is that the magic

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:45.240
of the idea?

02:53:45.240 --> 02:53:47.720
Einstein said, God doesn't play dice with the universe.

02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:52.000
Okay, maybe God doesn't play dice with the universe,

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.160
that quantum indeterminacy and all of that

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:56.640
is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak.

02:53:56.640 --> 02:54:00.000
But maybe it's in that indeterminacy

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.960
that we're given the opportunity to assert ourselves, right?

02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:06.440
To make something one way or another, you know,

02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:08.840
maybe it's not God playing dice with the universe,

02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:11.560
but it's God loading the dice in our favor.

02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.280
If we'll only listen to truth,

02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:15.880
the truth that being destructive

02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:17.320
doesn't help or soothe anything,

02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:19.800
even in the person who thinks it will for themselves

02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:22.160
and that creativity and generativeness

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:23.840
and kindness and compassion.

02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:26.280
Like this is, doesn't that seem so analogous

02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:28.000
to the eddy current of counter entropy

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
that has us here in the first place?

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.600
And I think that's where I pin meaning

02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:35.160
and that meaning then going back to the initial question,

02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:38.960
right, is generated in us through emotion,

02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:40.880
through what we feel that leads us to feel something

02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:43.720
that is mysterious, I don't know why I feel it.

02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:46.560
Yeah, in some sense, the motion is kind of the fuel

02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:49.000
of that creative imperative we have.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:52.920
But if you step back and look at the tapestry a little bit,

02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:54.760
it does seem that the destruction,

02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:56.040
the creation of the destruction

02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:58.760
are the ying ying yang of life.

02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:03.480
That it all works only if the main engine

02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:05.120
is towards creativity,

02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:10.120
but destruction also makes way for new things.

02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:13.840
So that's the, this kind of struggle.

02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:15.800
It seems like life is struggled

02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:17.320
between the different forces that make up

02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:19.520
the individual human, they make up society,

02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:24.240
all this tensions are necessary for growth, for development.

02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:28.320
This kind of inner conflict and outer conflict

02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:30.040
are necessary for growth.

02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:33.200
It's not just, I mean, in some sense,

02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:34.520
it's from the logic aspect,

02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:37.960
you kind of want everything to be perfect and just,

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:40.560
for nobody to suffer for everything to be perfect.

02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:42.080
But just like we talked about with trauma,

02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:45.480
it just seems like it's such a big giant mess.

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:46.360
What is it?

02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:49.800
Bukowski said, fine, would you love and let it kill you?

02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.440
There's some aspect of the negative aspect

02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:55.360
of passion and pursuit and obsession

02:55:55.360 --> 02:56:00.360
and the turmoil of the pursuit of happiness,

02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:05.320
of the creative pursuits and all of that.

02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:07.960
I mean, that's part of life as well.

02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:10.560
That's, and I don't know what to do with that

02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:13.800
from an individual perspective

02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:16.640
in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life?

02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:18.320
How do you live a healthy life?

02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:21.280
Cause it does seem that a bit of hardship

02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:22.680
or sometimes a lot of hardship

02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:25.960
can make a pretty interesting life.

02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:28.400
I think it brings us back to the discussion

02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.560
that we were having sort of before about

02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:32.720
like what does mean like the challenges of trauma, right?

02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:34.160
And of overcoming.

02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:36.880
And I think here we gotta be careful with the language, right?

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:40.800
Because I would then say, let's take destruction, right?

02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:43.320
And separate it into two things, right?

02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:47.120
One is to say destruction is like the breaking down,

02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:48.960
the tearing down of something, right?

02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:53.720
Versus a process that has malice in it, right?

02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.040
So just like when we were talking about trauma

02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:59.960
and setbacks, things to overcome.

02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:01.280
And we'd say, okay, if you say, hey,

02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:03.080
you have it harder than the next person

02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:05.000
and you have more to overcome,

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.080
or someone put a barrier in front of you

02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:08.680
for you to overcome,

02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:10.400
that there can be a lot of growth in that,

02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:11.920
including the times when you don't know,

02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:13.280
if you gosh, can I do this, right?

02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:14.960
Can I get over it, right?

02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:17.960
We're saying like that's challenge

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:20.000
and something to overcome that's very positive.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:21.720
But we're saying, but there's no benefit

02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:24.240
of like throwing a racial slur in there, right?

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:26.000
We're saying, because that's all bad.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.200
Like that's not, even the prince says,

02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.240
I'm angry about that and I'm gonna overcome that.

02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:30.240
It's like that didn't need to be,

02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:31.760
that didn't make anything better.

02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:33.280
If the person sees that and says,

02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:38.080
I'm gonna overcome that, it makes things less worse, right?

02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:40.560
But there's no good to something

02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:42.280
that's created as destructive.

02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:43.680
When we look at forest fires,

02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:45.280
like look, controlled burns,

02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:46.880
you say there's a forest burning down,

02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:50.320
but that's, okay, there's some weak destruction there.

02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:51.760
There's a tearing down there,

02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:53.760
but it's in the service of the next fire

02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:55.400
not running through the community,

02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:57.160
the town that's on the other side of it,

02:57:57.160 --> 02:57:59.400
that's very different than a forest fire,

02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:01.360
say started by arson, right?

02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:03.040
So you might say they're both a tearing down,

02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:04.800
they're a tearing down of the forest,

02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:06.880
but one is in the service of goodness,

02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:08.840
even though it's hurting the animals

02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:10.560
and the plants is not all good, right?

02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:12.720
But it's in the service of something

02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.440
as opposed to something else that's wantonly destructive.

02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:17.600
I think there's no good to the racial slur,

02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:19.680
there's no good to the arson, right?

02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:22.040
That's destruction in a way that's incorporating,

02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:24.560
I think, the malice of envy,

02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:26.520
something that's really purely,

02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:30.040
if there's a yin and yang, that's the destructive,

02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:31.320
that's the badness end.

02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:36.320
So racial slurs is a surface wave of a deeper thing.

02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:39.880
And so, I mean, the reason I bring that up is like,

02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:42.440
all right, well, you have these discussions of censorship,

02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:46.320
like what good does allowing racial slurs

02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:49.360
in public communication do, right?

02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:52.160
And it's like, our communication would surely be better

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:54.160
if we don't say bad things to each other.

02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:58.520
But it's like, it seems like the truth is,

02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:00.000
our communication will be better

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.080
if the amount of bad things

02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:05.000
is a small fraction of communication.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.800
That seems to be more true,

02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:09.840
because another aspect of human nature with power,

02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:13.600
the moment you start censoring and removing bad words

02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:15.960
that everyone agrees are bad words,

02:59:15.960 --> 02:59:18.280
then the people at the top,

02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:20.680
they're doing the censoring, start getting greedy.

02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:22.320
They start, it starts expanding.

02:59:22.320 --> 02:59:25.360
And this is the giant mess of human civilization

02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:28.440
where we can't, the nice piles you created

02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:31.160
are kind of overlapping piles.

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:32.560
That's a gray area.

02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:33.760
That's the problem with it.

02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:36.600
No, I agree completely, the control of language,

02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:37.760
there are slippery slopes there.

02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:40.840
I think there's a very big problem there.

02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:44.840
So I agree, I think, again, parsing out the language,

02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:47.480
I'm not saying, hey, we shouldn't have racial slurs

02:59:47.480 --> 02:59:49.080
as if like, let's stop saying the words.

02:59:49.080 --> 02:59:52.600
I mean, the idea is the premise behind it, right?

02:59:52.600 --> 02:59:54.400
Like, you know, the prejudices,

02:59:54.400 --> 02:59:56.880
if we could eliminate the prejudice behind it,

02:59:56.880 --> 02:59:58.560
you know, I was struck, I said,

02:59:58.560 --> 03:00:00.880
I do almost nothing about medicine.

03:00:00.880 --> 03:00:04.080
I get to medical school and start with anatomy, right?

03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:06.320
And it's remarkable as, you know,

03:00:06.320 --> 03:00:09.640
to see what, as the bodies are being dissected,

03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:11.320
that like we're all humans.

03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:13.880
Like, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter

03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:15.880
and any of these things on the outside, like,

03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:18.960
and that's true, not just like in our bodies,

03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:21.200
but in our minds and the part of the person

03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:22.160
that's not there, right?

03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:24.040
Because now we're trying to learn from the body.

03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:27.680
And, you know, it shows how ridiculous it is.

03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:29.360
If you think that we're 99.

03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:32.120
How many nines, you know, percent all alike genetically.

03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:33.240
And by the way, it's only like,

03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:36.200
take another 10th off and we're all orangutans, right?

03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:39.840
So, but somehow we have to see these differences

03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:41.080
between us, right?

03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:42.800
And where does that come from?

03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:46.160
And I think that, I believe that all comes from envy

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:47.360
in that classical sense,

03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:49.360
that if I don't feel good enough,

03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:52.040
I'm gonna want someone to feel better about.

03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:54.160
And so there can be visual things

03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:56.760
that that person looks different, right?

03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:59.120
Or you think about the, you know,

03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:01.280
I spent some time in Great Britain

03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:03.000
and when there's a lot of conflict

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.560
in between Northern Ireland and Ireland, right?

03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:06.960
And you thought, wow, there's not,

03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:08.560
there's not even a look difference, right?

03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:11.640
It's the same general religious umbrella,

03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:12.680
same ethnicity, right?

03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:14.560
But now there's some religious difference.

03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:17.160
And I thought, it's not me trying to be denigrating,

03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:18.640
you know, around the Irish conflicts,

03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:20.240
like that's human of,

03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:22.320
oh, there's no actual difference between us.

03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:23.920
If I don't feel good about myself,

03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:25.680
I'm gonna find one, right?

03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:30.240
It's that, that I believe could go away.

03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:32.320
It's driven by maybe the trauma

03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:33.600
of just being alive in the world

03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:34.800
and things can happen to us,

03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.720
but we certainly promote in the human created trauma,

03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:41.400
people feeling not good enough, finding differences.

03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:43.280
There's a place for the envy to attach

03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:46.520
and we're off to the races of, you know, wars.

03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:48.080
I mean, we're talking about the Second World War

03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:50.320
and we think, well, what have we learned since then?

03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:51.160
It would take us a day

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:53.960
to map out all the wars since then, right?

03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:55.360
Let alone for goodness sakes,

03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:57.320
everything that's salient right now.

03:01:57.320 --> 03:01:59.840
So we're not pretty, we're not good at learning

03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:03.320
from what seemed to be some very salient lessons.

03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:08.440
I should mention one thing is that I also know

03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:11.680
that you're interested in Russian culture a little bit.

03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:12.520
Yes.

03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:15.840
Churchill said, I cannot forecast to you

03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:17.840
the action of Russia.

03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:20.680
It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:23.840
So what do you or some interesting differences

03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:27.960
between, so this Eastern part of the world

03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:30.560
of Russia, Ukraine, the Slavic countries,

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:32.720
the former Soviet Union, all of that

03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:35.080
versus sort of the U.S. culture?

03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:37.120
What stands out to you from the literature,

03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:40.960
from the music, from the science, all that kind of stuff?

03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:45.960
I think there's so much intensity and I guess

03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:51.600
I would say fearlessness of expression

03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:55.600
that I see in the Slavic culture.

03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:58.480
Maybe it's across cultures

03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:00.480
because there's a different way that expression occurs.

03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:03.080
We say like, oh, it's different in the French

03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:05.720
than the Spanish or it's different than in parts of Africa.

03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:08.360
And I think when you take that part of the world

03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:10.960
for whatever reason, and maybe it's just totally random

03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:13.480
or maybe it's aspects of geography

03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.040
and experience and migration, but there's such an intensity.

03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:21.440
And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky very early on,

03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:23.640
for the very first time, early on in my life,

03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:26.920
or reading Dostoevsky and feeling like,

03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:31.920
oh, Dostoevsky's willingness, his ability and his willingness

03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:37.120
to express and create such powerful,

03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:40.080
aberrant states of human experience.

03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:43.360
Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of suffering

03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:47.120
that it expresses has always stood out to me

03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:52.040
as a way that like if that's like the brightest light,

03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:54.040
so to speak, communicating information,

03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:56.160
that that's a place to look.

03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:59.800
And it's also a place that resonated with me so strongly

03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:03.440
because I think for some people who are informative years

03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:05.800
and having very difficult feelings, right?

03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:07.880
Of like a depth of feeling of like fear

03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:09.520
and how's the world gonna be?

03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:10.600
Am I gonna be annihilated?

03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:11.920
Am I, what do I even want?

03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:15.080
What do I feel inside of me to encounter

03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:18.280
that being expressed so intensely?

03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:21.240
I found to be very, very moving.

03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:22.880
So I don't know if that's a good answer or not,

03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:24.960
but I think there's an intensity of expression

03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:26.240
and a fearlessness.

03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:28.840
Dostoevsky wrote about terrible things.

03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:31.000
What happens in the person?

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:34.360
Is there a person who is brilliant intellectually

03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:39.240
and very persuasive and very capable of being effective

03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:42.880
who also just chooses to be a child rapist, right?

03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:44.360
I mean, he wrote about that.

03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:48.960
He wrote about the truths of this is what we can be as humans.

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:52.440
And I think there's so many lessons, including the truth.

03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:53.400
Like people will tend to think,

03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:56.320
oh, evil is not very bright or not very intelligent.

03:04:56.320 --> 03:04:58.720
That's a way to let evil propagate, right?

03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:01.600
Evil can be effective and attractive

03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:05.480
and very compelling, but evil nonetheless.

03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:08.240
And I just think there's a fearless willingness

03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:10.200
to look at that and to describe it.

03:05:10.200 --> 03:05:14.200
That I see primarily I've studied in Russian culture.

03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:16.080
Yeah, the fearless exploration

03:05:16.080 --> 03:05:18.840
of this whole human drama.

03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:20.640
Definitely Dostoevsky and others since

03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:23.240
in the 20th century and the 19th century have done

03:05:23.240 --> 03:05:24.360
an incredible job of that.

03:05:24.360 --> 03:05:25.560
Some of that, just like you said,

03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:27.320
is the language, the culture.

03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:30.440
I think that intense romanticism is there.

03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:35.440
That is almost an overdramatic exploration of human nature.

03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:41.480
It can err on the side or falter

03:05:41.480 --> 03:05:45.680
when it goes into a kind of cynical view of life.

03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:47.400
Life is suffering.

03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:49.840
I think that also has to do with the way you deal

03:05:49.840 --> 03:05:52.840
with the trauma of the world wars and so on.

03:05:52.840 --> 03:05:54.480
This is something the different nations

03:05:54.480 --> 03:05:57.160
throughout Europe had to do with that in different ways.

03:05:57.160 --> 03:05:59.400
Some of them have channeled into envy and resentment.

03:05:59.400 --> 03:06:04.400
Some of them channeled into a kind of nihilism or cynicism.

03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:09.680
And ultimately the intensity of feeling is there,

03:06:09.720 --> 03:06:12.520
which is sort of interesting to see

03:06:12.520 --> 03:06:14.160
and interesting how that manifests itself

03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:19.000
in the kind of governments it builds up.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:24.000
There's more authoritarianism in that part of the world

03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:27.160
versus the Western world that's more focused

03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:29.240
on the individual versus the collective.

03:06:29.240 --> 03:06:31.160
And when more focused on the individual,

03:06:31.160 --> 03:06:34.240
you have a propensity to value individual rights

03:06:34.240 --> 03:06:35.720
with democracy and so on.

03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:37.280
It's interesting to watch and yeah,

03:06:37.280 --> 03:06:40.080
to reconstruct how that all came to be.

03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:42.880
Is it in the blood?

03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:44.520
Is it in the mind?

03:06:44.520 --> 03:06:48.000
Is it in some kind of thing that more ethereal,

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:49.720
a collective set of ideas that we pass

03:06:49.720 --> 03:06:52.720
from generation to generation between each other,

03:06:52.720 --> 03:06:54.920
sort of the collective of it?

03:06:54.920 --> 03:06:57.680
Yeah, it's fascinating to see.

03:06:57.680 --> 03:07:00.640
But now reinvigorated because there's conflict

03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:01.840
in that part of the world.

03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:06.040
You've also thought about the Cold War.

03:07:06.160 --> 03:07:09.040
What lessons about the human mind

03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:10.800
about psychiatry, psychology,

03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:14.280
and about looking at the Cold War?

03:07:15.440 --> 03:07:18.120
Can we take forward in the 21st century

03:07:18.120 --> 03:07:21.520
so that we can avoid World War III?

03:07:21.520 --> 03:07:22.360
Right.

03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:26.800
A major cold or hot war in the 21st century?

03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:27.760
Yeah.

03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:30.920
Well, I think unspoken animosities are very,

03:07:30.920 --> 03:07:32.360
very, very dangerous.

03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:34.520
I mean, right, it was a Cold War.

03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:38.280
There was fighting through proxies, right?

03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:41.840
The superpowers were fighting surrogate wars

03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:43.480
through proxies, which of course,

03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:46.080
in and of itself causes immense suffering.

03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:51.080
But it becomes the opposite of an exchange of ideas

03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:53.040
or an exchange of thought.

03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:55.080
You know, I remember the Khrushchev, right?

03:07:55.080 --> 03:07:57.720
Not believing that the kitchen could look like it did

03:07:57.720 --> 03:07:59.000
at the World's Fair, right?

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:02.080
And some of the misconceptions here

03:08:02.080 --> 03:08:04.480
of like what things were like in Russia, right?

03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:08.160
It was a thought that those other people

03:08:08.160 --> 03:08:09.680
are not actually people, right?

03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:12.400
There's an enemy society of evil,

03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:14.680
which then paints with a broad brush

03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:16.560
in a way that makes it easy,

03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:18.040
too easy for the Cold War,

03:08:18.040 --> 03:08:20.320
for it to go from being cold, right?

03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:23.680
To have it boiling over into utter destruction.

03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:27.240
And I wrote, it was really a true story

03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:31.520
that when I was in, it was still the Soviet Union,

03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:32.600
but it was right around the time

03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:34.360
the Soviet Union was coming to an end.

03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:39.880
And it had gone on a trip for students from England.

03:08:39.920 --> 03:08:42.480
And we got to go places that people like, I hadn't gone.

03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:45.720
You know, foreigners hadn't gone in many, many years.

03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:48.800
It was just kind of the right timing to experience that.

03:08:48.800 --> 03:08:52.760
And like it really is true that someone said on short notice

03:08:52.760 --> 03:08:56.480
to these poor kids that like these group of Americans

03:08:56.480 --> 03:08:58.480
were coming and I have a picture somewhere

03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:00.640
of the kid in a gas mask.

03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:03.520
Like as they went under their desks and put on a gas mask

03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:07.400
and they thought, right, that's what, I mean, that's what,

03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:09.640
they're taught to think about us

03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:11.520
and we're taught to think about them.

03:09:11.520 --> 03:09:15.600
And like now we're back in an us them, right?

03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:18.400
When, you know, we're all trying to survive

03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:23.400
and we're all such, you know, human life is so delicate,

03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:25.360
right?

03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:27.280
You know, let alone human happiness

03:09:27.280 --> 03:09:30.560
and we make these divisions and we create this aggression

03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:31.600
and latent aggression.

03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:33.240
I mean, during the Cold War, we developed, right,

03:09:33.240 --> 03:09:35.400
the ability to destroy the earth, right?

03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:37.720
And then just sat looking at one another, you know,

03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:40.360
with further growing misunderstanding

03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:42.760
and the opportunity for the proxy fights.

03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:44.880
Like I said, the Cuban Missile Crisis,

03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:47.240
which I know wasn't a war, but it's an aspect of that, right?

03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:50.640
Where we just have ourselves wildly, you know,

03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:54.680
at risk of destruction without any mutual understanding.

03:09:54.680 --> 03:09:57.640
And again, I would argue that that is the opposite

03:09:57.640 --> 03:09:59.480
of the counter entropy, right?

03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:01.080
Like we are setting everything up

03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:03.160
for less lack of communication, lack of understanding.

03:10:03.160 --> 03:10:05.080
How do those feelings of love

03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:07.960
and shared humanness happen?

03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:08.800
They don't, right?

03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:11.680
If you separate people and then we push ourselves

03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:15.080
more and more and more towards reinstating

03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:16.600
the state of entropy that's present

03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:17.960
in the rest of the universe.

03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:21.280
What advice would you give to young people

03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:25.760
that are fighting entropy with all their might?

03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:30.560
So young people and people that are wondering

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:32.560
how to find their way in life.

03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:34.800
What advice would you give?

03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:35.840
How to have a career?

03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:38.200
How to have a life they can be proud of?

03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:43.760
I think starting off with sort of first principles,

03:10:43.760 --> 03:10:46.160
I'm like, okay, what are my values, right?

03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:47.440
How do I wanna live life?

03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:49.720
Because, you know, I'm in my early fifties

03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:52.240
and when I was a kid, you know, we waited for the,

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:53.840
the newspaper came in the afternoon

03:10:53.840 --> 03:10:55.760
and then, you know, and then we'd see some,

03:10:55.760 --> 03:10:56.960
okay, what's going on in the world?

03:10:56.960 --> 03:10:57.800
We'd learn something.

03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:00.360
I'd get the West Coast baseball scores, right?

03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:02.520
And learn about, oh, here's what happened

03:11:02.520 --> 03:11:04.160
in different parts of the world.

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:06.840
And by and large, I and everyone else there,

03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:10.880
adult or child, we're like living in a reality

03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:12.920
that was largely, our conception was largely

03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:14.880
what was around us, right?

03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:17.280
And now, in many ways, it is,

03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:19.040
I'm not saying it's entirely negative, of course,

03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:20.040
that we have more information,

03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:22.640
we can sort of think globally, so to speak, right?

03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.440
But the other side of that is so much

03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:29.560
of the world's problems are on us all the time, right?

03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:31.400
Like, here's this awful thing that happened,

03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:33.040
how many awful things happen each day

03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:34.720
and they're right in front of us

03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:37.720
and there's such an immediacy to it all

03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:41.640
that I think it can be like, paralyze us with terror, right?

03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:45.040
And for someone who's young and trying to make their ways,

03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.840
like, how do you figure your way out in this world

03:11:46.840 --> 03:11:49.160
that your word isn't even gonna exist, right?

03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:51.320
And then you see how profligate

03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:54.360
the generations before you are, right?

03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:57.400
In so many ways, and there can become,

03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:00.280
I think, a push towards extremes, either nihilism

03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:03.400
or I'm gonna change everything, right?

03:12:03.400 --> 03:12:05.720
And it's like, how about let's start from,

03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:08.600
how do I wanna behave in my own community, right?

03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:09.800
Which starts with like, how do I wanna behave

03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:11.160
in my household, right?

03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:12.400
What kind of neighbor do I wanna be?

03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:14.000
I mean, it might seem like things like that

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:17.400
are silly or small in comparison to the big things,

03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:18.600
but I don't think they are.

03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:22.120
I think that's how we start building foundations

03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:24.640
that lets us tackle the big things.

03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:27.320
And then I do find myself saying what I'm working with,

03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:29.600
sometimes doing therapy with younger people

03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:33.880
of helping them kind of bring back their thoughts,

03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:37.240
their strivings, their decisions more to themselves

03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:40.440
and living with and around themselves more

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:44.560
instead of in something that becomes very theoretical

03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:48.600
and therefore very threatening and unnerving.

03:12:48.600 --> 03:12:50.200
So focusing on the people around them,

03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:52.440
taking one small step at a time

03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:56.200
to form deeper connections to build something locally.

03:12:57.080 --> 03:12:58.000
How do I wanna be today?

03:12:58.000 --> 03:12:59.600
If I go into the grocery store

03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:02.000
and the person in front of me drops something,

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:03.600
I can, I can, I can scow like,

03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:04.640
I'm in a rush, right?

03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:06.520
And I could be like that, right?

03:13:06.520 --> 03:13:07.360
I can be like that.

03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:09.240
I've been that way many, many times in my life, right?

03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:11.400
And it's never done anyone a damn bit of good,

03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:12.640
including me, right?

03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:15.120
Or I can realize like the 10 seconds aren't gonna matter.

03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:17.440
Can I help pick that thing up or just smile?

03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:19.480
These are the seemingly small things

03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:22.600
that I think make the tenor of our lives.

03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:25.760
Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline,

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:30.760
one of the really the main reason I moved to Austin, Texas,

03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:32.480
I just remembered deciding it.

03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:35.520
When I went to Walmart and a lady said,

03:13:37.320 --> 03:13:39.640
you look handsome in that tie

03:13:39.640 --> 03:13:42.040
or in that suit and tie, whatever.

03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:44.600
Like, I don't think anyone's ever said older lady,

03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:46.280
she was very sweet, there's kindness in her eyes.

03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:48.280
She said that, I don't think anyone ever said anything

03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:51.240
like that to me in my entire life.

03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:54.360
And it was just, I don't know.

03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:56.480
It was like, wow, there's kindness in this world.

03:13:56.480 --> 03:13:58.280
I know it sounds ridiculous, but like.

03:13:58.280 --> 03:13:59.440
Does not sound ridiculous.

03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:02.280
It's like those, you could be that for somebody.

03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:04.360
You go, go walk around in Walmart.

03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:06.200
Right, think that you remember that?

03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:07.040
Yeah.

03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:09.240
And it's pivotal, you're citing it as,

03:14:09.240 --> 03:14:11.320
hey, that was a big part of me moving here.

03:14:11.320 --> 03:14:13.480
So think about the branch point in your life

03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:15.920
that comes from the simple kindness, right?

03:14:15.920 --> 03:14:18.600
Of a person who had goodness to give, right?

03:14:18.600 --> 03:14:22.160
And wasn't scared that you're going to be upset by it.

03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:23.000
Right?

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:23.840
Right, right.

03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:26.560
She probably didn't have the thought

03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:28.360
that you could be a sailing, right?

03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:30.400
Probably she looks at you, she's got goodness to give,

03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:31.360
it's simple to give it.

03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:34.600
It's that simple and it's beautiful

03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:35.640
and it's worth more to you

03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:37.200
than like how many studies would be on,

03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:39.080
where's it right to live or this and that?

03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:39.920
None of that matters.

03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:41.360
It was just that.

03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:42.360
The freedom to be kind.

03:14:42.360 --> 03:14:43.560
And that's emotion.

03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:44.840
That's not logic at all.

03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:45.680
Right?

03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:48.160
That's purely just human emotion

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:49.800
and a little bit of humaneness,

03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:51.960
that little bit of connection.

03:14:51.960 --> 03:14:54.880
And then that's what makes life great.

03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:56.680
Which is why it's not a bad idea, right?

03:14:56.680 --> 03:14:58.760
That you moved here that way,

03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:01.320
instead of, one could say, well,

03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:02.240
I can't believe you did that,

03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:03.520
instead of looking at all the data

03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:05.760
and hiring consultants of what's the best place to live.

03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:07.160
But that would be wrong, right?

03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:09.520
Like you made a good decision, right?

03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:11.080
Like that was good data.

03:15:11.080 --> 03:15:12.600
It was impactful data,

03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:15.320
even in your thoughts about how you're happy living here,

03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:16.160
right?

03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:17.280
It's not that, oh, you discount,

03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:18.600
you short change yourself

03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:21.040
by not relying on all the logic, right?

03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:22.600
You felt something about the place

03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:24.920
and you felt it as symbolized in a person

03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:26.760
and that made the choice for you.

03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:28.160
It's a balance, of course,

03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:30.760
but you also have to know yourself a little bit.

03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:33.400
Sometimes you can find stability and comfort

03:15:33.400 --> 03:15:36.880
and kind of reasoning things out a little bit.

03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:41.400
Maybe as people close to me have sometimes criticized

03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:44.200
in that I'm a little bit too romantic,

03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:46.640
where I'll just follow the feeling.

03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:50.360
And life, there's physics,

03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:53.000
there's a reality to this world.

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:58.000
Sometimes reality doesn't allow you to flourish

03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:00.200
if you just follow your feelings,

03:16:00.200 --> 03:16:02.120
but there's a dance there.

03:16:02.120 --> 03:16:05.760
And happiness is ultimately found in that landscape

03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:11.360
feeling and emotion versus facts and reason and logic.

03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:12.960
As you said, have their place, right?

03:16:12.960 --> 03:16:13.800
Everything.

03:16:13.800 --> 03:16:15.240
They have their place,

03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:17.240
but they're not the be all and end all.

03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:20.480
You're an incredible person.

03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:22.600
Andrew Huberman is a friend of yours.

03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:24.560
He said, you absolutely must talk,

03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:27.920
called Dicerot.

03:16:27.920 --> 03:16:29.080
The number of people you know,

03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:30.400
they're just incredible people.

03:16:30.400 --> 03:16:32.840
There's just this group of folks

03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:36.040
that somehow helped each other flourish and grew together.

03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:38.480
And I'm just, I'm so happy you exist.

03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:40.480
I'm so happy you're doing the work you're doing.

03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:42.120
I can't wait for your second book.

03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:42.960
Thank you.

03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:44.160
And thank you for talking today.

03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:45.280
This was really cool.

03:16:45.280 --> 03:16:46.120
Thank you so much.

03:16:46.120 --> 03:16:50.400
I'm proud to be among the group of people that you cited.

03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:51.280
Proud to be their friend

03:16:51.280 --> 03:16:52.920
and proud that you've had me on today.

03:16:52.920 --> 03:16:53.760
Thank you so much.

03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:55.120
Thank you, Paul.

03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:57.680
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Conti.

03:16:57.680 --> 03:16:58.760
To support this podcast,

03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:01.720
please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:04.960
And now let me leave you with some words from Victor Franco.

03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:08.360
Everything can be taken from a man,

03:17:08.360 --> 03:17:10.840
but the last of the human freedoms,

03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:14.520
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.

03:17:15.520 --> 03:17:18.600
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
