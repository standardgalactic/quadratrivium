1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,080
And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic, which is to say they release energy.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,760
This, if you have hydrogen and CO2 and you put them together in a falcon tube and you warm it up

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,320
to say 50 degrees centigrade and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it, nothing's

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,560
going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable, two gases hydrogen and CO2 is less

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,400
stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out. Why doesn't that happen?

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,760
It's because of the kinetic barriers. It's because that's where you need the spark.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,360
The following is a conversation with Nick Lane, a biochemist at University College London

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,040
and author of some of my favorite books on biology, science and life ever written,

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
including his two most recent title transformer, the deep chemistry of life and death,

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,120
and the vital question, why is life the way it is? This is the Lux Friedman podcast to support it.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,800
Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious, the most interesting question

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,160
that we little humans can ask of ourselves. How did life originate on earth?

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,880
You could ask anybody working on the subject and you'll get a different answer from all of them.

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,080
They will be pretty passionately held opinions and their opinions grounded in science,

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
but they're still really at this point, their opinions, because there's so much stuff to know

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,800
that all we can ever do is get a kind of a small slice of it and it's the context which matters.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,240
So I can give you my answer. My answer is from a biologist's point of view. That has been missing

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,560
from the equation over decades, which is, well, what does life do on earth? Why is it this way?

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,720
Why is it made of cells? Why is it made of carbon? Why is it powered by electrical charges on

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,400
membranes? There's all these interesting questions about cells that if you then look to see, well,

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,520
is there an environment on earth, on the early earth, four billion years ago that kind of matches

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
the requirements of cells? Well, there is one. There's a very obvious one. It's basically created

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,960
by whenever you have a wet rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents which generate hydrogen

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,000
gas in bucket loads and electrical charges on kind of cell-like pores that can drive the kind of

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:43,280
chemistry that life does. So it seems so beautiful and so obvious that I've spent the last 10 years

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,680
or more trying to do experiments. It turns out to be difficult, of course. Everything's more

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
difficult than you ever thought it was going to be. But it looks, I would say, more true

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
rather than less true over that 10-year period. I think I have to take a step back every now and

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
then and think, hang on a minute, where's this going? I'm happy it's going in a sensible direction.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,240
And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas. I mean, I'm often accused of being

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,240
too focused on life on earth, too kind of narrow-minded and inward-looking, you might say.

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells, and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,320
ah, yeah, but life can be anything. I have no imagination. And maybe they're right. But

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,920
unless we can say why life here is this way, and if those reasons are fundamental reasons,

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,600
or if they're just trivial reasons, then we can't answer that question. So I think they're

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
fundamental reasons, and I think we need to worry about them. Yeah, there might be some deep truth

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,200
to the puzzle here on earth that will resonate with other puzzles elsewhere that will solving

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,640
this particular puzzle will give us that deeper truth. So to this puzzle, you said

41
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:06,080
vents, hydrogen, wet, so chemically, what is the potion here? How important is oxygen? You're

42
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,320
the book about this. Yeah. And I actually just came straight here from a conference where I was

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,560
chairing a session on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life. Of course, it matters.

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,360
But it matters most to the origin of life to be not there. As I see it, we have this,

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,800
I mean, life is made of carbon, basically, primarily, organic molecules with carbon,

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,480
carbon bonds. And the building block, the Lego brick that we take out of the air or take out of

47
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,400
the oceans is carbon dioxide. And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules, we need to strap

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,880
on hydrogen. And so we need, and this is basically what life is doing, it's hydrogenating carbon

49
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
dioxide, it's taking the hydrogen that bubbles out of the earth in these hydrothermal vents,

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,720
and it sticks it on CO2. And it's kind of really as simple as that. And actually,

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,360
thermodynamically, the thing that I find most troubling is that if you do these experiments

52
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,840
in the lab, the molecules you get are exactly the molecules that we see at the heart of biochemistry

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,520
in the heart of life. Is there something to be said about the earliest origins of that little

54
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,280
potion, that chemical process? What really is the spark there?

55
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:33,040
There isn't a spark. There is a continuous chemical reaction. And there is kind of a spark,

56
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,360
but it's a continuous electrical charge, which helps drive that reaction.

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,320
So literally spark?

58
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,280
Well, the charge at least, but yes. I mean, a spark in that sense is we tend to think of,

59
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,080
in terms of Frankenstein, we tend to think in terms of electricity, and one moment you zap

60
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,280
something and it comes alive. And what does that really mean? You've come alive, and now what's

61
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,720
sustaining it? Well, we are sustained by oxygen, by this continuous chemical reaction. And if you

62
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
put a plastic bag on your head, then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.

63
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,800
So it's some way of being able to leverage a source of energy?

64
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Well, the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

65
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,040
And amazingly, most of these reactions are hexagonic, which is to say they release energy.

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,720
If you have hydrogen and CO2, and you put them together in a falcon tube, and you warm it up

67
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
to say 50 degrees centigrade, and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

68
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,120
nothing's going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable, two gases hydrogen and CO2

69
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,840
is less stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out.

70
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,320
So why doesn't that happen is because of the kinetic barriers is because that's why you need

71
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,960
the spark. Is it possible that life originated multiple times on earth? The way you describe it,

72
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,440
you make it sound so easy. There's a long distance to go from the first bits of

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,520
prebiotic chemistry to say molecular machines like ribosomes. Is that the first thing that you would

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,760
say is life? Like if I introduce you to the two of you at a party, you would say that's a living

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:22,000
thing? I would say as soon as we introduce genes information into systems that are growing anyway,

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,280
so I would talk about growing protocells. As soon as we introduce even random bits of

77
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,600
information into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example, doesn't have to have

78
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,160
any information. It can be completely random sequence. But if it's introduced into a system

79
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,040
which is in any case growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself, then any changes in that

80
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,720
sequence that allow it to do so better or worse are now selected by perfectly normal natural

81
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,120
selection. So that's when it becomes alive to my mind. That's encompassed into an object

82
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,680
that keeps information and involves that information over time or changes that information

83
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,120
over time in response to the. So it's always part of a cell system from the very beginning.

84
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,800
So is your sense that it started only once because it's difficult or is it possibly started

85
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,720
multiple occasions on earth? It's possible it started multiple occasions. There's two

86
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,320
provisos to that. One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really for life to start. So as soon

87
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,360
as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere, then life isn't going to keep starting over. So I often get

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,600
asked by people, why can't we have life starting? If it's so easy, why can't life start in these

89
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,400
vents now? And the answer is if you want hydrogen to react with CO2 and there's oxygen there,

90
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,640
hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead. It's just, you know, you're getting explosive reaction that

91
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
way is rocket fuel. So it's never going to happen. But the other for the origin of life earlier than

92
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,960
that, all we know is that there's a single common ancestor for all of life. There could have been

93
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,600
multiple origins and they all just disappeared. But there's a very really interesting deep split

94
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
in life between bacteria and what are called archaea, which look just the same as bacteria.

95
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,920
And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly. And they are very different in their biochemistry.

96
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,720
And so any explanation for the origin of life has to account as well for why they're so different

97
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,320
and yet so similar. And that makes me think that life probably did arise only once.

98
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Can you describe the difference that's interesting there? Well, how they're similar,

99
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,640
how they're different? Well, they're different in their membranes primarily. They're different

100
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,200
in things like DNA replication. They use completely different enzymes and the genes behind it for

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,040
replicating DNA. So they both have membranes, both have DNA replication. Yes. The process

102
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,800
of that is different. They have, they both have DNA. The genetic code is identical in them both.

103
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,840
The way in which it's transcribed into RNA into the copy of a gene and the way that that's then

104
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,960
translated into a protein, that's all basically the same in both these groups. So they clearly share

105
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,360
a common ancestor. It's just that they're different in fundamental ways as well. And if you think

106
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,640
about, well, what kind of processes could drive that divergence very early on? I can think about

107
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,200
these in terms of membranes, in terms of the electrical charges on membranes. And it's that

108
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,080
that makes me think that there were probably many unsuccessful attempts and only one really

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,880
successful attempt. Can you explain why that divergence makes you think there's one common

110
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
ancestor? Okay, can you describe that intuition? I'm a little bit unclear about why the divert,

111
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,880
like the leap from the divergence means there's one. Do you mean like the divergence indicates

112
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,640
that there was a big invention at that time from one source? Yes. If you've got, as I imagine it,

113
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,600
you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent. Let's say there are millions of vents and

114
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,760
millions of potential common ancestors living in all of those vents, but only one of them makes it

115
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,360
out first. Then you could imagine that that cell is then going to kind of take over the world and

116
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,160
wipe out everything else. And so what you would see would be a single common ancestor for all of

117
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,640
life, but with lots of different vent systems all kind of vying to create the first life forms,

118
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,080
you might say. So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism? We're always talking about populations

119
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,960
of cells, but yes, these are celled organisms. But the fundamental life form is a single cell,

120
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,760
right? So they're always together, but they're alone together. There's a machinery in each

121
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,200
one individual component that if left by itself would still work. Yes, it's the unit of selection

122
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,320
is a single cell, but selection operates over generations and changes over generations in

123
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,560
populations of cells. So it would be impossible to say that a cell is the unit of selection

124
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,640
in the sense that unless you have a population, you can't evolve, you can't change.

125
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:16,240
Right. But there was one Chuck Norris, it's an American reference cell that made it out of the

126
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,560
vents, right? Or like the first one. So imagine then that there's one cell gets out and it takes

127
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,640
over the world. It gets out in the water, it's like floating around. We're deep in the ocean

128
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:34,800
somewhere. But actually two cells got out and they appear to have got out from the same vent

129
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,080
because they both share the same code and everything else. So unless all the, you know,

130
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,520
we've got a million different common ancestors in all these different vents. So either they all have

131
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,560
the same code and two cells spontaneously merged from different places or two different cells,

132
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,560
fundamentally different cells came from the same place. So either way, what are the constraints

133
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,680
that say not just one came out or not half a million came out, but two came out? That's kind

134
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,360
of a bit strange. So how did they come out? Well, they come out because what you're doing inside

135
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,800
event is you're relying on the electrical charges down there to power this reaction between hydrogen

136
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,280
and CO2 to make yourself grow. And when you leave the vent, you've got to do that yourself. You've

137
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,680
got to power up your own membrane. And so the question is, well, how do you power up your own

138
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,600
membrane? And the answer is, well, you need to pump, you need to pump ions to give an electrical

139
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,480
charge on the membrane. So what do the pumps look like? Well, the pumps look different in these two

140
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
groups. It says if they both emerge from a common ancestor, as soon as you've got that ancestor,

141
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,320
things move very quickly and divergently. Why does the DNA replication look different? Well,

142
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
it's joined to the membrane. The membranes are different. The DNA replication is different

143
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
because it's joined to a different kind of membrane. So there's interesting,

144
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
this is detail, you may say, but it's also fundamental because it's about the two

145
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,960
big divergent groups of life on earth that seem to have diverged really early on.

146
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,160
It all started from one organism. And then that organism just start replicating the heck out of

147
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:19,280
itself with some mutation of the DNA. So there's a competition through the process of evolution.

148
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,760
They're not like trying to beat each other up. They're just trying to live the way.

149
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
They're just replicators. Yeah. Well, let's not minimize their...

150
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,880
Yeah.

151
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,760
They're just trying to chill. They're trying to relax up in the... But there's no sense of trying

152
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,520
to survive. They're replicating... I mean, there's no sense in which they're trying to do anything.

153
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
They're just a kind of an outgrowth of the earth, you might say.

154
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,520
Of course, the aliens would describe us humans in that same way.

155
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,120
They might be right.

156
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,360
This primitive life. It's just ants that are hairless, mostly hairless.

157
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
Overgrown ants.

158
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,280
Overgrown ants. Okay. What do you think about the idea of panspermia, that the theory that

159
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,560
life did not originate on earth and was planted here from outer space? Or pseudo panspermia,

160
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,880
which is like the basic ingredients, the magic that you mentioned was planted here

161
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
from elsewhere in space?

162
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,280
I don't find them helpful. That's not to say they're wrong.

163
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,920
So, pseudo panspermia, the idea that the chemicals, the amino acids, the nucleotides are

164
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
being delivered from space. Well, we know that happens. It's unequivocal. They're delivered on

165
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,040
meteorites, comets, and so on. So, what do they do next? That's to me the question.

166
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,520
Well, what do they do is they stock a soup, like presumably they land in a pond or in an ocean or

167
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,640
wherever they land. And then you end up with a best possible case scenario is you end up with

168
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,560
a super-nucleotides and amino acids. And then you have to say, so now what happens? And the

169
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,320
answer is, oh, well, they have to go become alive. So, how did they do that? You may as well say,

170
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,080
then a miracle happened. I don't believe in soup. I think what we have in event is a continuous

171
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,280
conversion, a continuous growth, a continuous reaction, a continuous converting a flow of

172
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,520
molecules into more of yourself, you might say, even if it's a small bit. So, you've got

173
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,760
a kind of continuous self-organization and growth from the very beginning. You never have that in

174
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:24,080
a soup. Isn't the entire universe and living organisms in the universe? Isn't it just soup

175
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,080
all the way down? Isn't it all soup? No, no. I mean, soup almost by definition doesn't have a

176
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,640
structure. But soup is a collection of ingredients that are like randomly... Yeah, but they're not

177
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,080
random. They're not. I mean, we have chemistry going on here. We have metal grains forming,

178
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,640
which are, you know, effective oil-water interactions. Okay, so it feels like there's a

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,120
direction to a process, like a directive process. There are directions to processes, yeah.

180
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,520
And if you're starting with CO2 and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together

181
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,880
and they react, what are they going to make? Well, they make carboxylic acids, which include

182
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,400
the fatty acids that make up the cell membranes. And they form directly into bilayer membranes.

183
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,280
They form like soap bubbles. It's spontaneous organization caused by the nature of the

184
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,840
molecules. And those things are capable of growing and are capable in effect of being

185
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,720
selected even before there are genes. We have that. So, we have a lot of order. And that order is

186
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,000
coming from thermodynamics. And the thermodynamics is always about increasing the entropy of the

187
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
universe. But if you have oil and water and they're separating, you're increasing the entropy of

188
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,320
the universe, even though you've got some order, which is the soap and the water are not missable.

189
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:44,800
Now, to come back to your first question about panspermia properly, that just pushes the question

190
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,600
somewhere else. That just, even if it's true, maybe life did start on earth by panspermia. But

191
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,920
so, what are the principles that govern the emergence of life on any planet? It's an assumption

192
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,720
that life started here. And it's an assumption that it started in a hydrothermal vent or it started

193
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,920
in a terrestrial geothermal system. The question is, can we work out a testable sequence of events

194
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,320
that would lead from one to the other one, and then test it and see if there's any truth in it

195
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,760
or not? With panspermia, you can't do any of that. But the fundamental question of panspermia is,

196
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:29,040
do we have the machine here on earth to build life? Is the vents enough? Is oxygen and hydrogen

197
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,760
and whatever the heck else we want and some source of energy and heat, is that enough to build life?

198
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:44,640
Well, that's, of course, you would say that as a human. But there could be aliens right now

199
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:54,560
chuckling at that idea. Maybe you need some special sauce. Your sense is we have everything here.

200
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,080
I mean, this is precisely the question. I like to, when I'm talking in schools, I like to start

201
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,080
out with the idea of, we can make a time machine. We go back four billion years. And we go to these

202
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,640
environments that people talk about. We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent. We go to a kind of

203
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,000
Yellowstone Park type place environment. And we find some slime that looks like we can

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,480
test it. It's made of organic molecules. It's got a structure, which is not obviously cells, but

205
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,480
is this a stepping stone on the way to life or not? How do we know? Unless we've got an

206
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
intellectual framework that says, this is a stepping stone, and that's not a step. We'd

207
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
never know. We wouldn't know which environment to go to, what to look for, how to say this.

208
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
So all we can ever hope for, because we're never going to build that time machine,

209
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,880
is to have an intellectual framework that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,

210
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,000
how we go from a sterile inorganic planet to living cells as we know them. And in that framework,

211
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
every time you have a choice, it could be this way, or it could be that way, or there's lots of

212
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,120
possible forks down that road. Did it have to be that way? Could it have been the other way,

213
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
and would that have given you life with very different properties?

214
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,920
And so if you come up with a, it's a long hypothesis, because as I say, we're going from

215
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,000
really simple prebiotic chemistry all the way through to genes and molecular machines. That's

216
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,960
a long, long pathway, and nobody in the field would agree on the order in which these things

217
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,800
happened, which is not a bad thing, because it means that you have to go out and do some experiments

218
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,840
and try and demonstrate that it's possible or not possible.

219
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:40,960
It's so freaking amazing that it happened though. It feels like there's a direction to the thing.

220
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:49,280
Can you try to answer from a framework perspective of what is life?

221
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:59,040
So you said there's some order, and yet there's complexity. So it's not perfectly ordered.

222
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,120
It's not boring. There's still some fun in it. And it also feels like the processes have a direction

223
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,040
through the selection mechanism. They seem to be building something always better, always

224
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,080
improving. I mean, maybe it's- I mean, that's a perception. That's our romanticization of

225
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,800
things are always better. Things are getting better. We'd like to believe that.

226
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,720
I mean, you think about the world from the point of view of bacteria, and bacteria are the first

227
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,680
things to emerge from whatever environment they came from, and they dominated the planet very,

228
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,640
very quickly. And they haven't really changed. Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.

229
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,680
So if about four billion years ago, bacteria started to really run the show, and then nothing

230
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,080
happened for a while. Nothing happened for two billion years. Then after two billion years,

231
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,920
we see another single event origin, if you like, of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells,

232
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,800
cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside. Another singular origin, it only

233
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,880
happened once in the history of life on Earth. Maybe it happened multiple times, and there's no

234
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,080
evidence, everything just disappeared. But we have to at least take it seriously, that there's

235
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,400
something that stops bacteria from becoming more complex, because they didn't. That's a fact that

236
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,920
they emerged four billion years ago, and something happened two billion years ago, but the bacteria

237
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
themselves didn't change. They remain bacterial. So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory

238
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,400
towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it. It's very easy to imagine that without

239
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,880
photosynthesis arising, or without eukaryotes arising, that a planet could be full of bacteria

240
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,840
and nothing else. We'll get to that, because that's a brilliant invention. And there's a few

241
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,240
brilliant invention along the way. But what is life? If you were to show up on Earth, but to

242
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,440
take that time machine, and you said, asking yourself the question, is this a stepping stone

243
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,160
towards life? As you step along, when you see the early bacteria, how would you know it's life?

244
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,920
This is really important question when you go to other planets and look for life.

245
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,520
What is the framework of telling a difference between a rock and a bacteria?

246
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,480
I mean, the question's kind of both impossible to answer and trivial at the same time,

247
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,560
and I don't like to answer it, because I don't think there is an answer. I think we're trying to

248
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,760
describe the process at the same time. There's lots of at least 40 or 50 different definitions

249
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,760
of life out there, and most of them are obviously bad in one way or another.

250
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,800
I mean, there's freaks. I can never remember the exact words that people use, but there's a NASA

251
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:48,400
working definition of life, which more or less says a system which is capable of a

252
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,680
self-sustaining system capable of evolution or something along those lines.

253
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,600
And I immediately have a problem with the words self-sustaining, because it's sustained by the

254
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,400
environment. And I know what they're getting at. I know what they're trying to say, but I pick a

255
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,360
hole in that. And there's always wags who say, but by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.

256
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Only a pair of rabbits would be alive, because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.

257
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,040
There are all kinds of pedantic, silly, but also important, objections to any hypothesis.

258
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:25,200
The real question is what is... We can argue all day, or people do argue all day about,

259
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,880
is a virus alive or not? And it depends on the content. But most biologists could not agree

260
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,160
about that. So then what about a jumping gene, a retro element or something like that? It's even

261
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:41,520
simpler than a virus, but it's capable of converting its environment into a copy of itself.

262
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,880
And that's about as close... This is not a definition, but this is a kind of a description of life,

263
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,160
is that it's able to parasitize the environment, and that goes for plants as well as animals and

264
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:02,320
bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy of themselves, information on the

265
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,000
exact copy of themselves. By the way, it doesn't really have to be a copy of itself, right? It just

266
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,200
has to be... You have to create something that's interesting. The way evolution is... So it is

267
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,280
extremely powerful process of evolution, which is basically make a copy yourself and sometimes mess

268
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,680
up a little bit. Okay, that seems to work really well. I wonder if it's possible to

269
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,760
mess up big time as a standard, as the default. It's called a hopeful monster. And

270
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,840
in principle, it can. Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due a reemergence. This

271
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,440
is some amazing work from Michael Levin. I don't know if you came across him, but

272
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,800
if you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him. Yeah, yeah, I'm talking to him in

273
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,160
a few days. Oh, fantastic. So I mentioned there's two people that, if I may mention,

274
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,560
Andre Capati is a friend who's really admired in the AI community, said you absolutely must talk

275
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,520
to Michael and to Nick. So this, of course, I'm a huge fan of yours, so I'm really fortunate

276
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,640
that we can actually make this happen. Anyway, your second. Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work

277
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,200
basically about the way in which electrical fields control development.

278
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
And he's done some work with planarian worms, so flatworms, where he'll tell you all about

279
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
this. So I won't say any more than the minimum, but basically you can cut their head off and they'll

280
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,880
redevelop a different, a new head. But the head that they develop depends if you knock out just one

281
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,200
iron pump in a membrane, so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,

282
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,080
you can come up with a completely different head. It can be a head which is similar to those that

283
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,640
diverged 150 million years ago, or it can be a head which no one's ever seen before, a different

284
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,880
kind of head. Now, that is really, you might say a hopeful monster. This is a kind of leap into a

285
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,160
different direction. The only question for natural selection is, does it work? Is the change itself

286
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,960
feasible as a single change? And the answer is yes, it's just a small change to a single gene.

287
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,800
And the second thing is it gives rise to a completely different morphology.

288
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:23,440
Does it work? And if it works, that can easily be a shift. But for it to be a speciation, for it to

289
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:31,920
continue, for it to give rise to a different morphology over time, then it has to be perpetuated.

290
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:40,400
So that shift, that change in that one gene has to work well enough that it is selected and it

291
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,680
goes on. And copied enough times to where you can really test it. So the likelihood it would be

292
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,320
lost, but there will be some occasions where it survives. And yes, the idea that we can have

293
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,560
sudden fairly abrupt changes in evolution I think is time for a rebirth. What about this idea that

294
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:05,040
kind of trying to mathematicalize a definition of life and saying how many steps, the shortest

295
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,880
amount of steps it takes to build the thing, almost like an engineering view of it?

296
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I like that view, because I think that in a sense that's not very far away from what a

297
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,400
hypothesis needs to do to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life. You need to spell out,

298
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,480
here's each step, and here's the experiment to do for each step. The idea that we can do it in the

299
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,680
lab, some people say, well, we'll have created life within five years, but ask them what they

300
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:38,880
mean by life. We have a planet four billion years ago with these vent systems across the entire

301
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,720
surface of the planet, and we have millions of years if we wanted. I have a feeling that we're

302
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,920
not talking about millions of years. I have a feeling we're talking about maybe millions of

303
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,080
nanoseconds or picoseconds. We're talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.

304
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,960
But we still need to constrain those steps, but we've got a planet doing similar chemistry. You

305
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,480
asked about a trajectory. The trajectory is the planetary trajectory. The planet has properties.

306
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,920
See, it's basically got a lot of iron at the center of it. It's got a lot of electrons at the

307
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,640
center of it. It's more oxidized on the outside, partly because of the sun, and partly because

308
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,480
the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases. The planet is a battery, it's a giant battery.

309
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,480
We have a flow of electrons going from inside to outside in these hydrothermal vents, and that's

310
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,560
the same topology that a cell has. A cell is basically just a microversion of the planet.

311
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,840
There is a trajectory in all of that, and there's an inevitability that certain types of chemical

312
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,160
reaction are going to be favored over others. There's an inevitability in what happens in water,

313
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,840
the chemistry that happens in water. Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes and

314
00:29:51,840 --> 00:30:00,080
will form insoluble structures. Nobody really understands water very well. It's another big

315
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,600
question for experiments on the origin of life. What do you put it in? What kind of structure do

316
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,880
we want to induce in this water? Because the last thing it's likely to be is just bulk water.

317
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,240
How fundamental is water to life, would you say?

318
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,960
I would say pretty fundamental. I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life to start any other

319
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:30,160
way, but water is everywhere. Water is extremely good at what it does, and carbon works in water

320
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,600
especially well. Carbon is everywhere. Those things together make me think probabilistically,

321
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,120
if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them would be carbon-based and living in water.

322
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,280
Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water elsewhere and some carbon,

323
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,680
no, just a puddle of water. Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication that life

324
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:03,840
either exists here or has once existed here? No. So it doesn't work the other way.

325
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,720
I think you need a living planet. You need a planet which is capable of turning over its surface. It

326
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,360
needs to be a planet with water. It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons from inside

327
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,920
to the outside. It needs to turn over its surface. It needs to make that water work and turn it into

328
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,160
hydrogen. So I think you need a living planet. But once you've got the living planet, I think the

329
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,480
rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way. So if you were to run Earth over a million times,

330
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:41,600
up to this point, maybe beyond, to the end. Let's run it to the end. What is it? How much

331
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,280
variety is there? You kind of spoke to this trajectory that the environment dictates

332
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,320
like chemically, I don't know in which other way, spiritually, like dictates kind of the

333
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:04,000
direction of this giant machine that seems chaotic, but it does seem to have order in the

334
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,400
steps it's taking. How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge? How often will something

335
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,200
like humans emerge? How much variety do you think there would be? I think at the level of bacteria,

336
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,800
not much variety. I think we would get, that's how many times you say you want to run it a

337
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,840
million times. I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.

338
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,160
Because I think there's some level of inevitability that a wet rocky planet will give rise through

339
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,040
the same processes to something very, I think this is not something I'd have thought a few years ago,

340
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,200
but we're working with a PhD student of mine, Stuart Harrison. He's been thinking about the

341
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,960
genetic code, and we've just been publishing on that. There are patterns that you can discern

342
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,480
in the code, or he has discerned in the code, that if you think about them in terms of we start

343
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,720
with CO2 and hydrogen, and that these are the first steps of biochemistry, you come up with a code

344
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
which is very similar to the code that we see. It wouldn't surprise me any longer if we found

345
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,400
life on Mars and it had a genetic code that was not very different to the genetic code that we have

346
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,160
here without it just being transferred across. There's some inevitability about the whole of

347
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,480
the beginnings of life in my view. That's really promising because if the basic chemistry is tightly

348
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:30,400
linked to the genetic code, that means we can interact with other life if it exists out there.

349
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,000
Well, that's potentially... That's really exciting if that's the case. Okay, but then bacteria...

350
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,920
We've got bacteria. How easy is photosynthesis? Much harder, I would say.

351
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Let's actually go there. Let's go through the inventions. What is photosynthesis and why is

352
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,680
it hard? Well, there are different forms. Basically, you're taking hydrogen and you're

353
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,920
sticking it onto CO2 and it's powered by the sun. The question is where are you taking the hydrogen

354
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,600
from? And in photosynthesis that we know in plants, it's coming from water. So you're using the power

355
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,400
of the sun to split water, take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2, and the oxygen is a waste

356
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,800
product and you just throw it out, throw it away. So it's the single greatest planetary pollution

357
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,520
event in the whole history of the earth. The pollutant being oxygen. Yes. It also made possible

358
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,480
animals. You can't have large active animals without an oxygenated atmosphere, at least not

359
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,000
in the sense that we know on earth. So that's a really big invention in the history of earth.

360
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,880
Huge invention, yes. And it happened once. There's a few things that happen once on earth and you're

361
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,520
always stuck with this problem. Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly that it precluded

362
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,480
the same thing happening ever again? Or are there other reasons? And we really have to look at each

363
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,600
one in turn and think, why did it only happen once? In this case, it's really difficult to split

364
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,160
water. It requires a lot of power and that power, you're effectively separating charge across a

365
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,040
membrane and the way in which you do it, if it doesn't all rush back and kind of cause an explosion

366
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,720
right at the site, requires really careful wiring. And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right

367
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,040
because the plants that we see around us, they have chloroplasts. Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria

368
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,760
ones. Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria that can do that type of photosynthesis.

369
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,840
So there's plenty of opportunity. So not even many bacteria. So who invented photosynthesis?

370
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,960
The cyanobacteria or their ancestors. And there's not many...

371
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,520
No other bacteria can do what's called oxygenic photosynthesis. Lots of other bacteria can split.

372
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,760
You can take your hydrogen from somewhere else. You can take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling

373
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,800
out of a hydrothermal vent, grab your two. Hydrogens, the sulfur is the waste now.

374
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You can do it from iron. You can take electrons. So the early oceans were probably full of iron.

375
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,680
You can take an electron from ferrous iron, so iron 2 plus and make it iron 3 plus,

376
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,600
which now precipitates as rust. And you take a proton from the acidic early ocean,

377
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,240
stick it there. Now you've got a hydrogen atom, stick it onto CO2. You've just done the trick.

378
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,480
The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron. And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.

379
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,280
One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis is so much better is the waste product is oxygen,

380
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,320
which just bubbles away. That seems like extremely unlikely. And it's extremely

381
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,880
essential for the evolution of complex organisms because of all the oxygen.

382
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah. And that didn't accumulate quickly either. So it's converting, what is it?

383
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,200
It's converting energy from the sun and the resource of water into the resource needed for

384
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,480
animals. Both resources needed for animals. We need to eat and we need to burn the food.

385
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,480
And we're eating plants, which are getting their energy from the sun, and we're burning it with

386
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,560
their waste product, which is the oxygen. So there's a lot of kind of circularity in that.

387
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:14,880
But without an oxygenated planet, you couldn't really have predation. You can have animals,

388
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,640
but you can't really have animals that go around and eat each other. You can't have ecosystems,

389
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,320
as we know them. Well, let's actually step back. What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells,

390
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,840
prokaryotes? What are each of those and how big of an invention is that?

391
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,800
I personally think that's the single biggest invention in the whole history of life.

392
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,600
Exciting. So what are they? Can you explain?

393
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,920
Yeah. So I mentioned bacteria and archaea. These are both prokaryotes.

394
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,960
They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus. If you look at them under a microscope,

395
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,560
you don't see much going on. If you look at them under a super resolution microscope,

396
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,440
then they're fantastically complex. In terms of their molecular machinery, they're amazing.

397
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,320
In terms of their morphological appearance under a microscope, they're really small

398
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,600
and really simple. The earliest life that we can physically see on the planet are

399
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,960
stromatolites, which are made by things like cyanobacteria and their large superstructures.

400
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,280
Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other and you end up with quite large structures

401
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,960
that you can see in the fossil record. But they never came out with animals.

402
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,560
They never came out with plants. They came out with multicellular things,

403
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,800
filamentous cyanobacteria, for example. They're just long strings of cells.

404
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:37,200
But the origin of the eukaryotic cell seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis.

405
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,360
So one cell gets inside another cell. I think that that's transformed the energetic possibilities

406
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,360
of life. So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell, which can have a much larger

407
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,240
nucleus with many more genes, all supported. If you think about it, you could think about it as

408
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,320
multi-bacterial power without the overhead. So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria

409
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,960
living in it. And those bacteria are providing it with the energy currency it needs. But each

410
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,760
bacterium has a genome of its own, which costs a fair amount of energy to express, to kind of turn

411
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,200
over and convert into proteins and so on. What the mitochondria did, which are these

412
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,760
power packs in our own cells, they were bacteria once and they threw away virtually all their

413
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,120
genes. They've only got a few left. So mitochondria is, like you said, is the bacteria that got inside

414
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,240
a cell and then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to survive inside the cell and then

415
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,560
kept what? So what we end up with, so it kept always a handful of genes in our own case, 37 genes.

416
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,880
But there's a few protists, which are single cells, things that have got as many as 70 or 80

417
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,800
genes. So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number. And you can think of it as a

418
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,720
paired down power pack where the control unit has really been kind of paired down to almost nothing.

419
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,760
So you're putting out the same power, but the investment in the overheads is really paired

420
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,680
down. That means that you can support a much larger nuclear genome. So we've gone up in the

421
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,840
number of genes, but also the amount of power you have to convert those genes into proteins.

422
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,280
We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes, but in terms of the size of genomes and

423
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,000
your ability to make the building blocks, make the proteins, we've gone up a hundred thousand

424
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,200
fold or more. So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution. And it's interesting

425
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,400
then that the only, the only two occasions that complex life has arisen on earth, plants and

426
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,120
animals, fungi, you could say are complex as well, but they don't form such complex morphology as

427
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,120
plants and animals. Start with a single cell. They start with an oocyte and a sperm fused together

428
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,080
to make as I got. So you start development with a single cell and all the cells in the organism

429
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,920
have identical DNA. And you switch off in the brain, you switch off these genes and you switch on

430
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,720
those genes and the liver, you switch off those and you switch on a different set.

431
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,520
And the standard evolutionary explanation for that is that you've, you know, you're

432
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,840
restricting conflict. You don't have a load of genetically different cells that are all fighting

433
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,280
each other. And so it works. The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms and they're

434
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,480
all genetically different. And effectively, they're incapable of that level of cooperation.

435
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,760
They would get in the fight. Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention

436
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:38,000
of getting this bacteria inside and becoming an engine, which the mitochondria is? Why was that?

437
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,080
Why do you assign it such great importance? Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty

438
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,800
of how was to achieve a great importance in terms of the impact they had on life?

439
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,080
Both. It had a huge impact on life because if that had not happened, you can be certain

440
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,080
that life on earth would be bacterial only. And that took a really long time to...

441
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,640
It took two billion years. And it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge.

442
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,280
So it looks as if it's genuinely difficult. And if you think about it then from just an

443
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,240
informational perspective, you think bacteria have got, they structure their information

444
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,960
differently. So a bacterial cell has a small genome, you might have 4,000 genes in it,

445
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,640
but a single E. coli cell has access to about 30,000 genes. Potentially, it's got a kind of

446
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,840
metagenome where other E. coli out there have got different gene sets and they can switch them

447
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:36,160
around between themselves. And so you can generate a huge amount of variation and they've got more...

448
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,640
An E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome. We own 20,000 genes or something.

449
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,920
So... And they've had 4 billion years of evolution to work out what can I do and what can't I do

450
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
with this metagenome. And the answer is you're stuck. You're still bacteria.

451
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,200
So they have explored genetic sequence space far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did

452
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,840
because they've had twice as long at least and they've got much larger populations.

453
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,640
And they never got around this problem. So why can't they? It seems as if you can't solve it

454
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:18,640
with information alone. So what's the problem? The problem is structure. If cells...

455
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,080
If the very first cells need an electrical charge on their membrane to grow

456
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,520
and in bacteria, it's the outer membrane that surrounds the cell, which is electrically charged.

457
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,240
You try and scale that up and you've got a fundamental design problem. You've got an

458
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,280
engineering problem. And there are examples of it and what we see in all these cases is what's

459
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,200
known as extreme polyploidy, which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies of their

460
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:49,200
complete genome, which is energetically hugely expensive and you end up with a large bacteria with

461
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,800
no further development. What you need is to incorporate these electrically charged power

462
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,200
pack units inside with their control units intact. And for them not to conflict so much

463
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,840
with the host cell that it all goes wrong. Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.

464
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:14,160
And then you change the topology of the cell. Now, you don't necessarily have any more DNA

465
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,840
than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy. But what you've got is an asymmetry. You now have a

466
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:26,640
giant nuclear genome surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes that do all the...

467
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,520
And they're the control units that are doing all the control of energy generation.

468
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,200
Could this have been done gradually or does it have to be done?

469
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,080
The power pack has to be all intact and ready to go and work.

470
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,760
I mean, it's a kind of step change in the possibilities of evolution, but it doesn't

471
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,360
happen overnight. It's going to still require multiple, multiple generations. So it could take

472
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,360
millions of years. It could take shorter time. This is another thing I would like to put the

473
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,520
number of steps and try and work out what's required at each step. And we are trying to do

474
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,160
that with sex for example. You can't have a very large genome unless you have sex at that point.

475
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,800
So what are the changes to go from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?

476
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,040
What do you need to do? Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA as if it's loose

477
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,560
change to fusing cells together, lining up the chromosomes, recombining across the chromosomes

478
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,520
and then going through two rounds of cell division to produce your gametes? All eukaryotes do it that

479
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,400
way. So again, why switch? What are the drivers here? So there's a lot of time, there's a lot of

480
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,680
evolution, but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell, what you've got is a new

481
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,000
design. You've got new potential that you didn't have before. So the cell living inside another cell,

482
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:52,640
that design allows for better storage of information, better use of energy, more delegation,

483
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,640
like a hierarchical control of the whole thing. And then somehow that leads to ability to have

484
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,920
multi-cell organisms. I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily, but you've

485
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,920
got a system where you can have a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus. You

486
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,000
can have a much larger genome. And that allows multicellularity, yes, because it allows you...

487
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:25,120
It's a funny thing, but to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes switched on in my brain

488
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,680
and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something, you've got to have all those genes

489
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,360
in the egg cell at the very beginning. And you've got to have a program of development

490
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,200
which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes and switch on those genes and you guys,

491
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,880
you do that. But all the genes are there at the beginning. That means you've got to have a lot

492
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,800
of genes in one cell and you've got to be able to maintain them. And the problem with bacteria is

493
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,600
they don't get close to having enough genes in one cell. So if you were to try and make a

494
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,680
multicellular organism from bacteria, you'd bring different types of bacteria together and hope

495
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,480
they'll cooperate and the reality is they don't. That's really, really tough to do. Yeah. We know

496
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,360
they don't because it doesn't exist. We have the data, as far as we know. I'm sure there's a few

497
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,480
like special ones and they get off quickly. I'd love to know some of the most fun things bacteria

498
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:17,120
have done since. I mean, they can do some pretty funky things. This is big, this is broad brush

499
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:24,160
joke that I'm talking about. Yes, generally speaking. So how was another fun invention?

500
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,800
Us humans seem to utilize it well, but you say it's also very important early on is sex.

501
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:38,800
So what is sex? Just asking for a friend. And when was it invented and how hard was it

502
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,800
to invent? Just as you were saying, and why was it invented? Why, how hard was it and when?

503
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,600
I have a PhD student who's been working on this and we've just published a couple of papers on

504
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,640
sex. Yes, yes, yes. What do you publish? Does biology? Is it biology, genetics, journals?

505
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,080
This is actually PNAS, which is Proceedings of the National Academy.

506
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:07,120
Broad, big pictures. Everyone's interested in sex. The job of biologist is to make sex dull.

507
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,240
Yes. Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it. Okay. So when was it invented?

508
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:20,240
It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago. All eukaryotes share the same basic

509
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,280
mechanism that you produce gametes. The gametes fuse together. So a gamete is the egg cell and

510
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,680
the sperm. They're not necessarily even different in size or shape. So the simplest eukaryotes produce

511
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,200
what are called motile gametes. They're all like sperm and they all swim around. They find

512
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,920
each other. They fuse together. They don't have kind of much going on there beyond that.

513
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:47,200
And then these are haploid, which is to say we all have two copies of our genome and the gametes

514
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,840
have only a single copy of the genome. So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,

515
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,520
which is to say you now have two copies of your genome. And what you do is you line them all up

516
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,840
and then you double everything. So now we have four copies of the complete genome.

517
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,600
And then we crisscross between all of these things. So we take a bit from here and stick it on there

518
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:13,840
and a bit from here and we stick it on here. That's recombination. And then we go through two rounds

519
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,400
of cell division. So we divide in half. So now the two daughter cells have two copies and we

520
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,440
divide in half again. Now we have some gametes, each of which has got a single copy of the genome.

521
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,880
And that's the basic ground plan for what's called meiosis and syngamy. That's basically sex.

522
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,120
And it happens at the level of single-celled organisms and it happens pretty much the same

523
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,680
way in plants and pretty much the same way in animals and so on. And it's not found in any bacteria.

524
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,160
They switch things around using the same machinery and they take up a bit of DNA

525
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,160
from the environment. They take out this bit and stick in that bit and it's the same molecular

526
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,640
machinery they're using to do it. So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,

527
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,600
this kind of imperative to find each other. What is that? Like is that? Well, you've got a few cells

528
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:07,200
together. So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria. I mean, it's kind of simple when you've

529
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,520
figured it out and figuring it out. This is not me. This is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.

530
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:20,080
And in effect, if you're doing lateral, you're a Nikolaicel. You've got 4,000 genes. You want to

531
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:27,680
scale up to a eukaryotic size. I want to have 20,000 genes. And I need to maintain my genome

532
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,720
so it doesn't get shot to pieces by mutations. And I'm going to do it by lateral gene transfer.

533
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,800
So I know I've got a mutation in a gene. I don't know which gene it is because I'm not sentient,

534
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,200
but I know I can't grow. I know all my regulation systems are saying something wrong here,

535
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,560
something wrong. Pick up some DNA. Pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.

536
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,200
If you've got a small genome, the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA from the

537
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,400
environment is much higher than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes. To do that, you've

538
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,640
effectively got to be picking up DNA all the time, all day long, and nothing else. And you're

539
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,320
still going to get the wrong DNA. You've got to pick up large chunks. And in the end, you've got

540
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:17,440
to align them. You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase. So there is a kind of incentive.

541
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,640
If you want to have a large genome, you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.

542
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,880
That will happen with bacteria. There's another reason why bacteria can't have a large genome.

543
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,320
But as soon as you give them the power pack, as soon as you give you carotid cells the power pack

544
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,640
that allows them to increase the size of their genome, then you face the pressure that you've

545
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,240
got to maintain its quality. You've got to stop it just mutating away.

546
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,840
What about sexual selection? So the finding, I don't like this one. I don't like this one. This

547
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:52,320
one seems all right. At which point does it become less random?

548
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,920
It's hard to know. Because eukaryotes just float around.

549
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,120
I mean, is there sexual selection in single celled eukaryotes? The probably is. It's just

550
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,440
that I don't know very much about it. By the time we get on to it.

551
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,560
If you don't hang out with the eukaryotes. Well, I do all the time, but I can't communicate with

552
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:16,480
them yet. A peacock or something. This is not quite what I work on, but the standard answer

553
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:24,880
is that it's female mate choice. She is looking for good genes. If you can have a tail that's like

554
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,840
this and still survive, still be alive, not actually have been taken down by the nearest

555
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,680
predator, then you must have got pretty good genes. Because despite this handicap,

556
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,160
you're able to survive. So those are like human interpretable things,

557
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,160
like with a peacock. But I wonder, I'm sure echos of the same thing

558
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:50,160
are there with more primitive organisms. Basically, your PR, like how you advertise

559
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:57,040
yourself that you're worthy of. So one big advertisement is the fact that you survived

560
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:05,440
it all. Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom. And this can be a cyanobacteria.

561
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,120
It's going to be in bacteria. So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate or something

562
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,720
into the ocean and everything goes green, you end up with all this algae growing there.

563
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,640
A viral infection or something like that can kill the entire bloom overnight.

564
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,480
And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight. It's that most of the cells in that

565
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,680
bloom kill themselves before the virus can get onto them. And it's through a form of cell death

566
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,680
called programmed cell death. And we do the same things. This is how we have the different,

567
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,000
the gaps between our fingers and so on is how we craft synapses in the brain.

568
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:50,480
It's fundamental again to multicellular life. They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.

569
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,600
How do they know who dies? The answer is they will often put out a toxin. And that toxin

570
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,400
is kind of a challenge to you. Either you can cope with the toxin or you can't. If you can cope with

571
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,120
it, you form a spore and you will go on to become the next generation. You form a kind of a resistance

572
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,600
spore. You sink down a little bit. You get out of the way. You can't be attacked by a virus if

573
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,400
you're a spore or at least not so easily. Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin, you pull the

574
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,560
plug and you trigger your death apparatus and you kill yourself. It's truly life and death

575
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,080
solution. Yeah. So it's really, it's a challenge. And this is a bit like sexual selection. It's not

576
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,520
they're all pretty much genetically identical, but they've had different life histories. So

577
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,440
have you had a tough day? Did you happen to get infected by this virus or did you run out of iron

578
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,280
or did you get a bit too much sun? Whatever it may be, if this extra stress of the toxin just

579
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,120
pushes you over the edge, then you have this binary choice. Either you're the next generation

580
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,000
or you kill yourself now using the same machinery. It's also actually exactly the way I approach

581
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,400
dating, but that's probably why I'm single. Okay. What about if we can step back DNA?

582
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:13,760
Just mechanism of storing information. RNA, DNA. Yeah. How big of an invention was that? That seems

583
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:23,280
to be, that seems to be fundamental to like something deep within what life is, is the ability,

584
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,360
as you said, to kind of store and propagate information. But then you also kind of infer

585
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,440
with your and your students' work that there's a deep connection between the chemistry and the

586
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:42,800
ability to have this kind of genetic information. So how big of an invention is it to have a nice

587
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,640
representation, a nice hard drive for info to pass on? Huge, I suspect. I mean, but

588
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,320
when I was talking about the code, you see the code in RNA as well. And RNA almost certainly came

589
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:01,440
first. And there's been an idea going back decades called the RNA world because RNA in theory can

590
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,200
copy itself and can catalyze reactions. So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.

591
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,640
The DNA, it's possible, is not that special. So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work,

592
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,240
really. And the code lies in RNA. The code lies in the interactions between RNA and amino acids.

593
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,680
And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example, which is just kind of a giant ribosome,

594
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:32,400
which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA. So getting to RNA, I suspect it's probably not

595
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:39,600
that hard. But getting from RNA, how do you, you know, there's multiple different types of RNA

596
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,640
now. How do you distinguish? This is something we're actively thinking about. How do you distinguish

597
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:50,480
between, you know, a random population of RNA? Some of them go on to become messenger RNA. This

598
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,800
is the transcript of the code, of the gene that you want to make. Some of them become transfer RNA,

599
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,680
which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid that's going to be polymerized.

600
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,960
Some of them become ribosomal RNA, which is the machine which is joining them all up together.

601
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,640
How do they discriminate themselves? And, you know, there's some kind of phase transition going on

602
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:18,400
there. I don't know. It's a difficult question. And we're now in the region of biology where

603
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,200
information is coming in. But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does. But the

604
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,520
largest genome supported by RNA are RNA viruses like HIV, for example. They're pretty small.

605
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,560
And so there's a limit to how complex life could be unless you come up with DNA, which

606
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,560
chemically is a really small change. But how easy it is to make that change? I don't really know.

607
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,920
As soon as you've got DNA, then you've got an amazingly stable molecule for information storage.

608
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,680
And you can do absolutely anything. But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was? I don't know

609
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:00,800
either. How much possibility is there for variety in ways to store information? Because it seems

610
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:06,560
to be very specific characteristics about the programming language of DNA.

611
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:14,560
Yeah. There's a lot of work going on on what's called Zeno DNA or RNA. Can we replace the bases

612
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,640
themselves, the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA? Can we replace the backbone? Can we replace,

613
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:26,000
for example, phosphate with arsenate? Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose with

614
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,800
a different sugar? And the answer is yes, you can. Within limits, there's not an infinite

615
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:38,000
space there. Arsenate doesn't really work if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate. It's

616
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,240
probably quite hard to replace phosphate. It's possible to do it. The question to me is why is

617
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,680
it this way? Is it because there was some form of selection that this is better than the other

618
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,520
forms and there were lots of competing forms of information storage early on and this one was

619
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,000
the one that worked out? Or was it kind of channeled that way, that these are the molecules that

620
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,080
you're dealing with and they work? And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way that we're

621
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:14,000
channeled towards ribose, phosphate, and the bases that are used. But there are 200 different

622
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,320
letters kicking around out there that could have been used. It's such an interesting question. If

623
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,040
you look at in the programming world in computer science, there's a programming language called

624
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,640
JavaScript, which was written super quickly. It's a giant mess, but it took over the world.

625
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:36,640
It sounds very biological. It was kind of a running joke that surely this can't be.

626
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,480
It's a terrible programming language. It's a giant mess. It's full of bugs. It's so easy to

627
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,280
write really crappy code, but it took over all of front-end development in the web browser.

628
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,320
If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website, it's usually running JavaScript,

629
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,680
and it's now taking over much of the back end, which is like the serious heavy-duty

630
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,800
computational stuff, and it's become super fast with the different compilation engines

631
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,200
that are running it. So it's like, it really took over the world. It's very possible that this

632
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:15,920
initially crappy, derided language actually takes everything over. And then the question is,

633
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:24,240
did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript, or was JavaScript just the first

634
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,840
programming language that ran on the browser and still sticky? The first is the sticky one,

635
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,400
and so it wins over anything else because it was first. I don't think that's answerable,

636
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:42,880
right? But it's good to ask that. I suppose in the lab, you can't run it with programming

637
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:52,080
languages, but in biology, you can probably do some kind of small-scale evolutionary test

638
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:58,080
to try to infer which is which. Yeah. I mean, in a way, we've got the hardware and the software

639
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:04,400
here, and the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself, and then the software, perhaps,

640
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,400
is more about the code. Did the code have to be this way? Could it have been a different way?

641
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,360
People talk about the optimization of the code, and there's some suggestion for that.

642
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,000
I think it's weak, actually. But you could imagine, you could come out with a million

643
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,600
different codes, and this would be one of the best ones. Well, we don't know this.

644
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:29,920
Well, I mean, people have tried to model it based on the effect that mutations would have.

645
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,520
So no, you're right. We don't know it because that's a single assumption that a mutation is

646
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,280
what's being selected on there, and there's other possibilities, too.

647
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,120
I mean, there does seem to be a resilience and a redundancy to the whole thing.

648
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:50,400
Yes. It's hard to mess up, and the way you mess it up often is likely to produce interesting

649
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,800
results. Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?

650
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:00,960
Yeah. Well, I mean, biology is underpinned by this kind of mess, as well. You look at the

651
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,480
human genome, and it's full of stuff that is really either broken or dysfunctional or was

652
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,600
a virus once, whatever it may be, and somehow it works, and maybe we need a lot of this mess.

653
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,160
We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.

654
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,880
So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.

655
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah.

656
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,320
We talked about sex. What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?

657
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:33,120
How, when was that invented? And poetic and biological ways of putting it,

658
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:41,600
how do you describe predator-prayer relationship? Is it a beautiful dance, or is it a violent atrocity?

659
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,680
Well, I guess it's both, isn't it? I mean, when does it start? It starts in bacteria. You see

660
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,800
these amazing predators. Delivibrio is one that, in Margolis, used to talk about a lot.

661
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,640
It's got a kind of a drill piece that drills through the wall and the membrane of the bacterium,

662
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,440
and then it effectively eats the bacterium from just inside the periplasmic space,

663
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,280
and makes copies of itself that way. So that's straight predation. There are predators among

664
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:14,400
bacteria. So predation in that, sorry to interrupt, means you murder somebody and use their body as

665
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,000
a resource in some way. Yeah.

666
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,440
But it's not parasitic in that you need them to be still alive?

667
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,320
No, no. I mean, predation is you kill them, really.

668
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:26,880
You murder.

669
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,280
The parasite is, you kind of live on them.

670
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:35,600
Okay. So, but it seems the predator is the really popular tool.

671
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:43,520
So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years before the Cambrian explosion,

672
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:50,160
there is what's known as the Ediacaran fauna, or sometimes they call Vendobionts,

673
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,720
which is a lovely name. And it's not obvious that they're animals at all.

674
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,400
They're stalked things. They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves with kind of fractal

675
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:09,760
branching patterns on them. And the thing is, they're found sometimes geologists can figure out

676
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,000
the environment that they were in and say, this is more than 200 meters deep because

677
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,560
there's no sign of any waves. There's no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.

678
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,800
They were more than 200 meters deep. So they're definitely not photosynthetic.

679
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,960
These are animals. And they're filter feeders. And we know sponges and corals and things are

680
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,840
filter feeding animals. They're stuck to the spot. And little bits of carbon that come their way.

681
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,080
They filter it out and that's what they're eating.

682
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,960
So no predation involved in this beyond stuff just dies anyway. And it feels like a very gentle,

683
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,160
rather beautiful, rather limited world, you might say. There's not a lot going on there.

684
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,280
And something changes. Oxygen definitely changes during this period. Other things

685
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,920
may have changed as well. But the next thing you really see in the fossil record is the Cambrian

686
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,360
explosion. And what do we see there? We're now seeing animals that we would recognize.

687
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:11,200
They've got ice. They've got claws. They've got shells. They're plainly killing things or running

688
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:20,400
away and hiding. And so we've gone from a rather gentle but limited world to a rather vicious,

689
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:30,000
unpleasant world that we recognize and which leads to kind of arms races, evolutionary arms races.

690
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,640
Which again is something that when we think about a nuclear arms race, we think, Jesus,

691
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:41,040
we don't want to go there. It's not done anybody any good. In some ways, maybe it does do good.

692
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:49,760
I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms. But predation as a mechanism forces organisms to

693
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:56,240
adapt change to be better to escape or to kill. If you need to eat, then you've got to eat. And

694
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:03,520
a cheetah is not going to run at that speed unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.

695
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:10,080
So it leads to much greater feats of evolution would ever have been possible without it. And in

696
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:18,320
the end, to a much more beautiful world. And so it's not all bad by any means. But the thing is,

697
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,280
you can't have this if you don't have an oxygenated planet because it's all in the end. It's about

698
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,320
how much energy can you extract from the food you eat. And if you don't have an oxygenated planet,

699
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:34,080
you can get about 10% out, not much more than that. And if you've got an oxygenated planet,

700
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:38,960
you can get about 40% out. And that means you can have instead of having one or two

701
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,400
trophic levels, you can have five or six trophic levels. And that means things can eat things that

702
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,520
eat other things and so on. And you've gone to a level of ecological complexity, which is completely

703
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,240
impossible in the absence of oxygen. This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote,

704
01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:00,640
that for every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.

705
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:10,400
The history of life on earth, unfortunately, is that of violence, just the trillions and

706
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,960
trillions of multi cell organisms that were murdered in the in the struggled.

707
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,840
It's a sorry statement. But yes, it's basically true.

708
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:26,240
And that somehow is a catalyst from an evolutionary perspective for creativity,

709
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,640
for creating more and more complex organisms that are better and better at surviving.

710
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,120
Survival of the fittest, if you just go back to that old phrase, means death the weakest.

711
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:41,280
Now, what's fit, what's weak, these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning.

712
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,560
But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.

713
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:51,280
One way to die is the constraints, the scarcity of the resources in the environment.

714
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,640
But that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism for death

715
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,240
than other creatures roam about in the environment. When I say environment,

716
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,920
I mean like the static environment. But then there's the dynamic environment of

717
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,760
bigger things trying to eat you and use you for your energy.

718
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,480
It forces you to come up with a solution to your specific problem

719
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,720
that is inventive and is new and hasn't been done before.

720
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:25,920
And so it forces, I mean, literally change, literally evolution on populations,

721
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,280
they have to become different.

722
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:31,600
And it's interesting that humans have channeled that into more,

723
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,040
I mean, I guess what humans are doing is they're inventing

724
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,280
more productive and safe ways of doing that.

725
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,480
You know, this whole idea of morality and all those kinds of things,

726
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:49,840
I think they ultimately lead to competition versus violence.

727
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:56,400
Because I think violence can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.

728
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:02,400
But if you channel that into more controlled competition in the space of ideas,

729
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,080
in the space of approaches to life, maybe you can

730
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,160
be even more productive than evolution is, because evolution is very wasteful.

731
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,560
Like the modern murder required to really test a good idea,

732
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,280
genetically speaking, is just a lot. Many, many, many generations.

733
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,840
Morally, we cannot base society on the way that evolution works.

734
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,200
That's an invention, right?

735
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,320
But actually, in some respects, we do, which is to say,

736
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,880
this is how science works. We have competing hypotheses

737
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,280
that have to get better, otherwise they die.

738
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,480
It's the way that society works. In ancient Greece,

739
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,480
we had the Athens and Sparta and city-states,

740
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,280
and then we had the Renaissance and nation-states.

741
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,840
And universities compete with each other.

742
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,320
Yes.

743
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,680
Tremendous amount of companies competing with each other all the time.

744
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,440
It drives innovation.

745
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,040
And if we want to do it without all the death that we see in nature,

746
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,760
then we have to have some kind of societal level control that says,

747
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,200
well, there's some limits, guys, and these are what the limits are going to be.

748
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,880
And society as a whole has to say, right, we want to limit the amount of death here,

749
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,720
so you can't do this and you can't do that.

750
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,960
And who makes up these rules and how do we know?

751
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,440
It's a tough thing, but it's basically trying to find a moral basis

752
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,960
for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection

753
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,720
and keeping the innovation and the richness of it.

754
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,760
And I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal,

755
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,320
probably curve out of it, murder is illegal,

756
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,160
except when it's done to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.

757
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,160
So we still have wars.

758
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,400
But we are struggling with this idea that murder is a bad thing.

759
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,400
It's so interesting how we're channeling the best of the evolutionary imperative

760
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,600
and trying to get rid of the stuff that's not productive.

761
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,560
So trying to almost accelerate evolution,

762
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:07,280
the same kind of thing that makes evolution creative, we're trying to use that.

763
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,560
I think we naturally do it.

764
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,480
I mean, I don't think we can help ourselves do it.

765
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,560
Capitalism as a form is basically about competition and differential rewards.

766
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:25,120
But society, and I keep using this word moral obligation,

767
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,760
we cannot operate as a society if we go that way.

768
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,120
It's interesting that we've had problems achieving balance.

769
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,640
So for example, in the financial crash in 2009,

770
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,200
do you let banks go to the wall or not?

771
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,880
This is kind of question.

772
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,960
In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall,

773
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,280
and in that sense, you don't need the regulation because they just die.

774
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:56,240
Whereas if we as a society think about what's required for society as a whole,

775
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,400
then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall.

776
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:05,360
In which case, you then have to impose some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will

777
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,040
in an evolutionary manner exploit.

778
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,720
Yeah, we've been struggling with this kind of idea of capitalism,

779
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:19,600
the cold brutality of capitalism that seems to create so much beautiful things in this world,

780
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:26,480
and then the ideals of communism that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.

781
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,400
We struggle with ideas of, well, maybe we didn't do it right.

782
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,600
How can we do things better?

783
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,840
And then the ideas are the things we're playing with as opposed to people.

784
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,960
If a PhD student has a bad idea, we don't shoot the PhD student.

785
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,920
We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.

786
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,120
You have a very humane lamp.

787
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,520
Yeah, I don't know how you guys do it.

788
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,280
You know, the way I run things, it's always life and death.

789
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,560
Okay, so it is interesting about humans that there is an inner sense of morality,

790
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,320
which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?

791
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:08,880
If we think about the invention of early invention of sex and early invention of predation,

792
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,240
what was the thing invented to make humans?

793
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,560
What would you say?

794
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,120
I mean, I suppose a couple of things I'd say.

795
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,080
Number one is you don't have to wind the clock back very far, five, six million years or so,

796
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,560
and let it run forwards again.

797
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,240
And the chances of humans, as we know them, is not necessarily that high.

798
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,200
Now, you know, imagine, as an alien, you find planet Earth and it's got everything

799
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,280
apart from humans on it, it's an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet,

800
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,520
but nothing that we would recognize as extremely intelligent life,

801
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,680
kind of space-faring civilization.

802
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,600
So when we think about aliens, we're kind of after something like ourselves,

803
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,680
or after a space-faring civilization.

804
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,760
We're not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things.

805
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,880
Amazing though they are.

806
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:05,520
But the additional kind of evolutionary steps to go from large complex mammals, monkeys, let's say,

807
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:12,960
to humans doesn't strike me as that longer a distance.

808
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,400
It's all about the brain.

809
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,040
And where's the brain and morality coming from?

810
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:22,320
It seems to me to be all about groups, human groups and interactions between groups.

811
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,760
The collective intelligence of it.

812
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,640
Yes, the interactions really.

813
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,920
And there's a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas who's done a lot of really beautiful work,

814
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,440
I think, on this kind of question.

815
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,040
So I talk to him every now and then, so my view is influenced by him.

816
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,480
But a lot seems to depend on population density.

817
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,560
The more interactions you have going on between different groups,

818
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,320
the more transfer of information, if you like, between groups,

819
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,520
so people moving from one group to another group,

820
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,840
almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria.

821
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,040
The more expertise you're able to develop and maintain,

822
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,400
the more culturally complex your society can become.

823
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,200
And groups that have become detached, like on Easter Island, for example,

824
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,520
very often degenerate in terms of the complexity of their civilization.

825
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,080
Is that true for complex organisms in general?

826
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,560
Population density is often productive.

827
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:19,760
Really matters.

828
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:26,000
But in human terms, I don't know what the actual factors were

829
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,560
that were driving a large brain.

830
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,720
But you can talk about fire.

831
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,880
You can talk about tool use.

832
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,080
You can talk about language.

833
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,720
And none of them seem to correlate especially well

834
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:42,800
with the actual known trajectory of human evolution in terms of cave art and these kind of things.

835
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,520
That seems to work much better just with population density

836
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,480
and a number of interactions between different groups.

837
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,760
All of which is really about human interactions.

838
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,560
Human-human interactions and the complexity of those.

839
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:04,160
But population density is the thing that increases the number of interactions.

840
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,320
But then there must have been inventions

841
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,560
forced by that number of interactions that actually led to humans.

842
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:21,360
So like Richard Rangham talks about that it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha

843
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,760
male. So that's what collaboration looks like is they, when you're living together,

844
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:34,480
they don't like, our early ancestors don't like the dictatorial aspect of a single individual

845
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,440
at the top of a tribe.

846
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,720
So they learn to collaborate how to basically create a democracy of sorts,

847
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,200
a democracy that prevents, minimizes or lessens the amount of violence,

848
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:54,960
which essentially gives strength to the tribe and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.

849
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,320
I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things about humans is where all of those things.

850
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,280
I mean, we are deeply social as a species and we're also deeply selfish.

851
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,400
And it seems to me the conflict between capitalism and communism,

852
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,120
it's really just two aspects of human nature, both of which are.

853
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,760
Yeah, both.

854
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,080
We have both and we have a constant kind of vying between the two sides.

855
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:21,120
We really do care about other people beyond our families, beyond our immediate people.

856
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,920
We care about society and the society that we live in.

857
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,480
And you could say that's a drawing towards socialism or communism.

858
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,640
On the other side, we really do care about ourselves.

859
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,640
We really do care about our families about working for something that we gain from.

860
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,920
And that's the capitalist side of it.

861
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,000
They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature.

862
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,200
In terms of violence and interactions between groups,

863
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,120
yes, all this dynamic of if you're interacting between groups,

864
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,240
you can be certain that they're going to be burning each other

865
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,360
and all kinds of physical, violent interactions as well,

866
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,760
which will drive the kind of cleverness of how do you resist this?

867
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,800
Let's build a tower.

868
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,560
Let's see, what are we going to do to prevent being overrun

869
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,880
by those marauding gangs from over there?

870
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,640
And you look outside humans and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on.

871
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,280
And they're very, very different structures to society.

872
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,280
Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure and bonobos.

873
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,800
There's basically a female society where the males are predominantly excluded

874
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,640
and only brought in at the behest of the female.

875
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,200
We have a lot in common with both of those groups.

876
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
And there's again tension there.

877
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,800
And probably chimps more violent, so bonobos probably more sex.

878
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,560
That's another tension.

879
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,160
How serious do we want to be?

880
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,200
How much fun do we want to be?

881
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,840
Asking for a friend again, what do you think happened to Neanderthals?

882
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,880
What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals, homo sapiens?

883
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,080
Do you think we murdered them?

884
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,640
How do we murder them?

885
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,920
How do we out-compete them?

886
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,200
Or do we out-mate them?

887
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't know.

888
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,280
I mean, I think there's unequivocal evidence that we mated with them.

889
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,680
We always try to mate with everything.

890
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,480
Yes, pretty much.

891
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,240
There's some interesting.

892
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,280
The first sequences that came along were in mitochondrial DNA.

893
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,960
And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.

894
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,080
What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA was very different

895
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,280
to human mitochondria.

896
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:23,840
Oh, that's so interesting.

897
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,960
You could do a clock on it.

898
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,400
And they said the divergent state was about 600,000 years ago

899
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,160
or something like that, so not so long ago.

900
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,920
And then the first full genomes were sequenced,

901
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,200
maybe 10 years after that.

902
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,520
And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.

903
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,240
So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.

904
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,880
And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.

905
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,320
But we don't know.

906
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,120
Is that possible?

907
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,760
So can you explain the difference between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?

908
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,520
I've talked before about the mitochondria,

909
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,360
which are the power packs in cells.

910
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,800
These are the paired down control units is their DNA.

911
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,760
So it's passed on by the mother only.

912
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:10,480
And in the egg cell, we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.

913
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,320
There's only 37 genes left.

914
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,040
And they do basically the control unit of energy production.

915
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,400
That's what it's doing.

916
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,520
It's a basic old school machine that does.

917
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,800
And it's got genes that were considered to be effectively trivial

918
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,640
because they did a very narrowly defined job.

919
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,920
But they're not trivial in the sense that that narrowly defined job is about

920
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,320
everything that is being alive.

921
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,080
So they're much easier to sequence.

922
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,680
You've got many more copies of these things.

923
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,120
And you can sequence them very quickly.

924
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,240
But the problem is because they go down only the maternal line from mother to daughter,

925
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,520
your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.

926
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,680
Doesn't matter any kids we have, they get their mother's mitochondrial DNA.

927
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.

928
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,240
And so it tells a different story.

929
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,760
And it's not a story which is easy to reconcile always.

930
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,360
And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least is that there was one way

931
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,440
traffic of genes probably going from humans into Neanderthals rather than the other way around.

932
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,760
Why did the Neanderthals disappear?

933
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,720
I don't know.

934
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:26,400
I mean, I suspect that they were probably less violent, less clever,

935
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,520
less populace, less willing to fight.

936
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,400
I don't know.

937
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,760
I mean, I think I already drove them to extinction at the margins of Europe.

938
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,880
And it's interesting how much if we ran earth over and over again,

939
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:47,360
how many of these branches of intelligent beings that have figured out some kind of

940
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,680
how to leverage collective intelligence, which ones of them emerge,

941
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,600
which one of them succeed?

942
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,040
Is it the more violent ones?

943
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,040
Is it the more isolated ones?

944
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,840
You know, like what dynamics result to more productivity?

945
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,440
And I suppose we'll never know.

946
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,640
The more complex the organism, the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.

947
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:10,960
Yes.

948
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,240
And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.

949
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,520
Yeah, the truth might be very painful.

950
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:22,720
What about if we actually step back a couple of interesting things that we humans do?

951
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,920
One is object manipulation and movement.

952
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,120
And of course, movement was something that was done.

953
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,280
That was another big invention, being able to move around the environment.

954
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,960
And the other one is this sensory mechanism, how we sense the environment.

955
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,760
One of the coolest, high definition ones is vision.

956
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,680
How big are those inventions in the history of life on earth?

957
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:56,560
Vision, movement, again, extremely important, going back to the origin of animals,

958
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,400
the Cambrian explosion where suddenly you're seeing eyes in the fossil record.

959
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,800
It's not necessarily, again, lots of people historically have said what use is half an eye.

960
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:17,120
You can go in a series of steps from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue

961
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,360
to an eyeball with a lens and so on.

962
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,280
If you assume no more, then I don't remember this.

963
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:28,080
This was a specific model that I have in mind, but it was one percent change or half a percent

964
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,360
change for each generation.

965
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,440
How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?

966
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,880
And the answer is half a million years.

967
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,520
It doesn't have to take long.

968
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,800
That's not how evolution works.

969
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,560
That's not an answer to the question.

970
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:44,000
It just shows you can reconstruct the steps and you can work out roughly how it can work.

971
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,000
So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye.

972
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,000
But once you have one, then there's no way to hide.

973
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,040
And again, we're back to predator-prey relationships.

974
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,240
We're back to all the benefits that being able to see brings you.

975
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,560
And if you think philosophically what bats are doing with eco-location and so on,

976
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,160
I have no idea.

977
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:07,920
But I suspect that they form an image of the world in pretty much the same way that we do.

978
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,080
It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.

979
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:15,600
So I suppose the other thing about sight, there are single-celled organisms that have got

980
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,520
a lens and a retina and a cornea and so on.

981
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,720
Basically, they've got a camera tied by in a single cell.

982
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,680
They don't have a brain.

983
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:32,480
What they understand about their world is impossible to say, but they're capable of coming

984
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,800
out with the same structures to do so.

985
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:40,800
So I suppose, then, is that once you've got things like eyes, then you have a big driving

986
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,760
pressure on the central nervous system to figure out what it all means.

987
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:48,160
And we come around to your other point about manipulation, sensory input and so on, about

988
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,960
you have a huge requirement to understand what your environment is and what it means

989
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,000
and how it reacts and where you should run away and where you should stay put.

990
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,960
Actually, on that point, I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman,

991
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:15,040
who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution, to say that there's not necessarily a

992
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:22,160
strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.

993
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:30,080
So objective reality, that our perception actually is very different from what's objectively real.

994
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:37,520
We're living inside an illusion and we're basically the entire set of species on earth,

995
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,920
I think, I guess, are competing in a space that's an illusion that's distinct from,

996
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,160
that's far away from physical reality as it is defined by physics.

997
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,720
I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble.

998
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,960
I mean, we have a sensory input, which is a fraction of what we could have a sensory input on,

999
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,160
and we interpret it in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive.

1000
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:03,600
So yes, it's an illusion in that sense, but the tree is physically there,

1001
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:09,760
and if you walk into that tree, it's not purely a delusion of some physical reality to it.

1002
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:17,040
So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is, but because it's just a slice,

1003
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,720
you're missing a big picture.

1004
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,400
But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily need to be a slice,

1005
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:28,320
it could be a complete fabrication that's just consistent amongst the species,

1006
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:34,560
which is an interesting, or at least it's a humbling realization that our perception

1007
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,840
is limited and our cognitive abilities are limited.

1008
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:44,880
And at least to me, it's argument from evolution.

1009
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,720
I don't know how much, how strong that is as an argument,

1010
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,320
but I do think that life can exist in the mind.

1011
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,480
Yes.

1012
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,520
In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game,

1013
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:05,760
and you can have a vibrant life inside that place, and that place is not real in some sense,

1014
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,880
but you can still have a vibrant, all the same forces of evolution,

1015
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:13,360
all the same competition, the dynamics of between humans you can have,

1016
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:22,800
but I don't know if, I don't know if there's evidence for that being the thing that happened on

1017
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,040
Earth. It seems that Earth...

1018
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,360
I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny that you could have exactly the world that you

1019
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:36,400
talk about, and it would be very difficult to, you know, the idea in Matrix movies and so on,

1020
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:43,920
that the whole world is completely a construction, and we're fundamentally deluded.

1021
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:50,000
It's difficult to say that's impossible or couldn't happen, and certainly we construct

1022
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,840
in our minds what the outside world is, but we do it on input and that input,

1023
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,240
I would hesitate to say it's not real, because it's precisely how we do understand the world.

1024
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,000
We have eyes, but if you keep someone, apparently this kind of thing happens,

1025
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,560
someone kept in a dark room for five years or something like that, and they never see properly

1026
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:18,000
again, because the neural wiring that underpins how we interpret vision never developed,

1027
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,360
you know, you need, when you watch a child develop, it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the

1028
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:30,320
table and it hurts, and now you've got two inputs, you've got one pain from this sharp edge, and

1029
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,240
number two, you've touched it and realized it's there, it's a sharp edge, and you've got the

1030
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,320
visual input, and you put the three things together and think, I don't want to walk into a table again,

1031
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:44,240
so you're learning, and it's a limited reality, but it's a true reality, and if you don't learn

1032
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:47,760
that properly, then you will get eaten, you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive,

1033
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:55,840
and same if you're in some kind of, let's say, computer construction of reality,

1034
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:02,640
I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws that this is what reality is inside this,

1035
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,440
then you play by those laws. Yeah, well, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent,

1036
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,480
so just like you said in the lab, the interesting thing about the simulation question,

1037
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:18,080
yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation, but also, yes, it's possible to do

1038
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:23,040
these kinds of experiments in the lab now, more and more, to me, the interesting question is,

1039
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:29,840
how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be for us to not be able to tell the difference?

1040
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:40,000
A more interesting question to me is, how realistic or interesting does a virtual reality world need

1041
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,160
to be in order for us to want to stay there forever, or much longer than physical reality,

1042
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:54,080
prefer that place, and also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs, but prefer it in a deep,

1043
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:59,920
meaningful way, in a way we enjoy life. I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix,

1044
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:06,400
I imagine that it's possible to delude the mind sufficiently that you genuinely,

1045
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:11,520
in that way, do think that you are interacting with the real world when, in fact, the whole

1046
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:18,640
thing's a simulation. How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that? Well, it needs to

1047
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:26,720
convince you that all your sensory input is correct and accurate and joins up and makes sense. Now,

1048
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,600
that sensory input is not something that we're born with, we're born with a sense of touch,

1049
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,040
we're born with eyes and so on, but we don't know how to use them, we don't know what to make of them.

1050
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:41,840
We go around, we bump into trees, we cry a lot, we're in pain a lot, we're basically

1051
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:47,520
booting up the system so that it can make head a tail of the sensory input that it's getting,

1052
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,280
and that sensory input is not just a one-way flux of things, it's also you have to walk into

1053
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,920
things, you have to hear things, you have to put it together. Now, if you've got just babies

1054
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:02,480
in the matrix who are slotted into this, I don't think they have that kind of sensory input,

1055
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:07,840
I don't think they would have any way to make sense of New York as a world that they're part of,

1056
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,640
the brain is just not developed in that way. Well, I can't make sense of New York in this

1057
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:18,000
physical reality either, but yeah, I mean, but you said pain and the walking into things, well,

1058
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,760
you can create a pain signal, and as long as it's consistent that certain things result in pain,

1059
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,400
you can start to construct a reality, there are some, maybe, maybe you disagree with this,

1060
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:35,200
but I think we are born almost with a desire to be convinced by our reality,

1061
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,160
like a desire to make sense of our reality. Oh, I'm sure we are, yes.

1062
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:45,040
So there's an imperative, so whatever that reality is given to us, like the table hurts,

1063
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:53,120
fire is hot, I think we want to be deluded in a sense that we want to make a simple,

1064
01:31:53,120 --> 01:32:00,800
like Einstein simple theory of the thing around us, we want that simplicity. And so maybe the

1065
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,760
hunger for the simplicity is the thing that could be used to construct a pretty dumb simulation

1066
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,640
that tricks us. So maybe tricking humans doesn't require building a universe.

1067
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,840
No, I don't, I mean, this is not what I work on, so I don't know how close to it we are,

1068
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:21,920
but I agree with you that, yeah, I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do,

1069
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:27,600
but is it possible in principle? I think it would be very difficult,

1070
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:34,800
but I don't see why in principle it wouldn't be possible, and I agree with you that we try to

1071
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,640
understand the world, we try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have, and we try to come

1072
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:46,480
out with a hypothesis that explains what's going on. I think though, that we have huge input from

1073
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:52,240
the social context that we're in, we don't do it by ourselves, we don't kind of blunder around in a

1074
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:58,080
universe by ourselves and understand the whole thing, we're told by the people around us,

1075
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,840
what things are and what they do, and you know, languages coming in here and so on. So

1076
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,480
it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation to simulate all of that.

1077
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:14,080
Yeah, simulate all of that, including the social construct, the thing, the spread of ideas and

1078
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,560
the exchange of ideas, I don't know, but those questions are really important to understand

1079
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:24,080
as we become more and more digital creatures. It seems like the next step of evolution is us

1080
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:29,920
becoming partial, all the same mechanisms we've talked about are becoming more and more plugged

1081
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:37,520
into the machine. We're becoming cyborgs, and there's an interesting interplay between wires

1082
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:46,080
and biology, you know, zeros and ones and the biological systems, and I don't think you can just,

1083
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,360
I don't think we'll have the luxury to see humans as disjoint from the technology we've

1084
01:33:51,360 --> 01:34:00,480
created for much longer. We are an organism that's... Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, but

1085
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:09,280
we come really with this to consciousness and is there a distinction there? Because what you're

1086
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:14,160
saying, the natural end point says we are indistinguishable, that if you are capable of building

1087
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:22,880
an AI which is sufficiently close and similar, that we merge with it, then to all intents and

1088
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:31,680
purposes, that AI is conscious as we know it. And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view.

1089
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:42,160
And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book, because 10 years ago, I wrote a chapter

1090
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:48,480
in a book called Life Ascending about consciousness, and the subtitle of life ascending was the 10

1091
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,240
great inventions of evolution, and I couldn't possibly write a book with a subtitle like

1092
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:57,920
that that did not include consciousness, and specifically consciousness as one of the great

1093
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:03,760
inventions. And it was in part because I was just curious to know more, and I read more for that

1094
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,320
chapter. I never worked on it, but I've always... How can anyone not be interested in the question?

1095
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:15,200
And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows, and B, there are two main

1096
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:22,160
schools of thought out there with a big skew in distribution. One of them says,

1097
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:28,080
oh, it's a property of matter. It's an unknown law of physics, panpsychism, everything is conscious,

1098
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:32,320
the sun is conscious, it's just a matter of... Or a rock is conscious, it's just a matter of

1099
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:38,240
how much. And I find that very unpersuasive. I can't say that it's wrong, it's just that

1100
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,280
I think we somehow can tell the difference between something that's living and something that's not.

1101
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:51,200
And then the other end is it's an emergent property of a very complex central nervous system.

1102
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:59,200
And I never quite understand what people mean by words like emergence. I mean,

1103
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:07,680
there are genuine examples, but I think we very often tend to use it to plaster over ignorance.

1104
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:15,760
As a biochemist, the question for me then was, okay, it's a concoction of a central nervous

1105
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:23,760
system. A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling, to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of

1106
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:30,720
love, or anger, whatever it may be. So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms in the

1107
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:36,800
central nervous system? Which bit of the wiring gives rise to... And I've never seen anyone answer

1108
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,800
that question in a way that makes sense to me. And that's an important question to answer.

1109
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,360
I think if we want to understand consciousness, that's the only question to answer, because

1110
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:54,080
certainly an AI is capable of out thinking and it's only a matter of time. Maybe it's already

1111
01:36:54,080 --> 01:37:01,200
happened. In terms of just information processing and computational skill, I don't think we have any

1112
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:08,480
problem in designing a mind which is at least the equal of the human mind. But in terms of

1113
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:13,440
what we value the most as humans, which is to say our feelings, our emotions, our

1114
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:22,880
sense of what the world is in a very personal way, that's, I think, means as much or more to

1115
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:28,800
people than their information processing. And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will

1116
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:34,400
become conscious, because I think it's the property of life. Well, let's talk about it more. You're

1117
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:40,320
an incredible writer. One of my favorite writers. So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,

1118
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:46,480
What You Write About Consciousness. I think therefore I am, said Descartes, is one of the

1119
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:53,360
most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I exactly? And artificial intelligence can think

1120
01:37:53,360 --> 01:38:00,720
too, by definition, and therefore is. Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle

1121
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:08,480
of anything resembling human emotions of love or hate, fear and joy of spiritual yearnings

1122
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:16,400
for oneness or oblivion or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don't know

1123
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:22,240
what emotions are, as you were saying. What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a

1124
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:27,200
discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all? This is the hard problem of

1125
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:34,080
consciousness, the seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self.

1126
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:38,640
We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system

1127
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:44,000
could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence. But we can't answer in principle

1128
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,160
whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy. What is the quantum

1129
01:38:50,160 --> 01:39:01,840
of solace? Speaking to the question of emergence, you know, there's just technical, there's an

1130
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:09,920
excellent paper on this recently about the kind of phase transition emergence of performance in

1131
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:16,560
neural networks on the problem of NLP, natural language processing. So language models, there

1132
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:24,720
seems to be this question of size. At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size

1133
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:30,640
of the neural network. So the question is sort of somewhat of a technical question that you can

1134
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:36,320
philosophize over. The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to

1135
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:42,160
be able to form the kind of representations that can capture a language and therefore be able to,

1136
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,480
not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of

1137
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:55,280
problems in language, like be able to have a conversation. And there seems to be not a gradual

1138
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:01,120
increase, but a phase transition. And they're trying to construct the science of where that is,

1139
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:05,840
like what is the good size of a neural network? And why does such a phase transition happen?

1140
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:15,520
Anyway, that sort of points to emergence that there could be stages where a thing goes from being,

1141
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:25,680
you're a very intelligent toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away and looks out

1142
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:32,080
the window, sighing, having an existential crisis. I was thinking of Marvin, the paranoid

1143
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:41,520
android. Well, no, Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky. So easily programmed.

1144
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:47,680
Easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis. You're almost basically, what is it, notes from

1145
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:55,360
underground, but just constantly complaining about life. No, they're capturing the full

1146
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:00,800
roller coaster of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss, the connection,

1147
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:09,040
the empathy and all that kind of stuff. And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression,

1148
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:14,320
all that kind of stuff. They're capturing all of that and be able to experience it deeply.

1149
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:19,200
Like it's the most important thing you could possibly experience today. The highest highs,

1150
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:26,640
the lowest lows, this is it. My life will be over. I cannot possibly go on that feeling,

1151
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:33,680
and then like after a nap, you're feeling amazing. That might be something that emerges.

1152
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:38,240
So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?

1153
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,120
First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?

1154
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:50,080
But we do know that that's actually true for many people much of the time. Maybe I'd be depressed

1155
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:55,120
if you have an app and you do, in fact, feel better. Oh, you are actually asking the technical

1156
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:01,680
question there. So there's a biological answer to that. And so the question is whether AI needs

1157
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:07,280
to have the same kind of attachments to its body, bodily function, preservation

1158
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:16,080
of the brain's successful function, self-preservation essentially, in some deep biological sense.

1159
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,600
I mean, to my mind, it comes back around to the problem we were talking about before,

1160
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:27,360
about simulations and sensory input and learning what all of this stuff means.

1161
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:35,760
And life and death, that biology, unlike society, has a death penalty over everything.

1162
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:43,280
And natural selection works on that death penalty, that if you make this decision wrongly,

1163
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:52,880
you die. And the next generation is represented by beings that made a slightly different decision

1164
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:58,400
on balance. And that is something that's intrinsically

1165
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:06,960
difficult to simulate in all its richness, I would say. So what is...

1166
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:18,160
Death in all its richness, our relationship with death, or the whole of it. So when you say

1167
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:25,520
richness, of course, there's a lot in that, which is hard to simulate. What's part of the

1168
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:31,920
richness that's hard to simulate? I suppose the complexity of the environment and your position

1169
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:38,000
position of an organism in that environment, in the full richness of that environment over its

1170
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:44,160
entire life, over multiple generations, with changes in gene sequence over those generations,

1171
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:48,240
so slight changes in the makeup of those individuals over generations.

1172
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:57,280
But if you take it back to the level of single cells, which I do in the book, and ask how does a

1173
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:04,000
single cell, in effect, know it exists as an unit, as an entity? I mean, no, in inverted commas,

1174
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:10,080
obviously, it doesn't know anything. But it acts as a unit, and it acts with astonishing

1175
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:18,720
precision as a unit. And I had suggested that that's linked to the electrical fields on the

1176
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,760
membranes themselves, and that they give some indication of how am I doing in relation to my

1177
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:30,800
environment as a kind of real-time feedback on the world. And this is something physical,

1178
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,200
which can be selected over generations, that if you get this wrong,

1179
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:46,560
it's linked with this set of circumstances that I've just, as an individual, I have a moment

1180
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:53,440
of blind panic and run. As a bacterium or something, you have some electrical discharge that says

1181
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:59,040
blind panic, and it runs, whatever it may be. And you associate over generations, multiple

1182
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:07,040
generations, that this electrical phase that I'm in now is associated with a response like that.

1183
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:13,760
And it's easy to see how feelings come in through the back door, almost, with that kind of

1184
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:22,000
giving real-time feedback on your position in the world in relation to how am I doing.

1185
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,680
And then you complexify the system, and yes, I have no problem with a phase transition.

1186
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:40,560
And can all of this be done purely by the language, by the issues with how the system

1187
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:47,680
understands itself? Maybe it can, I honestly don't know. But the philosophers for a long time have

1188
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:54,880
talked about the possibility that you can have a zombie intelligence, and that there are no

1189
01:45:54,880 --> 01:46:01,280
feelings there, but everything else is the same. I mean, I have to throw this back to you, really.

1190
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:06,880
How do you deal with a zombie intelligence? So, first of all, I can see that from a biologist

1191
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:13,760
perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being, the entirety of

1192
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:19,280
the history of four billion years, that in some deep sense, integrated the human being into this

1193
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:26,800
environment, and that dance of the organism and the environment, you could see how emotions arise

1194
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:32,720
from that, and then emotions are deeply connected and creating a human experience, and from that,

1195
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:40,320
you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it, yeah. But from a perspective of an intelligent

1196
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:48,160
organism that's already here, like a baby that learns, it doesn't need to learn how to be a

1197
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:54,240
collection of cells or how to do all the things he needs to do. The basic function of a baby,

1198
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:59,520
as it learns, is to interact with this environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit

1199
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:07,040
in to this social society. And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.

1200
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:14,880
To cry, well, to convince the humans to protect it, or to discipline it, to teach it, whatever.

1201
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:22,000
I mean, we've developed a bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us,

1202
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:27,840
to educate us, to teach us about the world. Also, we've constructed the world in such a way

1203
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,400
that it's safe enough for us to survive in, and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable

1204
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:37,280
lessons, like the tables are still hard with corners, so it can still run into them. It hurts

1205
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:44,160
like hell. So AI needs to solve that problem, not the problem of constructing this super complex

1206
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:54,000
organism that leads up to run the whole, to make an apple pie, to build the whole universe,

1207
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,080
you need to build the whole universe. I think the zombie question is something

1208
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:11,120
I would leave to the philosophers, because, and I will also leave to them the definition of love

1209
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:17,920
and what happens between two human beings when there's a magic that just grabs them,

1210
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,880
like nothing else matters in the world, and somehow you've been searching for this feeling,

1211
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:29,440
this moment, this person, your whole life. That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun

1212
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:34,960
with that one, and also say that that's just, you can have a biological explanation, you can have

1213
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:41,120
all kinds of, it's all fake, it's actually, I'm Rand, we'll say it's all selfish, there's a lot

1214
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:44,720
of different interpretations, I'll leave it to the philosophers. The point is the feeling,

1215
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:54,320
sure as hell feels very real, and if my toaster makes me feel like it's the only toaster in the

1216
01:48:54,320 --> 01:49:01,360
world, and when I leave and I miss the toaster, and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster,

1217
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:07,680
and my life is meaningful, and joyful, and the friends I have around me get a better version

1218
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:13,280
of me, because that toaster exists. That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster.

1219
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,280
Is that psychologically different to having a dog?

1220
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,400
No, no.

1221
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,200
Because, I mean, most people would dispute whether we can say a dog, I would say a dog is

1222
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,400
undoubtedly conscious, but some people would say it doesn't.

1223
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,800
But there's degrees of consciousness and so on, but people are definitely much more uncomfortable

1224
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:34,960
saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog, and there's still a deep connection,

1225
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:40,000
and you could say our relationship with the dog has more to do with anthropomorphism,

1226
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,320
like we kind of project the human being onto it.

1227
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:42,880
Maybe.

1228
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,760
We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.

1229
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:51,840
Yes, but you can look into the dog's eyes and you can see that it's sad that it's delighted

1230
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,720
to see you again. I don't have a dog, by the way, I don't know, it's not that I'm a dog.

1231
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,800
Dogs are actually incredibly good at using their eyes to do just that.

1232
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:04,880
They are. Now, I don't imagine that a dog is remotely as close to being intelligent as an AI

1233
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:11,920
intelligence, but it's certainly capable of communicating emotionally with us.

1234
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,480
But here's what I would venture to say, we tend to think because AI plays chess well,

1235
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,960
and is able to fold proteins now well, that it's intelligent.

1236
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:25,760
I would argue that in order to communicate with humans, in order to have emotional intelligence,

1237
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:28,880
it actually requires another order of magnitude of intelligence.

1238
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:32,320
It's not easy to be flawed.

1239
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:41,920
Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same as the full complexity of human-to-human interaction.

1240
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:48,320
That's actually, we humans just take for granted the things we're really good at.

1241
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,000
Non-stop people tell me how shitty people are at driving.

1242
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,680
No, humans are incredible at driving.

1243
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:01,360
Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation, we're incredible at this.

1244
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:07,200
People tend to discount the things we all just take for granted.

1245
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:13,680
And one of those things that they discount is our ability, the dance of conversation and

1246
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:18,320
interaction with each other, the ability to morph ideas together,

1247
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,840
the ability to get angry at each other, and then to miss each other,

1248
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:27,600
like to create attention that makes life fun and difficult and challenging in a way that's

1249
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:33,440
meaningful. That is a skill that's learned, and AI would need to solve that problem.

1250
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:39,920
I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is AI cannot become meaningfully

1251
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:46,960
emotional, let's say, until it experiences some kind of internal conflict that is unable to reconcile

1252
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:54,000
these various aspects of reality or its reality with a decision to make.

1253
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:59,440
And then it feels sad necessarily because it doesn't know what to do.

1254
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,600
I certainly can't dispute that. That may very well be how it works.

1255
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,760
I think the only way to find out is to do it.

1256
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:10,000
To build it, yeah, and leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.

1257
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,360
The point is, the robot will be sitting there alone having an internal conflict,

1258
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,280
an existential crisis, and that's required for it to have a deep,

1259
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:23,920
meaningful connection with another human being. Now, does it actually feel that? I don't know.

1260
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:28,960
But I'd like to throw something else at you, which troubles me on reading it.

1261
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:36,240
Noah Harar is book 21, Lessons for the 21st Century, and he's written about this kind of

1262
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:40,560
thing on various occasions. And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.

1263
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:47,200
And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm and do it better than humans.

1264
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:51,520
So there will be AI better at writing music that we appreciate, the Mozart ever called,

1265
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:56,400
or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on. Because biochemistry is a algorithmic,

1266
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,520
and all you need to do is figure out which bits of the algorithm to play

1267
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:06,160
to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things. And as a biochemist, I find that argument

1268
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:15,280
close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable. I don't like the sound of it. That's just my

1269
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:20,080
reaction as a human being. You might like the sound of it because that says that AI is capable of the

1270
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:26,960
same kind of emotional feelings about the world as we are, because the whole thing is an algorithm

1271
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:32,880
and you can program an algorithm. And there you are. He then has a peculiar final chapter

1272
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:39,280
where he talks about consciousness in rather separate terms. And he's talking about meditating

1273
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,880
and so on and getting in touch with his inner consciousness. I don't meditate. I don't know

1274
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:49,920
anything about that. But he wrote in very different terms about it, as if somehow it's a way out of

1275
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:57,840
the algorithm. Now, it seems to me that consciousness, in that sense, is capable of scuppering the

1276
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:03,360
algorithm. I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops and so on, it is undoubtedly

1277
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:09,200
algorithmic. But in terms of what we decide to do, it can be much more

1278
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:20,080
based on an emotion. We can just think, I don't care. I can't resolve this complex situation.

1279
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:25,040
I'm going to do that. And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency, which is the

1280
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:29,840
currency of feelings and something where we don't have very much personal control over.

1281
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:36,240
And then it comes back around to you. And what are you trying to get at with AI? Do we need to

1282
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:42,880
have some system which is capable of overriding a rational decision which cannot be made because

1283
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,400
there's too much conflicting information by effectively an emotional, judgmental decision

1284
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:52,800
that just says, do this and see what happens? That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.

1285
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:58,080
Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a higher level process.

1286
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:06,800
I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.

1287
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:14,800
There's a lot of things that, the moment you say it, it's irrefutable,

1288
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:21,680
but it simplifies and in the process loses something fundamental. So for example,

1289
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:29,840
calling a universe and an information processing system, sure, yes. You can make that. It's a

1290
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:41,040
computer that's performing computations, but you're missing the process of the entropy somehow

1291
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:47,360
leading to pockets of complexity that creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex

1292
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:51,920
and they're like machines. And then those machines are through the process of evolution

1293
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:57,280
are constructing even further complexity. Like in calling the universe information

1294
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:03,920
processing machine, you're, you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult

1295
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:08,960
is to create them. So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult

1296
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:16,160
is it to create a software system that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect.

1297
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:23,040
I think we're, that is going to take so long. I can't, I mean, that's going to be centuries from

1298
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:28,880
now to be able to reconstruct the human. Now what I would venture to say, to get some of the magic

1299
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:34,560
of a human being with what we're saying with the emotions and the interactions and like,

1300
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,520
like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things that will come much sooner,

1301
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:44,160
but that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm of biochemistry.

1302
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:50,480
Yes, but the toaster is making you happy. Yes. It's not about whether you make the toaster happy.

1303
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:57,920
No, it has to be. It has to be. It has to be. The toaster has to be able to leave me.

1304
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,480
Yes, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case is very intelligent.

1305
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:05,680
Yeah, the toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me. That's essential.

1306
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:11,360
Yeah. That's essential for my being able to miss the toaster. If the toaster is just my servant,

1307
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:19,760
that's not or a provider of like services like tells me the weather makes toast.

1308
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:25,840
That's not going to deep connection. It has to have internal conflict. You write about life

1309
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:32,960
and death. It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality and the finiteness of its existence.

1310
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,920
And that life is for its temporary and therefore needs to be more selective.

1311
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,840
One of the most moving moments in the movies from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in

1312
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:54,160
2001, where that was the death of a sentient being and Hal knew it. So I think we all kind of know

1313
01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:02,720
that a sufficiently intelligent being is going to have some form of consciousness,

1314
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:07,840
but whether it would be like biological consciousness, I just don't know. And if you're

1315
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,760
thinking about how do we bring together, I mean, obviously we're going to interact

1316
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:23,680
more closely with AI, but are we really is a dog really like a toaster? Or is there really some

1317
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:30,880
kind of difference there? You're talking about biochemistry is algorithmic, but it's not single

1318
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,200
algorithm and it's very complex, of course it is. So it may be that there's that there are again

1319
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:41,040
conflicts in the circuits of biochemistry, but I have a feeling that the level of complexity of

1320
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:46,560
the total biochemical system at the level of a single cell is less complex than the level of

1321
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:55,280
neural networking in the human brain or in an AI. Well, I guess I assumed that we were including

1322
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:01,120
the brain in the biochemistry algorithm, because you have to- I would see that as a higher level

1323
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,760
of organization of neural networks, they're all using the same biochemical wiring within themselves.

1324
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:13,120
Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons, it's the immune system, it's the whole package.

1325
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:20,240
I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm that runs an intelligent biological system, you have to

1326
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:25,120
include the whole damn thing. And it's pretty fascinating that it comes from an embryo.

1327
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:36,240
I mean, if you can, what is a human being? Because it's just some code and then you build.

1328
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:40,640
And then that DNA doesn't just tell you what to build, but how to build it.

1329
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,520
I mean, the thing is impressive. And the question is how

1330
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:51,280
difficult is it to reverse engineer the whole shebang?

1331
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:53,600
Very difficult.

1332
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,440
I would say it's-

1333
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:06,480
Don't want to say impossible, but it's much easier to build a human than to reverse engineer,

1334
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:14,080
to build a fake human, human-like thing, than to reverse engineer the entirety of the process of

1335
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:20,080
the evolution of her. I'm not sure if we are capable of reverse engineering the whole thing.

1336
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:26,480
If the human mind is capable of doing that. I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I wasn't trying.

1337
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
But I know I can't understand the whole problem. I'm just trying to understand

1338
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,200
the rudimentary outlines of the problem. There's another aspect though,

1339
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:41,600
you're talking about developing from a single cell to the human mind and all the

1340
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:46,240
part system subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.

1341
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:55,520
This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine, with Michael Levin. But

1342
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:03,440
so little is known about- you talk about reverse engineers. So little is known about

1343
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:08,480
the developmental pathways that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.

1344
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:14,800
And a lot of it seems to depend on the same electrical interactions

1345
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,400
that I was talking about happening at the level of single cells and its interaction

1346
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:22,720
with the environment. There's a whole electrical field side to biology

1347
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:29,520
that is not yet written into any of the textbooks, which is about how does an embryo develop into

1348
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:34,160
or a single cell develop into these complex systems? What defines the head? What defines

1349
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:38,720
the immune system? What defines the brain and so on? That really is written in a language that

1350
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:43,840
we're only just beginning to understand and frankly biologists, most biologists, are still very reluctant

1351
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:51,600
to even get themselves tangled up in questions like electrical fields influencing development.

1352
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:56,320
It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists and it should not be because this is the 21st

1353
02:01:56,320 --> 02:02:02,000
century biology. This is where it's going. But we're not going to reverse engineer a human being,

1354
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,960
or the mind, or any of these subsystems until we understand how this developmental process is,

1355
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:13,840
how electricity and biology really works. And if it is linked with feelings and with

1356
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:19,600
consciousness and so on, that's the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try. But I think

1357
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:27,840
that's where the answer lies. So you think it's possible that the key to things like consciousness

1358
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:34,000
are some of the more tricky aspects of cognition might lie in that early development,

1359
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:40,240
the interaction of electricity and biology, electrical fields.

1360
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:44,640
But we already know the EEG and so on is telling us a lot about brain function,

1361
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:48,880
but we don't know which cells, which parts of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG. We

1362
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:54,320
don't know the basics. The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks, we know it's multiple

1363
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:59,600
cells, hundreds or thousands of cells involved in it. And we assume that it's to do with depolarization

1364
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:05,840
during action potentials and so on. But the mitochondria which are in there have much

1365
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,840
more membranes than the plasma membrane of the neuron. And there's a much greater membrane

1366
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:15,120
potential. And it's formed in parallel, very often parallel Christi, which are capable of

1367
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:22,800
reinforcing a field and generating fields over longer distances. And nobody knows if that plays

1368
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:27,920
a role in consciousness or not. There's reasons to argue that it could, but frankly, we simply do

1369
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:33,920
not know. And it's not taken into consideration. You look at the structure of the mitochondrial

1370
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:41,600
membranes in the brains of simple things like josophila, the fruit fly, and they have amazing

1371
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:48,000
structures. You can see lots of little rectangular things all lined up in amazing patterns.

1372
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,040
What are they doing? Why are they like that? We haven't the first clue.

1373
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:58,800
What do you think about organoids and brain organoids? So in a lab, trying to study the

1374
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:06,960
development of these in the Petru dish development of organs, do you think that's promising? Do you

1375
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:11,360
have to look at the whole systems? I've never done anything like that. I don't know much about it.

1376
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:16,720
The people who I've talked to who do work on it say amazing things can happen. And a bit of a

1377
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:22,560
brain drone in a dish is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings or even memories of its

1378
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:29,120
former brain. Again, I have a feeling that until we understand how to control the electrical

1379
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:34,240
fields that control development, we're not going to understand how to turn an organoid into a real

1380
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:42,400
functional system. But how do we get that understanding? It's so incredibly difficult. I mean, you would

1381
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:47,280
I mean, one promising direction. I'd love to get your opinion on this. I don't know if you're

1382
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:52,640
familiar with the work of Deep Mind and Alpha Fold with protein folding and so on. Do you think

1383
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:59,760
it's possible that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology, trying to basically

1384
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:08,560
simulate and model the behavior of trivial biological systems as they become complex

1385
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:15,680
biological systems? I'm sure it will. The interesting thing to me about protein folding

1386
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:21,680
is that for a long time, my understanding is not what I work on. So I may have got this wrong. But

1387
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:29,200
my understanding is that you take the sequence of a protein and you try to fold it. And there are

1388
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:33,840
multiple ways in which you can fold and to come up with the correct confirmation is not a very

1389
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:38,160
easy thing because you're doing it from first principles from a string of letters, which specify

1390
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:45,040
the string of amino acids. But what actually happens is when a protein is coming out of a ribosome,

1391
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:50,080
it's coming out of a charged tunnel and it's in a very specific environment, which is going to

1392
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:53,600
force this to go there now and then this one to go there and this one to come like that. And so

1393
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:58,320
you're forcing a specific conformational set of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.

1394
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:03,120
So by the time it's fully emerged, it's already got its shape and that shape depended on

1395
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:11,120
the immediate environment that it was emerging into one letter, one amino acid at a time.

1396
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:18,720
And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way. And if that's correct,

1397
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:22,720
then that's very characteristic of science, which is to say it asks very often the wrong

1398
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:26,800
question and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses on something having never

1399
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,880
thought to actually think, well, what is biology doing? And biology is giving you a charged

1400
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:37,200
electrical environment that forces you to be this way. Now, did deep mind come up through

1401
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:42,560
patterns with some answer that was like that? I've got absolutely no idea. It ought to be

1402
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:47,920
possible to deduce that from the shapes of proteins. It would require much greater

1403
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:55,040
skill than the human mind has. But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on,

1404
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:58,880
let's look at this exit tunnel and try and work out what shape is this protein going to take.

1405
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:03,120
We can figure that out. That's really interesting about the exit tunnel. But sometimes we get lucky

1406
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:11,760
and just like in science, the simplified view or the static view will actually solve the problem

1407
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:17,280
for us. So in this case, it's very possible that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping to

1408
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:23,680
our structure without considering how it unraveled, so without considering the tunnel.

1409
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:29,680
And so that seems to be the case in this situation where the cool thing about proteins,

1410
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:32,560
all the different shapes they can possibly take, it actually seems to take

1411
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:38,560
very specific unique shapes given the sequence. That's forced on you by an exit tunnel. So the

1412
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:44,320
problem is actually much simpler than you thought. And then there's a whole army of proteins that

1413
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:51,760
which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins. And they're only used when

1414
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:56,960
there's some presumably issue with how it came out of the exit tunnel and you want to do it

1415
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:01,760
differently to that. So very often the chaperone proteins will go there and will influence the

1416
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:09,280
way in which it falls. So there's two ways of doing it. Either you can look at the structures and

1417
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:13,680
the sequences of all the proteins and you can apply an immense mind to it and figure out what

1418
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:17,840
the patterns are and figure out what how or you can look at the actual situation where it is and

1419
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:21,520
say, well, hang on, it was actually quite simple. It's got a charged environment and then you fall

1420
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:25,360
it's forced to come out this way. And then the question will be, well, do different ribosomes

1421
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:29,520
have different charged environments for what happens if a chaperone, you're asking a different

1422
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:34,160
set of questions to come to the same answer in a way which is telling you a much simpler story

1423
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:39,920
and explains why it is rather than saying it could be, this is one in a billion different

1424
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:43,360
possible conformational states that this protein could have. You're saying, well, it has this one

1425
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:50,560
because that was the only one it could take given its setting. Well, yeah, I mean, currently humans

1426
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:55,440
are very good at that kind of first principles thinking of stepping back. But I think AI is

1427
02:08:55,440 --> 02:09:01,440
really good at, you know, collect a huge amount of data and a huge amount of data of observation of

1428
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:06,080
planets and figure out that Earth is not at the center of the universe that there's actually a

1429
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:11,760
sun were orbiting the sun. But then you can as a human being ask, well, how did how do solar

1430
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:18,800
systems come to be? How do what are the different forces that are required to make this kind of

1431
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:23,760
pattern emerge? And then you start to invent things like gravity, what I mean, obviously,

1432
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:32,720
I mixed up the ordering of gravity wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets, but

1433
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:39,680
we are able to think about those big picture things as human beings. AI is just very good to

1434
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:48,000
infer simple models from a huge amount of data. And the question is with biology, you know, we

1435
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,840
kind of go back and forth to how we solve biology. Listen, protein folding was thought to be

1436
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:59,360
impossible to solve. And there's a lot of brilliant PhD students that worked one protein at a time

1437
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:05,440
trying to figure out the structure. And the fact that I was able to do that. Oh, I'm not knocking

1438
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:11,920
it at all. But I think that people have been asking the wrong question. But then as the people

1439
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:20,240
start to ask better and bigger questions, the AI kind of enters the chat and says,

1440
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:24,480
I'll help you out with that. Can I give you another example of my own work?

1441
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:35,280
The risk of getting a disease as we get older. There are genetic aspects to it. You know, if

1442
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:40,720
you spend your whole life overeating and smoking and whatever, that's a whole separate question.

1443
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:46,640
But there's a genetic side to the risk. And we know a few genes that increase your risk of

1444
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:51,920
certain things. And for probably 20 years now, people have been doing what's called GWAS, which is

1445
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:59,280
genome-wide association studies. So you've effectively scanned the entire genome for any

1446
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:04,800
single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is to say a single letter change in one place

1447
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:09,520
that has a higher association of being linked with a particular disease or not. And you can

1448
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:16,800
come out with thousands of these things across the genome. And if you add them all up and try and

1449
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:24,400
say, well, so do they add up to explain the known genetic risk of this disease? And the known genetic

1450
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:31,280
risk often comes from twin studies. And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy, there's a 40

1451
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:36,800
or 50% risk that the other twin, identical twin, will also get epilepsy. Therefore, the genetic

1452
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:45,280
factor is about 50%. And so the gene similarities that you see should account for 50% of that known

1453
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:52,160
risk. Very often it accounts for less than a tenth of the known risk. And there's two possible

1454
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:56,480
explanations. And there's one which people tend to do, which is to say, ah, well, we don't have

1455
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:01,360
enough statistical power. If we maybe there's maybe there's a million, we've only found a thousand of

1456
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:05,040
them. But if we find the other million, they're weakly related, but there's a huge number of them.

1457
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:09,120
And so we'll, we'll, we'll account for that whole risk. Maybe there's, you know, maybe there's a

1458
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:15,840
billion of them. So, so that's one way. The other way is to say, well, hang on a minute, you're

1459
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:20,640
missing a system here. That system is the mitochondrial DNA, which people tend to dismiss

1460
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:29,200
because it's small and it's not, it doesn't change very much. But a few single letter changes in

1461
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:34,240
that mitochondrial DNA, it, it controls some really basic processes. It controls

1462
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:39,600
not only all the energy that we need to live and to move around and do everything we do,

1463
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:47,280
but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks to, you know, to, to, to make new cells

1464
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:53,280
and cancer cells very often kind of take over the mitochondria and rewire them so that instead of

1465
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:57,200
using them for making energy, they're effectively using them as precursors for the building blocks

1466
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:01,920
with biosynthesis. You need to make new amino acids, new nucleotides for DNA. You want to make

1467
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:07,840
new lipids to make your membranes and so on. So they kind of rewire metabolism. Now the problem is

1468
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:12,640
that we've got all these interactions between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus

1469
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:18,160
that are overlooked completely because people throw away, literally throw away the mitochondrial

1470
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:23,360
genes. And we can see in fruit flies that they interact and produce big differences in risk.

1471
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:33,920
So you can set, you can set AI onto this question of exactly what, you know, how many of these

1472
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:38,960
base changes there are. And this is one possible solution that maybe there are a million of them,

1473
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:42,480
and it does account for the greatest part of the risk. Or the other one is they aren't,

1474
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:46,960
that it's just not there. That actually the risk lies in something you weren't even looking at.

1475
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:52,160
And this is where human intuition is very important. And just this feeling that, well,

1476
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:56,560
I'm working on this and I think it's important and I'm bloody minded about it. And in the end,

1477
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:01,920
some people are right. It turns out that it was important. Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody

1478
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:09,680
minded? And that hang on a minute, you might be missing a whole other system here that's much

1479
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:20,160
bigger. That's the moment of discovery of scientific revolution. I'm giving up on saying AI

1480
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:26,240
can't do something. I've said enough times about enough things. I think there's been a lot of

1481
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:32,960
progress. And instead, I'm excited by the possibility of AI helping humans. But at the same time,

1482
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:41,440
just like I said, we seem to dismiss the power of humans. Like we're so limited in so many ways

1483
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:52,400
that we kind of, in what we feel like dumb ways, like we're not strong, where we're kind of,

1484
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:59,440
our attention, our memory is limited, our ability to focus on things is limited

1485
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:05,360
in our own perception of what limited is. But that actually, there's an incredible computer

1486
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:10,960
behind the whole thing that makes this whole system work, our ability to interact with the

1487
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:16,640
environment, to reason about the environment. There's magic there. And I am hopeful that AI

1488
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:21,760
can capture some of that same magic. But that magic is not going to look like deep blue playing

1489
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:26,400
chess. It's going to be more interesting. But I don't think it's going to look like

1490
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:30,240
pattern finding either. I mean, that's essentially what you're telling me. It does very well at

1491
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:35,520
the moment. And my point is, it works very well where you're looking for the right pattern.

1492
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,840
But we are storytelling animals. And the hypothesis is a story. It's a testable story.

1493
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:49,040
But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown and it's a new story, basically. And it says,

1494
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:54,160
this leads to this leads to that. It's a causal set of storytelling.

1495
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:58,560
It's also possible that the leap into the unknown has a pattern of its own.

1496
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:01,760
Yes, it is. And it's possible that it's learnable.

1497
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:11,760
I'm sure it is. There's a nice book by Arthur Kersler on the nature of creativity. And he

1498
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,760
likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off in a completely unexpected direction and says

1499
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:21,680
that this is the basis of human creativity, that some creative switch of direction to an

1500
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:27,600
unexpected place is similar to a joke. I'm not saying that's how it works, but it's a nice idea

1501
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:34,080
and there must be some truth in it. And it's one of these, most of the stories we tell are probably

1502
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:38,560
the wrong story and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful. And we definitely don't

1503
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:45,360
do as well at seeing patterns in things. But some of the most enjoyable human aspects is finding a

1504
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:50,800
new story that goes to an unexpected place. And these are all aspects of what being human means

1505
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:56,480
to me. And maybe these are all things that AI figures out for itself, or maybe they're just

1506
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:03,360
aspects of it. But I just have the feeling sometimes that the people who are trying to

1507
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:12,000
understand what we are like, if we wish to craft an AI system, which is somehow human-like,

1508
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:20,240
that we don't have a firm enough grasp of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.

1509
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:27,840
But we get a better, better understanding of that. I agree with you completely. We try to build a thing

1510
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:34,560
and then we go, hang on in a minute. There's another system here and that's actually the attempt to build

1511
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:40,480
AI that's human-like, is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings. The funny thing

1512
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:44,800
that I recently talked to Magnus Carlson, widely considered to be the greatest chess player of all

1513
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:50,800
time, and he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.

1514
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:59,280
And he had a funny comment. He has a kind of dry sense of humor, but he was extremely impressed

1515
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:05,600
when he first saw AlphaZero play. And he said that it did a lot of things that could easily be

1516
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:13,600
mistaken for creativity. So he, as a typical human, refused to give the system

1517
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:19,440
sort of its due, because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people

1518
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:27,440
are extremely impressed by, not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play. So one

1519
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:36,320
of the things that it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces. So in chess, that

1520
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:43,200
means you basically take a few steps back and it takes a step forward. You give away pieces

1521
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:51,760
for some future reward. And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess. You take big risks,

1522
02:18:52,480 --> 02:19:01,680
that for us humans, those risks are especially painful because you have a fog of uncertainty

1523
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:06,720
before you. So to take a risk now, based on intuition, if I think this is the right risk to

1524
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:12,400
take, but there's so many possibilities that that's where it takes guts. That's where art is,

1525
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:19,760
that's that danger. And then AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks

1526
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:24,880
and does them even greater degree. But of course, it does it from a,

1527
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:34,720
well, you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns. But

1528
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:40,480
boy, when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see in

1529
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:47,120
creativity. We see creative play on the chessboard. But the chessboard is very limited. And the

1530
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:53,360
question is, as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics,

1531
02:19:54,080 --> 02:20:02,000
in programming, and then venturing biology, psychology, and expand into more and more

1532
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:09,040
complex systems? I was, I used to go running when I was a boy and fell running, which is to say

1533
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:14,000
running up and down mountains. And I was never particularly great at it. But there were some

1534
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:21,040
people who were amazingly fast, especially at running down. And I realized in trying to do this,

1535
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:26,480
that there's, there's only really two, two ways, there's three possible ways of doing it. And

1536
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:31,600
there's only two that work, either you go extremely slowly and carefully. And you figure out, okay,

1537
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:36,320
there's a stone, I'll put my foot on this stone. And then there's another, there's a muddy puddle

1538
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:40,960
and we're void. And, you know, it's slow, it's laborious, you figure it out step by step.

1539
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:46,400
Or you can just go incredibly fast. And you don't think about it at all. The entire conscious mind

1540
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:50,480
is shut out of it. And it's probably the same, playing table tennis or something. There's something

1541
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:54,640
in the mind, which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations about exactly that.

1542
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:59,280
And it's amazing, you can run that astonishing speed down a hillside with no idea how you did it at

1543
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:03,280
all. And then you panic, when you think, I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this,

1544
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,800
I've got to think about where I'm going to put my foot. So you slow down a bit and try to bring

1545
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:12,400
those conscious mind in. And then you do, you crash, you can't, you cannot think consciously

1546
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:19,680
while running downhill. So it's amazing. It's amazing how many calculations the mind is able

1547
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:24,720
to make. And now the problem with playing chess or something, if you're able to make all of those

1548
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:31,200
subconscious kind of forward calculations about what is the likely outcome of this move now,

1549
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:36,480
in the way that we can by running down a hillside or something, you know, it's partly about what

1550
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:41,040
we have adapted to do. It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in running fast

1551
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:46,400
downhill is something that we'd better be bloody good at otherwise we're going to be eaten. Whereas

1552
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:53,360
trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves into the future is not something we've ever been called

1553
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:58,320
on to do. Two or three, four moves into the future is quite enough for most of us most of the time.

1554
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:09,280
Yeah. Yeah. So the, yeah, just solving chess may not, we may not be as far towards solving the

1555
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:18,560
problem of downhill running as we might think just because we solve chess. Still, it's beautiful to

1556
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:27,920
see creativity. Humans create machines that are able to create art and art on the chess board and

1557
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:35,760
art otherwise. Who knows how far that takes us. So I mentioned Andre Carpathia earlier. Him and I

1558
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:41,280
are big fans of yours. If you're taking votes, his suggestion was you should write your next book on

1559
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:50,320
the Fermi Paradox. So let me ask you on the topic of alien life. Since we've been talking about life

1560
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:55,680
and we're a kind of aliens. How many alien civilizations are out there? Do you think?

1561
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:04,480
Well, the universe is very big. So some, but not as many as most people would like to think is my

1562
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:14,560
view because the idea that there is a trajectory going from simple cellular life like bacteria

1563
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:20,480
all the way through to humans. It seems to me there's some big gaps along that way that the

1564
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:26,320
eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is

1565
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:33,200
another. Another interesting gap is a long gap from the origin of the eukaryotic cell to the

1566
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:40,480
first animals. That was about a billion years, maybe more than that. A long delay in where

1567
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:44,720
no oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. So from the first appearance of oxygen in the

1568
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:50,080
Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals to respire, it was close to two billion years.

1569
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:57,040
Why so long? It seems to be planetary factors. It seems to be geology as much as anything else.

1570
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:03,280
And we don't really know what was going on. So the idea that there's a kind of an inevitable

1571
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:13,120
march towards complexity and sentient life, I don't think is right. It doesn't, not to say,

1572
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:16,880
it's not going to happen, but I think it's not going to happen often.

1573
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:22,560
So if you think of earth, given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,

1574
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:30,240
do you have a sense that life, complex life, intelligent life happen really quickly on earth

1575
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:37,440
or really long? So just to get a sense of, are you more sort of saying that it's very

1576
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:44,240
unlikely to get the kind of conditions required to create humans? Or is it even if you have the

1577
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:49,440
condition it's just statistically difficult? I think the, I mean, the problem, the single

1578
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:53,200
great problem at the center of all of that to my mind is the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

1579
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:57,520
which happened once and without eukaryotes, nothing else would have happened. And that is

1580
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:02,400
something that- That's because you're saying it's super important, the eukaryotes, but-

1581
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:07,040
I'm saying tantamount to saying that it is impossible to build something as complex as

1582
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:12,240
a human being from bacterial cells. Totally agree and some deep fundamental way. But it's just

1583
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:16,880
like a one cell going inside another. Is that so difficult to get to work right?

1584
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:25,680
Well, again, it happened once. And if you think about, if you think about, I mean,

1585
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:30,400
I'm in a minority view in this position, most biologists probably wouldn't agree with me anyway.

1586
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:35,600
But if you think about the starting point, we've got a simple cell. It's an archaeal cell,

1587
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:40,000
we can be fairly sure about that. So it looks a lot like a bacterium, but it's in fact from this

1588
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:46,080
other domain of life. So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell. That means it doesn't have anything.

1589
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:51,440
It doesn't have a nucleus. It doesn't really have complex endomembrane. It has a little bit of stuff,

1590
02:25:51,440 --> 02:26:00,480
but not that much. And it takes up an endosymbiont. So what happens next? And the answer is basically

1591
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:08,560
everything to do with complexity. To me, there's a beautiful paradox here. Plants and animals and

1592
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:16,720
fungi all have exactly the same type of cell. But they all have really different ways of living.

1593
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:24,720
So a plant cell is photosynthetic. They started out as algae in the oceans and so on. So think of

1594
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:33,280
algal blooms, single cell things. The basic cell structure that it's built from is exactly the same

1595
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:37,280
with a couple of small differences. It's got chloroplasts as well. It's got a vacuole. It's

1596
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:41,280
got a cell wall. But that's about it. Pretty much everything else is exactly the same in a plant

1597
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:47,920
cell and an animal cell. And yet the ways of life are completely different. So this cell structure

1598
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:52,320
did not evolve in response to different ways of life, different environments. I'm in the ocean

1599
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:57,680
doing photosynthesis. I'm on land running around as part of an animal. I'm a fungus in the soil,

1600
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:05,760
spending out long kind of shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium. So they all have the same

1601
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:12,480
underlying cell structure. Why? Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation to the internal

1602
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:18,080
environment, to having these pesky endosymbionts that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.

1603
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:21,280
Now, in one way, you could see that as a really good thing because it may be that

1604
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:24,960
there's some inevitability to this process. As soon as you've got endosymbionts, you're more or

1605
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:29,200
less bound to go in that direction. Or it could be that there's a huge fluke about it and it's

1606
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:34,320
almost certain to go wrong in just about every case possible, that the conflict will lead to

1607
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:39,680
effectively war leading to death and extinction. And it simply doesn't work out. So maybe it

1608
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:43,040
happened millions of times and it went wrong every time. Or maybe it only happened once

1609
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:48,560
and it worked out because it was inevitable. And actually, we simply do not know enough now

1610
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:51,600
to say which of those two possibilities is true, but both of them are a bit grim.

1611
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:57,520
But you're leaning towards, we just got really lucky in that one leap.

1612
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:02,960
Like we got, so do you have a sense that our galaxy, for example, has just

1613
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:07,680
maybe millions of planets with bacteria living on it?

1614
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:12,480
I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets with bacteria living on it practically.

1615
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:19,360
I mean, there's probably what five to 10 planets per star of which I would hope that at least one

1616
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:26,320
would have bacteria on. So I expect bacteria to be very common. I simply can't put a number

1617
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:29,840
otherwise. I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere. It's not that I think we're living

1618
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:32,560
in a completely empty universe. That's so fascinating.

1619
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:36,400
But I think that it's not going to happen inevitably and there's something,

1620
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:43,360
that's not the only problem with complex life on Earth. I mentioned oxygen and animals and so on

1621
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:48,400
as well. And even humans, we came along very late. You go back five million years and would

1622
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:53,120
be that impressed if we came across a planet full of giraffes? I mean, you'd think, hey,

1623
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:56,880
there's life here. There's a nice planet to colonize or something. We wouldn't think,

1624
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:59,280
oh, let's try and have a conversation with this giraffe.

1625
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:07,760
Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think. I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting

1626
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:12,800
from an alien perspective or how they would notice. I'll talk to you about cities too,

1627
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:16,400
because that's an interesting perspective of how to look at human civilization.

1628
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:21,680
But your sense, I mean, of course you don't know, but it's an interesting

1629
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:27,440
world. It's an interesting galaxy. It's an interesting universe to live in.

1630
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:38,160
That's just like every sun, like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.

1631
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:47,920
Imagine that world. And the galaxy maybe has just a handful, if not one,

1632
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:56,080
intelligence civilization. That's a wild world. I didn't even think about that world. There's a

1633
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:03,120
kind of thought that one of the reasons it would be so exciting to find life on Mars or Titan or

1634
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:11,600
whatever is like, if it's life is elsewhere, then surely, statistically, that life, no matter how

1635
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:20,320
unlikely, eukaryos, multi-cell organisms, sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult?

1636
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:27,520
I mean, photosynthesis is figuring out some machinery that involves the chemistry and the

1637
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:32,800
environment to allow the building up of complex organisms. Surely that would arise.

1638
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:38,560
But man, I don't know how I would feel about just bacteria everywhere.

1639
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:42,240
Well, it would be depressing if it was true. I suppose depressing.

1640
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:45,920
Always natural. I don't know what's more depressing, bacteria everywhere, nothing

1641
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:52,320
everywhere. Yes, either of them are chilling. But whether it's chilling or not, I don't think

1642
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:59,200
should force us to change our view about whether it's real or not. And what I'm saying may or may

1643
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:05,520
not be true. So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars? It sounds like you would be less

1644
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:10,560
excited than some others because you're like, wow. What I would be most interested in is how

1645
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:14,080
similar to life on Earth it would be. It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem because

1646
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:24,080
the likelihood of life having gone to and fro between Mars and the Earth is quite, I wouldn't

1647
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:31,280
say high, but it's not low. It's quite feasible. And so if we found life on Mars and it had very

1648
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:36,400
similar genetic code, but it was slightly different, most people would interpret that immediately as

1649
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:40,880
evidence that there'd been transit one way or the other and that it was a common origin of life on

1650
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:44,640
Mars or on the Earth. And it went one way or the other way. The other way to see that question,

1651
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:49,360
though, would be to say, well, actually, the beginnings of life lie in deterministic chemistry

1652
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:55,440
and thermodynamics, starting with the most likely abundant materials, CO2 and water and

1653
02:31:55,440 --> 02:32:01,840
a wet rocky planet. And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning. And we'll, I won't say inevitably,

1654
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:06,000
but potentially almost inevitably come up with a genetic code, which is not very far away from

1655
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:11,840
the genetic code that we already have. So we see subtle differences in the genetic code. What does

1656
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:17,040
it mean? It could be very difficult to interpret. Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference

1657
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:22,080
or something that truly originated? I think if the stereochemistry was different,

1658
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:30,080
we have sugars, for example, that are the L form or the D form. And we have D sugars and

1659
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:38,880
alumino acids right across all of life. But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer and

1660
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:44,080
the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly possible to

1661
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:49,920
use one or the other one. And the same would almost only go for, and I think George Church

1662
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:57,120
has been trying to make life based on the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly

1663
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:02,960
possible to do and it will work. And if we were to find life on Mars that was using the opposite

1664
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:08,720
stereoisomer, that would be unequivocal evidence that life had started independently there.

1665
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:13,920
So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa or something like that,

1666
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:18,880
where it's less likely that we shared. And it's harsher conditions, so there's going to be weird

1667
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:25,600
or kind of life. I wouldn't count on that because life started in deep sea hydrothermal vents.

1668
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:30,880
It's a little harsh. That's pretty harsh. Yeah. So Titan is different. Europa is probably quite

1669
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:35,360
similar to Earth in the sense that we're dealing with an ocean, some acidic ocean there,

1670
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:41,440
as the early Earth would have been. And it almost only has hydrothermal systems, same with Enceladus.

1671
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:46,400
We can tell that from these plumes coming from the surface through the ice. We know there's a

1672
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:51,840
liquid ocean and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is. For Titan, we're dealing with

1673
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:55,200
liquid methane and things like that. So that would really, if there really is life there,

1674
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,440
it would really have to be very, very different to anything that we know on Earth.

1675
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:04,000
So the hard leap, the hardest leap, the most important leap is from

1676
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:16,160
prokaryotes to eukaryotes. What's the second, if we're ranking? You gave a lot of emphasis on

1677
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:22,320
photosynthesis. Yeah. And that would be my second one, I think. But it's not so much. I mean,

1678
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:28,640
photosynthesis is part of the problem. It's a difficult thing to do. Again, we know it happened

1679
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:39,120
once. We don't know why it happened once. But the fact that it was kind of taken on board

1680
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:46,160
completely by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts and did very well in completely

1681
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:50,400
different environments and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest that there's no

1682
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:56,560
problem with exploring. You could have a separate origin that explored this whole domain over there

1683
02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:02,800
that the bacteria had never gone into. So that kind of says that the reason that it only happened

1684
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:08,560
once is probably because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult. But then it happened

1685
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:15,680
at least 2.2 billion years ago, right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago,

1686
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:19,440
when there are some people say there are whiffs of oxygen, there's just kind of traces in the

1687
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:23,520
fossil in the geochemical record that say maybe there was a bit of oxygen then,

1688
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,760
that's really disputed. Some people say it goes all the way back 4 billion years ago

1689
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:33,040
and that it was the common ancestor of life on earth was photosynthetic. So immediately you've

1690
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:39,120
got groups of people who disagree over a 2 billion year period of time about when it started.

1691
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:47,120
But well, let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal, that's 2.2 billion years ago,

1692
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:51,360
through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion when oxygen levels definitely got

1693
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:57,520
close to modern levels, which was around about 550 million years ago. So we've gone more than

1694
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:04,480
one and a half billion years where the earth was in stasis, nothing much changed,

1695
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:10,800
as known as the boring billion, in fact. Probably stuff was, that was when Eukaryotes arose somewhere

1696
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:18,480
in there, but it's... So this idea that the world is constantly changing, that we're constantly

1697
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:24,640
evolving, that we're moving up some ramp is a very human idea. But in reality, there are

1698
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:36,160
tipping points to a new stable equilibrium, where the cells that are producing oxygen are

1699
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:41,040
precisely counterbalanced by the cells that are consuming that oxygen, which is why it's 21%

1700
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:46,320
now and has been that way for hundreds of millions of years. We have a very precise balance.

1701
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:51,200
You go through a tipping point and you don't know where the next stable state's going to be,

1702
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:56,880
but it can be a long way from here. And so if we change the world with global warming,

1703
02:36:56,880 --> 02:37:01,520
there will be a tipping point. The question is where and when, and what's the next stable state?

1704
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:07,360
It may be uninhabitable to us. It'll be habitable to life, for sure. But there may be something

1705
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:13,600
like the Permian extinction, where 95% of species go extinct. And there's a 5 to 10 million year gap,

1706
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:18,640
and then life recovers, but without humans. And the question statistically, well, without humans,

1707
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:23,840
but statistically, does that ultimately lead to greater complexity, more interesting life?

1708
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:30,560
Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE, there was a tipping point,

1709
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:34,640
which led to a long-term stable state that was equivalent to the Black Sea today,

1710
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:41,200
which is to say oxygenated at the very surface and stagnant sterile, not sterile, but sulfurous,

1711
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:48,400
lower down. And that was stable, certainly around the continental margins for more than

1712
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:52,800
a billion years. It was not a state that led to progression in an obvious way.

1713
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:59,520
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution, like what leads to stable states

1714
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:09,520
and how often are evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment?

1715
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:16,000
So maybe other planets are able to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures,

1716
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,080
whatever, some kind of pressure that say you're screwed unless you get your shit together in

1717
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:28,320
the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of pressure. It seems like Earth, like the boring

1718
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:33,760
building might be explained in two ways. One is super difficult to take any kind of next step,

1719
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:38,800
and the second way it could be explained is there's no reason to take the next step.

1720
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:43,600
No, I think there is no reason, but at the end of it, there was a snowball Earth.

1721
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:52,880
So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale where the sea was frozen at the equator,

1722
02:38:53,840 --> 02:39:00,160
and that forced change in one way or another. It's not long after that,

1723
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:03,760
a hundred million years, perhaps after that, so not a short time, but this is when we begin

1724
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:08,720
to see animals. There was a shift again, another tipping point that led to catastrophic change,

1725
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:14,880
that led to a take off then. We don't really know why, but one of the reasons why that I discuss in

1726
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:22,640
the book is about sulfate being washed into the oceans, which sounds incredibly parochial.

1727
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:31,680
But what the data is showing, we can track roughly how oxygen was going into the atmosphere from

1728
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:39,120
carbon isotopes. So there's two main isotopes of carbon that we need to think about here.

1729
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:44,400
One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12, and then 1% of carbon is carbon 13,

1730
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:48,560
which is a stable isotope, and then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive,

1731
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:57,120
it's trivial in amount. So carbon 13 is 1%, and life and enzymes generally, you can think of

1732
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:02,400
carbon atoms as little balls bouncing around, ping-pong balls bouncing around. Carbon 12 moves

1733
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:07,200
a little bit faster than carbon 13 because it's lighter, and it's more likely to encounter an

1734
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:13,040
enzyme, and so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter. And so organic matter is enriched,

1735
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:18,080
and this is just an observation, it's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent compared to carbon

1736
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:24,640
13 relative to what you would expect if it was just equal. And if you then bury organic matter,

1737
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:32,640
as coal or oil or whatever it may be, then it's no longer oxidized. So some oxygen remains left

1738
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:37,680
over in the atmosphere, and that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere. And you can work

1739
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:41,280
out historically how much oxygen there must have been in the atmosphere by how much

1740
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:45,600
carbon was being buried, and you think, well, how can we possibly know how much carbon was

1741
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:50,000
being buried? And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12, what you're leaving behind

1742
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,560
is more carbon 13 in the oceans, and that precipitates out in limestone. So you can look

1743
02:40:54,560 --> 02:40:59,600
at limestones over these ages and work out what's the carbon 13 signal, and that gives you a kind

1744
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:05,440
of a feedback on what the oxygen content. Right before the Cambrian explosion, there was what's

1745
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:10,800
called a negative isotope anomaly excursion, which is basically the carbon 13 goes down by a

1746
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:17,120
massive amount and then back up again 10 million years later. And what that seems to be saying

1747
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:27,200
is the amount of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing, which is to say, it was being

1748
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:33,600
oxidized. And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen. And that should,

1749
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:39,520
so a big carbon 13 signal says the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,

1750
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:44,160
which means there's much more carbon 12 being taken out and being oxidized. Sorry,

1751
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:49,280
this is getting too complex. Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.

1752
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:53,600
If you calculate the amount of oxygen based on the assumption that all this carbon 12 that's

1753
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:57,600
being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen, the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere

1754
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:03,120
gets stripped out. There is none left. And yet the rest of the geological indicators say, no,

1755
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:08,960
there's oxygen in the atmosphere. So it's kind of a paradox. And the only way to explain this

1756
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:13,520
paradox just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air, how much stuff is in the oceans

1757
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:20,080
and so on is to assume that what oxygen was not the oxygen, it was sulfate. Sulfate was being

1758
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:25,760
washed into the oceans. It's used as an electron acceptor by sulfate reducing bacteria just as

1759
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:30,160
we use oxygen as an electron acceptor. So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.

1760
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:36,800
Bacteria did. Yeah. So these are bacteria. So they're

1761
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:42,320
oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate, passing the electrons on to sulfate.

1762
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:48,400
That reacts with iron to form iron pyrides or fools gold, sinks down to the bottom, gets

1763
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:54,400
buried out of the system. And this can account for the mass balance. So why does it matter?

1764
02:42:55,040 --> 02:43:01,040
It matters because what it says is there was a chance event, tectonically there was a lot of

1765
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:08,880
sulfate sitting on land as some kind of mineral. So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are

1766
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:17,520
evaporitic. And because there happened to be some continental collisions, mountain building,

1767
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:21,760
the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain and happened to get washed into the ocean.

1768
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:26,880
Yeah. So I wonder how many happy accidents like that are possible.

1769
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:32,160
Statistically, it's really hard. Maybe you can roll that in statistically. This is the course

1770
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:37,200
of life on earth. Without all that sulfate being raised up, this Cambrian explosion almost

1771
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:41,760
certainly would not have happened. And then we wouldn't have had animals and so on and so on.

1772
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:51,040
This kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion. So let me actually say in several

1773
02:43:51,040 --> 02:44:00,320
ways, folks who challenge the validity of the theory of evolution will give us an example.

1774
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:04,960
No, I'm not. We'll study in this, but we'll give us an example of the Cambrian explosion as like,

1775
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:14,640
this thing is weird. Oh, it is weird. So by the question I would have is what's the biggest mystery

1776
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:21,840
or gap in understanding about evolution? Is it the Cambrian explosion? And if so, how do we,

1777
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:28,640
what's our best understanding of how to explain? First of all, what is it? In my understanding,

1778
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:33,120
in the short amount of time, maybe 10 million years, 100 million years, something like that,

1779
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:40,240
a huge number of animals, a variety, diversity of animals were created. Anyway, there's like

1780
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:44,080
five questions in there. Is that the biggest mystery? No, I don't think it's a particularly

1781
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:50,000
big mystery really anymore. I mean, there are still mysteries about why then,

1782
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:55,120
and I've just said sulfate being washed into the oceans is one, it needs oxygen and oxygen

1783
02:44:55,120 --> 02:45:02,400
levels rose around that time. So probably before that, they weren't high enough for animals.

1784
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:07,280
What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.

1785
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:13,040
We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races and we're seeing

1786
02:45:15,440 --> 02:45:21,600
we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed. And so I talked about the boring

1787
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:26,800
billion, nothing happens for one and a half, one billion years, one and a half billion years.

1788
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:34,400
The assumption, and this is completely wrong, this assumption is then that evolution works

1789
02:45:34,400 --> 02:45:40,640
really slowly and that you need billions of years to affect some small change and then another

1790
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:45,920
billion years to do something. And it's completely wrong. Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it

1791
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:51,280
stays that way for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years. And Stephen Jay Gould used

1792
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:55,360
to argue this, he called it punctuated equilibrium, but he was doing it to do with animals and to do

1793
02:45:55,360 --> 02:46:00,320
with the last 500 million years or so, where it's much less obvious than if you think about the

1794
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:05,920
entire planetary history. And then you realize that the first two billion years was bacteria only,

1795
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:10,400
you have the origin of life, two billion years of just bacteria, oxygenic photosynthesis

1796
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:16,000
arising here, then you have a global catastrophe, snowball earths and great oxidation event and

1797
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:20,400
then another billion years of nothing happening and then some period of upheavals and then another

1798
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:24,720
snowball earth and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion. This is long periods of stasis

1799
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:30,720
where the world is in a stable state and it's not geared towards increasing complexity, it's

1800
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:36,880
just everything is in balance. And only when you have a catastrophic level of global problem like

1801
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:40,960
a snowball earth, it forces everything out of balance and there's a tipping point and you

1802
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:49,280
end up somewhere else. Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong. It can be incredibly fast.

1803
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:55,600
And I mentioned earlier on, in theory, it would take half a million years to invent an eye,

1804
02:46:55,600 --> 02:47:03,520
for example, from a light sensitive spot. It doesn't take long to convert one kind of tube

1805
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:09,120
into a tube with nobles on it, into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms and then one

1806
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:14,720
end is ahead with it, it starts out as a swelling. It's not difficult intellectually to understand

1807
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:21,760
how these things can happen. It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly, but we're used to

1808
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:28,160
human time scales. And what we need to talk about is generations of things that live for a year

1809
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:34,640
in the ocean. And then a million years is a million generations and the amount of change that

1810
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:39,440
you can do, you can affect in that period of time is enormous. And we're dealing with large

1811
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:46,160
populations of things where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes. And so again, as soon as

1812
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:53,280
you throw in the competition of predators and prey and you're ramping up the scale of evolution,

1813
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:58,080
it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly when the environment allows it to happen.

1814
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:02,240
So I don't think there's a big mystery. There's lots of details that need to be filled in.

1815
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:06,320
I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.

1816
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:15,040
The big mystery in biology is consciousness. Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.

1817
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:30,560
I mean, you said biology, not psychology. Because from a biology perspective, it seems like

1818
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:37,120
intelligence and consciousness all are the same, like weird, like all the brain stuff.

1819
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:43,280
I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult, I suppose. I mean, I see it as a

1820
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:49,360
form of computing and I don't know much about computing. So you don't know much about consciousness

1821
02:48:49,360 --> 02:48:58,320
either. So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see that consciousness you do know

1822
02:48:58,320 --> 02:49:04,720
a lot about as a human being. No, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring of a brain

1823
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:14,880
as a series of, in pretty much the same way as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry

1824
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:21,680
of it. The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings, as we were talking

1825
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:28,800
about earlier on. Yeah, I just, I think, I think we oversimplify intelligence. I think the dance,

1826
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:38,880
the magic of reasoning is as interesting as the magic of feeling. We tend to think of reasoning

1827
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:48,160
as like very, running a very simplistic algorithm. I think reasoning is the interplay between memory,

1828
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:52,080
whatever the hell's going on, the unconscious mind, all of that.

1829
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:59,280
I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all. Obviously, it's extraordinarily

1830
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:05,440
exquisitely complex, but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.

1831
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:13,360
Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah, there's a big cloak of mystery around

1832
02:50:13,360 --> 02:50:18,400
consciousness. I mean, let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.

1833
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:26,640
Classical physics is logical, and you can understand that the kind of language we're

1834
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:30,320
dealing with, it's almost at the human level, we're dealing with stars and things that we

1835
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:35,600
can see. And when you get to quantum mechanics and things, it's practically impossible for

1836
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:41,760
the human mind to compute what just happened there. Yeah, I mean, that is the same. It's like,

1837
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:48,000
you understand mathematically the notes of a musical composition, that's intelligence.

1838
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:58,000
Why makes you feel a certain way? That is much harder to understand. Yeah, that's really,

1839
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:05,600
but it was interesting framing that that's a mystery at the core of biology. I wonder

1840
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:12,000
who solves consciousness. I tend to think consciousness will be solved by the engineer,

1841
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:21,280
meaning the person who builds it, who keeps trying to build the thing versus biology,

1842
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:30,240
such a complicated system. I feel like the building blocks of consciousness from a biological

1843
02:51:30,240 --> 02:51:36,640
perspective are like, that's like the final creation of a human being. So you have to

1844
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:42,880
understand the whole damn thing. You said electrical fields, but like electrical fields plus

1845
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:50,000
plus everything at the whole shebang. I mean, trying to agree. I mean, my feeling is from

1846
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,000
my meagre knowledge of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough is usually comes

1847
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:59,520
through from a field that was not related to it. So if anyone is not going to be a biologist who

1848
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:06,400
solves consciousness, just because biologists are too embedded in the nature of the problem.

1849
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:09,520
And then nobody's going to believe you when you've done it because nobody's going to be able to

1850
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:16,880
prove that this AI is in fact conscious and sad in any case, and any more than you can prove

1851
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:23,520
that a dog is conscious and sad. So it tells you that it is in good language and you must believe

1852
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:30,720
it. But I think most people will accept if faced with that, that that's what it is. All of this

1853
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:34,240
probability of complex life.

1854
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:41,520
In one way, I think why it matters is that

1855
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:50,640
my expectation, I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years or so if we survive at all

1856
02:52:50,640 --> 02:52:56,640
that AI will increasingly dominate and pretty much anything that we put out into space going

1857
02:52:56,720 --> 02:53:03,280
looking for other well for the universe for what's out there will be AI won't be won't be us we

1858
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:08,080
won't be doing that or when we do it'll be on a much more limited scale. I suppose the same would

1859
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:14,800
apply to any alien civilization. So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there,

1860
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:19,840
we should be looking for AI out there. But then we face the problem

1861
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:28,240
that I don't see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.

1862
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:32,160
You can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.

1863
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:38,560
And if the principles that govern the evolution of life on earth apply to other planets as well,

1864
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:46,320
and I think a lot of them would, then the likelihood of ending up with a human like

1865
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:52,000
civilization capable of giving rise to AI in the first place is massively limited.

1866
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,720
Once you've done it once, perhaps it takes over the universe and maybe there's no issue.

1867
02:53:56,720 --> 02:54:02,480
But it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked that you're not going to just turn a

1868
02:54:02,480 --> 02:54:07,520
sterile planet into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics first.

1869
02:54:08,480 --> 02:54:14,880
You have to run the evolutionary computation with the organics to create AI.

1870
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:19,360
How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid of an intelligent designer?

1871
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:25,040
The origin of AI is going to have to be in the chemistry of a planet.

1872
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:33,520
But that's not a limiting factor, right? So let me ask the Fermi Paradox question.

1873
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:40,720
Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful world of

1874
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:48,640
just billions of planets with bacteria on it and very few intelligent civilizations.

1875
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:56,320
And yet there's a few out there. Why haven't we at scale seen them visit us?

1876
02:54:57,440 --> 02:55:00,640
What's your sense? Is it because they don't exist?

1877
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:05,680
Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe at the right time. That's the simplest

1878
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:11,440
answer for it. Is that the one you find the most compelling? Or is there some other explanation?

1879
02:55:13,360 --> 02:55:17,920
I find that, you know, it's not that I find it more compelling. It's that I find more probable.

1880
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:22,720
And I find all of them, I mean, there's a lot of hand waving in this, we just don't know.

1881
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:29,200
So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth to what might happen somewhere else.

1882
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:35,360
And it gives to my mind a bit of a pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere and only occasional

1883
02:55:35,360 --> 02:55:41,040
intelligent life. And, you know, running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else that

1884
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:45,520
you would necessarily be any more excited about making contact with than you would be making

1885
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:53,200
contact with them on Earth. So, so I think the chances are pretty limited. And the chances of

1886
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:58,160
us surviving is pretty limited too. And the way we're going on at the moment, the likelihood

1887
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:04,240
of us not making ourselves extinct within the next few hundred years, possibly within the next

1888
02:56:04,240 --> 02:56:11,520
50 or 100 years, seems quite small. I hope we can do better than that. So maybe the only thing

1889
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:15,840
that will survive from humanity will be AI. And maybe AI, once it exists, and once it's capable

1890
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:22,720
of effectively copying itself and cutting humans out of the loop, then maybe that will take over

1891
02:56:22,720 --> 02:56:27,920
the universe. I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness to the way you described that. But isn't

1892
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:37,680
that also potentially beautiful that that's the next step of life? I suppose, from your

1893
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:40,800
perspective, as long as it carries the flame of consciousness somehow.

1894
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:44,480
I think yes, there can be some beauty to it being the next step of life. And I don't know if

1895
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:51,120
consciousness matters or not from that point of view, to be honest with you. But there's

1896
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:57,840
some sadness, yes, probably, because I think it comes down to the selfishness that we were

1897
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:05,440
talking about earlier on. I am an individual with a desire not to be kind of displaced from life.

1898
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:12,720
I want to stay alive. I want to be here. So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would

1899
02:57:12,720 --> 02:57:19,520
feel is that we will just be wiped out. So there will be potential conflicts between AI and humans

1900
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:22,960
and that AI will win because it's a lot smarter.

1901
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:30,800
Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs if consciousness is just an intermediate stage

1902
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:39,600
between bacteria and AI. I would see bacteria as being potentially a primitive form of

1903
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:46,000
consciousness. The whole of life on earth, to my mind, is capable of some form of feelings

1904
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:49,840
in response to the environment. That's not to say it's intelligent, though it's got its own

1905
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:56,080
algorithms for intelligence, but nothing comparable with us. I think it's beautiful what a planet,

1906
02:57:56,080 --> 02:58:00,880
what a sterile planet can come up with. It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this

1907
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:07,680
stuff that we see around us and that either we or whatever we produce is capable of destroying

1908
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:18,080
all of that. It is a sad thought, but it's also hugely pessimistic. I'd like to think that we're

1909
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:22,560
capable of giving rise to something which is at least as good if not better than us as AI.

1910
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:30,800
Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing that is able to propagate throughout the

1911
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:37,360
universe more efficiently than humans can or extensions of humans, some merger with AI and

1912
02:58:37,360 --> 02:58:45,520
humans. Where does that come from? Bioengineering of the human body to extend its life somehow

1913
02:58:46,640 --> 02:58:52,480
to carry that flame of consciousness and that personality and the beautiful tension that's

1914
02:58:52,480 --> 02:58:58,400
within all of us carry that through to multiple planets, to multiple solar systems all out there

1915
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:05,440
in the universe. I mean, that's a beautiful vision. Whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans

1916
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:13,280
can. That's an exciting possibility and especially meeting other alien civilizations in that same

1917
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:17,200
kind of way. Do you think aliens have consciousness? If they're organic.

1918
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:23,280
Organic connected to consciousness. I mean, I think any system which is going to bootstrap

1919
02:59:23,280 --> 02:59:31,040
itself up from planetary origins, let me finish this and then I come onto something else,

1920
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:36,480
but from planetary origins is going to face similar constraints and those constraints are

1921
02:59:36,480 --> 02:59:41,600
going to be addressed in similar basic engineering ways and I think it will be cellular and I think

1922
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:47,040
it will have electrical charges and I think it will have to be selected in populations over time

1923
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:51,520
and all of these things will tend to give rise to the same processes as the simplest fix to a

1924
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:56,800
difficult problem. So I would expect it to be conscious. Yes, and I would expect it to resemble

1925
02:59:56,800 --> 03:00:04,000
life on earth in many ways. When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16, I remember reading a book by

1926
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:11,200
Fred Hoyle called The Black Cloud, which I was budding biologists at the time and this was the

1927
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:15,120
first time I'd come across someone that really challenging the heart of biology and saying,

1928
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:22,160
you are far too parochial. You're thinking about life as carbon-based. Here's a life form which is

1929
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:33,120
interstellar dust on a solar system scale and it's a novel, but I felt enormously challenged

1930
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:42,240
by that novel because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was, how narrow-minded I

1931
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:46,480
was being and here was a great physicist with a completely different conception of what life could

1932
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:54,480
be. And since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways and I'm reluctant to say the attacks

1933
03:00:54,480 --> 03:01:01,760
make more sense to me than the original story, which is to say, even in terms of information

1934
03:01:01,760 --> 03:01:06,000
processing, if you're on that scale and there's a limit of the speed of how quickly can something

1935
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:16,480
think if you're needing to broadcast across the solar system, it's going to be slow. It's not

1936
03:01:16,480 --> 03:01:21,760
going to hold a conversation with you on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining,

1937
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:26,720
or at least not by any easy way of doing it, assuming that the speed of light is a limit.

1938
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:34,480
And then again, you really can't. This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago and I

1939
03:01:34,480 --> 03:01:40,240
do think he's right. There is no other way to generate this level of complexity than natural

1940
03:01:40,240 --> 03:01:45,680
selection. Nothing else can do it. You need populations and you need selection in populations

1941
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:55,360
and a kind of an isolated interstellar cloud. Again, there's unlimited time and maybe there's

1942
03:01:55,360 --> 03:02:02,560
no problems with distance, but you need to have a certain frequency of generational time

1943
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:10,240
to generate a serious level of complexity. And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.

1944
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:16,240
Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution is a really powerful tool here on

1945
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:21,120
Earth, but there could be other mechanisms. So whenever I don't know if you're familiar with

1946
03:02:21,760 --> 03:02:29,120
cellular automata, but complex systems that have really simple components and seemingly

1947
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:34,480
move based on simple rules when they're taken as a whole, really interesting complexity emerges.

1948
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:39,840
I don't know what the pressures on that are. It's not really selection, but

1949
03:02:39,840 --> 03:02:44,240
interesting complexity seems to emerge. And that's not well understood exactly.

1950
03:02:45,440 --> 03:02:51,840
I think there's a difference between complexity and evolution. So some of the work we're doing on

1951
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:59,360
the origin of life is thinking about how does, well, how do genes arise? How does information

1952
03:02:59,360 --> 03:03:05,040
arise in biology? And thinking about it from the point of view of reacting CO2 with hydrogen,

1953
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:09,120
what do you get? Well, what you're going to get is carboxylic acids and amino acids. It's

1954
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:15,520
quite hard to make nucleotides. And it's possible to make them and it's been done and it's been

1955
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:21,040
done following this pathway as well. But you make trace amounts. And so the next question, assuming

1956
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:25,200
that this is the right way of seeing the question, which maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is,

1957
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:30,880
is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides then? How do you become more complex and better

1958
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:36,880
becoming a nucleotide generating machine? And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,

1959
03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:42,960
some form of autocatalysis. So that can work. And we know it happens in biology. If this

1960
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:49,520
nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation, then you're going to increase the rate of flux

1961
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:53,120
through the whole system and you're going to effectively steepen the driving force to make

1962
03:03:53,120 --> 03:04:01,520
more nucleotides. And this can be inherited because there are forms of membrane heredity that you

1963
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:07,040
can have. And there are, effectively, you can, if a cell divides in two and it's got a lot of stuff

1964
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:12,640
inside it and that stuff is basically bound as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,

1965
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:19,040
then it will inevitably regenerate itself. And so you can develop greater complexity.

1966
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:25,120
But everything that I've said depends on the underlying rules of thermodynamics. There is

1967
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:31,600
no evolvability about that. It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,

1968
03:04:32,160 --> 03:04:36,720
assuming that you're able to increase the driving force through the system. You will

1969
03:04:36,720 --> 03:04:41,040
generate more of the same, you'll expand on what you can do, but you'll never get anything different

1970
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:47,520
than that. And it's only when you introduce information into that as a gene, as a kind of

1971
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:54,480
small stretch of RNA, which can be random stretch, then you get real evolvability,

1972
03:04:54,480 --> 03:04:58,400
then you get biology as we know it, but you also have selection as we know it.

1973
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:02,640
Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.

1974
03:05:02,880 --> 03:05:09,680
That's the kind of memory of the system. So it's not, yeah, at the local level,

1975
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:14,560
it's propagation of copying yourself and changing and improving your adaptability

1976
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:22,720
to the environment. But if you look at earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory. That's the key

1977
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:31,040
feature of it. In what way? It remembers the stuff it tries. Like if you were to describe

1978
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:36,240
earth, I think evolution is something that we experience

1979
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:44,320
as individual organisms. That's how the individual organisms interact with each other.

1980
03:05:44,320 --> 03:05:50,320
There's a natural selection. But when you look at earth as an organism in its entirety,

1981
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:55,120
how would you describe it? I mean,

1982
03:05:55,120 --> 03:06:02,240
well, not as an organism. I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely. And James Lovelock originally

1983
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:08,160
put Gaia out as an organism that had somehow evolved. And he was immediately attacked by

1984
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:15,200
lots of people. And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat because that was more of a poetic

1985
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:23,280
vision than the science. The science is now called earth systems science. And it's really about how

1986
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:27,840
does the world kind of regulate itself so it remains within the limits which are hospitable

1987
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:35,360
to life. And it does it amazingly well. And it is working at a planetary level of kind of

1988
03:06:35,360 --> 03:06:41,280
integration of regulation. But it's not evolving by natural selection. And it can't because there's

1989
03:06:41,280 --> 03:06:46,800
only one of it. And so it can change over time, but it's not evolving. All the evolution is

1990
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:51,520
happening in the parts of the system. Yeah, but it's a self-sustaining organism.

1991
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,680
No, it's sustained by the sun.

1992
03:06:55,200 --> 03:07:01,280
Right. So I mean, you don't think it's possible to see earth as its own organism?

1993
03:07:02,320 --> 03:07:06,800
I think it's poetic and beautiful. And I often refer to the earth as a living planet.

1994
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:12,320
But it's not in biological terms, an organism. No.

1995
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:20,480
If aliens were to visit earth, what would they notice? What would be the basic

1996
03:07:20,560 --> 03:07:22,080
unit of light they would notice?

1997
03:07:22,960 --> 03:07:27,200
Trees, probably. I mean, it's green. It's green and blue. I think that's the first thing you'd

1998
03:07:27,200 --> 03:07:31,920
notice is it stands out from space as being different to any of the other planets.

1999
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:35,120
So it would notice the trees at first, because the green...

2000
03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:37,040
Well, I would notice the green, yes.

2001
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:41,680
Yeah. And then probably notice to figure out the photosynthesis.

2002
03:07:41,680 --> 03:07:43,920
Probably notice cities a second, I suspect.

2003
03:07:44,880 --> 03:07:45,920
Yeah. First.

2004
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:49,040
They arrived at night, they noticed cities first, that's for sure.

2005
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:55,200
It depends the time. You write quite beautifully in Transformers once again.

2006
03:07:55,200 --> 03:07:57,280
I think you open the book in this way. I don't remember.

2007
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:04,160
From space describing earth, it's such an interesting idea of what earth is.

2008
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:12,160
You also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless,

2009
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:13,920
which is a beautifully poetic thing.

2010
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:21,280
You open Transformers with from space, it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating the

2011
03:08:21,280 --> 03:08:26,960
blue-green colors of the living earth. It is crisscrossed by regular patterns and convergent

2012
03:08:26,960 --> 03:08:33,760
striations. There's a central amorphous density where these scratches seem lighter.

2013
03:08:34,400 --> 03:08:40,160
This, quote, growth does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines,

2014
03:08:40,240 --> 03:08:43,360
and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.

2015
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:48,480
Across the globe, there are thousands of them, varying in shape and detail,

2016
03:08:48,480 --> 03:08:52,560
but all of them gray, angular, and organic, spreading.

2017
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:55,600
Yet at night, they light up.

2018
03:08:56,560 --> 03:08:59,680
Glowing up the dark sky, suddenly beautiful.

2019
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:03,920
Perhaps these cankers on the landscape are in some sense living.

2020
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:09,440
There's a controlled flow of energy, there must be information and some form of metabolism,

2021
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:15,840
some turnover of materials. Are they alive? No, of course not. They are cities.

2022
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:20,000
So is there some sense that cities are living beings?

2023
03:09:20,880 --> 03:09:23,840
You think aliens would think of them as living beings?

2024
03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:26,080
Well, it would be easy to see it that way, wouldn't it?

2025
03:09:28,640 --> 03:09:32,160
It wakes up at night. They wake up at night.

2026
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:34,560
Strictly nocturnal, yes.

2027
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:38,960
I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough to get here would understand

2028
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:41,520
that they're not living beings.

2029
03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:51,600
My reason for saying that is that we tend to think of biology in terms of information and

2030
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:57,520
forget about cells. I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell as a city and the

2031
03:09:57,520 --> 03:10:02,960
energy flow through the city and the energy flow through cells and the turnover of materials.

2032
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:09,200
An interesting thing about cities is that they're not really exactly governed by anybody.

2033
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:15,680
There are regulations and systems and whatever else, but it's pretty loose.

2034
03:10:18,320 --> 03:10:21,600
They have their own life, their own way of developing over time.

2035
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:25,040
And in that sense, they're quite biological.

2036
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:32,480
There was a plan after the Great Fire of London, Christopher Wren was making plans

2037
03:10:32,480 --> 03:10:38,720
not only for St Paul's Cathedral, but also to rebuild in large Parisian-type boulevards,

2038
03:10:38,720 --> 03:10:42,880
a large part of the area of central London that was burned.

2039
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:47,280
It never happened because they didn't have enough money, I think.

2040
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:49,840
But it's interesting what was in the plan. There were all these boulevards,

2041
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:55,280
but there were no pubs and no coffee houses or anything like that.

2042
03:10:56,160 --> 03:11:02,080
The reality was London just kind of grew up in a set of jumbled streets.

2043
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:05,360
It was the coffee houses and the pubs where all the business of the city of London was

2044
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:08,880
being done and that was where the real life of the city was. And no one had planned it.

2045
03:11:08,880 --> 03:11:12,560
The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.

2046
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:16,240
And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned, it's not controlled by the genes

2047
03:11:16,240 --> 03:11:19,600
in the nucleus and the way that we might like to think that it is, but it's kind of

2048
03:11:20,240 --> 03:11:24,640
evolved entity that has the same kind of flux, the same animation, the same life.

2049
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:31,200
So I think it's a beautiful analogy, but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.

2050
03:11:31,200 --> 03:11:37,280
See, I disagree with you. I disagree with you. I think you are so steeped.

2051
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:46,080
And actually the entirety of science, the history of science is steeped in a biological

2052
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:52,160
framework of thinking about what is life. And not just biological, it's very human-centric too.

2053
03:11:52,960 --> 03:12:01,760
That the human organism is the epitome of life on earth. I don't know. I think there is some

2054
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:08,080
deep fundamental way in which a city is a living being in the same way that a human-

2055
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:14,720
It doesn't give rise to an offspring city. It doesn't work by natural selection,

2056
03:12:14,720 --> 03:12:21,840
it works by, if anything, memes it works by. It's kind of copying itself conceptually as a

2057
03:12:21,840 --> 03:12:29,920
mode of being. So I mean, maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms that are really essential to

2058
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:35,840
life on earth. Maybe it's much more important about the collective aspect of human nature,

2059
03:12:35,840 --> 03:12:41,600
the collective intelligence than the individual intelligence. Maybe the collective humanity

2060
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:48,720
is the organism. And the thing that defines the collective intelligence of humanity is the ideas

2061
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:55,840
and maybe the way that manifests itself is cities, maybe or societies or geographically

2062
03:12:55,840 --> 03:13:00,960
constrained societies or nations and all that kind of stuff. I mean, from an alien perspective,

2063
03:13:00,960 --> 03:13:07,520
it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing, not from a place of ignorance.

2064
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:13,360
What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works. I mean, I don't have any problem with what you're

2065
03:13:13,360 --> 03:13:22,320
saying, really, except that it's not possible without the humans, we went from a hunter-gatherer

2066
03:13:22,320 --> 03:13:29,120
type economy, if you like, without cities. And as soon as we get into human evolution

2067
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:34,640
and culture and society and so on, then yes, there are other forms of evolution,

2068
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:41,600
other forms of change, but cities don't directly propagate themselves. They propagate themselves

2069
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:46,080
through human societies and human societies only exist because humans as individuals propagate

2070
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:51,680
themselves. So there's a hierarchy there and without the humans in the first place,

2071
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:58,720
none of the rest of it exists. So do you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit on which

2072
03:13:58,800 --> 03:14:02,160
evolution can operate? I think it's a really important thing, yes.

2073
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:09,520
Yeah. And we don't have any other better ideas than evolution for how to create one.

2074
03:14:09,520 --> 03:14:14,560
I never came across a better idea than evolution. I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.

2075
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:21,360
You mentioned, oh, that's no automator and so on. And I don't think specifically about that,

2076
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:25,280
but I have thought about it in terms of selective units at the origin of life and

2077
03:14:25,280 --> 03:14:30,320
the difference between evolvability and complexity or just increasing complexity,

2078
03:14:30,320 --> 03:14:38,400
but within very narrowly defined limits. The great thing about genes and about selection

2079
03:14:38,400 --> 03:14:42,480
is it just knocks down all those limits. It gives you a world of information in the end,

2080
03:14:42,480 --> 03:14:48,800
which is limited only by the biophysical reality of what kind of an organism you are,

2081
03:14:48,800 --> 03:14:54,640
what kind of a planet you live on and so on. And cities and all these other forms that look alive

2082
03:14:54,640 --> 03:15:00,800
and could be described as alive because they can't propagate themselves, can only exist as the

2083
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:08,320
product of something that did propagate itself. Yeah. I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth

2084
03:15:08,320 --> 03:15:14,800
to that kind of way of looking at things, but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud

2085
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:22,800
among us. I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this because I can't say that my world

2086
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:28,800
view is particularly uplifting, but in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not,

2087
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:36,480
science is about what's reality, what's out there, why is it this way? And I think there's beauty

2088
03:15:36,480 --> 03:15:44,000
in that too. There's beauty in darkness. You write about life and death sort of at the biological

2089
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:51,680
level. Does the question of suicide, why live, does the question of why the human mind is capable

2090
03:15:51,760 --> 03:16:02,320
of depression, are you able to introspect that from a place of biology? Why are minds, why we humans

2091
03:16:02,320 --> 03:16:14,480
can go to such dark places? Why can we commit suicide? Why can we go suffer, suffer period,

2092
03:16:14,480 --> 03:16:21,360
but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness of going to a dark place that depression can take

2093
03:16:21,360 --> 03:16:31,280
you? Is this a feature of life or is it a bug? I don't know. I mean, if it's a feature of life,

2094
03:16:31,280 --> 03:16:35,200
then I suppose it would have to be true of other organisms as well. And I don't know

2095
03:16:36,480 --> 03:16:43,200
when we were talking about dogs earlier on, and they can certainly be very sad and upset and may

2096
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:47,840
mooch for days after their owner died or something like that. So I suspect in some sense it's a

2097
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:59,120
feature of biology. It's probably a feature of mortality. But beyond all of that, I mean,

2098
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:05,760
I guess there's two ways you could come at it. One of them would be to say, well, you can effectively

2099
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:10,560
do the math and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless and that there's really no point

2100
03:17:10,560 --> 03:17:16,880
in me being here any longer. And maybe that's true. In the greater scheme of things, you can

2101
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:21,360
justify yourself in terms of society, but society will be gone soon enough as well. And you end

2102
03:17:21,360 --> 03:17:27,680
up with a very bleak place just by logic. In some sense, it's surprising that we can find any meaning

2103
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:33,280
at all. Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in, that we have transient joy. But with

2104
03:17:33,280 --> 03:17:38,880
transient joy, we have transient misery as well. And sometimes with everything in biology,

2105
03:17:40,640 --> 03:17:45,760
getting the regulation right is practically impossible. You will always have a bell-shaped

2106
03:17:45,760 --> 03:17:50,960
curve where some people, unfortunately, are at the joy end and some people are at the misery end.

2107
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:58,000
And that's the way brains are wired. And I doubt there's ever an escape from that. It's the same

2108
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:03,280
with sex and everything else as well. We're dealing with it. You can't regulate it. So

2109
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:07,280
anything goes. It's all part of biology.

2110
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:20,320
Amen to that. Let me on writing in your book, Power Sex and Suicide. First of all,

2111
03:18:20,320 --> 03:18:26,240
can I just read off the books you've written? If there's any better titles and topics to be

2112
03:18:26,240 --> 03:18:30,080
covered, I don't know what they are. It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write

2113
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:35,280
next. I hope there's things you write next. So you first, you wrote Oxygen, the molecule that

2114
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:40,560
made the world, as we've talked about, this idea of the role of oxygen in life on earth.

2115
03:18:40,560 --> 03:18:48,400
Then wait for it. Power Sex Suicide, mitochondria and the meaning of life. Then life ascending,

2116
03:18:48,400 --> 03:18:53,680
the 10 great inventions of evolution. The vital question, the first book I've read of yours,

2117
03:18:53,680 --> 03:18:59,040
the vital question, why is life the way it is? And the new book, Transformer,

2118
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:07,440
The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death. In Power Sex and Suicide, you write about writing,

2119
03:19:07,440 --> 03:19:12,720
or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing. You write,

2120
03:19:13,520 --> 03:19:19,520
in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision

2121
03:19:19,520 --> 03:19:26,720
to the guide's entry on the earth, which originally read harmless. By the way, I would also, as a

2122
03:19:26,800 --> 03:19:32,160
side quest, as a side question, would like to ask you what would be your summary of what earth is.

2123
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:40,560
You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down by the guide to read mostly harmless. I

2124
03:19:40,560 --> 03:19:47,280
suspect that too many new additions suffer a similar fate, if not through absurd editing decisions,

2125
03:19:47,280 --> 03:19:53,200
at least through a lack of meaningful change in content. As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed

2126
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:59,200
since the first edition of Power Sex, Suicide was published. And I am resisting the temptation

2127
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:05,760
to make any lame revisions. Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his arguments in

2128
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:11,280
the origin of species through his multiple revisions, in which he dealt with criticisms

2129
03:20:11,280 --> 03:20:17,120
and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction. I prefer my original to speak for

2130
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:23,760
itself, even if it turns out to be wrong. Let me ask the question about writing,

2131
03:20:24,640 --> 03:20:29,280
both your students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant

2132
03:20:29,280 --> 03:20:36,880
writings on science and humanity I've ever read. What's the process of writing? How do you advise

2133
03:20:36,960 --> 03:20:48,720
other humans? If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you and just young anybody and give

2134
03:20:48,720 --> 03:20:53,840
advice about how to write and how to write well about these big topics, what would you say?

2135
03:20:55,600 --> 03:21:03,520
I suppose there's a couple of points. One of them is what's the story? What do I want to know?

2136
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:10,720
What do I want to convey? Why does it matter to anybody? And very often the biggest,

2137
03:21:10,720 --> 03:21:18,960
most interesting questions, the childlike questions are the one that actually everybody

2138
03:21:18,960 --> 03:21:24,960
wants to ask, but then quite do it in case they look stupid. And one of the nice things about

2139
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:29,200
being in science is the longer you're in, the more you realize that everybody doesn't know the

2140
03:21:29,200 --> 03:21:36,000
answer to these questions and it's not so stupid to ask them after all. So trying to

2141
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:44,560
ask the questions that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16, when I was really

2142
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:52,480
hungry to know about the world and didn't know very much about it and wanted to go to the edge

2143
03:21:52,480 --> 03:22:00,960
of what we know, but be helped to get there. I don't want to be too much terminology and so I

2144
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:09,520
want someone to keep a clean eye on what the question is. Beyond that, I've wondered a lot

2145
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:16,640
about who am I writing for? And that was in the end, the only answer I had was myself at the age

2146
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:25,040
of 15 or 16. Because even if you're, you just don't know who's reading but also where are they

2147
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:32,320
reading it? Are they reading it in the bath or in bed or on the metro or listening to an audio

2148
03:22:32,320 --> 03:22:39,920
book? Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages because you read three pages at a time

2149
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:45,920
or are you really irritated by that? You're going to get criticism from people who are

2150
03:22:45,920 --> 03:22:49,440
irritated by what you're doing and you don't know who they are or what you're going to do

2151
03:22:49,440 --> 03:22:54,960
that's going to irritate people. And in the end, all you can do is just try and please yourself.

2152
03:22:56,560 --> 03:23:02,720
And that means, well, what are these big fun, fascinating, big questions? And what do we know

2153
03:23:02,720 --> 03:23:10,000
about it? And can I convey that? And I kind of learned in trying to write, first of all,

2154
03:23:10,960 --> 03:23:16,320
say what we know. And I was shocked in the first couple of books how often I came up

2155
03:23:16,320 --> 03:23:23,920
quickly against all the stuff we don't know. And if you're trying to, I've realised later on in

2156
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:30,960
supervising various physicists and mathematicians who are PhD students and their maths is way

2157
03:23:30,960 --> 03:23:36,080
beyond what I can do. But the process of trying to work out what are we actually going to model

2158
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:39,200
here? What's going into this equation? It's a very similar one to writing. What am I going to

2159
03:23:39,760 --> 03:23:45,040
put on a page? What's the simplest possible way I can encapsulate this idea so that I now

2160
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:50,160
have it as a unit that I can kind of see how it interacts with the other units? And you realise

2161
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:54,160
that, well, if this is like that and this is like this, then that can't be true.

2162
03:23:56,960 --> 03:24:01,840
So you end up navigating your own path through this landscape. And that can be thrilling because

2163
03:24:01,840 --> 03:24:07,200
you don't know where it's going. And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons my books have

2164
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:11,440
worked for people because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride that I don't know where

2165
03:24:11,440 --> 03:24:17,280
it's going either. So finding the simplest possible way to explain the things we know

2166
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:21,520
and the simplest possible way to explain the things we don't know and the tension between those two

2167
03:24:21,520 --> 03:24:29,520
and that's where the story emerges. What about the edit? Do you find yourself to the point of this

2168
03:24:30,480 --> 03:24:37,200
editing doll to most harmless? To arrive at simplicity, do you find

2169
03:24:38,160 --> 03:24:42,560
the edit is productive or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?

2170
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:49,040
No, I usually find, I think I'm perhaps a better editor than I am a writer. I write and rewrite

2171
03:24:49,040 --> 03:24:53,760
and rewrite and rewrite. Put a bunch of crap on the page first and then see where the edit where it

2172
03:24:53,920 --> 03:24:59,040
takes. Yeah. But then there's the professional editors who come along as well. And I mean,

2173
03:24:59,840 --> 03:25:06,000
in Transformer, the editor came back to me after I'd sent him two months after I sent the

2174
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:11,120
first edition, he'd read the whole thing and he said, the first two chapters prevent a formidable

2175
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:17,200
hurdle to the general reader. Go and do something about it. And it was the last thing I really

2176
03:25:17,200 --> 03:25:22,000
wanted to do. Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech. Yeah, well, this was an email. But

2177
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:30,160
I thought about it in, you know, the bottom line is he was right. And so I put the whole thing aside

2178
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:34,720
for about two months. It's been the summer. This would have been, I guess, last summer.

2179
03:25:35,920 --> 03:25:40,560
And then turned to it with full attention in about September or something and rewrote those

2180
03:25:40,560 --> 03:25:45,920
chapters almost from scratch. I kept some of the material, but it took me a long time to process

2181
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:50,240
it to work out what needs to change. Where does it need to change? I wasn't writing in this time.

2182
03:25:50,240 --> 03:25:54,320
How am I going to tell this story better so it's more accessible and interesting? And in the end,

2183
03:25:55,040 --> 03:26:00,400
I think it's still difficult. It's still biochemistry. But as he ended up saying,

2184
03:26:00,400 --> 03:26:05,920
now he's got a barreling energy to it. And because he'd told me the truth the first time,

2185
03:26:05,920 --> 03:26:10,400
I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth the second time as well and was delighted.

2186
03:26:12,320 --> 03:26:19,280
Could you give advice to young people in general? Folks in high school, folks in college,

2187
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:22,960
how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on. Now you've done that in the space of

2188
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:32,320
biology and expanded out. How can they have a career they can be proud of or have a life

2189
03:26:32,320 --> 03:26:41,920
they can be proud of? Gosh, that's a big question. I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom that you can

2190
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:48,800
impart to young people. So the only advice that I actually ever give to my students

2191
03:26:50,480 --> 03:26:57,920
is follow what you're interested in. Because they're often worried that if they make this

2192
03:26:57,920 --> 03:27:01,600
decision now and do this course instead of that course, then they're going to restrict

2193
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:08,800
their career opportunities. And there isn't a career path in science. It's not, I mean,

2194
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:15,040
there is, but there isn't. There's a lot of competition. There's a lot of death symbolically.

2195
03:27:16,320 --> 03:27:24,640
So who survives? The people who survive are the people who care enough to still do it. And they're

2196
03:27:24,640 --> 03:27:32,320
very often the people who don't worry too much about the future and are able to live in the present.

2197
03:27:32,320 --> 03:27:37,280
Because if you do a PhD, you've competed hard to get onto the PhD, then you have to compete hard

2198
03:27:37,280 --> 03:27:43,840
to get a post-doc job. And you have the next one maybe on another continent. And it's only two

2199
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:50,560
years anyway. And there's no guarantee you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.

2200
03:27:51,840 --> 03:27:56,960
And there's always the next step to compete. If you get a faculty position, you get a tenure.

2201
03:27:56,960 --> 03:28:01,200
And with tenure, you go full professor and full professor, then you go to some kind of whatever

2202
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:05,120
the discipline is. There's an award. If you're in physics, you're always competing for the

2203
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:09,120
there's different awards. And then eventually you're all competing to,

2204
03:28:10,080 --> 03:28:13,760
I mean, there's always a competition. So there is no happiness. Happiness does not lie.

2205
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:17,840
If you're looking into the future, yes. And if what you're caring about is a career, then

2206
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:26,720
it's probably not the one for you. If you can put that aside, and I've also worked in industry

2207
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:30,800
for a brief period and I was made redundant twice. So I know that

2208
03:28:31,520 --> 03:28:36,400
it's, you know, there's no guarantee that you've got a career that way either.

2209
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:45,200
So live in the moment and try and enjoy what you're doing. And that means really go to the

2210
03:28:47,600 --> 03:28:51,680
go to the themes that you're most interested in and try and follow them as well as you can.

2211
03:28:51,680 --> 03:28:57,440
And that tends to pay back in surprising ways. I don't know if you've found this as well,

2212
03:28:57,440 --> 03:29:06,240
but I found that people will help you often. If they see some light shining in the eye,

2213
03:29:07,440 --> 03:29:13,840
you're excited about their subject. And, you know, just want to talk about it.

2214
03:29:14,640 --> 03:29:19,040
And they know that their friend in California has got a job coming up. They'll say,

2215
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:24,880
go for this, this guy's all right. You know, they'll use the network to help you out

2216
03:29:24,880 --> 03:29:29,360
if you really care. And you're not going to have a job two years down the line. But if what you

2217
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:33,440
really care about is what you're doing now, then it doesn't matter if you have a job in two years

2218
03:29:33,440 --> 03:29:40,320
time or not. It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye. And so that's the only

2219
03:29:40,320 --> 03:29:46,960
advice I can give. And most people probably drop out through that system because the fight is just

2220
03:29:46,960 --> 03:29:51,760
not worth it for them. Yeah, when you have the light in your eye, when you have the excitement

2221
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:56,000
for the thing, what happens is you start to surround yourself with others that are interested

2222
03:29:56,000 --> 03:30:00,160
in that same thing that also have the light. If you really are rigorous about this, because

2223
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:07,600
I think it does take, it doesn't, it takes effort to make... Oh, you've got to be obsessive.

2224
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:12,080
But if you're doing what you really love doing, then it's not work anymore is what you do.

2225
03:30:12,080 --> 03:30:16,240
Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself with other people that are obsessed about the

2226
03:30:16,240 --> 03:30:20,400
same thing because depending on... Oh, that takes some work as well, yes. And look.

2227
03:30:20,400 --> 03:30:26,640
Finding the right mentors, the collaborators, because I think one of the problem with

2228
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:34,560
the PhD process is people are not careful enough in picking their mentors. Those are people,

2229
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:41,040
mentors and colleagues and so on, those are people are going to define the direction of your life,

2230
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:47,200
the how much you love a thing, the power of just like the few little conversations you have

2231
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:54,960
in the hallway, it's incredible. So you have to be a little bit careful in that. Sometimes you

2232
03:30:54,960 --> 03:31:05,120
just get randomly almost assigned, really pursue, I suppose, the subject as much as you pursue the

2233
03:31:05,120 --> 03:31:09,360
people that do that subject. So like both, the whole dance of it. They kind of go together really.

2234
03:31:09,360 --> 03:31:15,280
Yeah, they do. They really do. But take that part seriously. And probably in the way you're

2235
03:31:15,280 --> 03:31:23,200
describing it, careful how you define success because... You'll never find happiness in success.

2236
03:31:23,200 --> 03:31:27,120
I know there's a lovely quote from Robert Lewis Stevenson, I think, who said,

2237
03:31:27,120 --> 03:31:33,840
nothing in life is so disenchanting as attainment. Yeah, so I mean, in some sense,

2238
03:31:34,720 --> 03:31:42,480
the true definition of success is getting to do today what you really enjoy doing,

2239
03:31:42,480 --> 03:31:48,880
just what fills you with joy. And that's ultimately success. Success isn't the thing

2240
03:31:48,880 --> 03:31:56,560
beyond the horizon, the big trophy, the financials. I think it's as close as we can get to happiness.

2241
03:31:56,560 --> 03:32:01,520
That's not to say you're full of joy all the time, but it's as close as we can get to a sustained

2242
03:32:01,520 --> 03:32:05,840
human happiness is by getting some fulfillment from what you're doing on a daily basis. And if

2243
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:13,440
what you're looking for is the world giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize or a

2244
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:21,200
fellowship or whatever it is, then I've known people like this who they eat away by the

2245
03:32:22,640 --> 03:32:28,560
anger of the kind of caustic resentment that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.

2246
03:32:29,760 --> 03:32:33,520
And the other way, if you put too much value into those kinds of prizes and you win them,

2247
03:32:34,160 --> 03:32:38,320
I've gotten a chance to see that it also,

2248
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:45,840
the more, quote unquote, successful you are in that sense, the more you run the danger of

2249
03:32:48,560 --> 03:32:54,720
growing ego so big that you don't get to actually enjoy the beauty of this life,

2250
03:32:54,720 --> 03:33:00,400
you start to believe that you figured it all out, as opposed to I think what ultimately the most

2251
03:33:00,400 --> 03:33:05,600
fun thing is is being curious about everything around you, being constantly surprised, and

2252
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:10,800
these little moments of discovery of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.

2253
03:33:10,800 --> 03:33:14,640
And I think the bigger your ego grows, the more you start to take yourself seriously,

2254
03:33:14,640 --> 03:33:22,640
the less you're able to enjoy that. Oh man, I couldn't agree more. So the summary from harmless

2255
03:33:22,640 --> 03:33:28,160
to mostly harmless in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, how would you try to summarize

2256
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:37,120
earth? And if you were given, if you had to summarize the whole thing in a couple of sentences,

2257
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:45,280
and maybe throw in meaning of life in there, like why, why, why, maybe is that a defining

2258
03:33:45,280 --> 03:33:52,800
thing about humans that we care about the meaning of the whole thing? I wonder if that should be

2259
03:33:52,880 --> 03:33:59,280
part of the, these creatures seem to be very lost. Yes, I'm always asking why. I mean,

2260
03:33:59,280 --> 03:34:07,280
that's my defining question is why people used to make a joke. I have a small scar on my forehead

2261
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:12,720
from a climbing accident years ago. And the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock and he

2262
03:34:12,720 --> 03:34:18,160
shouted something, he shouted below, I think, meaning that the rock was coming down. And I

2263
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:24,400
hadn't caught what he said. So I looked up and it smashed straight on my forehead. And everybody

2264
03:34:24,400 --> 03:34:33,280
around me took the piss saying he looked up to ask why. Yeah, but that's a human imperative.

2265
03:34:33,280 --> 03:34:39,120
That's part of what it means to be human. Look up to the sky and ask why. And ask why.

2266
03:34:39,760 --> 03:34:43,040
So your question, define the earth.

2267
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:50,880
I'm not sure I can do that. I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.

2268
03:34:53,440 --> 03:34:55,360
I wouldn't like to say mostly living, but perhaps.

2269
03:34:56,560 --> 03:35:00,880
Mostly living. Well, it's interesting because like if you were to write

2270
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:10,400
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I suppose, say our idea we talked about the bacteria is the

2271
03:35:10,400 --> 03:35:18,560
most prominent form of life throughout the galaxy and the universe. I suppose the earth would be

2272
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:25,520
kind of unique and would require abundance in that case. Yeah, it's profligate, it's rich,

2273
03:35:25,520 --> 03:35:32,240
it's enormously living. So how would you describe that it's not bacteria? It's

2274
03:35:35,200 --> 03:35:41,200
eukaryotic. Yeah, well, I mean, that's the technical term, but it is basically.

2275
03:35:45,040 --> 03:35:50,000
Yeah, and then. How would I describe that? I've actually really struggled with that term,

2276
03:35:50,720 --> 03:35:56,240
because the word, I mean, there's few words quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off

2277
03:35:56,240 --> 03:36:01,200
immediately. You start using words like that and they'll leave the room. Krebs cycle is another

2278
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:08,800
one that gets people to leave the room. So I've tried to think, is there another word for eukaryotic

2279
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:14,480
that I can use? And really the only word that I've been able to use is complex cells,

2280
03:36:15,440 --> 03:36:22,480
complex life and so on. And that word, it serves one immediate purpose, which is to convey

2281
03:36:23,200 --> 03:36:30,800
an impression. But then it means so many different things just everybody that actually

2282
03:36:30,800 --> 03:36:37,600
is lost immediately. And so it's kind of. Well, that's unnoticeable from the perspective of other

2283
03:36:37,600 --> 03:36:42,800
planets. That is the noticeable face transition of complexity is the eukaryotic.

2284
03:36:45,280 --> 03:36:48,400
What about the harmless and the mostly harmless? Is that kind of?

2285
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:58,160
Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale. I don't think that humanity is in any danger of

2286
03:36:58,160 --> 03:37:03,200
disturbing the universe at the moment. At the moment, which is why the mostly,

2287
03:37:03,920 --> 03:37:09,440
we don't know, depends what you want us up to. Depends how many rockets. I think it's

2288
03:37:09,440 --> 03:37:16,240
it'll be still even then a while. I think before, before we disturb the fabric of time and space.

2289
03:37:16,240 --> 03:37:21,280
Was the aforementioned Andre Carpathia, I think he summarized earth as

2290
03:37:23,440 --> 03:37:31,120
as a system where you hammer it with a bunch of photons. The input is like photons and the output

2291
03:37:31,120 --> 03:37:37,840
is rockets. Well, that's the hell of a lot of photons before there was a rocket.

2292
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:43,920
You know, maybe maybe in the span of the universe, it's not, it's not that much time.

2293
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:49,680
And so, and I do wonder, you know, what the future is, whether we're just in the early

2294
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:55,200
beginnings of this earth, which is important when you try to summarize it, or we're at the end,

2295
03:37:56,160 --> 03:38:02,800
where humans have finally gained the ability to destroy the entirety of this beautiful project

2296
03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:08,560
we've got going on, that with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses, with all those kinds of

2297
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:14,000
things. Or just inadvertently through global warming and pollution and so on. We're quite

2298
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:18,160
capable of that. I mean, we just need to pass a tipping point. I mean, I think we're more likely

2299
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:23,200
to do it inadvertently than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time. But

2300
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:33,280
my fear is, is we just don't know where the tipping points are. And we will, we kind of think

2301
03:38:33,280 --> 03:38:38,320
we're smart enough to fix the problem quickly if we really need to. I think that's the overriding

2302
03:38:38,320 --> 03:38:44,000
assumption that we're all right for now. Maybe in 20 years time, it's going to be a calamitous

2303
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:47,200
problem. And then we'll really need to put some serious mental power into fixing it

2304
03:38:48,400 --> 03:38:54,480
without seriously worrying that perhaps that is too late. And that however brilliant we are,

2305
03:38:55,360 --> 03:39:02,240
it's, we miss the boat. And just walk off the cliff. I don't know. I have optimism in humans

2306
03:39:02,240 --> 03:39:08,720
being clever descendants. Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem. But it's an urgent

2307
03:39:08,720 --> 03:39:15,280
problem. And we need to fix it pretty sharpish. And I do have doubts about whether politically

2308
03:39:15,280 --> 03:39:21,600
we are capable of coming together enough to not just in any one country, but around the planet

2309
03:39:22,320 --> 03:39:27,680
to, I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will? Do we have the vision to

2310
03:39:28,640 --> 03:39:34,800
accomplish it? That's what makes this whole ride fun. I don't know. Not only do we not

2311
03:39:34,800 --> 03:39:39,920
know if we can handle the crises before us, we don't even know all the crises that are going to

2312
03:39:39,920 --> 03:39:46,880
be before us in the next 20 years. The ones I think that will most likely challenge us

2313
03:39:46,880 --> 03:39:51,280
in the 21st century are the ones we don't even expect. People didn't expect World War II.

2314
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:52,880
At the end of World War I.

2315
03:39:54,400 --> 03:39:59,600
Well, some people did, but not at the end of World War I, but by the late 1920s,

2316
03:39:59,600 --> 03:40:03,920
I think people were beginning to worry about it. Yeah, no, there's always people worrying about

2317
03:40:03,920 --> 03:40:08,800
everything. So if you focus on the thing that people worry about, because there's a million

2318
03:40:08,800 --> 03:40:14,160
things people worry about and 99.9999% of them don't come to be. Of course, the people that

2319
03:40:14,160 --> 03:40:19,520
turn out to be right, they'll say, I knew all along, but that's not an accurate way of knowing

2320
03:40:19,520 --> 03:40:24,800
what you could have predicted. I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it, but nobody

2321
03:40:24,800 --> 03:40:29,360
thought you could have another World War, the war to end all wars. Why would you have another war?

2322
03:40:29,920 --> 03:40:36,080
And the idea of nuclear weapons, just technologically, is a very difficult thing to

2323
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:41,840
anticipate to create a weapon that just jumps, orders the magnitude, and destructive capability.

2324
03:40:42,400 --> 03:40:46,720
And of course, we can intuit all the things like engineered viruses,

2325
03:40:46,720 --> 03:40:54,800
nanobots, artificial intelligence, yes, all the different complicated global effects of

2326
03:40:54,800 --> 03:40:59,120
global warming. So how that changes the allocation of resources, the flow of energy,

2327
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:04,320
the tension between countries, the military conflict between countries, the reallocation

2328
03:41:04,320 --> 03:41:11,040
of power, then looking at the role of China in this whole thing with Russia and growing influence

2329
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:18,000
of Africa and the weird dynamics of Europe, and then America falling apart through the political

2330
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:23,840
division fueled by recommender systems through Twitter and Facebook. The whole beautiful mess

2331
03:41:24,400 --> 03:41:29,840
is just fun. And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers, incredible scientists,

2332
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:35,440
incredible human beings that while everyone is bickering and so on online for the fun of it on

2333
03:41:35,440 --> 03:41:39,600
the weekends, they're actually trying to build solutions. And those are the people that will

2334
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:44,480
create something beautiful, at least I have, you know, that's the process of evolution. It's,

2335
03:41:45,520 --> 03:41:53,440
there was, it all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism that went out from the events

2336
03:41:54,000 --> 03:42:02,320
and was the parent to all of us. And for that guy or lady or both, I guess, is a big thank you.

2337
03:42:02,320 --> 03:42:07,520
And I can't wait to what happens next. And I'm glad there's incredible humans writing and studying

2338
03:42:07,600 --> 03:42:12,160
it like you are. Nick, it's a huge honor that you were talking to me. This is fantastic. This is

2339
03:42:12,160 --> 03:42:21,840
really amazing. I can't wait to read what you write next. Thank you for existing. And thank you

2340
03:42:21,840 --> 03:42:27,680
for talking today. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Lane. To support

2341
03:42:27,680 --> 03:42:32,800
this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some

2342
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:40,080
words from Steve Jobs. I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the

2343
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:48,960
intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning. Thank you for listening. I hope to

2344
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:59,520
see you next time.
