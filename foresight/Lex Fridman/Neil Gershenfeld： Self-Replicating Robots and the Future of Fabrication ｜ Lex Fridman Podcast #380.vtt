00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
The ribosome, who I mentioned a little while back,

00:02.440 --> 00:05.360
can make an elephant one molecule at a time.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.200
Ribosomes are slow.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.240
They run at about one molecule a second.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.480
But ribosomes make ribosomes.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.520
So you have trillions of them, and that makes an elephant.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.640
In the same way, these little assembly robots,

00:16.640 --> 00:20.280
I'm describing, can make giant structures at heart

00:20.280 --> 00:23.240
because the robot can make the robot.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.760
So more recently, two of my students, Amira and Miana,

00:26.760 --> 00:29.200
had a nature communication paper showing

00:29.240 --> 00:33.760
how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making

00:33.760 --> 00:35.520
so the robots can make the robot,

00:35.520 --> 00:38.160
so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.520
The following is a conversation with Neil Gershenfeld,

00:43.520 --> 00:46.720
the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms,

00:46.720 --> 00:49.880
an amazing laboratory that is breaking down boundaries

00:49.880 --> 00:52.560
between the digital and physical worlds,

00:52.560 --> 00:56.880
fabricating objects and machines at all scales of reality,

00:56.920 --> 00:59.920
including robots and automata

00:59.920 --> 01:02.240
that can build copies of themselves

01:02.240 --> 01:06.600
and self-assemble into complex structures.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.400
His work inspires millions across the world

01:09.400 --> 01:13.240
as part of the maker movement to build cool stuff,

01:13.240 --> 01:18.240
to create the very act that makes life so beautiful and fun.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.880
This is a Lex Friedman podcast.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.840
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:23.840 --> 01:25.000
in the description.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.520
And now, dear friends, here's Neil Gershenfeld.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.880
You have spent your life working at the boundary

01:31.880 --> 01:36.200
between bits and atoms, so the digital and the physical.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.960
What have you learned about engineering

01:38.960 --> 01:43.240
and about nature of reality from working at this divide,

01:43.240 --> 01:45.040
trying to bridge this divide?

01:45.040 --> 01:48.760
I learned why Van Neumann and Turing

01:48.760 --> 01:51.260
made fundamental mistakes.

01:52.260 --> 01:55.780
I learned the secret of life.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.180
Yeah.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.100
I learned how to solve many of the world's most important

02:01.100 --> 02:03.300
problems, which all sound presumptuous,

02:03.300 --> 02:05.460
but all of those are things I learned at that boundary.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.700
Okay, so Turing and Van Neumann, let's start there.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.820
Some of the most impactful, important humans

02:09.820 --> 02:12.620
who have ever lived in computing, why were they wrong?

02:12.620 --> 02:16.220
So, I worked with Andy Gleason,

02:16.220 --> 02:17.740
who is Turing's counterpart.

02:17.740 --> 02:20.140
So, just for background, if anybody doesn't know,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.140
Turing is credited with the modern architecture

02:22.140 --> 02:25.900
of computing, among many other things.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.380
Andy Gleason was his US counterpart.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.660
And you might not have heard of Andy Gleason,

02:31.660 --> 02:33.940
but you might have heard of the Hilbert problems.

02:33.940 --> 02:36.380
And Andy Gleason solved the fifth one.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.460
So, he was a really notable mathematician.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.340
During the war, he was Turing's counterpart.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.980
Then Van Neumann is credited with the modern architecture

02:43.980 --> 02:47.780
of computing, and one of his students was Marvin Minsky.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.140
So, I could ask Marvin what Johnny was thinking,

02:50.140 --> 02:52.940
and I could ask Andy what Alan was thinking.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.300
And what came out from that,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.060
what I came to appreciate as background,

02:58.060 --> 03:00.540
I never understood the difference between computer science

03:00.540 --> 03:01.900
and physical science.

03:01.900 --> 03:05.900
But Turing's machine, that's the foundation

03:05.900 --> 03:10.180
of modern computing, has a simple physics mistake,

03:10.180 --> 03:13.020
which is the head is distinct from the tape.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.860
So, in the Turing machine, there's a head

03:14.860 --> 03:17.540
that programmatically moves and reads and writes a tape.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.180
The head is distinct from the tape,

03:19.180 --> 03:22.060
which means persistence of information

03:22.060 --> 03:25.140
is separate from interaction with information.

03:26.220 --> 03:30.140
Then Van Neumann wrote deeply and beautifully

03:30.140 --> 03:32.700
about many things, but not computing.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.780
He wrote a horrible memo called the first draft

03:36.780 --> 03:38.660
of a report on the EDVAC,

03:38.660 --> 03:41.980
which is how you program a very early computer.

03:41.980 --> 03:46.060
In it, he essentially roughly took Turing's architecture

03:46.060 --> 03:47.620
and built it into a machine.

03:48.700 --> 03:53.580
So, the legacy of that is the computer somebody's using

03:53.580 --> 03:55.900
to watch this is spending much of its effort

03:55.900 --> 03:59.620
moving information from storage transistors

03:59.620 --> 04:01.380
to processing transistors,

04:01.380 --> 04:04.060
even though they have the same computational complexity.

04:04.060 --> 04:08.460
So, in computer science, when you learn about computing,

04:08.460 --> 04:10.900
there's a ridiculous taxonomy

04:10.900 --> 04:15.100
of about a hundred different models of computation.

04:15.140 --> 04:16.860
But they're all fictions.

04:16.860 --> 04:20.340
In physics, a patch of space occupies space.

04:20.340 --> 04:23.420
It stores state, it takes time to transit,

04:23.420 --> 04:24.780
and you can interact.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.140
That is the only model of computation that's physical.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.300
Everything else is a fiction.

04:30.300 --> 04:34.820
So, I really came to appreciate that a few years back

04:34.820 --> 04:36.460
when I did a keynote for the annual meeting

04:36.460 --> 04:38.500
of the supercomputer industry,

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
and then went into the halls and spent time

04:40.500 --> 04:42.300
with the supercomputer builders,

04:42.300 --> 04:45.580
and came to appreciate,

04:45.580 --> 04:48.020
oh, let's see, if you're familiar with the movie,

04:48.020 --> 04:52.140
The Metropolis, people would frolic upstairs in the gardens,

04:52.140 --> 04:54.540
and down in the basement, people would move levers.

04:54.540 --> 04:58.140
And that's how computing exists today,

04:58.140 --> 05:00.740
that we pretend software is not physical.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.620
It's separate from hardware.

05:02.620 --> 05:05.020
And the whole canon of computer science

05:05.020 --> 05:06.700
is based on this fiction

05:06.700 --> 05:09.580
that bits aren't constrained by atoms,

05:09.580 --> 05:12.700
but all sorts of scaling issues in computing

05:12.700 --> 05:13.740
come from that boundary,

05:13.740 --> 05:16.780
but all sorts of opportunities come from that boundary.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.740
And so, you can trace it all the way back

05:18.740 --> 05:22.060
to Turing's machine making this mistake

05:22.060 --> 05:23.220
between the head and the tape.

05:23.220 --> 05:28.220
Van Neumann, he never called it Van Neumann's architecture.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.180
He wrote about it in this dreadful memo,

05:30.180 --> 05:31.260
and then he wrote beautifully about

05:31.260 --> 05:32.900
other things we'll talk about.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.500
Now, to end a long answer, Turing and Van Neumann

05:36.500 --> 05:38.140
both knew this.

05:38.180 --> 05:41.900
So all of the canon of computer scientists credits them

05:41.900 --> 05:45.300
for what was never meant to be a computer architecture.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.300
Both Turing and Van Neumann ended their life

05:48.300 --> 05:52.300
studying exactly how software becomes hardware.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.300
So Van Neumann studied self-reproducing automata,

05:55.300 --> 05:58.420
how a machine communicates its own construction.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.580
A Turing studied morphogenesis,

06:00.580 --> 06:02.340
how genes give rise to form.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.140
They ended their life studying the embodiment of computation,

06:06.140 --> 06:09.140
something that's been forgotten by the canon of computing,

06:09.140 --> 06:10.900
but developed sort of off to the sides

06:10.900 --> 06:12.940
by a really interesting lineage.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.260
So there's no distinction between the head and the tape,

06:16.260 --> 06:17.940
between the computer and the computation.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.500
It is all computation.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.860
Right, so I never understood the difference

06:22.860 --> 06:25.540
between computer science and physical science.

06:25.540 --> 06:29.060
And working at that boundary helped lead to things

06:29.060 --> 06:31.100
like my lab was part of doing

06:31.100 --> 06:32.780
with a number of interesting collaborators,

06:32.780 --> 06:36.580
the First Fest or the classical quantum computations.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.340
We were part of a collaboration creating

06:39.340 --> 06:40.900
the minimal synthetic organism

06:40.900 --> 06:42.740
where you design life in a computer.

06:42.740 --> 06:45.500
Those both involve domains

06:45.500 --> 06:48.420
where you just can't separate hardware from software.

06:48.420 --> 06:51.180
The embodiment of computation is embodied

06:51.180 --> 06:52.900
in these really profound ways.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.860
So the first quantum computations,

06:56.860 --> 07:00.540
synthetic life, so in the space of biology,

07:00.540 --> 07:02.740
the space of physics at the lowest level

07:02.740 --> 07:05.740
and space of biology at the lowest level.

07:05.740 --> 07:09.260
So let's talk about CBA, Center of Bits and Atoms.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.940
What's the origin story of this MIT, legendary MIT center

07:12.940 --> 07:16.300
that you're a part of creating?

07:16.300 --> 07:19.780
In high school, I really wanted to go to vocational school

07:19.780 --> 07:24.100
where you learn to weld and fix cars and build houses.

07:24.100 --> 07:27.180
And I was told, no, you're smart, you have to sit in a room.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.380
And nobody could explain to me

07:28.380 --> 07:31.380
why I couldn't go to vocational school.

07:32.380 --> 07:35.140
I then worked at Bell Labs,

07:35.140 --> 07:39.460
this wonderful place before deregulation, legendary place.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.820
And I would get union grievances

07:41.820 --> 07:43.980
because I would go into the workshop

07:43.980 --> 07:45.380
and try to make something and they would say,

07:45.380 --> 07:48.700
no, you're smart, you have to tell somebody what to do.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.220
And it wasn't until MIT, and I'll explain how CBA started,

07:52.220 --> 07:55.580
but I could create CBA that I came to understand

07:55.580 --> 07:58.100
this is a mistake that dates back to the Renaissance.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.900
So in the Renaissance, the liberal arts emerged

08:01.900 --> 08:04.420
and liberal doesn't mean politically liberal.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.580
This was the path to liberation, birth of humanism.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.380
And so the liberal arts were the trivium, quadrivium,

08:10.380 --> 08:12.900
roughly language, natural science.

08:12.900 --> 08:17.900
And at that moment, what emerged was this dreadful concept

08:19.020 --> 08:20.580
of the illiberal arts.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.580
So anything that wasn't the liberal arts

08:22.580 --> 08:25.540
was for commercial gain and was just making stuff

08:25.580 --> 08:28.500
and wasn't valid for serious study.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.780
And so that's why we're left with learning to well

08:31.780 --> 08:34.140
wasn't a subject for serious study,

08:35.100 --> 08:37.420
but the means of expression have changed

08:37.420 --> 08:38.340
since the Renaissance.

08:38.340 --> 08:41.900
So micromachining or embedded coding

08:41.900 --> 08:44.420
is every bit as expressive as painting a painting

08:44.420 --> 08:45.460
or writing a sonnet.

08:45.460 --> 08:49.420
So never understanding this difference

08:49.420 --> 08:52.020
between computer science and physical science,

08:53.020 --> 08:58.020
the path that led me to create CBA with colleagues

08:58.140 --> 09:01.900
was, I was what's called the junior fellow at Harvard.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.220
I was visiting MIT through Marvin

09:04.220 --> 09:05.740
because I was interested in the physics

09:05.740 --> 09:07.020
of musical instruments.

09:08.540 --> 09:10.900
This will be another slight digression.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.820
And Cornell, I would study physics

09:13.820 --> 09:15.660
and then I would cross the street

09:15.660 --> 09:17.540
and go to the music department where I played the bassoon

09:17.540 --> 09:19.460
and I would trim reads and play the reads

09:19.460 --> 09:21.860
and they'd be beautiful, but then they'd get soggy.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.340
And then I discovered in the basement

09:23.340 --> 09:26.140
of the music department at Cornell was David Borden,

09:27.140 --> 09:28.260
who you might not have heard of,

09:28.260 --> 09:30.180
but is legendary in electronic music

09:30.180 --> 09:32.380
because he was really the first electronic musician.

09:32.380 --> 09:36.180
So Bob Mogue, who invented Mogue synthesizers

09:36.180 --> 09:39.420
was a physics student at Cornell like me crossing the street

09:39.420 --> 09:41.140
and eventually he was kicked out

09:41.140 --> 09:42.860
and invented electronic music.

09:42.860 --> 09:45.540
David Borden was the first musician

09:45.540 --> 09:47.060
who created electronic music.

09:47.060 --> 09:49.020
So he's legendary for people like Phil Glass

09:49.020 --> 09:50.460
and Steve Reich.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.940
And so that got me thinking about,

09:52.940 --> 09:55.620
I would behave as a scientist in the music department,

09:55.620 --> 09:57.900
but not in the physics department,

09:57.900 --> 09:59.260
but not in the music department,

09:59.260 --> 10:00.100
got me thinking about

10:00.100 --> 10:03.820
what's the computational capacity of a musical instrument.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.140
And through Marvin, he introduced me to Todd Backover

10:07.140 --> 10:08.860
at the Media Lab,

10:08.860 --> 10:11.660
who was just about to start a project with Yo-Yo Ma

10:11.660 --> 10:15.180
that led to a collaboration to instrument a cello,

10:15.180 --> 10:17.300
to extract Yo-Yo's data

10:17.300 --> 10:20.300
and bring it out into computational environments

10:20.300 --> 10:23.420
what is the computational capacity of a musical instrument?

10:23.420 --> 10:24.740
As we continue on this tangent

10:24.740 --> 10:26.180
and we'll share a return to CBA.

10:26.180 --> 10:31.180
Yeah, so one part of that is to understand the computing

10:33.020 --> 10:36.100
and if you look at like the finest timescale

10:36.100 --> 10:38.540
and length scale you need to model the physics,

10:38.540 --> 10:39.980
it's not heroic.

10:39.980 --> 10:42.900
A good GPU can do teraflops today.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.020
That used to be a national class supercomputer,

10:45.020 --> 10:46.300
now it's just a GPU.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.940
And that's about if you take the timescales

10:48.940 --> 10:50.700
and length scales relevant for the physics,

10:50.700 --> 10:53.380
that's about the scale of the physics computing.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.780
For Yo-Yo, what was really driving it

10:55.780 --> 10:59.500
was he's completely unsentimental about the Strad.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.180
It's not that it makes some magical wiggles

11:02.180 --> 11:03.380
in the sound wave,

11:03.380 --> 11:05.940
it's performance as a controller,

11:05.940 --> 11:09.860
how he can manipulate it as an interface device.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.500
Interface between one and what exactly?

11:11.500 --> 11:12.820
Him and sound.

11:12.820 --> 11:13.660
Okay, him and sound.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.700
And so what it led to was,

11:15.700 --> 11:18.020
I had started by thinking about ops per second,

11:18.020 --> 11:23.020
but Yo-Yo's question was really resolution and bandwidth.

11:23.140 --> 11:27.220
It's how fast can you measure what he does

11:27.220 --> 11:32.220
and the bandwidth and the resolution

11:32.900 --> 11:36.220
of detecting his controls

11:36.220 --> 11:38.420
and then mapping them into sounds.

11:38.420 --> 11:41.740
And what we found, what he found was

11:41.740 --> 11:44.140
if you instrument everything he does

11:44.140 --> 11:46.940
and connect it to almost anything,

11:46.980 --> 11:48.620
it sounds like Yo-Yo,

11:48.620 --> 11:51.220
that the magic is in the control,

11:51.220 --> 11:55.780
not in ineffable details in how the wood wiggles.

11:55.780 --> 11:59.060
And so with Yo-Yo and Todd, that led to a piece in,

11:59.060 --> 12:00.140
towards the end I asked Yo-Yo,

12:00.140 --> 12:02.860
what it would take for him to get rid of his Strad

12:02.860 --> 12:03.820
and use our stuff?

12:03.820 --> 12:05.460
And his answer was just logistics.

12:05.460 --> 12:09.140
It was at that time, our stuff was like a rack of electronics

12:09.140 --> 12:12.620
and lots of cables and some grad students to make it work.

12:12.620 --> 12:16.140
Once the technology becomes as invisible as the Strad,

12:16.380 --> 12:19.100
then sure, absolutely he would take it.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.060
And by the way, as a footnote on the footnote,

12:22.060 --> 12:25.140
an accident in the sensing of Yo-Yo's cello

12:25.140 --> 12:27.820
led to $100 million a year auto safety business

12:27.820 --> 12:29.860
to control airbags and cars.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.260
How did that work?

12:31.260 --> 12:34.020
I had to instrument the bow without interfering with it.

12:34.020 --> 12:38.100
So I set up local electromagnetic fields

12:38.100 --> 12:42.780
where I would detect how those fields interact

12:42.780 --> 12:45.380
with the bow he's playing.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.540
But we had a problem that his hand,

12:47.540 --> 12:49.660
whenever his hand got near the sensing fields,

12:49.660 --> 12:51.060
I would start sensing his hand

12:51.060 --> 12:53.580
rather than the materials on the bow.

12:53.580 --> 12:57.500
And I didn't quite understand what was going on

12:57.500 --> 13:00.180
with that interference.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.940
So my very first grad student ever, Josh Smith,

13:04.940 --> 13:07.420
did a thesis on tomography with electric fields,

13:07.420 --> 13:10.380
how to see in 3D with electric fields.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.380
Then through Todd and at that point,

13:13.380 --> 13:15.740
research scientist in my lab, Joe Paradiso,

13:15.740 --> 13:18.460
it led to a collaboration with Penn and Teller,

13:18.460 --> 13:21.820
who, where we did a magic trick in Las Vegas

13:21.820 --> 13:23.100
to contact Houdini.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.780
And sort of these fields are sort of like,

13:25.780 --> 13:27.140
contacting spirits.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.500
So we did a magic trick in Las Vegas.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.620
And then the crazy thing that happened after that

13:33.620 --> 13:37.820
was Phil Rittmueller came running into my lab.

13:37.820 --> 13:42.180
He worked with, this became with Honda and NEC,

13:42.220 --> 13:45.700
airbags were killing infants in rear-facing child seats.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.540
Cars need to distinguish a front-facing adult

13:49.540 --> 13:52.540
where you'd save the life versus a bag of groceries

13:52.540 --> 13:53.940
where you don't need to fire the airbag

13:53.940 --> 13:56.300
versus a rear-facing infant where you would kill it.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.820
And so the seat need to, in effect,

13:58.820 --> 14:01.140
see in 3D to understand the occupants.

14:01.140 --> 14:05.100
And so we took the Penn and Teller magic trick

14:05.100 --> 14:08.620
derived from Josh's thesis from Yo-Yo's cello

14:08.620 --> 14:10.060
to an auto show.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.100
And all the car companies said,

14:11.140 --> 14:12.820
great, when can we buy it?

14:12.820 --> 14:15.900
And so that became Elisys and it was $100 million a year

14:15.900 --> 14:17.700
business making sensors.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.060
There wasn't a lot of publicity

14:19.060 --> 14:22.180
because it was in the car so the car didn't kill you.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.500
So they didn't sort of advertise,

14:24.500 --> 14:26.780
we have nice sensors so the car doesn't kill you.

14:26.780 --> 14:28.900
But it became a leading auto safety sensor.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.580
And that started from the cello

14:30.580 --> 14:33.260
and the question of the computational capacity,

14:33.260 --> 14:34.180
the musical instrument.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.020
Right.

14:35.020 --> 14:39.340
So now to get back to MIT,

14:39.340 --> 14:42.260
I was spending a lot of outside time at IBM research

14:42.260 --> 14:45.100
that had gods of the foundations of computing.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.220
There's just amazing people there.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.300
And I'd always expected to go to IBM to take over a lab.

14:52.300 --> 14:57.100
But at the last minute, pivoted and came to MIT

14:57.100 --> 15:02.100
to take a position in the media lab

15:02.500 --> 15:05.460
and start what became the predecessor to CBA.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.940
Media lab is well known for Nicholas Negarpanti.

15:09.940 --> 15:13.460
What's less well known is the role of Jerry Wiesner.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.740
So Jerry was MIT's president

15:15.740 --> 15:17.540
before that Kennedy science advisor,

15:17.540 --> 15:20.140
grand old man of science.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.740
At the end of his life,

15:21.740 --> 15:25.940
he was frustrated by how knowledge was segregated.

15:25.940 --> 15:28.220
And so he wanted to create a department

15:28.220 --> 15:30.140
of none of the above,

15:30.140 --> 15:33.540
a department for work that didn't fit in departments.

15:33.580 --> 15:37.100
And the media lab in a sense was a cover story

15:37.100 --> 15:38.660
for him to hide a department.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.300
As MIT's president towards the end of his tenure,

15:42.300 --> 15:44.100
if he said, I'm gonna make a department

15:44.100 --> 15:45.660
for things that don't fit in departments,

15:45.660 --> 15:47.660
the departments would have screamed.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.460
But everybody was sort of paying attention

15:49.460 --> 15:50.980
to Nicholas creating the media lab

15:50.980 --> 15:53.700
and Jerry kind of hid in it a department

15:53.700 --> 15:55.260
called media arts and sciences.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.940
It's really the department of none of the above.

15:57.940 --> 16:01.020
And Jerry explaining that and Nicholas then confirming it

16:01.020 --> 16:03.860
is really why I pivoted and went to MIT.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.580
Because my students who helped create quantum computing

16:07.580 --> 16:11.460
or synthetic life get degrees from media arts and sciences,

16:11.460 --> 16:13.580
this department of none of the above.

16:14.660 --> 16:19.660
So that led to coming to MIT with Todd and Joe Paradiso

16:21.260 --> 16:23.060
and my colleague, we started a consortium

16:23.060 --> 16:24.340
called Things That Think.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.340
And this was around the birth of internet of things

16:27.340 --> 16:29.900
and RFID.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.940
But then we started doing things like work we can discuss

16:32.940 --> 16:35.340
that became the beginnings of quantum computing

16:35.340 --> 16:37.380
and cryptography and materials

16:37.380 --> 16:39.940
and logic and microfluidics.

16:39.940 --> 16:44.940
And those needed much more significant infrastructure

16:45.340 --> 16:47.300
and were much longer research arcs.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.660
So with a bigger team of about 20 people,

16:50.660 --> 16:52.700
we wrote a proposal to the NSF

16:52.700 --> 16:54.180
to assemble one of every tool

16:54.180 --> 16:57.660
to make anything of any size was roughly the proposal.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.580
One of any tool to make anything of any size.

17:01.580 --> 17:05.580
Yeah, so they're usually nanometers, micrometers,

17:05.580 --> 17:07.860
millimeters, meters are segregated,

17:07.860 --> 17:09.860
input and output is segregated.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.020
We wanted to look just very literally

17:13.020 --> 17:16.980
how digital becomes physical and physical becomes digital.

17:16.980 --> 17:21.660
And fortunately, we got NSF on a good day

17:21.660 --> 17:25.580
and they funded this facility of one of almost every tool

17:25.580 --> 17:27.100
to make anything.

17:27.100 --> 17:32.020
And so with a group of core colleagues

17:32.860 --> 17:36.980
that included Joe Jacobson, Ike Trang, Scott Minales,

17:36.980 --> 17:38.300
we launched CBA.

17:39.540 --> 17:42.860
And so you're talking about nanoscale, microscale,

17:42.860 --> 17:45.580
nanostructures, microstructures, macrostructures,

17:45.580 --> 17:48.180
electron microscopes and focus time beam probes

17:48.180 --> 17:51.620
for nanostructures, laser, micro machining

17:51.620 --> 17:55.300
and X-ray microtomography for microstructures,

17:55.340 --> 17:57.060
multi-axis machining and 3D printing

17:57.060 --> 17:59.100
for macrostructures, just some examples.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.740
What are we talking about in terms of scale?

18:00.740 --> 18:04.100
How can we build tiny things and big things

18:04.100 --> 18:05.180
all in one place, is that possible?

18:05.180 --> 18:07.740
Yeah, so a well-equipped research lab

18:07.740 --> 18:09.940
has the sort of tools we're talking about,

18:09.940 --> 18:12.340
but they're segregated in different places.

18:12.340 --> 18:16.580
They're typically also run by technicians

18:16.580 --> 18:19.620
where you then have an account and a project and you charge.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.140
All of these tools are essentially

18:22.140 --> 18:23.460
when you don't know what you're doing,

18:23.460 --> 18:25.100
not when you do know what you're doing

18:25.100 --> 18:28.300
in that they're when you need to work across length scales

18:28.300 --> 18:33.020
where we don't, once projects are running in this facility,

18:33.020 --> 18:36.340
we don't charge for time,

18:36.340 --> 18:38.980
you don't make a formal proposal to schedule

18:38.980 --> 18:41.860
and the users really run the tools and it's for work

18:41.860 --> 18:43.780
that's kind of in Co8 that needs to span

18:43.780 --> 18:46.540
these disciplines and length scales.

18:46.540 --> 18:51.540
And so work in the project today,

18:51.740 --> 18:55.860
work in CBA today ranges from developing

18:55.860 --> 18:59.220
Zeptojoule electronics for the lowest power computing

18:59.220 --> 19:03.580
to micromachining diamond to take 10 million RPM bearings

19:03.580 --> 19:06.340
for molecular spectroscopy studies

19:06.340 --> 19:09.740
up to exploring robots to build

19:09.740 --> 19:12.820
100 meter structures in space.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.940
Okay, can we, the three things you just mentioned,

19:15.940 --> 19:17.780
let's start with the biggest.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.380
What are some of the biggest stuff you attempted

19:20.380 --> 19:22.300
to explore how to build in a lab?

19:22.300 --> 19:26.100
Sure, so viewed from one direction,

19:26.100 --> 19:29.940
what we're talking about is a crazy random seeming

19:29.940 --> 19:32.700
of almost unrelated projects.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.380
But if you rotate 90 degrees,

19:34.380 --> 19:37.980
it's really just a core thought over and over again,

19:37.980 --> 19:41.340
just very literally how bits and atoms relate,

19:41.340 --> 19:44.660
how digital and just going from digital to physical

19:44.660 --> 19:45.820
in many different domains,

19:45.820 --> 19:48.740
but it's really just the same idea over and over again.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.820
So to understand the biggest things,

19:52.060 --> 19:56.940
let me go back to bring in now Shannon

19:56.940 --> 19:59.300
as well as Van Neumann.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.140
Claude Shannon.

20:00.140 --> 20:02.620
Yeah, so what is digital?

20:04.220 --> 20:08.300
The casual obvious answer is digital in one and zero,

20:08.300 --> 20:09.700
but that's wrong.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.100
There's a much deeper answer,

20:11.100 --> 20:16.100
which is Claude Shannon at MIT wrote the best master thesis

20:16.700 --> 20:18.540
ever in his master's thesis,

20:18.540 --> 20:22.340
he invented our modern notion of digital logic.

20:22.340 --> 20:27.340
Where it came from was Vannevar Bush was a grand old man

20:27.820 --> 20:31.820
at MIT, he created the post war research establishment

20:31.820 --> 20:34.140
that led to the National Science Foundation

20:34.140 --> 20:37.340
and he made an important mistake, which we can talk about.

20:37.340 --> 20:40.620
But he also made the differential analyzer,

20:40.620 --> 20:42.900
which was the last grade analog computer.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.300
So it was a room full of gears and pulleys

20:46.220 --> 20:49.020
and the longer it ran, the worse the answer was.

20:49.020 --> 20:52.540
And Shannon worked on it as a student

20:52.540 --> 20:55.060
and he got so annoyed in his master's thesis,

20:55.060 --> 20:57.700
he invented digital logic,

20:57.700 --> 20:59.740
but he then went on to Bell Labs.

20:59.740 --> 21:03.100
And what he did there was communication

21:03.100 --> 21:05.220
was beginning to expand,

21:05.220 --> 21:07.540
there was more demand for phone lines.

21:07.540 --> 21:11.780
And so there's a question about how many phone lines

21:11.780 --> 21:14.620
you could, phone messages you could send down a wire.

21:15.420 --> 21:17.940
And you could try to just make it better and better.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.820
He asked a question nobody had asked,

21:19.820 --> 21:21.740
which is rather than make it better and better,

21:21.740 --> 21:23.740
what's the limit to how good it can be?

21:23.740 --> 21:26.860
And he proved a couple of things,

21:26.860 --> 21:28.620
but one of the main things he proved

21:28.620 --> 21:32.660
was a threshold theorem for channel capacity.

21:32.660 --> 21:36.500
And so what he showed was my voice to you right now

21:36.500 --> 21:38.460
is coming as a wave through sound

21:38.460 --> 21:40.900
and the further you get, the worse it sounds.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.820
But people watching this are getting it

21:43.460 --> 21:46.180
as packets of data in a network.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.340
When the computer, they're watching this,

21:50.340 --> 21:52.780
gets the packet of information,

21:53.780 --> 21:56.940
it can detect and correct an error.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.820
And what Shannon showed is if the noise

21:59.820 --> 22:02.380
in the cable to the people watching this

22:02.380 --> 22:04.980
is above a threshold, they're doomed.

22:04.980 --> 22:07.460
But if the noise is below a threshold

22:07.460 --> 22:10.300
for a linear increase in the energy

22:10.300 --> 22:12.420
representing our conversation,

22:12.460 --> 22:15.540
the error rate goes down exponentially.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.180
Exponentials are fast.

22:17.180 --> 22:19.620
There's very few of them in engineering.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.100
And the exponential reduction of error

22:22.100 --> 22:25.060
below a threshold if you restore state

22:25.060 --> 22:27.260
is called a threshold theorem.

22:27.260 --> 22:29.300
That's what led to digital.

22:29.300 --> 22:32.340
That means unreliable things can work reliably.

22:32.340 --> 22:34.900
So Shannon did that for communication.

22:34.900 --> 22:38.660
Then Van Neumann was inspired by that

22:38.660 --> 22:40.860
and applied it to computation.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.100
And he showed how an unreliable computer

22:43.100 --> 22:44.900
can operate reliably

22:44.900 --> 22:48.180
by using the same threshold property of restoring state.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.620
It was then forgotten many years.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.300
We had to rediscover it in effect

22:51.300 --> 22:52.940
in the quantum computing era

22:52.940 --> 22:54.820
when things are very unreliable again.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.620
But now to go back to how does this relate

22:58.620 --> 23:00.620
to the biggest things I've made?

23:00.620 --> 23:05.620
So in fabrication, MIT invented

23:06.460 --> 23:10.180
computer-controlled manufacturing in 1952.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.460
Jet aircraft were just emerging.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.860
There was a limit to turning cranks

23:14.860 --> 23:19.780
on a milling machine to make parts for jet aircraft.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.060
Now, this is a messy story.

23:21.060 --> 23:23.740
MIT actually stole computer-controlled machining

23:23.740 --> 23:26.020
from an inventor who brought it to MIT.

23:26.020 --> 23:28.340
Wanted to do a joint project with the Air Force

23:28.340 --> 23:30.140
and MIT effectively stole it from him.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.460
So it's kind of a messy history.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.100
But that sounds like the birth

23:35.100 --> 23:38.020
of computer-controlled machining, 1952.

23:39.020 --> 23:42.140
There are a number of inventors of 3D printing.

23:42.140 --> 23:44.220
One of the companies spun off my lab

23:44.220 --> 23:45.900
by Max Lobowski's form labs,

23:45.900 --> 23:48.780
which is now a billion dollar 3D printing company.

23:48.780 --> 23:50.620
That's the modern version.

23:50.620 --> 23:54.860
But all of that's analog, meaning the information

23:54.860 --> 23:56.060
is in the control computer.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.020
There's no information in the materials.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.580
And so it goes back to Vannevar Bush's analog computer.

24:01.580 --> 24:04.380
If you make a mistake in printing or machining,

24:04.380 --> 24:06.820
just the mistake accumulates.

24:06.940 --> 24:11.940
The real birth of computerized digital manufacturing

24:12.100 --> 24:14.100
is four billion years ago.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.980
That's the evolutionary age of the ribosome.

24:16.980 --> 24:21.140
So the way you're manufactured

24:21.140 --> 24:26.140
is there's a code that describes you, the genetic code.

24:26.420 --> 24:30.620
It goes to a micro machine, the ribosome,

24:30.620 --> 24:32.340
which is this molecular factory

24:32.340 --> 24:36.360
that builds the molecules that are you.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.980
The key thing to know about that

24:38.980 --> 24:43.580
is there are about 20 amino acids that get assembled.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.380
And in that machinery,

24:45.380 --> 24:47.900
it does everything Shannon and Van Neumann taught us.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.580
You detect and correct errors.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.540
So if you mix chemicals,

24:51.540 --> 24:54.020
the error rate is about a part in a hundred.

24:54.020 --> 24:57.020
When you elongate a protein in the ribosome,

24:57.020 --> 24:59.100
it's about a part in 10 to the four.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.940
When you replicate DNA,

25:00.940 --> 25:03.180
there's an extra level of error correction.

25:03.180 --> 25:05.260
It's a part in 10 to the eight.

25:05.260 --> 25:08.500
And so in the molecules that make you,

25:08.500 --> 25:10.660
you can detect and correct errors

25:10.660 --> 25:12.700
and you don't need a ruler to make you.

25:12.700 --> 25:15.300
The geometry comes from your parts.

25:15.300 --> 25:19.420
So now compare a child playing with Lego

25:19.420 --> 25:21.660
and a state-of-the-art 3D printer

25:21.660 --> 25:23.540
or a computerized milling machine.

25:24.860 --> 25:27.180
The tower made by a child

25:27.180 --> 25:29.540
is more accurate than their motor control

25:29.540 --> 25:31.860
because the act of snapping the bricks together

25:31.860 --> 25:33.860
gives you a constraint on the joints.

25:35.020 --> 25:38.500
You can join bricks made out of dissimilar materials.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.100
You don't need a ruler for Lego

25:40.100 --> 25:42.980
because the geometry locally gives you the global parts

25:42.980 --> 25:44.540
and there's no Lego trash.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.580
The parts have enough information to disassemble them.

25:47.580 --> 25:52.180
Those are exactly the properties of a digital code.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.060
The unreliable is made reliable.

25:54.060 --> 25:55.460
Yes, absolutely.

25:55.460 --> 25:59.620
So what the ribosome figured out four billion years ago

25:59.620 --> 26:03.540
is how to embody these digital properties

26:03.540 --> 26:07.540
but not for communication or computation

26:07.540 --> 26:09.900
in effect but for construction.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.180
So a number of projects in my lab

26:13.180 --> 26:16.380
have been studying the idea of digital materials

26:16.380 --> 26:20.340
and think of a digital material just as Lego bricks.

26:20.340 --> 26:24.340
The precise meaning is a discrete set of parts

26:24.340 --> 26:28.380
reversibly joined with global geometry

26:28.380 --> 26:30.580
determined from local constraints.

26:30.580 --> 26:33.380
And so it's digitizing the materials.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.620
And so I'm coming back to

26:34.620 --> 26:36.380
what are the biggest things I've made?

26:36.380 --> 26:38.780
My lab was working with the aerospace industry.

26:38.780 --> 26:42.020
So Spirit Arrow was Boeing's factories.

26:42.020 --> 26:44.700
They asked us for how to join composites.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.460
When you make a composite airplane,

26:46.460 --> 26:48.900
you make these giant wing and fuselage parts

26:48.900 --> 26:52.260
and they asked us for a better way to stick them together

26:52.260 --> 26:54.540
because the joints were a place of failure.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.500
And what we discovered was

26:57.500 --> 26:59.740
instead of making a few big parts,

26:59.740 --> 27:02.940
if you make little loops of carbon fiber

27:02.940 --> 27:06.220
and you reversibly link them in joints

27:06.220 --> 27:09.020
and you do it in a special geometry

27:09.020 --> 27:12.460
that balances being under constrained and over constrained

27:12.460 --> 27:14.780
with just the right degrees of freedom.

27:14.780 --> 27:18.260
We set the world record for the highest modulus

27:18.260 --> 27:20.140
ultralight material

27:20.180 --> 27:24.620
just by in effect making carbon fiber Lego.

27:24.620 --> 27:29.300
So lightweight materials are crucial for energy efficiency.

27:29.300 --> 27:32.300
This let us make the lightest weight,

27:32.300 --> 27:34.020
high modulus material.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.740
We then showed that with just a few part types

27:37.740 --> 27:39.980
we can tune the material properties

27:39.980 --> 27:43.260
and then you can create really wild robots

27:43.260 --> 27:45.940
that instead of having a tool the size of a jumbo jet

27:45.940 --> 27:47.020
to make a jumbo jet,

27:47.020 --> 27:48.620
you can make little robots

27:48.620 --> 27:50.740
that walk on these cellular structures

27:50.740 --> 27:52.260
to build the structures

27:52.260 --> 27:54.620
where they error correct their position on the structure

27:54.620 --> 27:56.740
and they navigate on the structure.

27:56.740 --> 28:00.740
And so using all of that with NASA,

28:02.100 --> 28:04.580
we made morphing airplanes.

28:04.580 --> 28:08.420
A former student Kenny Chang and Ben Jeanette

28:08.420 --> 28:09.380
made a morphing airplane

28:09.380 --> 28:12.020
the size of NASA Langley's biggest wind tunnel.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.700
With Toyota, we've made super efficiency race cars.

28:15.700 --> 28:18.060
We're right now looking at projects with NASA

28:18.060 --> 28:20.220
to build these for things like space telescopes

28:20.220 --> 28:23.620
and space habitats where the ribosome

28:23.620 --> 28:25.220
I who I mentioned a little while back

28:25.220 --> 28:28.180
can make an elephant one molecule at a time.

28:28.180 --> 28:29.980
Ribosomes are slow.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.060
They run at about one molecule a second

28:32.060 --> 28:34.300
but ribosomes make ribosomes.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.260
So you have thousands of them,

28:36.260 --> 28:38.620
billions of them and that makes an elephant.

28:38.620 --> 28:41.300
In the same way these little assembly robots I'm describing

28:41.300 --> 28:44.580
can make giant structures at heart

28:44.580 --> 28:47.540
because the robot can make the robot.

28:47.540 --> 28:51.100
So more recently to my students, Samira and Miana

28:51.100 --> 28:53.500
had a nature communication paper showing

28:53.500 --> 28:58.060
how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making

28:58.060 --> 28:59.820
so the robots can make the robot.

28:59.820 --> 29:02.340
So you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.

29:02.340 --> 29:03.180
It can self-replicate.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.140
Can you linger on what that robot looks like?

29:05.140 --> 29:07.180
What is a robot that can walk along

29:07.180 --> 29:08.620
and do error correction?

29:08.620 --> 29:11.900
And what is a robot that can self-replicate

29:13.220 --> 29:14.860
from the materials that is given?

29:14.860 --> 29:15.700
What does that look like?

29:15.700 --> 29:16.540
What are we talking?

29:17.020 --> 29:17.860
This is fascinating.

29:17.860 --> 29:21.700
Yeah, the answer is different at different length scales.

29:21.700 --> 29:25.740
So to explain that in biology, primary structure

29:25.740 --> 29:28.540
is the code in the messenger RNA

29:28.540 --> 29:31.220
that says what the ribosome should build.

29:31.220 --> 29:33.860
Secondary structure are geometrical motifs

29:33.860 --> 29:35.860
or things like helices or sheets.

29:35.860 --> 29:38.540
Tertiary structures are functional elements

29:38.540 --> 29:40.940
like electron donors or acceptors.

29:40.940 --> 29:45.940
Quaternary structure is things like molecular motors

29:46.020 --> 29:47.220
that are moving my mouth

29:47.220 --> 29:49.580
or making the synapses work in my brain.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.540
So there's that hierarchy of primary,

29:51.540 --> 29:53.900
secondary, tertiary, quaternary.

29:53.900 --> 29:58.900
Now, what's interesting is if you wanna buy electronics today

29:59.260 --> 30:02.740
from a vendor, there are hundreds of thousands of types

30:02.740 --> 30:07.740
of resistors or capacitors or transistors, huge inventory.

30:07.780 --> 30:09.980
All of biology is just made from this inventory

30:09.980 --> 30:11.700
of 20 parts of the amino acids.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.540
And by composing them, you can create all of life.

30:14.580 --> 30:19.580
And so as part of this digitization of materials,

30:20.740 --> 30:22.900
we're in effect trying to create something

30:22.900 --> 30:24.540
like amino acids for engineering,

30:24.540 --> 30:27.700
creating all of technology from 20 parts.

30:27.700 --> 30:31.340
I see, as another discretion,

30:31.340 --> 30:34.860
I helped start an office for science in Hollywood.

30:34.860 --> 30:38.100
And there was a fun thing for the movie, The Martian,

30:38.100 --> 30:41.180
where I did a program with Bill Nye and a few others

30:41.180 --> 30:43.580
on how to actually build a civilization on Mars

30:43.580 --> 30:45.940
that they described in a way that I like

30:45.940 --> 30:49.060
as I was talking about how to go to Mars without luggage.

30:49.060 --> 30:52.860
And at heart, it's sort of how to create life

30:52.860 --> 30:54.340
in non-living materials.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.820
So if you think about this primary,

30:56.820 --> 30:59.060
secondary, tertiary, quaternary structure,

31:00.180 --> 31:02.380
in my lab, we're doing that,

31:02.380 --> 31:04.460
but on different length scales for different purposes.

31:04.460 --> 31:08.660
So we're making micro robots out of like nanobricks

31:08.660 --> 31:12.940
and to make the robots to build large scale structures

31:12.940 --> 31:16.980
in space, the elements of the robots now are centimeters

31:16.980 --> 31:19.460
rather than micrometers.

31:19.460 --> 31:23.300
And so the assembly robots for the bigger structures are,

31:25.740 --> 31:27.900
there are the cells that make up the structure,

31:27.900 --> 31:29.580
but then we have functional cells.

31:29.580 --> 31:32.460
And so cells that can process and actuate,

31:32.460 --> 31:35.380
each cell can like move one degree of freedom

31:35.380 --> 31:40.460
or attach or detach or process.

31:40.460 --> 31:43.140
Now, those elements I just described,

31:43.140 --> 31:45.340
we can make out of the still smaller parts.

31:45.340 --> 31:47.820
So eventually there's a hierarchy of the little parts

31:47.820 --> 31:49.660
make little robots that make bigger parts

31:49.660 --> 31:52.620
of bigger robots up through that hierarchy.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.460
And that way you can move up the length scale.

31:54.460 --> 31:57.380
Right, early on I tried to go in a straight line

31:57.380 --> 31:58.540
from the bottom to the top

31:58.540 --> 32:00.460
and that ended up being a bad idea.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.940
Instead, we're kind of doing all of these in parallel

32:02.940 --> 32:04.820
and then they're growing together.

32:04.820 --> 32:08.340
And so to make the larger scale structures,

32:08.340 --> 32:10.300
like there's a lot of hype right now

32:10.300 --> 32:11.540
about 3D printing houses

32:11.540 --> 32:13.900
where you have a printer the size of the house.

32:13.900 --> 32:17.340
We're now working on using swarms of these,

32:17.340 --> 32:19.580
table scale robots that walk on the structures

32:19.580 --> 32:22.380
to place the parts much more efficiently.

32:22.380 --> 32:23.740
That's amazing.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.940
But you're saying you can't for now go

32:25.940 --> 32:27.900
from the very small to the very large.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.860
That'll come in stages.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.020
Can we just link around this idea

32:33.020 --> 32:36.660
starting from Vinoyman's self replicating automata

32:36.660 --> 32:39.740
that you mentioned, it's just a beautiful idea.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.620
That's at the heart of all of this.

32:41.620 --> 32:42.940
In the stack I described,

32:42.940 --> 32:44.860
so one student, Will Langford,

32:44.860 --> 32:47.540
made these micro-robots out of little parts

32:47.540 --> 32:50.780
that then we're using for Miana's bigger robots

32:50.780 --> 32:52.220
up through this hierarchy.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.980
And it's really realizing

32:53.980 --> 32:56.060
this idea of the self-reproducing automata.

32:56.060 --> 32:59.020
So Vinoyman, when I complained about

32:59.020 --> 33:01.420
the Vinoyman architecture,

33:01.420 --> 33:02.820
it's not fair to Vinoyman

33:02.820 --> 33:04.820
because he never claimed it as his architecture.

33:04.820 --> 33:07.300
He really wrote about it in this one fairly dreadful memo

33:07.300 --> 33:08.940
that led to all sorts of lawsuits

33:08.940 --> 33:11.900
and fights about the early days of computing.

33:11.900 --> 33:15.620
He did beautiful work on reliable computation

33:15.620 --> 33:17.100
and reliable devices.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.500
And towards the end of his life,

33:18.500 --> 33:21.500
what he studied was how,

33:21.500 --> 33:24.060
and I have to say this precisely,

33:24.060 --> 33:27.500
how a computation communicates its own construction.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.980
Yeah, so beautiful.

33:28.980 --> 33:33.980
So a computation can store a description

33:34.020 --> 33:35.980
of how to build itself.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.620
But now there's a really hard problem,

33:38.660 --> 33:43.500
which is if you have that in your mind,

33:43.500 --> 33:48.060
how do you transfer it and wake up a thing

33:48.060 --> 33:50.300
that then can contain it?

33:50.300 --> 33:51.740
So how do you give birth to a thing

33:51.740 --> 33:53.660
that knows how to make itself?

33:53.660 --> 33:56.340
And so with Stan Ulam,

33:56.340 --> 34:00.300
he invented cellular automata as a way to simulate these.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.980
But that was theoretical.

34:03.980 --> 34:05.900
Now the work I'm describing in my lab

34:05.900 --> 34:08.500
is fundamentally how to realize it,

34:08.500 --> 34:13.140
how to realize self-reproducing automata.

34:13.140 --> 34:16.860
And so this is something Van Neumann thought very deeply

34:16.860 --> 34:19.620
and very beautifully about theoretically.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.020
And it's right at this intersection.

34:22.020 --> 34:27.020
It's not communication or computation or fabrication.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.660
It's right at this intersection

34:28.660 --> 34:31.420
where communication and computation meets fabrication.

34:32.300 --> 34:36.020
Now the reason self-reproducing automata intellectually

34:36.020 --> 34:36.860
is so important,

34:36.860 --> 34:38.460
is this is the foundation of life.

34:38.460 --> 34:39.820
This is really just understanding

34:39.820 --> 34:42.100
the essence of how to life.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.700
And in effect, we're trying to create life

34:43.700 --> 34:45.380
in non-living material.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.380
The reason it's so important technologically

34:48.380 --> 34:50.820
is because that's how you scale capacity.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.540
That's how you can make an elephant from a ribosome

34:53.540 --> 34:56.340
because the assemblers make assemblers.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.340
So simple building blocks

34:58.340 --> 35:01.180
that inside themselves contain the information

35:01.180 --> 35:03.420
how to build more building blocks.

35:03.420 --> 35:08.220
And between each other construct arbitrarily complex objects.

35:08.220 --> 35:09.820
Now let me give you the numbers.

35:09.820 --> 35:11.860
So let me relate this to right now

35:11.860 --> 35:15.860
we're living in AI mania explosion time.

35:15.860 --> 35:18.940
Let me relate that to what we're talking about.

35:19.860 --> 35:22.380
A hundred petaflop computer,

35:22.380 --> 35:27.380
which is a current generation supercomputer,

35:27.420 --> 35:29.140
not quite the biggest ones,

35:29.980 --> 35:32.900
does 10 to the 17 ops per second.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.820
Your brain does 10 to the 17 ops per second.

35:35.820 --> 35:38.060
It has about 10 to the 15 synapses

35:38.060 --> 35:40.140
and they run at about a hundred hertz.

35:40.140 --> 35:43.140
So as of a year or two ago,

35:43.140 --> 35:47.700
the performance of a big computer matched a brain.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.540
So you could view AI as a breakthrough,

35:50.540 --> 35:55.540
but the real story is within about a year or two ago,

35:55.780 --> 35:57.980
and let's see that the supercomputer

35:57.980 --> 36:01.500
has about 10 to the 15 transistors in the processors,

36:01.500 --> 36:03.380
10 to the 15 transistors in the memory,

36:03.380 --> 36:05.220
which is the synapses in your brain.

36:05.220 --> 36:06.940
So the real breakthrough was

36:06.940 --> 36:11.700
the computers match the computational capacity of a brain.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.140
And so we'd be sort of derelict

36:13.140 --> 36:15.540
if they couldn't do about the same thing.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.700
But now the reason I'm mentioning that is

36:18.700 --> 36:23.340
the chip fab making the supercomputer

36:23.340 --> 36:27.380
is placing about 10 to the 10 transistors a second.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.780
While you're digesting your lunch right now,

36:30.460 --> 36:33.840
you're placing about 10 to the 18 parts per second.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.540
There's an eight order of magnitude difference.

36:38.540 --> 36:42.460
So in computational capacity, it's done, we've caught up.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.060
But there's eight orders of magnitude difference

36:45.060 --> 36:47.620
in the rate at which biology can build

36:47.620 --> 36:50.860
versus state-of-the-art manufacturing can build.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.960
And that distinction is what we're talking about.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.260
That distinction is not analog,

36:56.260 --> 36:58.780
but this deep sense of digital fabrication,

36:58.820 --> 37:01.140
of embodying codes in construction.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.900
So a description doesn't describe a thing,

37:02.900 --> 37:04.980
but the description becomes the thing.

37:04.980 --> 37:07.420
So you're saying, I mean, this is one of the cases

37:07.420 --> 37:10.460
you're making and that this is this third revolution.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.540
We've seen the Moore's Law in communication,

37:12.540 --> 37:15.380
we've seen the Moore's Law-like type of growth

37:15.380 --> 37:19.460
in computation, and you're anticipating,

37:19.460 --> 37:22.220
we're going to see that in digital fabrication.

37:22.220 --> 37:23.820
Can you actually first of all describe

37:23.820 --> 37:26.460
what you mean by this term, digital fabrication?

37:26.460 --> 37:29.460
So the casual meaning is the computer controls

37:29.460 --> 37:31.540
the tool to make something.

37:31.540 --> 37:35.140
And that was invented when MIT stole it in 1952.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.620
There's the deep meaning of what the ribosome does,

37:39.620 --> 37:44.620
of a digital description doesn't describe a thing,

37:45.660 --> 37:48.100
a digital description becomes the thing.

37:48.100 --> 37:53.020
That's the path to the Star Trek replicator,

37:53.020 --> 37:56.300
and that's the thing that doesn't exist yet.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.540
Now, I think the best way to understand

37:58.540 --> 38:03.380
what this roadmap looks like is to now bring in FAB Labs

38:03.380 --> 38:04.780
and how they relate to all of this.

38:04.780 --> 38:05.940
What are FAB Labs?

38:05.940 --> 38:08.820
So here's a sequence.

38:08.820 --> 38:12.340
With colleagues, I accidentally started a network

38:12.340 --> 38:16.500
of what's now 2,500 digital fabrication community labs

38:16.500 --> 38:19.540
called FAB Labs right now in 125 countries,

38:19.540 --> 38:21.340
and they double every year and a half.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.300
That's called Lassa's Law after Sherry Lasseter,

38:24.300 --> 38:25.260
who I'll explain.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.580
So here's the sequence.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.140
We started Center for Bits and Atoms

38:31.140 --> 38:33.420
to do the kind of research we're talking about.

38:33.420 --> 38:36.940
We had all of these machines, and then had a problem,

38:36.940 --> 38:38.940
it would take a lifetime of classes

38:38.940 --> 38:41.540
to learn to use all the machines.

38:41.540 --> 38:45.620
So with colleagues who helped start CBA,

38:45.620 --> 38:47.420
we began a class modestly called

38:47.420 --> 38:48.940
how to make almost anything.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.380
And there's no big agenda, it was just,

38:51.380 --> 38:54.060
it was aimed at a few research students to use the machines,

38:54.060 --> 38:56.060
and it was completely unprepared

38:56.060 --> 38:57.860
for the first time we taught it.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.780
We were swamped by, every year since,

39:00.780 --> 39:02.740
hundreds of students try to take the class.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.620
It's one of the most oversubscribed classes at MIT.

39:06.660 --> 39:07.940
Students would say things like,

39:07.940 --> 39:09.380
can you teach this at MIT?

39:09.380 --> 39:10.580
It seems too useful.

39:10.580 --> 39:13.180
It's just how to work these machines.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.780
And the students in the class,

39:15.780 --> 39:18.980
I would teach them all the skills to use all these tools,

39:18.980 --> 39:21.060
and then they would do projects integrating them,

39:21.060 --> 39:21.900
and they're amazing.

39:21.900 --> 39:25.580
So Kelly was a sculptor, no engineering background.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.380
Her project was she made a device

39:27.380 --> 39:28.940
that saves up screams when you're mad

39:28.940 --> 39:30.740
and plays them back later.

39:30.740 --> 39:33.420
And saves up screams when you're mad

39:33.420 --> 39:34.460
and plays them back later.

39:34.460 --> 39:37.620
You scream into this device and it deadens the sound,

39:37.620 --> 39:39.380
records it, and then when it's convenient,

39:39.380 --> 39:41.060
releases your scream.

39:41.060 --> 39:45.260
Can we just pause on the brilliance of that invention?

39:45.260 --> 39:49.380
Creation, the art, I don't know, the brilliance.

39:49.380 --> 39:50.380
Who is this that created this?

39:50.380 --> 39:51.220
Kelly Dobson.

39:52.060 --> 39:54.220
Gone on to do a number of interesting things.

39:54.220 --> 39:57.180
Mijin, who's gone on to do a number of interesting things,

39:57.180 --> 39:59.900
made a dress instrumented with sensors and spines.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.300
And when somebody creepy comes close,

40:01.300 --> 40:02.860
it would defend your personal space.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.340
It's also very easy.

40:04.340 --> 40:07.980
Another project early on was a web browser for parrots,

40:07.980 --> 40:10.020
which have the cognitive ability of a young child,

40:10.020 --> 40:12.260
and lets parrots surf the internet.

40:12.260 --> 40:14.380
You know, another was an alarm clock,

40:14.380 --> 40:17.340
an alarm clock you wrestle with and prove you're awake.

40:17.340 --> 40:20.340
And what connects all of these is,

40:20.380 --> 40:23.460
so MIT made the first real-time computer, the whirlwind.

40:23.460 --> 40:26.420
That was transistorized as the TX.

40:26.420 --> 40:30.580
The TX was spun off from MIT as the PDP.

40:30.580 --> 40:35.580
PDPs were the mini computers that created the internet.

40:36.540 --> 40:40.740
So outside MIT was DEC, Prime, Wang, Data, General,

40:40.740 --> 40:42.900
the whole mini computer industry.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.820
The whole computing industry was there,

40:44.820 --> 40:48.820
and it all failed when computing became personal.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.420
Ken Olson, the head of digital,

40:50.420 --> 40:52.980
famously said, you don't need a computer at home.

40:52.980 --> 40:54.220
There's a little background to that,

40:54.220 --> 40:58.780
but DEC completely missed computing became personal.

40:58.780 --> 41:01.780
So I mentioned all of that because I was asking

41:01.780 --> 41:04.780
how to do digital fabrication, but not really why.

41:04.780 --> 41:08.460
The students in this how to make class were showing me

41:08.460 --> 41:11.060
that the killer app of digital fabrication

41:11.060 --> 41:12.420
is personal fabrication.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.700
Yeah, how do you jump to the personal fabrication?

41:14.700 --> 41:16.940
So Kelly didn't make the screen body

41:16.940 --> 41:18.220
because it was for a thesis.

41:18.260 --> 41:20.300
She wasn't writing a research paper.

41:20.300 --> 41:23.180
It wasn't a business model.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.500
She wanted, it was because she wanted one.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.740
It was personal expression going back

41:27.740 --> 41:29.620
to me in vocational school.

41:29.620 --> 41:33.060
It was personal expression in these new means of expression.

41:33.060 --> 41:34.940
So that's happened every year since.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.260
It literally is called,

41:36.260 --> 41:37.660
the course is literally called

41:37.660 --> 41:40.740
how to make almost anything.

41:40.740 --> 41:44.540
A legendary course at MIT every year.

41:44.540 --> 41:48.620
And it's grown to multiple labs at MIT

41:48.620 --> 41:51.220
with as many people involved in teaching as taking it.

41:51.220 --> 41:53.660
There's even a Harvard lab for the MIT class.

41:53.660 --> 41:58.660
What have you learned about humans colliding

41:58.740 --> 42:00.980
with the fab lab, about what the capacity

42:00.980 --> 42:02.580
of humans to be creative and to build?

42:02.580 --> 42:04.020
I mentioned Marvin.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.580
Another mentor at MIT, sadly no longer living

42:06.580 --> 42:08.180
is Seymour Papper.

42:08.180 --> 42:11.140
So Papper studied with Piaget.

42:11.140 --> 42:14.660
He came to MIT to get access to the early computer.

42:14.660 --> 42:18.020
Piaget was a pioneer in how kids learn.

42:18.020 --> 42:22.780
Papper came to MIT to get access to the early computers

42:22.780 --> 42:25.300
with the goal of letting kids play with them.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.380
Piaget helps show kids are like scientists.

42:27.380 --> 42:29.300
They learn as scientists

42:29.300 --> 42:31.340
and it gets kind of throttled out of them.

42:31.340 --> 42:34.340
Seymour wanted to let kids have a broader landscape to play.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.220
Seymour's work led with Mitch Resnick

42:36.220 --> 42:39.420
to Lego, Logo, Mindstorms, all of that stuff.

42:39.420 --> 42:42.420
As fab lab spread and we started creating

42:42.420 --> 42:44.460
educational programs for kids in them,

42:44.460 --> 42:46.100
Seymour said something really interesting.

42:46.100 --> 42:46.980
He made a gesture.

42:46.980 --> 42:50.500
He said it was a thorn in his side

42:50.500 --> 42:53.060
that they invented what's called the turtle,

42:53.060 --> 42:55.660
a early robot kids could program

42:55.660 --> 42:57.940
to connect it to a mainframe computer.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.300
Seymour said the goal was not for the kids

43:01.300 --> 43:02.500
to program the robot,

43:02.500 --> 43:05.460
it was for the kids to create the robot.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.540
And so in that sense, the fab labs,

43:07.580 --> 43:09.420
which for me were just this accident,

43:09.420 --> 43:11.140
he described as sort of this fulfillment

43:11.140 --> 43:14.460
of the arc of kids learned by experimenting.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.900
It was to give them the tools to create,

43:16.900 --> 43:19.620
not just assemble things and program things,

43:19.620 --> 43:20.980
but actually create.

43:20.980 --> 43:23.180
So coming to your question,

43:23.180 --> 43:28.180
what I've learned is MIT,

43:28.780 --> 43:31.260
a few years back, somebody added up businesses

43:31.260 --> 43:32.820
from spun off from MIT

43:32.820 --> 43:34.500
and it's the world's 10th economy.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.580
It falls between India and Russia.

43:36.620 --> 43:39.820
And I view that in a way as a bad number

43:39.820 --> 43:41.740
because it's only a few thousand people

43:41.740 --> 43:44.820
and these aren't uniquely the 4,000 brightest people,

43:44.820 --> 43:47.380
it's just a productive environment for them.

43:47.380 --> 43:50.820
And what we found is in rural Indian villages

43:50.820 --> 43:55.220
in African shantytowns and Arctic hamlets,

43:55.220 --> 43:59.900
I find exactly precisely that profile.

43:59.900 --> 44:04.300
So Ling sighed at a few hours above Tromsø,

44:04.300 --> 44:05.940
way above the Arctic circles.

44:05.980 --> 44:07.420
So far in North, the satellite dishes,

44:07.420 --> 44:09.500
look at the ground, not the sky.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.340
Hans Christian in the lab was considered a problem

44:13.340 --> 44:14.500
in the local school

44:14.500 --> 44:16.220
because they couldn't teach him anything.

44:16.220 --> 44:17.500
I showed him a few projects.

44:17.500 --> 44:19.180
Next time I came back, he was designing

44:19.180 --> 44:21.060
and building little robot vehicles.

44:21.060 --> 44:26.060
And in South Africa, I mentioned Soshengovie,

44:27.140 --> 44:28.420
in this apartheid township,

44:28.420 --> 44:30.500
the local technical institute taught kids

44:30.500 --> 44:31.980
how to make bricks and fold sheets.

44:31.980 --> 44:33.820
So it was punitive.

44:33.820 --> 44:35.580
But Chepiso in the fab lab

44:35.580 --> 44:37.900
was actually doing all the work of my MIT classes.

44:37.900 --> 44:41.700
And so over and over, we found precisely

44:41.700 --> 44:46.700
the same kind of bright invent of creativity.

44:47.780 --> 44:51.860
And historically, the answer was,

44:51.860 --> 44:53.220
go, you're smart, go away.

44:53.220 --> 44:55.580
It's sort of like me in vocational school.

44:55.580 --> 44:57.300
But in this lab network,

44:57.300 --> 44:59.140
what we could then do is in effect,

44:59.140 --> 45:00.500
bring the world to them.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.460
Now let's look at the scaling of all of this.

45:02.460 --> 45:07.460
So there's one earth, 1,000 cities,

45:07.500 --> 45:11.140
a million towns, a billion people, a trillion things.

45:11.980 --> 45:14.220
There was one whirlwind computer,

45:14.220 --> 45:17.300
MIT made the first real-time computer.

45:17.300 --> 45:19.860
There were thousands of PDPs.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.820
There were millions of hobbyist computers

45:21.820 --> 45:23.660
that came from that,

45:23.660 --> 45:25.140
billions of personal computers,

45:25.140 --> 45:27.420
trillions of internet of things.

45:27.420 --> 45:30.180
So now if we look at this fab lab story,

45:30.220 --> 45:32.380
1952 was the NC mill.

45:33.620 --> 45:35.700
There are now thousands of fab labs.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.620
And the fab lab costs exactly the same

45:39.620 --> 45:42.500
constant complexity of the mini computer.

45:42.500 --> 45:46.020
So on the mini computer, it didn't fit in your pocket.

45:46.020 --> 45:47.700
It filled the room.

45:47.700 --> 45:51.620
But video games, email, word processing,

45:51.620 --> 45:53.460
really anything you do, the internet,

45:53.460 --> 45:56.740
anything you do with a computer today happened at that era

45:56.740 --> 45:59.300
because it got on the scale of a work group,

45:59.340 --> 46:01.460
not a corporation.

46:01.460 --> 46:05.140
In the same way, fab labs are like the mini computers

46:05.140 --> 46:06.540
inventing how does the world work

46:06.540 --> 46:08.380
if anybody can make anything.

46:08.380 --> 46:11.380
Then if you look at that scaling,

46:11.380 --> 46:16.080
fab labs today are transitioning from buying a machine

46:16.080 --> 46:18.060
to make machines, making machines.

46:18.060 --> 46:20.660
So we're transitioning to you can go to a fab lab,

46:20.660 --> 46:24.380
not to make a project, but to make a new machine.

46:24.380 --> 46:27.300
So we talked about the deep sense of self-replication.

46:27.300 --> 46:30.260
There's a very practical sense of fab lab machines

46:30.260 --> 46:32.500
making fab lab machines.

46:32.500 --> 46:37.500
And so that's the equivalent of the habeas computer era,

46:38.140 --> 46:41.460
what it's called the Altair historically.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.660
Then the work we spent a while talking about

46:43.660 --> 46:45.620
about assemblers and self-assemblers,

46:45.620 --> 46:48.620
that's the equivalent of smartphones

46:48.620 --> 46:49.700
and internet of things.

46:49.700 --> 46:53.940
That's when, so the assemblers are like the smartphone

46:53.940 --> 46:55.940
where a smartphone today has the capacity

46:55.940 --> 46:58.700
of what used to be a supercomputer in your pocket.

46:58.700 --> 47:02.380
And then the smart thermostat on your wall

47:02.380 --> 47:07.380
has the power of the original PDP computer,

47:07.500 --> 47:08.980
not metaphorically, but literally,

47:08.980 --> 47:12.020
and now there's trillions of those in the same sense

47:12.020 --> 47:14.820
that when we finally merge materials

47:14.820 --> 47:16.620
with the machines in the self-assembly,

47:16.620 --> 47:19.140
that's like the internet of things stage.

47:19.140 --> 47:21.260
But here's the important lesson.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.880
If you look at the computing analogy,

47:24.880 --> 47:28.000
computing expanded exponentially,

47:28.000 --> 47:32.160
but it really didn't fundamentally change.

47:32.160 --> 47:36.040
The core things happened in that transition

47:36.040 --> 47:37.300
in the mini computer era.

47:37.300 --> 47:40.200
So in the same sense, the research now,

47:40.200 --> 47:41.360
we spent a while talking about

47:41.360 --> 47:43.680
is how we get to the replicator.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.640
Today you can do all of that if you close your eyes

47:46.640 --> 47:49.140
and view the whole fab lab as a machine.

47:49.140 --> 47:51.080
In that room, you can make almost anything,

47:51.080 --> 47:52.800
but you need a lot of inputs.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.680
Bit by bit, the inputs will go down

47:55.680 --> 47:57.440
and the size of the room will go down

47:57.440 --> 47:59.880
as we go through each of these stages.

47:59.880 --> 48:04.720
So how difficult is it to create a self-replicating assembler,

48:04.720 --> 48:09.720
self-replicating machine that builds copies of itself

48:09.720 --> 48:11.680
or builds more complicated version of itself,

48:11.680 --> 48:14.360
which is kind of the dream towards which you're pushing

48:14.360 --> 48:16.880
in a generic arbitrary sense?

48:16.880 --> 48:20.360
I had a student Nadia Peek with Jonathan Ward,

48:20.400 --> 48:23.600
who for me started this idea of how do we use

48:23.600 --> 48:26.800
the tools in my lab to make the tools in the lab?

48:26.800 --> 48:29.520
In a very clear sense,

48:29.520 --> 48:31.840
they are making self-reproducing machines.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.560
So one of the really cool things that's happened

48:34.560 --> 48:38.040
is there's a whole network of machine builders

48:38.040 --> 48:38.920
around the world.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.800
So there's Danielle and now in Germany

48:41.800 --> 48:43.120
and Jens in Norway.

48:43.120 --> 48:48.120
And each of these people has learned the skills

48:48.800 --> 48:50.920
to go into a fab lab and make a machine.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.040
And so we've started creating a network of super fab,

48:54.040 --> 48:55.520
so the fab lab can make a machine,

48:55.520 --> 48:56.520
but it can't make a number

48:56.520 --> 48:58.680
of the precision parts of the machine.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.960
So in places like Bhutan or Kerala in the south of India,

49:01.960 --> 49:04.000
we've started creating super fab labs

49:04.000 --> 49:06.800
that have more advanced tools to make the parts

49:06.800 --> 49:09.280
of the machines so that the machines themselves

49:09.280 --> 49:11.240
become even cheaper.

49:11.240 --> 49:15.680
So that is self-reproducing machines,

49:15.720 --> 49:19.440
but you need to feed it things like bearings

49:19.440 --> 49:21.920
or microcontrollers, they can't make those parts.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.440
But other than that, they're making their own things.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.360
And I should note as a footnote,

49:26.360 --> 49:29.600
the stack I described of computers controlling machines

49:29.600 --> 49:32.600
to machine making machines to assemblers to self-assemblers,

49:32.600 --> 49:35.400
view that as fab1234.

49:35.400 --> 49:38.280
So we're transitioning from fab1 to fab2

49:38.280 --> 49:40.640
and the research in the lab is three and four.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.960
At this fab2 stage, a big component of this

49:43.960 --> 49:47.920
is sustainability in the material feedstocks.

49:47.920 --> 49:51.600
So Alicia, colleague in Chile is leading a great effort

49:51.600 --> 49:54.040
looking at how you take forest products

49:54.040 --> 49:55.720
and coffee grounds and seashells

49:55.720 --> 49:58.680
and a range of locally available materials

49:58.680 --> 50:02.520
and produce the high tech materials that go into the lab.

50:02.520 --> 50:05.840
So all of that is machine building today.

50:05.840 --> 50:10.840
Then back in the lab, what we can do today is

50:11.840 --> 50:14.040
we have robots that can build structures

50:14.040 --> 50:17.440
and can assemble more robots that build structures.

50:17.440 --> 50:20.280
We have finer resolution robots

50:20.280 --> 50:22.880
that can build micromechanical systems.

50:22.880 --> 50:26.840
So robots that can build robots that can walk and manipulate.

50:26.840 --> 50:31.920
And we're just now, we have a project at the layer below that

50:31.920 --> 50:33.720
where there's endless attention today

50:33.720 --> 50:37.200
to billion dollar chip fab investments.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.120
But a really interesting thing we pass through

50:40.320 --> 50:44.200
is today the smallest transistors you can buy

50:44.200 --> 50:47.400
as a single transistor, just commercially for electronics,

50:47.400 --> 50:49.760
is actually the size of an early transistor

50:49.760 --> 50:51.840
in an integrated circuit.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.600
So we're using these machines, making machines,

50:54.600 --> 50:57.360
making assemblers to place those parts

50:57.360 --> 50:59.360
to not use a billion dollar chip fab

50:59.360 --> 51:00.520
to make integrated circuits,

51:00.520 --> 51:03.160
but actually assemble little electronic components.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.880
So have a fine enough, precise enough actuators

51:06.920 --> 51:10.200
and manipulators that allow you to place these transistors.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.600
Right, that's a research project in my lab

51:13.600 --> 51:16.360
called DICE on Discrete Assembly of Integrated Electronics.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.920
And we're just at the point to really start

51:18.920 --> 51:20.480
to take seriously this notion

51:20.480 --> 51:24.400
of not having a chip fab make integrated electronics,

51:24.400 --> 51:26.840
but having not a 3D printer,

51:26.840 --> 51:30.120
but a thing that's a cross between a pick in place

51:30.120 --> 51:32.200
makes circuit boards in 2D.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.840
The 3D printer extrudes in 3D.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.040
We're making sort of a micromanipulator

51:37.040 --> 51:38.160
that acts like a printer,

51:38.160 --> 51:41.400
but it's placing to build electronics in 3D.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.440
But this micromanipulator is distributed,

51:43.440 --> 51:45.880
so there's a bunch of them, or is this one centralized thing?

51:45.880 --> 51:47.680
So that's why that's a great question.

51:47.680 --> 51:51.280
So I have a prize that's almost but not been claimed

51:51.280 --> 51:54.680
for the students whose thesis can walk out of the printer.

51:54.680 --> 51:55.640
Oh, nice.

51:55.640 --> 51:59.400
So you have to print the thesis with the means

51:59.400 --> 52:01.560
to exit the printer,

52:01.560 --> 52:05.840
and it has to contain its description of the thesis

52:05.840 --> 52:07.200
that says how to do that.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.760
It's a really good...

52:09.760 --> 52:12.680
I mean, it's a fun example of exactly

52:12.680 --> 52:13.520
the thing we're talking about.

52:13.520 --> 52:17.480
And I've had a few students almost get to that.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.920
And so in what I'm describing,

52:20.920 --> 52:23.400
there's this stack where we're getting closer,

52:23.400 --> 52:26.720
but it's still quite a few years to really go from us.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.840
So there's a layer below the transistors

52:28.840 --> 52:30.520
where we assemble the base materials

52:30.520 --> 52:32.200
that become the transistor.

52:32.200 --> 52:35.600
We're now just at the edge of assembling the transistors

52:35.600 --> 52:37.760
to make the circuits.

52:37.760 --> 52:41.640
We can assemble the micro parts to make the micro robots.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.640
We can assemble the bigger robots.

52:43.640 --> 52:44.600
And in the coming years,

52:44.600 --> 52:47.560
we'll be patching together all of those scales.

52:47.560 --> 52:52.560
So do you see a vision of just endless billions of robots

52:52.680 --> 52:54.920
at the different scales, self-assembling,

52:55.920 --> 52:58.880
self-replicating and building complicated structures?

52:58.880 --> 53:00.520
Yes.

53:00.520 --> 53:03.360
And the but to the yes, but is...

53:03.360 --> 53:04.960
Let me clarify two things.

53:04.960 --> 53:09.960
One is that immediately raises King Charles' fear

53:10.120 --> 53:15.040
of gray goo, of runaway mutant self-reproducing things.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.320
The reason why there are many things

53:17.320 --> 53:19.080
I can tell you to worry about,

53:19.080 --> 53:21.280
but that's not one of them,

53:21.280 --> 53:25.680
is if you want things to autonomously self-reproduce

53:25.680 --> 53:26.800
and take over the world,

53:26.800 --> 53:29.080
that means they need to compete with nature

53:29.080 --> 53:32.960
on using the resources of nature, of water and sunlight.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.640
And in light of everything I'm describing,

53:35.640 --> 53:37.960
biology knows everything I told you.

53:37.960 --> 53:39.560
Every single thing I explained,

53:39.560 --> 53:41.280
biology already knows how to do.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.480
What I'm describing isn't new for biology,

53:45.480 --> 53:47.920
it's new for non-biological systems.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.520
So in the digital era,

53:50.520 --> 53:53.800
the economic when ended up being centralized,

53:53.800 --> 53:55.680
the big platforms.

53:55.680 --> 53:58.320
In this world of machines that can make machines,

53:58.320 --> 53:59.960
I'm asked for example,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.560
what's the killer opportunity?

54:03.560 --> 54:05.640
Who's gonna make all the money?

54:05.640 --> 54:07.120
Who to invest in?

54:07.120 --> 54:09.000
But if the machine can make the machine,

54:09.000 --> 54:12.200
it's not a great business to invest in the machine.

54:13.540 --> 54:17.880
In the same way that if you can think globally,

54:17.880 --> 54:19.760
but produce locally,

54:19.760 --> 54:23.360
then the way the technology goes out into society

54:23.360 --> 54:26.160
isn't a function of central control,

54:26.160 --> 54:27.940
but is fundamentally distributed.

54:27.940 --> 54:31.680
Now, that raises an obvious kind of concern,

54:31.680 --> 54:32.800
which is well, doesn't this mean

54:32.800 --> 54:35.760
you could make bombs and guns and all of that?

54:35.760 --> 54:39.600
The reason that's much less of a problem than you would think

54:39.600 --> 54:42.920
is making bombs and guns and all of that

54:42.920 --> 54:45.280
is a very well-met market need.

54:45.280 --> 54:49.720
Anywhere we go, there's a fine supply chain for weapons.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.840
Now, hobbyists have been making guns for ages

54:51.840 --> 54:54.360
and guns are available just about anywhere.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.360
So you could go into the lab and make a gun.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.440
Today, it's not a very good gun

54:58.440 --> 55:00.160
and guns are easily available.

55:00.160 --> 55:03.240
And so generally, we've run these lab and war zones.

55:03.240 --> 55:08.080
What we find is people don't go to them to make weapons,

55:08.080 --> 55:09.480
which you can already do anyway.

55:09.480 --> 55:11.600
It's an alternative to making weapons.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.800
Coming back to your question,

55:12.800 --> 55:15.880
I'd say the single most important thing I've learned is

55:17.000 --> 55:19.040
the greatest natural resource of the planet

55:19.040 --> 55:23.120
is this amazing density of bright invent of people

55:23.120 --> 55:24.640
whose brains are underused.

55:24.640 --> 55:29.640
And you could view the social engineering of this lab work

55:30.360 --> 55:32.440
is creating the capacity for them.

55:32.440 --> 55:37.120
And so in the end, the way this is gonna impact society

55:37.120 --> 55:38.920
isn't gonna be command and control.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.000
It's how the world uses it.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.560
And it's been really gratifying for me

55:43.560 --> 55:45.800
to see just how it does.

55:45.800 --> 55:48.160
Yeah, but what are the different ways

55:48.160 --> 55:50.920
the evolution of the exponential scaling

55:50.920 --> 55:52.760
of digital fabrication can evolve?

55:52.760 --> 55:56.760
So you said, yeah, self replicating nanobots, right?

55:56.760 --> 55:59.720
This is the gray goo fear.

55:59.720 --> 56:01.800
It's a caricature of a fear,

56:01.800 --> 56:03.720
but nevertheless, there's interesting,

56:03.720 --> 56:06.600
just like you said, spam and all these kinds of things

56:06.600 --> 56:10.080
that came with the scaling of communication and computation.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.920
What are the different ways

56:11.920 --> 56:15.120
that malevolent actors will use this technology?

56:15.120 --> 56:17.680
Yeah, well, first, let me start with a benevolent story,

56:17.720 --> 56:22.720
which is trash is an analog concept.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.800
There's no trash in a forest.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.520
All the parts get disassembled and reused.

56:28.520 --> 56:31.560
Trash means something doesn't have enough information

56:31.560 --> 56:33.960
to tell you how to reuse it.

56:33.960 --> 56:38.400
It's as simple as there's no trash in a Lego room.

56:38.400 --> 56:39.760
When you assemble Lego,

56:39.760 --> 56:42.880
the Lego bricks have enough information to disassemble them.

56:42.880 --> 56:47.320
So as you go through this fab one, two, three, four story,

56:47.320 --> 56:51.200
one of the implications of this transition

56:51.200 --> 56:53.720
to from printing to assembling.

56:53.720 --> 56:56.280
So the real breakthrough technologically

56:56.280 --> 56:58.280
isn't additive versus subtractive,

56:58.280 --> 57:02.400
which is a subject of a lot of attention and hype.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.040
3D printers are useful.

57:05.280 --> 57:07.960
We spun off companies like form labs

57:07.960 --> 57:09.840
led by Max for 3D printing.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.400
But in a fab lab, it's one of maybe 10 machines.

57:12.400 --> 57:15.140
It's used, but it's only part of the machines.

57:15.140 --> 57:18.060
The real technological change is when we go from printing

57:18.060 --> 57:22.220
and cutting to assembling and disassembling.

57:22.220 --> 57:26.580
But that reduces inventories of hundreds of thousands

57:26.580 --> 57:28.260
of parts to just having a few parts

57:28.260 --> 57:29.860
to make almost anything.

57:29.860 --> 57:31.880
It reduces global supply chains

57:31.880 --> 57:34.180
to locally sourcing these building blocks.

57:34.180 --> 57:36.980
But one of the key implications is it gets rid

57:36.980 --> 57:40.820
of technological trash because you can disassemble

57:40.820 --> 57:43.260
and reuse the parts, not throw them away.

57:43.260 --> 57:45.900
And so initially that's of interest for things

57:45.900 --> 57:48.720
at the end of long supply chains, like satellites on orbit.

57:48.720 --> 57:51.700
But one of the things coming is eliminating technical trash

57:51.700 --> 57:54.420
through reuse of the building blocks.

57:54.420 --> 57:56.840
So like when you think about 3D printers,

57:56.840 --> 57:59.960
you're thinking about addition and subtraction

57:59.960 --> 58:03.660
when you think about the other options available to you

58:03.660 --> 58:05.820
in that parameter space as you call it,

58:05.820 --> 58:09.540
that's going to be assembly, this assembly cutting you said.

58:09.540 --> 58:14.540
So the 1952 NC mill was subtractive, you remove material.

58:15.700 --> 58:20.140
And 3D printing additive, and there's a couple of claims

58:20.140 --> 58:21.820
to the invention of 3D printing,

58:21.820 --> 58:23.660
that's closer to what's called net shape,

58:23.660 --> 58:25.500
which is you don't have to cut away the material

58:25.500 --> 58:27.700
you don't need, you just put material where you do need it.

58:27.700 --> 58:30.140
And so that's the 3D printing revolution.

58:30.140 --> 58:34.620
But there are all sorts of limitations on 3D printing

58:34.620 --> 58:38.220
to the kinds of materials you can print,

58:38.220 --> 58:40.420
of kind of functionality you can print.

58:40.420 --> 58:43.620
We're just not going to get to making a,

58:44.940 --> 58:47.860
everything in a cell phone on a single printer,

58:47.860 --> 58:50.160
but I do expect to make everything in a cell phone

58:50.160 --> 58:51.180
with an assembler.

58:51.180 --> 58:54.380
And so instead of printing and cutting technologically,

58:54.380 --> 58:57.780
it's this transition to assembling and disassembling,

58:57.780 --> 59:00.300
going back to Shannon and Van Neumann,

59:00.300 --> 59:03.500
going back to the ribosome four billion years ago.

59:03.500 --> 59:06.420
Now you come to malevolent.

59:06.420 --> 59:09.020
Let me tell you a story about,

59:09.020 --> 59:14.020
I was doing a briefing for the National Academy

59:14.220 --> 59:19.060
of Sciences group that advises the intelligence communities.

59:19.060 --> 59:21.740
And I talked about the kind of research we do.

59:21.740 --> 59:24.940
And at the very end, I showed a little video clip

59:24.940 --> 59:29.660
of Valentina and Ghana making a local girl

59:29.660 --> 59:33.460
making surface mount electronics in the fab lab.

59:33.460 --> 59:36.380
And I showed that to this room full of people.

59:36.380 --> 59:39.140
One of the members of the intelligence community

59:39.140 --> 59:41.180
got up livid and said,

59:41.180 --> 59:44.660
how dare you waste our time showing us a young girl

59:44.660 --> 59:47.540
in an African village making surface mount electronics.

59:47.540 --> 59:51.060
We're looking at, we need to know about disruptive threats

59:51.060 --> 59:52.820
to the future of the United States.

59:53.820 --> 59:56.700
And somebody else got up in the room and yelled at him,

59:56.700 --> 59:59.500
and you idiot, I can't think of anything more important

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.860
than this, but for two reasons.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.420
One reason was because if we rely

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.620
on like informational superiority in the battlefield,

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.020
it means other people could get access to it.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.060
But this intelligence person's point, bless him,

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:20.060
wasn't that it was getting at the root causes of conflict

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.300
is if this young girl in an African village

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.140
could actually master surface mount electronics,

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.140
it changes some of the most fundamental things

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.980
about recruitment for terrorism,

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.020
impact of economic migration,

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.940
basic assumptions about an economy.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.700
It's just existential for the future of the planet.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.780
But we've just lived through a pandemic.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.460
I would love to linger on this

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.460
because the possibilities that are positive are endless,

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.100
but the possibilities are negative

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.420
are still nevertheless extremely important.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.540
Well, it's both positive and negative.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:01.540
What do you do with a large number of general assemblers?

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.140
Yeah, with the fab lab,

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.940
you could roughly make a bio lab,

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.540
then learn biotechnology.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.660
Now, that's terrifying because making self-reproducing

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.300
gray goo that outcompetes biology,

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.540
I consider doom because biology knows everything

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.940
I'm describing and is really good at what it does.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.860
In how to grow almost anything,

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.980
you learn skills in biotechnology

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.860
that let you make serious biological threats.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.580
And when you combine some of the innovations

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.180
you see with large language models,

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.740
some of the innovations you see with AlphaFold,

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.940
so applications of AI for designing biological systems

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.020
for writing programs,

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.300
which you can have a large language models increasingly.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.100
So there seems to be an interesting dance here

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.100
of automating the design stage of complex systems using AI.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.500
And then that's the bits.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.260
And you can leap now, the innovations you're talking about,

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.580
you can leap from the complex systems in the digital space

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.620
to the printing, to the creation, to the assembly

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:18.220
at scale of complex systems in the physical space.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.540
Yeah, so something to be scared about

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.380
is a fab lab can make a biolab,

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.540
a biolab can make biotechnology,

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.980
somebody could learn to make a virus.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.060
That's scary.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.860
That's unlike some of the things I said,

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.780
I don't worry about that's something

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.100
I really worry about that is scary.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.980
Now, how do you deal with that?

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:45.580
Prior threats we dealt with command and control.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.980
So like early color copiers had unique codes

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.620
and you could tell which copier made them.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.420
Eventually you couldn't keep up with that.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.500
There was a famous meeting at Asilomar

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.580
in the early days of recombinant DNA,

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.500
where that community recognized the dangers

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.780
of what it was doing and put in place a regime

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.260
to help manage it.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.580
And so that led to the kind of research management.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:18.100
MIT has an office that supervises research

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.860
and it works with the national office.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.500
That works if you can identify who's doing it and where.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.420
It doesn't work in this world we're describing.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.900
So anybody could do this anywhere.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:33.900
And so what we found is you can't contain this,

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.060
it's already out, you can't forbid

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.260
because there isn't command and control.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.540
The most useful thing you can do

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.340
is provide incentives for transparency.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.380
So, but really the heart of what we do is

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.500
you could do this by yourself in a basement

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.900
for nefarious reasons,

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.140
or you could come into a place in the light

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.900
where you get help and you get community

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.580
and you get resources.

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.540
And there's an incentive to do it in the open,

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.500
not in the dark.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.300
And that might sound naive,

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.220
but in the sort of places we're working,

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.260
so again, bad people do bad things in these places already,

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:20.780
but providing openness and providing transparency

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.460
is a key part of managing these.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.860
And so it transitions from regulating risks

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:30.060
as regulation to soft power to manage them.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.020
So there's so much potential for good,

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.340
so much capacity for good that Fab Labs

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:40.420
and the ability and the tools of creation

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.820
really unlock that potential.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.140
Yeah, and I don't say that as sort of dewy-eyed naive,

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.100
I say that empirically from just years

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.740
of seeing how this plays out in communities.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.340
I wonder if it's the early days of personal computers though,

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.420
before we get spam, right?

01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.700
In the end, most fundamentally,

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:05.340
literally the mother of all problems

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.820
is who designed us.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.900
So assume success

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.860
in that we're gonna transition to the machines,

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.060
making the machines,

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.300
and all of these new sort of social systems we're describing

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.660
will help manage them and curate them and democratize them.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.580
If we close the gap I just let off with

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:33.580
of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18 between Chip Fab and you,

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.820
we're ultimately in marrying communication,

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.340
computation, and fabrication

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.260
gonna be able to create unimaginable complexity.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.260
And how do you design that?

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:53.260
And so I'd say the deepest of all questions

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.820
that I've been working on is,

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.540
goes back to the oldest part of our genome.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.540
So in our genome, what are called Hox genes,

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.700
and these are morphogenes,

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:15.620
and nowhere in your genome is the number five.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.580
It doesn't store the fact that you have five fingers.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.460
What it stores is what's called a developmental program.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.300
It's a series of steps,

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.820
and the steps have the character of like,

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.460
grow up a gradient or break symmetry.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.580
And at the end of that developmental program,

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.540
you have five fingers.

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:39.540
So you are stored not as a body plan,

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.540
but as a growth plan.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.540
And there's two reasons for that.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.660
One reason is just compression.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.980
Billions of genes can place trillions of cells,

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:57.460
but the much deeper one is evolution

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.420
doesn't randomly perturb.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.700
Almost anything you did randomly in the genome

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.980
would be fatal or inconsequential, but not interesting.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:11.080
But when you modify things in these developmental programs,

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.260
you go from like webs for swimming to fingers,

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:17.220
or you go from walking to wings for flying.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.740
It's a space in which search is interesting.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.740
So this is the heart of the success of AI.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.700
In part, it was the scaling we talked about a while ago.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.940
And in part, it was the representations

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:37.060
for which search is effective.

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.620
AI has found good representations.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.060
It hasn't found new ways to search,

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.540
but it's found good representations of search.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.300
You're saying that's what biology,

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.860
that's what evolution has done,

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.580
is creative representations, structures,

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:56.260
biological structures through which search is effective.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:00.340
And so the developmental programs in the genome

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.420
beautifully encapsulate the lessons of AI.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.700
And it's molecular intelligence.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.740
It's AI embodied in our genome.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:16.500
It's every bit as profound as the cognition in our brain,

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.660
but now this is sort of thinking in molecular thinking

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.460
in how you design.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:27.140
And so I'd say the most fundamental problem we're working on

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.740
is it's kind of tautological

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.420
that when you design a phone, you design the phone.

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.340
You represent the design of the phone.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.380
But that actually fails when you get

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.420
to the sort of complexity that we're talking about.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.500
And so there's this profound transition to come.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.300
Once I can have self-reproducing assemblers

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.580
placing 10 to the 18 parts,

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:54.420
you need to not sort of metaphorically, but create life

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.660
in that you need to learn how to evolve.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:01.820
But evolutionary design has a really misleading,

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.460
trivial meaning.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.500
It's not as simple as you randomly mutate things.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.100
It's this much more deep embodiment of AI

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.820
and morphogenesis.

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.340
Is there a way for us to continue the kind of evolutionary

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.020
design that led us to this place

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.820
from the early days of bacteria, single cell organism,

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:24.500
to ribosomes and the 20 amino acids?

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.900
You mean for human augmentation or?

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.060
For life augment.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.620
I mean, what would you call assemblers

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.620
that are self-replicating and placing parts?

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.460
What is that?

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:39.460
The dynamic complex things built with digital fabrication.

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:40.700
What is that?

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.540
That's life.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.180
Yeah, so ultimately, absolutely,

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.580
if you add up everything I'm talking about,

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.500
it's building up to creating life in non-living materials.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:56.100
And I don't view this as copying life.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.260
I view it as driving life.

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.780
I didn't start from how does biology work

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.660
and then I'm gonna copy it.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.980
I start from how to solve problems

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.700
and then it leads me to, in a sense, rediscover biology.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:13.060
So if we go back to Valentina in Ghana

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.100
making her circuit board,

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.140
she still needs a chip fab very far away

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.900
to make the processor on her circuit board.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.700
For her to make the processor locally

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.820
for all the reasons we described,

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.980
you actually need the deep things

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.380
we were just talking about.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.140
And so it really does lead you.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:37.140
So there's a wonderful series of books by Gingery.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.180
Book one is how to make a charcoal furnace

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.700
and at the end of book seven, you have a machine shop.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.820
So it's sort of how you do your own

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.340
personal industrial revolution.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:55.020
ISRU is what NASA calls in situ resource utilization.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.740
And that's how do you go to a planet

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.860
and create a civilization?

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.820
ISRU has essentially assumed Gingery.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.860
You go through the industrial revolution

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.540
and you create the inventory of 100,000 resistors.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.500
What we're finding is the way,

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.660
the minimum building blocks for a civilization

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.900
is roughly 20 parts.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.780
So what's interesting about the amino acids

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.380
is they're not interesting.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.780
They're hydrophobic or hydrophilic, basic or acidic.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.420
They have typical but not extremal properties

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.700
but they're good enough you can combine them to make you.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.020
So what this is leading towards is technology

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.980
doesn't need enormous global supply chains.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.180
It just needs about 20 properties you can compose

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:43.780
to create all technology as the minimum building blocks

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.940
for a technological civilization.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:49.460
So there's going to be 20 basic building blocks

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.940
based on which the self-replicating assemblers can work.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.220
Right, and I say that not philosophically,

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.420
just empirically, sort of that's where it's heading.

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.780
And I like thinking about

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.860
how you bootstrap a civilization on Mars, that problem.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.260
There's a fun video on bonus material for the movie

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.580
where we're with a neat group of people we talk about it

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.740
because it has really profound implications

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:15.300
back here on earth about how we live sustainably.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.740
What does that civilization on Mars looks like

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.940
that's using ISRU,

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.140
that's using these 20 building blocks and does self-assembly?

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.220
Yeah, go through primary secondary tertiary, quaternary.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.860
You extract properties like conducting, insulating,

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:39.060
semi-conducting, magnetic, dielectric, flexural.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.060
These are the kind of roughly 20 properties.

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:49.380
With those, those are enough for us to assemble logic

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.540
and they're enough for us to assemble actuation.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.700
With logic and actuation, we can make micro-robots.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.300
The micro-robots can build bigger robots.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.620
The bigger robots can then take the building block materials

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.460
and make the structural elements

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.500
that you then do to make construction

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.060
and then you boot up through the stages

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.380
of a technological civilization.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.540
By the way, where in the span of logic and actuation

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.380
did the sensing come in?

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.500
Oh, I skipped over that.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.500
But my favorite sensor is a step response.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.260
So if you just make a step

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.740
and measure the response to the electric field,

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:37.220
that ranges from user interfaces

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.020
to positioning to material properties.

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.300
And if you do it at higher frequencies, you get chemistry.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.380
And you can get all of that just from a step

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.860
in an electric field.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:51.860
So for example, once you have time resolution in logic,

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.620
something as simple as two electrodes

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:58.220
let you do amazingly capable sensing.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.660
So we've been talking about all the work I do.

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.380
There's a story about how it happens.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.500
Where do ideas come from?

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.540
That's an interesting story.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.580
Where do ideas come from?

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:12.180
So I had mentioned Vannevar Bush

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.980
and he wrote a really influential thing

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.540
called the Endless Frontier.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.260
So science won World War II.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.380
The more known story is Nuclear Bombs.

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.940
The less well-known story is the Rad Lab.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.700
So at MIT, an amazing group of people invented radar

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.300
which is really credited as winning the war.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:39.500
So after the war, a grand old man from MIT

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.500
and it was charged with science won the war,

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.300
how do we maintain that edge?

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.620
And the report he wrote led to

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.540
the National Science Foundation

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.420
and the modern notion we take for granted

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.140
but didn't really exist before then

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.640
of public funding of research or research agencies.

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:06.100
In it, he made again what I consider

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:11.100
an important mistake, which is he described basic research

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:15.100
leads to applied research, leads to applications,

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.580
leads to commercialization, leads to impact.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:22.820
And so we need to invest in that pipeline.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.980
The reason I considered a mistake

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.920
is almost all of the examples we've been talking about

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.320
in my lab went backwards,

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.580
that the basic research came from applications.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.660
And further, almost all of the examples

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:44.980
we've been talking about came fundamentally

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.300
from mistakes.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:51.300
So essentially everything I've ever worked on has failed

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.140
but in failing, something better happened.

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:00.180
So the way I like to describe it is ready, aim, fire

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.620
is you do your homework, you aim carefully

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.980
at a target you want to accomplish.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.140
And if everything goes right,

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.300
you then hit the target and succeed.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:15.140
What I do, you can think of as ready, fire, aim.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.220
So you do a lot of work to get ready,

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.960
then you close your eyes

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.700
and you don't really think about where you're aiming

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.900
but you look very carefully at where you did aim,

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.060
where you aim after you fire.

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:31.940
And the reason that's so important is

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.980
if you do ready, aim, fire,

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.540
there's the best you can hope is hit what you aim at.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.580
So let me give you some examples.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.580
Because this is a source of great...

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.500
You're full of good lines today.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.220
...source of great frustration.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:51.300
So I mentioned the early quantum computing.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.740
So quantum computing is this power of using quantum mechanics

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.860
to make computers that for some problems

01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:01.020
are dramatically more powerful than classical computers.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.780
Before it started,

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.260
there was a really interesting group of people

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.540
who knew a lot about physics and computing

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:12.620
that were inventing what became quantum computing

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.180
before it was clear anything,

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.620
there was an opportunity there.

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.380
It was just studying how those relate.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.020
Here's how it fits to the ready, fire, aim,

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.280
in that I was doing really short-term work in my lab

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.980
on shoplifting tags.

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:30.980
This was really before there was modern RFID.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.460
And so how you put tags in objects to sense them,

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.540
something we just take for granted commercially.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.660
And there was a problem of how you can sense

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.540
multiple objects at the same time.

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:47.980
And so I was studying how you can remotely sense materials

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.300
to make low-cost tags

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.740
that could let you distinguish multiple objects simultaneously.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.980
To do that, you need non-linearity

01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:58.260
so that the signal is modulated.

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.980
And so I was looking for material sources of non-linearity

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.980
and that led me to look at how nuclear spins interact,

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:13.060
just for spin resonance,

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:17.380
the sort of things you use when you go in an MRI machine.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.460
And so I was studying how to use that.

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.980
And it turns out that it was a bad idea.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.980
You couldn't remotely use it for shoplifting tags.

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:31.260
But I realized you could compute.

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:36.260
And so with a group of colleagues thinking

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.060
about early quantum computing,

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.980
like David D. Vincenzo and Charlie Bennett

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.220
was articulating what are the properties you need to compute?

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.500
And then looking at how to make the tags,

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.300
it turns out the tags were a terrible idea

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:53.300
for sensing objects in a supermarket checkout.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.500
But I realized they were computing.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.580
So with Ike Chuang and a few other people,

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.220
we realized we could program nuclear spins to compute.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.700
And so that's what we used to do Grover's search algorithm

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.980
and then it was used for a Shores factoring algorithm.

01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.260
And it worked out,

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:12.940
the systems we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:15.860
don't scale beyond a few qubits,

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.180
but the techniques have lived on.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:22.020
And so all the current quantum computing techniques

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:26.460
grew out of the ways we would talk to these spins,

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.340
but I'm telling this whole story

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:32.260
because it came from a bad way to make a shoplifting tag.

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.020
Starting with an application,

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:37.900
mistakes led to break through fundamental science.

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.420
I mean, can you just link on that?

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.620
I mean, just using nuclear spins to do computation

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:48.620
that like what gave you the guts to try

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.100
to think through this from a digital fabrication perspective

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.020
actually, how to leap from one to the other.

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:55.900
I wouldn't call it guts.

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.140
I would call it collaboration.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:02.140
So at IBM, there was this amazing group of like,

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.060
I mentioned Charlie Bennett and David DiVincenzo

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.260
and Ralph Landau and Nabil Amir.

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:10.740
And these were all gods of thinking

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.060
about physics and computing.

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:18.060
So I yelled at the whole computer industry

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:22.900
being based on a fiction, metropolis.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.340
Programmers frolicking in the garden

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.420
while somebody moves levers in the basement.

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:28.820
There's a complete parallel history

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:33.820
of Maxwell de Boltzmann does a lard

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.140
to Landau or to Bennett.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.300
Most people won't know most of these names,

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.060
but this whole parallel history thinking deeply

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.420
about how computation and physics relate.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.780
So I was collaborating with that whole group of people.

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:53.460
And then at MIT, I was in this high traffic environment.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.380
I wasn't deeply inspired to think about better ways

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:00.180
to detect shoplifting tags, but stumbled across companies

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.740
that needed help with that and was thinking about it.

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:05.260
And then I realized those two worlds intersected

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.740
and we could use the failed approach

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:12.740
for the shoplifting tags to make early quantum computing

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.700
algorithms.

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.300
And this kind of stumbling is fundamental

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.140
to the fab lab idea, right?

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:18.980
Right.

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.040
Here's one more example.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.060
With a student, Manu, we talked about ribosomes

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.940
and I was trying to build a ribosome

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.820
that worked on fluids so that I could place

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.900
the little parts we're talking about.

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:35.540
And it kept failing because bubbles would come

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.380
into our system and the bubbles would make

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.020
the whole thing stop working.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.740
And we spent about half a year trying to get rid

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.340
of the bubbles.

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:44.220
Then Manu said, wait a minute,

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.340
the bubbles are actually better than what we're doing.

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.780
We should just use the bubbles.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:52.460
And so we invented how to do universal object

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.740
logic with little bubbles and fluid.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.700
Okay, you have to explain this microfluidic bubble logic.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.060
Please, how does this work?

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.900
So, yeah, it's super interesting.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.580
Yeah, and so I'll come back and explain it.

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:10.660
But what it led to was we showed fluids could do,

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.940
it'd been known fluid could do logic.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.540
Like your old automobile transmissions do logic,

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:18.660
but that's macroscopic.

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.980
It didn't work at little scales.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:20.980
We showed with these bubbles,

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.860
we could do it at little scales.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.580
Then I'm gonna come back and explain it.

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.380
But what came out of that is Manu then showed

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.060
you could make a 50 cent microscope using little bubbles.

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.820
And then the techniques we developed

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.500
are what we used to transplant genomes

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.940
to make synthetic life all came out of the failure

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.740
of trying to make the genome, the ribosome.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.620
Now, so the way the bubble logic works is

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:52.620
in a little channel, fluid at small scales

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.780
is fairly viscous.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:00.180
It's sort of like pushing Jell-O, think of it as.

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.820
If a bubble gets stuck, the fluid has to detour around it.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:12.980
So now imagine a channel that has two wells and one bubble.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.660
If the bubble is in one well,

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.340
the fluid has to go in the other channel.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.620
If the fluid is in the other well,

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.780
it has to go in the first channel.

01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:26.780
So the position of the bubble can switch,

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.820
it's a switch, it can switch the fluid between two channels.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.020
So now we have one element, a switch.

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.260
And it's also a memory because you can detect

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.740
whether or not a bubble is stored there.

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:41.100
Then if two bubbles meet,

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.860
if you have two channels crossing,

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:46.780
a bubble can go through one way

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.700
or a bubble can go through the other way.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.380
But if two bubbles come together,

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.700
then they push on each other and one goes one way

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.100
and one goes the other way.

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:58.180
That's a logic operation, that's a logic gate.

01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.940
So we now have a switch, we have a memory

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.980
and we have a logic gate,

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.180
and that's everything you need to make

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.940
a universal computer.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.300
I mean, the fact that you did that with bubbles

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:10.220
and microfluid just kind of,

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.180
kind of brilliant.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.860
Well, so to stay with that example,

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:20.100
what we proposed to do was to make a fluid ribosome

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:23.300
and the project crashed and burned, it was a disaster.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.220
This is what came out of it.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:30.700
And so it was precisely ready fire aim

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.820
in that we had to do a lot of homework

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.020
to be able to make these microfluidic systems.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.980
The fire part was we didn't think too hard

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.060
about making the ribosome,

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.500
we just tried to do it.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.860
The aim part was we realized the ribosome failed

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.540
but something better had happened.

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.740
And if you look all across research funding,

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:53.460
research management, it doesn't anticipate this.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:56.340
So fail fast is familiar,

01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:01.100
but fail fast tends to miss ready and aim.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.220
You can't just fail.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:05.260
You have to do your homework before the fail part

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.060
and you have to do the aim part after the fail part.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.980
And so the whole language of research

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.180
is about like milestones and deliverables.

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.980
That works when you're going down a straight line

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.580
but it doesn't work for this kind of discovery.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.220
And to leap to something you said that's really important

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.940
is I view part of what the fab lab network is doing

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:28.940
is giving more people the opportunity to fail.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:34.020
You've said that geometry is really important in biology.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:39.900
What does fabrication biology look like?

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.820
Why is geometry important?

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:46.420
So molecular biology is dominated by geometry.

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.420
That's why the protein folding is so important

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:53.220
that the geometry gives the function.

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:56.980
And there's this hierarchical construction

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.220
of as you go through primary, secondary, tertiary,

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.300
the shapes of the molecules

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.900
make the shape of the molecular machines.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.980
And they really are exquisite machines.

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:12.980
If you look at how your muscles move,

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.540
if you were to see a simulation of it,

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:19.940
it would look like a improbable science fiction cyborg world

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.300
of these little walking robots

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.060
that walk on a discrete lattice

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.220
that they're really exquisite machines.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:29.460
And then from there, this whole hierarchical stack

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:32.220
of once you get to the top of that,

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.020
you then start making organelles that make cells

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.420
that make organs through the stack of that hierarchy.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.540
Just stepping back, does it amaze you

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.380
that from small building blocks

01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:49.300
where amino acids you mentioned, molecules,

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:51.420
let's go to the very beginning of hydrogen and helium

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.060
at the start of this universe,

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:57.580
that we're able to build up such complex

01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:00.740
and beautiful things like our human brain.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:04.780
So studying thermodynamics,

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:10.660
which is exactly the question of batteries run out

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:17.420
and need recharging, equipment, cars get old and fail,

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.980
cars get old and fail, yet life doesn't.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:26.420
And that's why there's a sense

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.860
in which life seems to violate thermodynamics,

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:30.140
although of course it doesn't.

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.340
It seems to resist the March towards entropy somehow.

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:36.500
Right, and so Maxwell,

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:40.900
who helped give rise to the science of thermodynamics,

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:45.620
posited a problem that was so infuriating,

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:48.100
it led to a series of suicides.

01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:52.460
There was a series of advisors and advisees,

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:56.700
three in a row that all ended up committing suicide

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.140
that happened to work on this problem.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:04.140
And Maxwell's demon is this simple but infamous problem

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.620
where right now in this room we're surrounded by molecules

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.620
and they run at different velocities.

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:18.540
Imagine a container that has a wall

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.660
and it's got gas on both sides and a little door.

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:26.060
And if the door is a molecular sized creature

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.340
and it could watch the molecules coming

01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:31.380
and when a fast molecule is coming, it opens the door.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.940
When a slow molecule is coming, it closes the door.

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:38.180
After it does that for a while, one side is hot,

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.220
one is cold.

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.700
When something is hot and it's cold, you can make an engine.

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.980
And so you close that, you make an engine and you make energy.

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:51.660
So the demon is violating thermodynamics

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:55.140
because it's never touching the molecule.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.660
Yet by just opening and closing the door,

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:03.660
it can make arbitrary amounts of energy and power a machine.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.380
And in thermodynamics, you can't do that.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.740
So that's Maxwell's demon.

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:13.020
That problem is connected to everything we just spoke about

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.300
for the last few hours.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:25.300
So Leo Zalard around early 1900s was a deep physicist

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:33.300
who then had a lot to do with also post-war anti-nuclear things.

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:38.780
But he reduced Maxwell's demon to a single molecule.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:41.740
So the molecule, there's only one molecule

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.940
and the question is which side of the partition is it on.

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.980
That led to the idea of one bit of information.

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:53.580
So Shannon credited Zalard's analysis of Maxwell's demon

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.380
for the invention of the bit.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.940
For many years, people tried to explain Maxwell's demon

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:05.780
by like the energy in the demon looking at the molecule

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:08.500
or the energy to open and close the door

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.060
and nothing ever made sense.

01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.540
Finally, Rolf Landauer, one of the colleagues

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.380
I mentioned at IBM, finally solved the problem.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.940
He showed that you can explain Maxwell's demon

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.140
by you need the mind of the demon.

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.940
When the demon open and closes the door,

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:35.340
as long as it remembers what it did,

01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:38.740
you can run the whole thing backwards.

01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:45.140
But when the demon forgets, then you can't run it backwards

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:49.140
and that's where you get dissipation

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.940
and that's where you get the violation of thermodynamics.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:54.540
And so the explanation of Maxwell's demon

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.740
is that it's in the demon's brain.

01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:02.300
So then Rolf's colleague, Charlie at IBM,

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:07.380
then shock Rolf by showing you can compute

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.100
with arbitrarily low energy.

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:13.260
So one of the things that's not well covered

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:18.260
is the big computers used for big machine learning,

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.100
the data centers use tens of megawatts of power,

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.820
they use as much power as a city.

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:27.780
Charlie showed you can actually compute

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.860
with arbitrarily low amounts of energy

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.140
by making computers that can go backwards

01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.540
as well as forwards.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.180
And what limits the speed of the computer

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:42.380
is how fast you want an answer

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:45.100
and how certain you want the answer to be.

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.500
But we're orders of magnitude away from that.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:50.380
So I have a student Cameron working with Lincoln Labs

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.180
on making superconducting computers

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:56.860
that operate near this land hour limit

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.900
that are orders of magnitude more efficient.

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.900
So stepping back to all of that,

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:05.700
that whole tour was driven by your question about life.

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:10.060
And right at the heart of it is Maxwell's demon.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:14.380
Life exists because it can locally violate thermodynamics.

01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:16.500
It can locally violate thermodynamics

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:21.500
because of intelligence and it's molecular intelligence

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:25.740
that I would even go out on a limb to say,

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.180
we can already see we're beginning to come

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:32.260
to the end of this current AI phase.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:34.020
So depending on how you count,

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.940
this is I'd say the fifth AI boom bus cycle.

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.180
And you can already, it's exploding,

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.860
but you can already see where it's heading,

01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:46.900
how it's going to saturate what happens on the far side.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.940
The big thing that's not yet on horizons

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:55.940
is embodied AI, molecular intelligence.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.980
So to step back to this AI story,

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:05.100
there was automation and that was gonna change everything.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:07.100
Then there were expert systems.

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:13.980
There was then the first phase of the neural network systems.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:16.580
There've been about five of these

01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:19.340
in each case on the slope up,

01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:21.020
it's gonna change everything.

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.800
Each case what happens is on the slope down,

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.340
we sort of move the goal posts

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:29.940
and it becomes sort of irrelevant.

01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.260
So a good example is going up,

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.340
computer chess was gonna change everything.

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.620
Once computers could play chess,

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:38.540
that fundamentally changes the world.

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.540
Now on the downside, computers play chess.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:44.460
Winning at chess is no longer seen as a unique human thing,

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.180
but people still play chess.

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:51.260
This new phase is gonna take a new chunk of things

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.020
that we thought computers couldn't do.

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.500
Now computers will be able to do,

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.420
they have roughly our brain capacity,

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:01.180
but we'll keep thinking as well as computers.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.740
And as I described,

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:06.060
while we've been going through these five boom busts,

01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.500
if you just look at the numbers of ops per second,

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.660
bits storage, bits of IO,

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:11.940
that's the more interesting one.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.940
That's been steady,

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.980
and that's what finally caught up to people.

01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.940
But as we've talked about a couple of times,

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:20.740
there's eight orders of magnitude to go,

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:24.180
not in the intelligence in the transistors or in the brain,

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:25.860
but in the embodied intelligence,

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.500
in the intelligence in our body.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.540
So the intelligent constructions of physical systems

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.700
that would embody the intelligence

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.860
versus contain it within the computation.

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:38.220
Right, and there's a brain centrism

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:42.900
that assumes our intelligence is centered in our brain.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:45.260
And in endless ways in this conversation,

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.500
we've been talking about molecular intelligence.

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.700
Our molecular systems do a deep kind

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.100
of artificial intelligence.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.700
All the things you think of as artificial intelligence does

01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:01.780
in representing knowledge, storing knowledge,

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.620
searching over knowledge, adapting to knowledge,

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.860
our molecular systems do,

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:11.100
but the output isn't just a thought, it's us.

01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.060
It's the evolution of us.

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:17.820
And the real horizon to come is now embodying AI,

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:20.820
of not just a processor and a robot,

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:25.820
but building systems that really can grow and evolve.

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.660
So we've been speaking about this boundary

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.860
between bits and atoms.

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.820
So let me ask you about one of the big mysteries

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:35.980
of consciousness.

01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.900
Do you think it comes from somewhere between that boundary?

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.820
I won't name names,

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:47.340
but if you know who I'm talking about, it's probably clear.

01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:52.340
I once did a drive, in fact, up to the Mussolini era villa

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:55.860
outside Torino in the early days

01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:00.860
of what became quantum computing with a famous person

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.500
who thinks about quantum mechanics and consciousness.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.780
And we had the most infuriating conversation

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:12.780
that went roughly along the lines of consciousness is weird,

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:17.340
quantum mechanics is weird,

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.580
therefore quantum mechanics explains consciousness.

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.380
That was roughly the logical process.

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.180
And you're not satisfied with that process?

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.620
No, and I say that very precisely in the following sense.

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:32.900
I was a program manager somewhat by accident

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:37.940
in a DARPA program on quantum biology.

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:43.620
And so biology trivially uses quantum mechanics

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.860
and that were made out of atoms,

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:49.420
but the distinction is in quantum computing,

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:53.220
quantum information, you need quantum coherence.

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:57.900
And there's a lot of muddled thinking about like collapse

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.620
of the wave function and claims of quantum computing

01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:04.700
that garbles just quantum coherence.

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:09.180
That you can think of it as a wave

01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.620
that has very special properties,

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.820
but these wave-like properties.

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.700
And so there's a small set of places

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:21.140
where biology uses quantum mechanics in that deeper sense.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:26.140
One is how light is converted to energy in photo systems.

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.300
It looks like one is all faction,

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.860
how your nose is able to tell different smells.

01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.260
Probably one has to do with how birds navigate,

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.140
how they sense magnetic fields.

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.660
That involves a coupling between a very weak energy

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.100
with a magnetic field, coupling into chemical reactions.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.780
And there's a beautiful system.

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:56.180
Standard in chemistry is magnetic fields

01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.220
like this can influence chemistry,

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.060
but there are biological circuits

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.260
that are carefully balanced with two pathways

01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:04.620
that become unbalanced with magnetic fields.

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:08.020
So each of these areas are expensive for biology.

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.740
It has to consume resources

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.540
to use quantum mechanics in this way.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.620
So those are places where we know

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.700
there's quantum mechanics in biology.

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:20.300
In cognition, there's just no evidence.

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:27.460
There's no evidence of anything quantum mechanical going on

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.540
in how cognition works.

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.740
Consciousness.

01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.700
Well, I'm saying cognition, I'm not saying consciousness,

01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:37.220
but to get from cognition to consciousness.

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:41.780
So McCullough and Pitts made a model of neurons.

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:47.780
That led to perceptrons that then through a couple

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:51.180
of boom busts led to deep learning.

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.980
One of the interesting things about that sequence is

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:57.500
it diverged off so deep neural networks

01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.180
used in machine learning,

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.260
diverged from trying to understand how the brain works.

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:09.100
What makes them work, what's emerged is,

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.780
it's a really interesting story.

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:13.140
This may be too much of a technical detail,

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.300
but it has to do with function approximation.

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:18.660
That we talked about exponentials.

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:23.660
A deep network needs an exponentially larger

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:27.220
shallow network to do the same function.

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.860
And that exponential is what gives the power

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:31.500
to deep networks.

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.820
But what's interesting is the sort of lessons

01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:37.460
about building these deep architectures

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:41.340
and how to train them have really interesting echoes

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.340
to how brains work.

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:45.340
And there's an interesting conversation

01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:48.220
that's sort of coming back of neuroscientists

01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:50.380
looking over the shoulder of people training

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:52.780
these deep networks, seeing interesting echoes

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:56.700
for how the brain works, interesting parallels with it.

01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:01.580
And so I didn't say consciousness, I just said cognition,

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:05.220
but I don't know any experimental evidence

01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:07.580
that points to anything in neurobiology

01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:10.100
that says we need quantum mechanics.

01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:15.100
And I view the question about whether a large language model

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:20.380
is conscious as silly in that biology is full of hacks

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.500
and it works.

01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:34.140
There's no evidence we have that there's anything deeper

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:37.100
going on than just this sort of stacking up

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:38.420
of hacks in the brain.

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.860
And somehow consciousness is one of the hacks

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.740
or an emergent property of the hacks.

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:43.580
Absolutely.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.980
And just numerically, I said big computations now

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.540
have the degrees of freedom of the brain.

01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:53.300
And they're showing a lot of the phenomenology

01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.140
of what we think is properties of what a brain can do.

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.420
And I don't see any reason to invoke anything else.

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.940
That makes you wonder what kind of beautiful stuff

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.900
digital fabrication will create.

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:09.500
If biology created a few hacks on top of which

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.500
consciousness and cognition, some of the things

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.460
we love about human beings was created.

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.980
It makes you wonder what kind of beauty in the complexity

01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.940
can create digital fabrication.

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.700
There's an early peek at that,

01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:26.740
which is there's a misleading term,

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:29.220
which is generative design.

01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:32.820
Generative design is where you don't tell a computer

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820
how to design something.

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.420
You tell the computer what you want it to do.

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.020
That doesn't work.

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.940
That only works in limited subdomains.

01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:44.060
You can't do really complex functionality that way.

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.100
The one place it's matured, though,

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.580
is topology optimization for structure.

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.260
So let's say you wanted to make a bicycle or a table.

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.860
You describe the loads on it

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.860
and it figures out how to design it.

01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.620
And what it makes are beautiful, organic-looking things.

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.500
These are things that look like they grew in a forest.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.100
And they look like they grew in a forest

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:08.940
because that's sort of exactly what they are,

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:12.900
that they're solving the ways of how you handle loads

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:14.260
in the same way biology does.

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:16.500
And so you get things that look like trees

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.820
and shells and all of that.

01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:19.980
And so that's a peek at this transition

01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.980
from we design to we teach the machines how to design.

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:28.060
What can you say about,

01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.540
because you mentioned cellular automata earlier,

01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.540
about from this example you just gave,

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:34.380
and in general the observation you can make

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.820
by looking at cellular automata,

01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:40.380
that from simple rules and simple building blocks

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:43.540
can emerge arbitrary complexity.

01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:48.540
Do you understand what that is, how that can be leveraged?

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:53.740
So understand what it is is much easier than it sounds.

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.980
I complained about Turing's machine

01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.340
making a physics mistake,

01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:01.660
but Turing never intended it to be a computer architecture.

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:06.340
He used it just to prove results about uncomputability.

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:10.900
What Turing did on what his computation is exquisite

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:12.700
is gorgeous.

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:16.420
He gave us our notion of computational universality

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:19.740
and something that sounds deep

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:24.740
and turns out to be trivial is it's really easy

01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:29.300
to show almost everything is computationally universal.

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:33.340
So Norm Margolis wrote a beautiful paper

01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:39.180
with Tom Toffoli showing in a cellular automata world

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.660
is like the game of life

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:43.940
where you just move tokens around.

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:48.660
They showed that modeling billiard balls

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:52.420
on a billiard table with cellular automata

01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:53.900
is a universal computer.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.620
To be universal, you need a persistent state.

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:03.020
You need a non-linear operation to interact them

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.380
and you need connectivity.

01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:11.420
So that's what you need to show computational universality.

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:15.660
So they showed that a CA modeling billiard balls

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.620
is a universal computer.

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.780
Chris Moore went on to show that instead of chaos,

01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:27.140
Turing showed their problems in computation

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:30.340
that you can't solve, that they're harder

01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:31.340
than you can't predict.

01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:34.700
They're actually in a deep reason that they are unsolvable.

01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:39.300
Chris Moore showed it's very easy to make physical systems

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.380
that are uncomputable, that what the physics system does,

01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.500
just bouncing balls and surfaces,

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.900
you can make systems that solve uncomputable problems.

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.580
And so almost any non-trivial physical system

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.740
is computationally universal.

01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.700
So the first part of the answer to your question is,

01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:00.660
this comes back to my comment about

01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:02.980
how do you bootstrap a civilization?

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.780
You just don't need much to be computationally universal.

01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:10.780
So then there isn't today a notion

01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:14.100
of like fabricational universality

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.340
or fabricational complexity.

01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:18.500
The sort of numbers I've been giving you

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.900
about you eating lunch versus the chip fab,

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:26.580
sort of that, that's in the same spirit of what Shannon did.

01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:31.580
But once you connect computational universality

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:35.340
to kind of fabricational universality,

01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:39.340
you then get the ability to grow and adapt and evolve.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.620
Because that evolution happens in the physical space.

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:45.780
Yeah, and so that's why, for me,

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.820
the heart of this whole conversation is morphogenesis.

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:51.980
So just to come back to that,

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:58.860
what Turing ended his sadly cut short life studying

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:05.700
was how genes give rise to form.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.380
So how the small amount of it,

01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.660
relatively it affects small amount of information

01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.020
in the genome can give rise to the complexity

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.660
of who you are.

01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:21.660
That's where what resides is this molecular intelligence,

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:24.980
which is first how to describe you,

01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:29.380
but then how to describe you such that you can exist

01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:33.580
and you can reproduce and you can grow and you can evolve.

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:38.580
And so that's the seat of our molecular intelligence.

01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:41.100
The maker of revolution in biology.

01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:45.140
Yeah, it really is, it really is.

01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:48.700
And that's where you can't separate

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.940
communication, computation and fabrication.

01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:53.740
You can't separate computer science and physical science.

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.980
You can't separate hardware and software.

01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.340
They all intersect right at that place.

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:02.660
Do you think of our universe as just one giant computation?

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:08.860
I would even kind of say quantum computing is overhyped

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.340
in that there's a few things quantum computing

01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.380
is gonna be good at.

01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.140
One is breaking crypto systems,

01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.100
how to make new crypto systems.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:19.020
What it's really good at is modeling other quantum systems.

01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:23.300
So for studying nanotechnology, it's gonna be powerful,

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:27.220
but quantum computing is not going to disrupt

01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:29.060
and change everything.

01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:33.140
But the reason I say that is this interesting group

01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:36.620
of strange people who helped invent quantum computing

01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:39.400
before it was clear anything was there.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.220
One of the main reasons they did it wasn't

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:46.460
to make a computer that can break a crypto system.

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:48.900
It was you could turn this backwards.

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.340
You could be surprised quantum mechanics can compute

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:55.300
or you can go in the opposite direction

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:58.580
and say if quantum mechanics can compute,

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:01.900
that's a description of nature.

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:05.660
So physics is written in terms

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:08.340
of partial differential equations.

01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:11.860
That is an information technology

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.260
from two centuries ago.

01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:21.260
The equations of physics are not,

01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.740
this would sound very strange to say,

01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:24.140
but the equations of physics,

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:26.180
Schrodinger's equations and Maxwell's equations

01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:28.820
and all of them are not fundamental.

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.020
They're a representation of physics

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.220
that was accessible to us

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:35.740
in the era of having a pencil and a piece of paper.

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.540
They have a fundamental problem

01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:45.580
which is if you make a dot on a piece of paper

01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:48.540
in traditional physics theory,

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:51.860
there's infinite information in that dot.

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:55.360
A point has infinite information.

01:48:56.700 --> 01:49:00.740
That can't be true because information

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:05.740
is a fundamental resource that's connected to energy.

01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:09.980
And in fact, one of my favorite questions

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:14.140
you can ask a cosmologist to trip them up is ask,

01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:17.780
is information a conserved quantity in the universe?

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:20.300
Was all the information created in the Big Bang

01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.980
or can the universe create information?

01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:26.620
And I've yet to meet a cosmologist who doesn't stutter

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:31.620
and not clearly know how to handle that existential question,

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:35.220
but sort of putting that to a side,

01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:38.060
in physics theory, the way it's taught,

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:43.260
information comes late.

01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:46.420
You're taught about X, a variable,

01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:48.220
which can contain infinite information,

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.380
but physically that's unrealistic.

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.940
And so physics theories have to find ways to cut that off.

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:57.860
So instead, there are a number of people

01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:03.220
who start with a theory of the universe

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.660
should start with information and computation

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.580
as the fundamental resources that explain nature.

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.740
And then you build up from that

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:15.820
to something that looks like throwing baseballs down a slope.

01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:20.820
And so in that sense, the work on physics and computation

01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:24.660
has many applications that we've been talking about,

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:29.060
but more deeply, it's really getting at new ways

01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.220
to think about how the universe works.

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:32.780
And there are a number of things

01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:34.860
that are hard to do in traditional physics

01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.580
that make more sense when you start with information

01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:41.260
and computation as the root of physical theory.

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.620
So information and computation

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:46.060
being the real fundamental thing in the universe.

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:49.020
Right, that information is a resource.

01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:52.900
You can have infinite information in finite space.

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.340
Information propagates and interacts,

01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.780
and from there you erect the scaffolding of physics.

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:01.540
Now it happens, the words I just said

01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:04.340
look a lot like quantum field theories.

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.380
But there's an interesting way

01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:11.060
where instead of starting with differential equations

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:13.020
to get to quantum field theories

01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:16.260
and quantum field theories, you get to quantization.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.300
If you start from computation and information,

01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:24.740
you begin sort of quantized and you build up from there.

01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:29.300
And so that's the sense in which absolutely,

01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:31.260
I think about the universe as a computer.

01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:34.180
The easy way to understand that is

01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.940
just almost anything is computationally universal,

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.980
but the deep way is it's a real fundamental way

01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.980
to understand how the universe works.

01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.620
Let me go a little bit to the personal

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:50.500
and the center of bits and atoms.

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:56.620
You have worked with the students you've worked with

01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:00.460
have gone on to do some incredible things in this world,

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:04.500
including build supercomputers that power Facebook

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:05.620
and Twitter and so on.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:08.860
What advice would you give to young people?

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:11.220
What advice have you given them?

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:14.180
How to have one heck of a great career,

01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:15.740
one heck of a great life?

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:20.740
What one important one is if you look at junior faculty

01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:25.460
trying to get tenure at a place like MIT,

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:28.420
the ones who try to figure out how to get tenure

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.740
are miserable and don't get tenure.

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:33.420
And the ones who don't try to figure it out

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.700
are happy and do get it.

01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:39.180
You have to love what you're doing and believe in it

01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.980
and nothing else could possibly be

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.500
what you wanna be doing with your life

01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.580
and it gets you out of bed in the morning.

01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:48.740
And again, it sounds naive,

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:53.740
but within the limited domain I'm describing now

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:57.340
of getting tenure at MIT, that's a key attribute to it.

01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:02.140
And in the same sense, if you take the sort of outliers

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:05.900
students were talking about, 99 out of 100 come to me

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.540
and say your work is very fascinating,

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:11.180
I'd be interesting to work for you.

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:15.620
And one out of 100 come and say, you're wrong.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:20.020
Here's your mistake, here's what you should have been doing.

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:26.540
They just sort of say I'm here and get to work.

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:29.860
And again, I don't know how far this resource goes.

01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:33.780
So I've said, I consider the world's greatest resource,

01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.060
this engine, a bright invent of people

01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.220
of which we only see a tiny little iceberg of it.

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.100
And everywhere we open these labs,

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.340
they come out of the woodwork, they come.

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:45.940
We didn't create all these educational programs,

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:47.740
all these other things I'm describing.

01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:51.180
We tried to partner everywhere with local schools

01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:53.660
and local companies and kept tripping over dysfunction

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.260
and find we had to create the environment

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:56.820
where people like this can flourish.

01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:00.060
And so I don't know if this is everyone,

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:02.580
if it's 1% of society, what the fraction is,

01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:05.620
but it's so many orders of magnitude bigger

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:07.020
than we see it today.

01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:08.380
We've been racing to keep up with it

01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:10.340
to take advantage of that resource.

01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.220
Something tells me it's a very large fraction

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:13.260
of the population.

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:17.620
I mean, the thing that gives me most hope for the future

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.820
is that population.

01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:21.180
Once a year, this whole lab network meets.

01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:24.100
And it's my favorite gathering, it's in Bhutan this year,

01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:27.820
because it's every body shape, it's every language,

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.020
every geography, but it's the same person

01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.700
in all those packages.

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:36.700
It's the same sense of bright invent of joy and discovery.

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:38.340
If there's people listening to this

01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:41.700
and they're just overwhelmed with how exciting this is,

01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:44.300
which I think they would be, how can they participate,

01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:47.540
how can they help, how can they encourage young people

01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:50.940
or themselves to build stuff, to create stuff?

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:51.980
Yeah, that's a great question.

01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:56.980
So this is part of a much bigger maker movement

01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:00.580
that has a lot of embodiments.

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:03.380
The part I've been involved in, this fab lab network,

01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:06.180
you can think of as a curated part that works as a network.

01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:09.260
So you don't benefit in a gym

01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:11.780
if somebody exercises in another gym,

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:14.420
but in the fab network, you do, in a sense,

01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:16.780
benefit when somebody works in another network,

01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:19.540
another lab in the way it functions as a network.

01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:23.540
So you can come to cba.mit.edu

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:26.340
to see the research we're talking about.

01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:29.420
There's a fab foundation run by Sherry Lasseter

01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:31.460
at fabfoundation.org.

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:35.320
Fab Labs I.O. is a portal into this lab network.

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:40.020
Fabacademy.org is this distributed hands-on

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.980
educational program.

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:44.940
Fab.city is the platform of cities producing

01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:45.780
what they consume.

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:48.620
Those are all nodes in this network.

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.380
So you can learn with Fabacademy

01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:53.060
and you can perhaps launch or help launch

01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:54.700
or participate in launching a fab lab.

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:59.220
Well, in particular, from one to a thousand,

01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:00.740
we carefully counted labs.

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.100
Now we're going from a thousand to a million

01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.340
where it ceases to become interesting to count them.

01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:07.300
And in the thousand to the million,

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:12.900
what's interesting about that stage is technologically,

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:15.300
you go to a lab not to get access to the machine,

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.940
but you go to the lab to make the machine.

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:20.220
But the other thing interesting in it

01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:22.620
is we have an interesting collaboration

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.460
on a fab lab in a box.

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:30.740
And this came out of a collaboration with SolidWorks

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:34.980
on how you can put a fab lab in a box,

01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.820
which is not just the tools, but the knowledge.

01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:42.100
So you open the box and the box contains the knowledge

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:45.660
of how to use it as well as the tools within it

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.340
so that the knowledge can propagate.

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:48.860
And so we have an interesting group of people

01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:52.020
working on the original fab labs.

01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:54.020
We have a whole team to get involved

01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:56.300
in the setting up and training.

01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:58.740
And the Fabacademy is a real in-depth,

01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:01.100
deep technical program in the training.

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:05.020
But in this next phase, how sort of the lab itself

01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.220
knows how to do the lab.

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:13.060
We've talked deeply about the intelligence in fabrication,

01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:14.620
but in a much more accessible one

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:19.540
about how the AI in the lab in effect

01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:23.380
becomes a collaborator with you in this nearer term

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:24.500
to help get started.

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:28.380
And for people wanting to connect,

01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:31.140
it can seem like a big step, a big threshold,

01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:32.940
but we've gotten to thousands of these

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:35.300
and they're doubling exactly that way

01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.660
just from people opting in.

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:40.540
And in so doing, driving towards this kind of idea

01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:43.900
of personal digital fabrication.

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.580
And it's not utopia, it's not free,

01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:51.580
but come back to today, we separately have education,

01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:55.540
we have big business, we have startups,

01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:59.700
we have entertainment, each of these things are segregated.

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:01.940
When you have global connection

01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:04.140
to one of these local facilities,

01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:07.820
in that you can do play and art and education

01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.460
and create infrastructure.

01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:13.700
You can make many of the things you consume.

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.980
You could make it for yourself,

01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:16.740
it could be done on a community scale,

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:19.140
it could be done on a regional scale.

01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:24.260
It really, I'd say the research we spent

01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:27.740
the last few hours talking about, I thought was hard.

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:32.740
And in a sense, I mean, it's non-trivial

01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:35.300
but in a sense, it's just sort of playing out

01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.500
we're turning the crank.

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:39.100
What I didn't think was hard is

01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:42.900
if anybody can make almost anything anywhere,

01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:45.500
how do you live, how do you learn,

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.460
how do you work, how you play,

01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.980
these very basic assumptions about how society functions.

01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:54.820
There's a way in which it's kind of back to the future

01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:59.820
in that this mode where work is money is consumption

01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:03.660
and consumption is shopping by selecting

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:07.380
is only a kind of a few decade old stretch.

01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:13.020
In some ways, we're getting back to a Sami village

01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:17.300
in North Norway is deeply sustainable,

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:22.060
but rather than just reverting to living

01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:24.320
the way we did a few thousand years ago,

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:28.760
being connected globally, having the benefits

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:32.020
of modern society, but connecting it back

01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:34.500
to older notions of sustainability.

01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:40.020
I hadn't remotely anticipated just how fundamentally

01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:42.980
that challenges how a society functions.

01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:46.300
And how interesting and how hard it is to figure out

01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:47.900
how we can make that work.

01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:50.540
And it's possible that this kind of process

01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:54.940
will give a deeper sense of meaning to each person.

01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:58.180
Let me violently agree in two ways.

01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:03.180
One way is this community making

02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:09.460
crosses many sensitive sectarian boundaries

02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.900
in many parts of the world where there's just,

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:15.660
implicit or explicit conflict,

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:20.660
but sort of this act of making seems to transcend

02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:22.740
a lot of historical divisions.

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:24.460
I don't say that philosophically,

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:26.420
I just say that as an observation.

02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:30.020
And I think there's something really fundamental

02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:34.020
in what you said, which is deep in our brain

02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:35.980
is shaping our environment.

02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:41.900
A lot of what's strange about our society

02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:44.100
is the way that we can't do that.

02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:49.020
The act of shaping our environment

02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:51.260
touches something really, really deep

02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:53.980
that gets to the essence of who we are.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.820
That's again why I say that in a way,

02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:00.260
the most important thing made in these labs

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:01.500
is making itself.

02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:06.300
What do you think if the shaping of our environment

02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:07.260
gets to something deep?

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:09.660
What do you think is the meaning of it all?

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:11.260
What's the meaning of life, Neil?

02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:17.220
I can tell you my insights into how life works.

02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:19.620
I can tell you my insights

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:23.820
in how to make life meaningful and fulfilling

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:26.740
and sustainable.

02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:31.340
I have no idea what the meaning of life is,

02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:33.740
but maybe that's the meaning of life.

02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.860
Naha, the uncertainty, the confusion.

02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:38.860
Because there's a magic to it all.

02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:40.140
Everything you've talked about

02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:42.940
from starting from the basic elements

02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:45.420
with the big bang that somehow created the sun

02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:49.220
that somehow set a few to thermodynamics

02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:52.740
and created life in all the ways that you've talked about

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:54.860
from ribosomes that created the machinery

02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:55.980
that created the machine

02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:59.140
and then now the biological machine creating

02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.420
through digital fabrication,

02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:02.420
more complex artificial machines,

02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:05.860
all of that, there's a magic to that creative process.

02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:09.540
And we humans are smart enough to notice the magic.

02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:13.220
So you haven't said the S word yet.

02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:14.060
Which one is that?

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:14.900
Singularity.

02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:19.700
Yeah, I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is listening

02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:20.700
if he is high Ray,

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:23.220
but I have a complex relationship with Ray

02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:28.220
because a lot of the things he projects, I find annoying,

02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:31.740
but then he does his homework

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:33.820
and then somewhat annoyingly,

02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.980
he points out how almost everything I'm doing

02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.860
fits on his roadmaps.

02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:44.820
And so the question is,

02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:47.540
are we heading towards a singularity?

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:52.980
So I'd have to say I lean towards sigmoids

02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.700
rather than exponentials.

02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:59.020
But we've done pretty well with sigmoids.

02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:02.460
Yeah, so sigmoids are things grow and they taper

02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:04.820
and then there can be one after it and one after it.

02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:09.820
So I'll pass on whether there's enough of them

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:13.020
that they diverge,

02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:18.020
but the selfish gene answer to the meaning of life

02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:23.900
is the meaning of life is the propagation of life.

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.900
And so it was a step for atoms to assemble into a molecule,

02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:33.100
for atoms to assemble into a molecule,

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:38.580
for molecules to assemble into a proto cell,

02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:41.860
for the proto cell to form, to then form organelles,

02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:44.540
for the organ cells to form organs,

02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.660
the organs to form an organism.

02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:51.180
Then it was a step for organisms to form family units,

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.460
then family units to form villages.

02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:56.180
You can view each of those as a stack

02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.540
and the level of organization.

02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:02.100
So you could view everything we've spoken about

02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:06.500
as the imperative of life,

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:10.100
just the next step in the hierarchy of that

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.580
in the fulfillment of the inexorable drive

02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.380
of the violation of thermodynamics.

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:17.980
So you could view, I'm an embodiment of the will

02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:20.340
of the violation of thermodynamics speaking.

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.780
The two of us having an old chat, yes.

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:25.900
Yeah.

02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:29.020
And so it continues and even then the singularity

02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:31.500
is just a transition up the ladder.

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:34.540
There's nothing deeper to consciousness

02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:39.540
than it's a derived property of distributed problem solving.

02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:44.020
There's nothing deeper to life

02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:49.020
than embodied AI in morphogenesis.

02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:53.860
So why so much of this conversation in my life

02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:57.260
is involved in these fab labs.

02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:00.020
And initially it just started as outreach,

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:02.620
then it started as keeping up with it.

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:05.020
Then it turned to,

02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:09.380
it was rewarding.

02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:12.820
Then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs

02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:14.260
in as goes out to them.

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:16.700
It began as outreach, but now more knowledge

02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:19.420
is coming back from the labs that is going into them.

02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:24.420
And then finally it ends with what I described

02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:27.140
as competing with myself at MIT,

02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:30.220
but a better way to say that is tapping

02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:31.840
the brain power of the planet.

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:35.340
And so I guess for me personally,

02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:37.620
that's the meaning of my life.

02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:39.700
And maybe that's the meaning for the universe too.

02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:44.700
It's using us humans and our creations to understand itself

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:50.060
in the way it's whatever the creative process

02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:53.220
that created Earth is competing with itself.

02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:56.460
Yeah, so you could take morphogenesis

02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.180
as a summary of this whole conversation

02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:02.420
or you could take recursion that in a sense,

02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:05.580
what we've been talking about is recursion all the way down.

02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:08.920
And in the end, I think this whole thing is pretty fun.

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:12.420
It's short life is, but it's pretty fun.

02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:13.980
And so is this conversation.

02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:15.820
I mentioned to you offline that I'm going

02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:17.340
through some difficult stuff personally

02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:20.620
and your passion for what you do is just really inspiring.

02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:23.820
And it just lights up my mood and lights up my heart.

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:27.500
And you're an inspiration for I know thousands of people

02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:30.220
that work with you at MIT and millions people across the world.

02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:31.940
It's a big honor to use it with me today.

02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:32.780
This is really fun.

02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:33.780
This was a pleasure.

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.300
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:37.700
with Neil Gershenfeld.

And now let me leave you with some words

02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:45.820
from Pablo Picasso.

02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:48.260
Every child is an artist.

02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.420
The challenge is staying an artist when you grow up.

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:55.680
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
