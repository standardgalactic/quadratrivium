00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
The following is a conversation with Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Harvard.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.040
Her work involves improving our understanding of particle physics, supersymmetry,

00:11.040 --> 00:17.360
bariogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:17.360 --> 00:22.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

00:22.240 --> 00:28.320
here's Lisa Randall. One of the things you work on and write about is dark matter.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.320
We can't see it, but there's a lot of it in the universe. You also end one of your books with

00:34.320 --> 00:41.920
a Beatles song quote, got to be good looking because he's so hard to see. What is dark matter?

00:42.560 --> 00:46.800
How should we think about it, given that we can't see it? How should we visualize it in our mind

00:46.800 --> 00:51.680
and die? I think one of the really important things that physics teaches you is just our

00:51.680 --> 00:57.760
limitations, but also our abilities. So the fact that we can deduce the existence of something

00:57.760 --> 01:03.760
that we don't directly see is really a tribute to people that we can do that. But it's also

01:04.400 --> 01:11.440
something that tells you you can't overly rely on your direct senses. If you just relied on

01:11.440 --> 01:15.440
just what you see directly, you would miss so much of what's happening in the world.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.200
And we can generalize this, but we're just for now to focus on dark matter.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.320
It's something we know is there, and it's not just one way we know it's there. In my book,

01:24.320 --> 01:29.200
Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs, I talk about the many different ways, there's eight or nine,

01:29.200 --> 01:35.600
that we deduce not just the existence of dark matter, but how much is there? And they all agree.

01:36.320 --> 01:43.120
Now, how do we know it's there? Because of its gravitational force. And individually,

01:43.120 --> 01:47.840
a particle doesn't have such a big gravitational force. In fact, gravity is an extremely weak

01:47.840 --> 01:53.520
force compared to other forces we know about in nature. But there's a lot of dark matter out there.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.760
It carries a lot of energy, five times the amount of energy, as the matter we know that's

01:57.760 --> 02:04.720
in atoms, etc. So you can ask, how should we think about it? Well, it's just another form of matter

02:04.720 --> 02:10.080
that doesn't interact with light, or at least as far as we know. So it interacts gravitationally,

02:10.080 --> 02:16.400
it clumps, it forms galaxies, but it doesn't interact with light, which means we just don't

02:16.400 --> 02:21.520
see it. And most of our detection, before gravitational wave detectors, we only saw

02:21.520 --> 02:27.440
things because of their interactions with light in some sense. So in theory, it behaves just like

02:27.440 --> 02:32.560
any other matter, it just doesn't interact with light. So when we say it interacts just like

02:32.560 --> 02:37.120
any other form of matter, we have to be careful. Because gravitationally, it interacts like other

02:37.120 --> 02:43.280
forms of matter, but it doesn't experience electromagnetism, which is why it has a different

02:43.280 --> 02:49.360
distribution. So in our galaxy, it's roughly spherical, unless it has its own interactions,

02:49.440 --> 02:55.200
that's another story. But we know that it's roughly spherical. Whereas ordinary matter

02:55.840 --> 03:00.720
can radiate and clumps into a desk. And that's why we see the Milky Way desk.

03:01.520 --> 03:07.360
So on large scales in some sense, yes, all the matter is similar in some sense. In fact,

03:07.360 --> 03:14.400
dark matter is in some sense more important, because it can collapse more readily than ordinary

03:14.400 --> 03:20.720
matter, because ordinary matter has radiative forces, which makes it hard to collapse on small

03:20.720 --> 03:27.280
scales. So actually, it's dark matter that sort of drives galaxy formation. And then ordinary

03:27.280 --> 03:32.000
matter kind of comes along with that. And there's also just more of it. And because there's more

03:32.000 --> 03:38.240
of it, it can start collapsing sooner. That is to say the energy density in dark matter dominates

03:38.240 --> 03:42.960
over radiation earlier than you would if you just had ordinary matter.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.560
So it's part of the story of the origin of a galaxy, part of the story of the end of the

03:46.560 --> 03:50.000
galaxy, and part of the story of all the various interactions throughout.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.880
Exactly. I mean, in my book, I make kind of sort of jokes about, you know, it's like

03:54.880 --> 03:58.160
when we think about a building, we think about the architect, we think about, you know, the high

03:58.160 --> 04:02.400
level, but we forget about all the workers that did all the grunt work. And in fact,

04:02.400 --> 04:07.600
dark matter was really important in the formation of our universe. And we forget that sometimes.

04:07.600 --> 04:15.840
That's a metaphor on top of a metaphor. Okay. The unheard voices that do the actual work.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.400
Exactly. No, but it is a metaphor, but it also captures something because

04:20.400 --> 04:25.920
the fact is we don't directly see it. So we forget it's there, or we don't understand it's there,

04:25.920 --> 04:31.200
or we think it's not. The fact that we don't see it makes it no less legitimate. It just means that

04:31.200 --> 04:34.560
we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.960
Yeah, but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have

04:40.160 --> 04:42.480
gravitational interaction with the things we can't see is

04:44.080 --> 04:50.560
at the layman level is just mind blowing, you know?

04:50.560 --> 04:56.880
It is and it isn't because I think what it's teaching us is that we're human. The universe is

04:56.880 --> 05:01.680
what it is. And we're trying to interact with that universe and discover what it is. We've

05:01.760 --> 05:08.240
discovered amazing things. In fact, I would say it's more surprising that the matter that we know

05:08.240 --> 05:14.640
about constitutes as big a fraction of the universe as it does. I mean, we're limited, we're human.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.800
And the fact that we see 5% of the energy density of the universe,

05:19.760 --> 05:23.920
you know, about one-sixth of the energy density in matter, that's kind of remarkable. I mean,

05:23.920 --> 05:28.240
why should that be? There could be anything. Anything could be out there, yet the universe

05:28.240 --> 05:32.560
that we see is a significant fraction. Yeah, but a lot of our intuition, I think,

05:33.120 --> 05:38.320
operates using visualizations in the mind. That's absolutely true. And it's certainly

05:38.320 --> 05:42.640
writing books. I realized also how many of our words are based on how we see the world.

05:43.840 --> 05:49.200
And that's true. And that's actually one of the fantastic things about physics is that it teaches

05:49.200 --> 05:55.040
you how to go beyond your median intuition to develop intuitions that apply at different

05:55.120 --> 05:59.440
distances, different scales, different ways of thinking about things. Yeah, how do you anthropomorphize

05:59.440 --> 06:05.200
dark matter? I just did, I think. I made it the grant workers. Oh yeah, that's good.

06:06.800 --> 06:13.920
That's why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books. Okay, so you also write in that

06:13.920 --> 06:20.960
book about dark matter having to do something with the extinction events, the extinction of the

06:20.960 --> 06:28.320
dinosaurs, which is kind of a fascinating presentation of how everything is connected.

06:28.320 --> 06:35.120
So I guess the disturbances from the dark matter, they create gravitational disturbances in the

06:35.120 --> 06:40.880
ore cloud at the edge of our solar system. And then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting

06:40.880 --> 06:48.080
Earth. So I want to be really clear, this was a speculative theory. I love it though. I mean,

06:48.080 --> 06:55.600
and I liked it too. And we still don't know for sure, but we can, what we liked about it,

06:55.600 --> 07:01.280
so let me take a step back. So we usually assume that dark matter is what we, being physicists,

07:01.280 --> 07:07.520
that it's just one thing. It's just basically not interacting, aside from gravity,

07:07.520 --> 07:14.080
or very weakly interacting matter. But again, we have to get outside the mindset of just humans

07:14.080 --> 07:20.160
and ask what else could be there. And so what we suggested is that there's a fraction of dark

07:20.160 --> 07:24.720
matter, not all the dark matter, but some of the dark matter, maybe it has interactions of its own.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.560
Just the same way in our universe, we have lots of different types of matter. We have nuclei,

07:30.560 --> 07:37.840
we have electrons, we have forces. We have lots of, it's not a simple model, the standard model,

07:37.840 --> 07:42.800
but it does have some basic ingredients. So maybe dark matter also has some interesting

07:43.760 --> 07:48.560
structure to it. So maybe there's some small fraction. And the interesting thing is that

07:49.280 --> 07:54.880
if some of the dark matter does radiate, and I like to call it dark light, because it's

07:54.880 --> 08:00.160
light that we don't see, but dark matter would see, it could radiate that, and then it could

08:00.160 --> 08:06.000
perhaps collapse into a disc the same way ordinary matter collapsed into the Milky Way disc.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.760
So it's not all the dark matter, it's a fraction. But it could conceivably be a very thin disc of

08:11.760 --> 08:16.720
dark matter, thin dense disc of dark matter. And so then the question is, do they exist?

08:16.720 --> 08:21.680
And people have done studies now to think about whether they can find them. I mean,

08:21.680 --> 08:26.080
it's an interesting target. It's something you can measure by measuring the positions and velocities

08:26.080 --> 08:33.120
of stars. You can find out what the structure of the Milky Way is. But the fun proposal was that

08:33.680 --> 08:39.120
the solar system orbits around the galaxy. And as it does so, it goes a little bit up and down,

08:39.120 --> 08:43.040
kind of like horses on a carousel. And the suggestion was every time it goes through,

08:43.040 --> 08:48.480
you have an enhanced probability that you would dislodge something from the edge of the solar

08:48.480 --> 08:53.280
system in something called the Oort cloud. So the idea was that at those times, you're more

08:53.280 --> 08:59.440
likely to have these cataclysmic events, such as the amazing one that actually caused the last

08:59.440 --> 09:03.520
extinction that we know of for sure. It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.080
Or for two thirds of the species on the planet. Yeah, but as it gets amazing for humans,

09:08.640 --> 09:13.200
what really is amazing, I mean, I talk about this in Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs,

09:13.200 --> 09:18.640
it's just an amazing scientific story, because it really is one of the real stories that combine

09:18.640 --> 09:24.960
together different fields of science. Geologists at the time, people thought that things happen

09:24.960 --> 09:30.000
slowly and this would be a cataclysmic event. And also, I have to say, if you think about it,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
it sounds like a story like a five-year-old would make up. Maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some

09:34.000 --> 09:40.240
big rock that came and hit the earth, but then there really was a scientific story behind it.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.600
And that's also why I like the dark disk, because there's a scientific story behind it.

09:43.600 --> 09:48.000
So as far-fetched as it might sound, you could actually go and look for the experimental

09:48.000 --> 09:51.840
consequences or the observational consequences to test whether it's true.

09:51.840 --> 09:57.840
I wish you could know high-resolution details of where that asteroid came from,

09:58.640 --> 10:03.120
like where in the Oort cloud, why it happened, is it in fact because of Dark Matter? Just

10:03.200 --> 10:08.880
like the full tracing back to the origin of the universe? Because humans seem to be somewhat special,

10:08.880 --> 10:15.280
but it just seems like so many fascinating events at all scales of physics had to happen.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.320
So I'm really, really glad you mentioned that, because actually, that was one of the main points

10:20.320 --> 10:25.440
of my book, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs. One of the reasons I wrote it was because I really think

10:25.440 --> 10:29.760
we are abusing the planet. We're changing the planet way too quickly. And just like anything else,

10:29.840 --> 10:33.120
when you alter things, it's good to think about the history of what it took to get here.

10:34.320 --> 10:40.320
And as you point out, it took many operations on many different scales. We had to have the

10:40.320 --> 10:44.320
formation of structure, the formation of galaxies, the formation of the solar system,

10:44.320 --> 10:48.400
the formation of our planet, the formation of humans. I mean, there's so many steps that go

10:48.400 --> 10:54.160
into this. And humans, in some part, were the result of the fact that this big object hit the

10:54.160 --> 10:59.120
earth, made the dinosaurs go extinct, and mammals developed. I mean, it is an incredible story.

10:59.120 --> 11:04.800
And yes, something else might come of it, but it won't be us if we mess with it too much.

11:05.440 --> 11:10.560
But it is on a grand scale. Earth is a pretty resilient system.

11:13.040 --> 11:20.320
Can you just clarify? It's fascinating. The shape of things, so the shape of the Milky Way

11:20.320 --> 11:27.680
of the observable stuff is mostly flat. And you said Dark Matter tends to be spherical,

11:27.760 --> 11:33.120
but a subset of that might be a flat disk. So you wanted to hear about the shape of things?

11:34.160 --> 11:41.040
Yes, please. So structure formed early on, and now our structure that we live in is,

11:41.040 --> 11:46.960
so we know about the Milky Way Galaxy. So the Milky Way Galaxy has the disk you can see in a

11:46.960 --> 11:55.840
dry, dark place. That's where stars and light is. But you can also measure, in some ways,

11:55.920 --> 12:01.280
that dark matter. And we believe that dark matter is more or less spherically distributed.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.360
And like we said, there's a lot of it, not necessarily in the disk, but just because

12:07.360 --> 12:13.120
it's a sphere, there's a lot of it sitting there. And the reason it doesn't collapse,

12:13.120 --> 12:17.680
as far as we know, is that it doesn't really, it can't radiate the same way. So because it can

12:17.680 --> 12:22.160
radiate ordinary matter collapses, and it's actually because of conservation of angular momentum,

12:22.800 --> 12:28.880
it stays a disk and it doesn't just collapse to the center. So our suggestion was that maybe

12:28.880 --> 12:33.280
there are some components of dark matter that also radiate. Like I said, that's far from proven.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.920
People have looked for a disk. They see some evidence of some disks of certain densities. But

12:38.880 --> 12:42.880
these are all questions that are worth asking. Basically, if we can figure it out from existing

12:42.880 --> 12:48.160
measurements, why not try? Okay, so there's not all dark matters made the same? Well,

12:48.160 --> 12:52.560
that's a possibility. We actually don't know what dark matter is. In the first place,

12:52.560 --> 12:56.320
we don't know what most of it is. We don't know what a fraction is. I mean, it's hard to measure.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.920
Why is it hard to measure? For exactly the reason you said earlier, we don't see it.

13:00.480 --> 13:06.800
So we want to think of possibilities for what it can be, especially if those give rise to some

13:06.800 --> 13:12.400
observational consequences. I mean, it's a tough game because it's not something that's just

13:12.400 --> 13:16.080
there for the taking. You have to think about what it could be and how you might find it.

13:16.160 --> 13:21.840
And the way you detect it is gravitational effects on things we can see.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.440
That would be the way you detect the type of dark matter I've been talking about.

13:25.440 --> 13:30.320
People have suggestions for other forms of dark matter. They could be particles called axions.

13:30.320 --> 13:34.320
They could be other types of particles. And then there are different ways of detecting it. I mean,

13:34.320 --> 13:38.400
the most popular candidate for dark matter, probably until pretty recently because they

13:38.400 --> 13:42.560
haven't found it, is something called WIMPs, weekly interacting mass of particles.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.400
Particles that have mass about the same as the Higgs boson mass.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.200
And it turns out that you would get about the right density of dark matter.

13:51.200 --> 13:56.400
But then people really like that, of course, because it is connected to the standard model,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.760
the particles that we know about. And if it's connected to that,

13:59.760 --> 14:02.960
we have a better chance of actually seeing it. Fortunately or unfortunately,

14:02.960 --> 14:05.760
it's also a better chance that you can rule it out because you can look for it.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.240
And so far, no one has found it. We're still looking for it.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.680
Is that one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider?

14:11.760 --> 14:14.720
That was originally one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.200
I'd say at this point, it would be very unlikely given what they've already

14:19.760 --> 14:26.560
accomplished. But there are these underground detectors, xenon detectors that look for

14:26.560 --> 14:33.840
dark matter coming in. And they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound

14:33.840 --> 14:35.040
than it exists today.

14:35.040 --> 14:40.720
Just take that tangent. Looking back now, what's the biggest to you in sight?

14:42.560 --> 14:46.800
To humanity that the LHC has been able to provide?

14:47.600 --> 14:54.080
It's interesting. It's both a major victory. The Higgs boson was proposed 50 years ago,

14:54.080 --> 14:58.720
and it was discovered. The Higgs mechanism seemed to be the only way to explain elementary

14:58.720 --> 15:02.240
particle masses, and it was right. So on the one hand, it was a major victory.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.440
On the other hand, I've been in physics long enough to know it was also

15:06.400 --> 15:10.400
a cautionary tale in some sense, because at the time I started out in physics,

15:11.040 --> 15:14.640
we had some proposed something in the United States called the superconducting supercollider.

15:15.520 --> 15:20.160
A lot of physicists, I'll say particularly in Europe, but I'd say a lot of physicists

15:20.160 --> 15:24.560
were saying when that the Large Hadron Collider would have the energy reach necessary

15:25.200 --> 15:28.880
to discover what underlies the standard model. We don't want to just discover the standard model,

15:28.880 --> 15:34.080
we want to know what the next step is. And I think here, people were more cautious about that.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.920
They wanted to have a more comprehensive search that could get to higher energies,

15:38.560 --> 15:42.960
more events, so that we could really more definitively rule it out.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.720
But in that case, many people thought they knew what would be there. It happened to be

15:46.720 --> 15:50.400
a theory called supersymmetry. So a lot of physicists thought it would be supersymmetry.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.400
I mean, it's one of the many factors, I think, that went into the fact that

15:54.400 --> 15:59.920
the Large Hadron Collider became the only machine in town, and the superconducting supercollider

15:59.920 --> 16:03.440
would have just been a much, if it really had achieved what it was supposed to,

16:03.520 --> 16:08.560
would have been a much more robust test of the space. So I'd say for humanity,

16:08.560 --> 16:14.640
it's both a tribute to the ability to discover and the ability of really believing in things,

16:14.640 --> 16:18.240
so they have the confidence to go look for them. But it's also a cautionary tale that

16:18.880 --> 16:25.040
you don't want to assume things before they've been actually found. So you want to do things in,

16:26.080 --> 16:29.680
you want to believe in your theories, but you also want to question them at the same time

16:29.680 --> 16:31.840
in ways that you're more likely to discover the truth.

16:32.240 --> 16:37.280
But it's also an illustration of grand engineering efforts that humanity can take on,

16:38.160 --> 16:41.520
and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.120
I'm really glad you said that, though, too, because that's absolutely true. I mean,

16:47.680 --> 16:52.320
it really is an impressive, it's impressive in so many ways. It's impressive

16:52.320 --> 16:57.120
technologically, it's impressive at an engineering level. It's also impressive that so many countries

16:57.120 --> 17:03.760
work together to do this. It wasn't just one country, and how it was, it was also impressive

17:03.760 --> 17:11.360
in that it was a long-term project that people committed to and made it happen. So it is a

17:11.360 --> 17:16.640
demonstration that when people set their minds to things and they commit to it, that they can do

17:16.640 --> 17:22.560
something amazing. But also in the United States, maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things

17:22.560 --> 17:31.120
down. Bureaucracy and politics, and economics, many things can make them faster and make them

17:31.120 --> 17:37.600
slower. So science is the way to make progress. Politics is the way to slow that progress down.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.280
Well, I don't want to overstate that because without politics, you know, the LEC won't happen

17:43.280 --> 17:53.120
either. You need broccoli. But sometimes I do think, I mean, you're not asking this question,

17:53.120 --> 17:57.440
but sometimes I do think when I think about some of these conflicts,

17:59.440 --> 18:05.200
sometimes it's just good to have a project that people work on together. And there were some

18:05.200 --> 18:10.000
efforts to do that in science, too, to have Palestinians and Israelis work together,

18:10.640 --> 18:15.760
project called Sesame. I think it's not a bad idea when you can do that, when you can get,

18:16.400 --> 18:23.600
you know, sort of forget the politics and just focus on some particular project,

18:23.600 --> 18:27.840
sometimes that can work. Some kind of forcing function, some kind of deadline that gets people

18:27.840 --> 18:33.680
to sit in a room together. And you're working on a thing, but as part of that, you realize

18:33.680 --> 18:38.800
the common humanity, that you all have the same concerns, the same hopes, the same fears,

18:38.800 --> 18:43.840
the same that you are all human. And that's an accidental side effect of working together

18:43.840 --> 18:48.320
on a thing. That's absolutely true. And it's one of the reasons CERN was formed, actually.

18:48.320 --> 18:53.600
It was post World War II. And a lot of European physicists had actually left Europe. And they

18:53.600 --> 19:00.560
wanted to see Europeans work together and sort of rebuild. And it worked. I mean, they did.

19:00.560 --> 19:05.440
And it's true. And I often think that, you know, one of the major problems is we just

19:05.440 --> 19:09.520
don't meet enough people so that everyone thinks when they seem like the other,

19:09.520 --> 19:14.800
it's more easy to forget their humanity. So I think it is important to have these connections.

19:16.240 --> 19:22.160
Given the complexity, all cosmological scales involved here that led to the extension of

19:22.160 --> 19:28.640
the dinosaurs, when you look out at the future of Earth, do you worry about future extinction

19:28.640 --> 19:33.840
events? I do think that we might be in the middle of an extinction right now, if you

19:33.840 --> 19:39.200
define it by the number of species that are getting killed off. And it's subtle, but it's

19:39.200 --> 19:46.160
a complex system. The way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve. Sometimes

19:46.160 --> 19:52.080
animals just move to another place. And the way we've developed the Earth, it's very hard for

19:52.080 --> 19:58.080
species just to move somewhere else. And we're seeing that with people now too. I mean, I know

19:58.080 --> 20:02.720
people are worried just about AI taking over. And that's a totally different story. We just

20:02.720 --> 20:07.280
don't think about the future very much. We think about what we're doing now. And we certainly don't

20:07.280 --> 20:11.600
think enough about all the animals that we're destroying, all the things that are precursors

20:11.600 --> 20:19.360
to humans that we sort of rely on. It's interesting just to think whether the things that threaten us

20:20.480 --> 20:25.440
is the stuff we see that's happening gradually, or the stuff we don't really see that's going to

20:25.440 --> 20:32.000
happen all of a sudden. And sometimes I think about what should we be more worried about?

20:32.080 --> 20:37.600
Because it seems like with the asteroids or nuclear war, it could be stuff that just happens

20:37.600 --> 20:46.320
one day. When I say one day, meaning over a span of a few days or a few months, but not on a scale

20:46.320 --> 20:53.760
of decades and centuries. Because we sometimes mostly talk about stuff that's happening gradually,

20:54.560 --> 20:59.600
but we can be really surprised. It's actually really interesting. And that was actually one of

20:59.600 --> 21:05.120
the reasons it took a while to determine what it was that it caused the last extinction. Because

21:05.120 --> 21:09.920
people did think at the time, many people thought that things were more gradual. And the idea of

21:09.920 --> 21:16.320
extinction was actually a novel concept at some point. I mean, these aren't predictable events

21:16.320 --> 21:23.280
necessarily. They're only predictable on a grand scale. But sometimes they are. And I think

21:23.440 --> 21:30.800
people were pretty aware that nuclear weapons were dangerous. I'm not sure people are as aware now

21:30.800 --> 21:38.880
as they were, say, 20 or 30 years ago. And that certainly worries me. I have to say I was not as

21:38.880 --> 21:45.520
worried about AI as other people, but now I understand. And it's more that as soon as you

21:45.520 --> 21:51.440
create things that we lose control over, it's scary. And the other thing that we're learning from

21:52.000 --> 21:58.160
the events today is that it takes a few bad actors. It takes everyone to make things work well.

21:59.040 --> 22:03.920
It takes not that many things to make things go wrong. It's the issue with disease. We can find

22:03.920 --> 22:09.440
out what causes a disease. But to make things better is not necessarily that simple. Sometimes it is.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.720
But for things to be healthy, a lot of things have to work. For things to go wrong,

22:14.720 --> 22:20.080
only one thing has to go wrong. And so it's amazing that we do it. And the same is true for

22:20.080 --> 22:25.040
democracy, for democracy to work. A lot of people have to believe in it. A few bad actors can

22:25.040 --> 22:32.480
destroy things sometimes. So a lot of the things that we really rely on are delicate

22:32.480 --> 22:37.600
equilibrium situations. And there is some robustness in the systems. We try to build in robustness.

22:38.240 --> 22:44.880
But a few extreme events can sometimes alter things. And I think that's what people are

22:44.880 --> 22:49.120
scared of today in many ways. They're scared of it for democracy. They're scared of it for peace.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.600
They're scared of it for AI. I think they're not as scared as they should be about nuclear weapons,

22:53.600 --> 22:59.920
to be honest. I think that's a more serious danger than people realize. I think people are a little

22:59.920 --> 23:05.360
bit more scared about pandemics than they were before. But I still say they're not super scared

23:05.360 --> 23:12.160
about it. So you're right. There are these major events that can happen. And we are setting things

23:12.160 --> 23:16.960
up so that they might happen. And we should be thinking about them. The question is who should

23:16.960 --> 23:20.880
be thinking about them? How should we be thinking about them? How do you make things happen on a

23:20.880 --> 23:25.200
global scale? Because that's really what we need. It certainly shouldn't be a source of division.

23:25.200 --> 23:31.200
It should be a source of grand collaboration, probably. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah. I just

23:31.200 --> 23:36.800
wonder what it would be like to be a dinosaur. It must have been beautiful to look at that

23:36.800 --> 23:44.880
asteroid, just enter the atmosphere. Until everything just... Man, that would be one of the

23:44.880 --> 23:49.600
things I would travel back in time to. That's just to watch it. That's also one of the things

23:49.600 --> 23:53.680
that I think you probably could do with virtual reality. I don't think you have to be there and

23:53.680 --> 23:57.440
get extinct. So you just explain that. I think there's something... It's an event. You're just

23:57.440 --> 24:01.600
watching. You're not doing anything. You're just looking at it. So maybe you could just recreate it.

24:01.600 --> 24:08.160
I actually heard that there's a nuclear weapon explosion experience in virtual reality that's

24:08.800 --> 24:16.400
good to remind you about what it would feel like. I have to say, I got an award from the Museum of

24:16.400 --> 24:23.040
Nuclear History and Technology in the Southwest. I went to visit the museum, which turned out to

24:23.040 --> 24:30.560
be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons. The scary thing is that they look really cool. It's true

24:30.560 --> 24:35.760
that you have that, yes, this is scary, but you also have this, this is cool feeling. I think

24:35.760 --> 24:41.120
we have to get around that because I kind of think that, yes, you can be in that, but I'm not

24:41.120 --> 24:46.640
sure that's going to make people scared. Have they actually asked afterwards, are you more or less

24:46.640 --> 24:53.680
scared? That's a good... That's a really good point. I mean, that's a good summary of just humanity in

24:53.680 --> 25:01.360
general. We're attracted to creating cool stuff even though it can be dangerous. Actually,

25:01.360 --> 25:04.960
that was the really interesting thing about visiting that museum actually. It was very nice

25:04.960 --> 25:08.800
because I had a tour from people who had been working there on the Cold War and actually

25:08.800 --> 25:13.600
one or two people from the Manhattan Project. It was a very cool tour. You just realized just how

25:14.640 --> 25:18.160
just the thing itself gets you so excited. I think that's something that sometimes these

25:18.160 --> 25:22.880
movies miss. Just the thing itself, you're not thinking about the overall consequences.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.400
In some ways, it was like the early Silicon Valley. People were just thinking, what if we did

25:28.400 --> 25:34.320
this? What if we did that? Not keeping track of what the peripheral consequences are.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.040
You definitely see that happening with AI now. I think that was the moral of the

25:39.040 --> 25:42.560
battle that just happened, that it's just full speed ahead.

25:43.280 --> 25:50.000
Which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book. You write about

25:50.000 --> 25:55.840
the experience of facing the sublime in physics and you quote Ryan Arilke.

25:57.600 --> 26:03.520
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure,

26:03.600 --> 26:09.680
and we're so odd because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. It's pretty intense.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.400
I think it applies to nuclear weapons.

26:14.080 --> 26:20.560
At a more mundane perhaps level, I think it applies. It's really interesting. One of the

26:20.560 --> 26:28.720
things I found when I wrote these books is some people love certainty. Scientists many

26:28.720 --> 26:32.240
revel in uncertainty. It's not that you want to be uncertain. You want to solve it.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.280
You're at this edge where it's really frustrating because you don't really want to not know the

26:37.280 --> 26:42.560
answer. Of course, if you knew the answer, that would be done. You're always at this

26:42.560 --> 26:48.240
edge where you're trying to sort things out. There is something scary. You don't know if

26:48.240 --> 26:51.440
there's going to be a solution. You don't know if you're going to find it. It's not something

26:51.440 --> 26:55.760
that can destroy the Earth. It's just something that you do on your individual level. Then,

26:55.760 --> 26:59.760
of course, there are much bigger things like the ones you're talking about where they could

26:59.760 --> 27:04.080
actually be dangerous. The stuff I do, I just want to be clear. I'm doing theoretical physics,

27:04.080 --> 27:09.520
not very dangerous, but sometimes things end up having bigger consequences than you think.

27:10.240 --> 27:17.920
Yeah, but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense, but isn't it still in part terrifying when you

27:18.560 --> 27:27.040
think of just the size of things? The power of this thing in terms of

27:28.000 --> 27:34.160
its potential gravitational effects, just the cosmological objects of a black hole at the

27:34.160 --> 27:39.680
center of our galaxy. This might be why I'm a physicist or why I differ from other people,

27:39.680 --> 27:46.400
because I'm not such a big fan of humanity in some ways. Some ways I am. The idea that we were

27:46.400 --> 27:50.560
everything would be really boring to me. I love the idea that there's so much more out there,

27:50.560 --> 27:54.560
that there's a bigger universe and there's lots to discover and that we're not all there is.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.880
I'm going to be disappointing if we were all there is.

27:57.840 --> 28:03.440
Yeah, and the full diversity of other stuff is pretty interesting.

28:04.080 --> 28:09.760
We have no idea how much there is. We know what we can observe so far. The idea that there's other

28:09.760 --> 28:15.360
stuff out there that we yet have to figure out, it's exciting. Let me ask you an out-there question.

28:15.440 --> 28:21.840
Uh-oh. Okay. So if you think of humans on earth, life on earth,

28:22.720 --> 28:29.600
as this pocket of complexity that emerged, and there's a bunch of conditions that came to be,

28:29.600 --> 28:37.280
and there's Darwinian evolution, however life originated, do you think it's possible there's

28:37.280 --> 28:42.480
some pockets of complexity of that sort inside dark matter that we can't see?

28:42.480 --> 28:49.440
So that's possible. Chemistry and biology evolving in different ways.

28:49.440 --> 28:53.760
And that's one of the reasons we suggest. I mean, it's not the reason, but it would be true if

28:53.760 --> 28:58.400
there were that type of interactions we'd suggest. I mean, it would need more complex ones.

28:59.040 --> 29:05.760
And we don't know. I will say that the conditions that give rise to life and complexity,

29:06.480 --> 29:12.080
they're complex, they're unlikely. So it's not like there's great odds that would happen.

29:12.880 --> 29:16.720
But there's no reason to know that it doesn't happen. It's worth investigating,

29:16.720 --> 29:20.160
are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector? That's exactly it.

29:20.160 --> 29:26.000
So the dark matter sector doesn't have all the forces of the standard model of physics?

29:26.000 --> 29:29.680
Right. As far as we know, it doesn't have any. It might have it at some low level,

29:29.680 --> 29:34.640
but it could have its own forces, just like the dark matter might not experience our light.

29:34.640 --> 29:38.080
Maybe it has its light that we don't experience.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.920
So there could be other kinds of forces?

29:40.560 --> 29:45.120
I mean, there could be other kinds of forces even within our sector that are too weak for us

29:45.120 --> 29:48.880
to have discovered so far, or that exist at different scales than we know about.

29:49.520 --> 29:54.720
I mean, we detect what interacts strongly enough with our detectors to detect.

29:55.440 --> 30:00.320
So it's worth asking. And that's one of the reasons we build big colliders to see, are there

30:01.600 --> 30:07.360
other forces, other particles that exist, say, at higher energies at shorter distance scales

30:07.360 --> 30:12.800
than we've explored so far? So it's not just in the dark matter sector, even in our sector.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.440
There could be a whole bunch of stuff we don't yet know.

30:16.640 --> 30:20.960
So maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard model of particle physics.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.720
How does dark matter fit into it? First of all, what is it? Can you explain what the standard model is?

30:27.680 --> 30:34.960
So the standard model of particle physics is basically tells us about nature's most basic

30:34.960 --> 30:40.400
elements and their interactions. And so it's the substructure as far as we understand it.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.840
So if you look at atoms, we know they have nuclei and electrons.

30:44.720 --> 30:50.320
Nuclei have protons and neutrons in them. Protons and neutrons have particles called quarks

30:50.960 --> 30:53.280
that are held together by something called the strong force.

30:54.160 --> 30:59.120
They interact through the strong force, the strong nuclear force,

30:59.120 --> 31:01.840
with something called the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism.

31:02.720 --> 31:08.000
So basically all those particles and their interactions describe many, many things we

31:08.000 --> 31:12.320
understand. That's the standard model. We now know about the Higgs boson,

31:13.200 --> 31:18.640
which is associated with how elementary particles get their mass. So that piece of the puzzle has

31:18.640 --> 31:24.480
also been completed. We also know that there are kind of a weird array of masses of elementary

31:24.480 --> 31:29.440
particles. There's not just the up and down quark, but there are heavier versions of the up and down

31:29.440 --> 31:34.640
quark, charm and strange top and bottom. There's not just the electron, there's a muon and a tau.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.320
There are particles called neutrinos, which are under intense study now,

31:38.880 --> 31:43.360
which are partnered with the leptons through the weak interactions. So we really do know

31:43.360 --> 31:49.040
these basic elements. And we know the forces, we know, I mean, when we're doing particle

31:49.040 --> 31:54.080
physics experiments, we can usually even ignore gravity, except in exceptional cases that we

31:54.080 --> 32:00.320
can talk about. So those are the basic elements in their interactions. Dark matter stands outside

32:00.320 --> 32:06.160
that it's not interacting through those forces. So when we look at the world around us, we don't

32:06.160 --> 32:10.400
usually see the effects of dark matter. It's because there's so much of it that we do,

32:10.400 --> 32:16.080
and it doesn't have those forces that we know about. But the standard model has worked spectacularly

32:16.080 --> 32:21.120
while it's been tested to a high degree of precision. People are still testing it. And

32:21.120 --> 32:26.000
one of the things we do as physicists is we actually wanted to break down on some of it.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.360
We're looking for the precision measurement or the energy or whatever it will take,

32:31.360 --> 32:36.800
where the standard model is no longer working. Not that it's not working

32:36.800 --> 32:41.360
approximately, but we're looking for the deviations. And those deviations are critical

32:41.360 --> 32:45.840
because they can tell us what underlies the standard model, which is what we really want to see next.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.640
Where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down?

32:48.960 --> 32:52.320
Like what are the places you can see those tiny little deviations?

32:52.880 --> 32:57.120
So we don't know yet, but we know the kinds of things you wouldn't want to look for.

32:57.120 --> 33:02.480
So one obvious place to look is at higher energy. We're looking at the large hadron collider,

33:02.480 --> 33:07.680
but we'd love to go beyond that. Higher energy means shorter distances, and it means things

33:07.680 --> 33:12.160
that we just couldn't produce before. I mean, E equals mc squared. So if you have a heavy

33:12.160 --> 33:16.800
particle and you don't have enough energy to make it, you'll never see it. So that's one place.

33:16.880 --> 33:21.280
The other place is precision measurements. You know, the standard model has been tested

33:21.280 --> 33:26.480
exquisitely. So if it's been tested at 1%, you want to look at a tenth of a percent.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.800
And there are some processes that we know shouldn't even happen at all in the standard model or happen

33:30.800 --> 33:36.480
at a very suppressed level. And those are other things that we look for. So all of those things

33:36.480 --> 33:41.200
could indicate there's something beyond what we know about, which of course would be very exciting.

33:41.440 --> 33:47.520
When you just step back and look at the standard model, the quarks and all the different particles

33:47.520 --> 33:58.080
and neutrinos, isn't it wild how this little system came to being creates, underpins everything we see?

33:59.040 --> 34:02.400
Absolutely. And that's why we'd like to understand it better. We want to know,

34:02.960 --> 34:07.440
is it part of some bigger sector? Why are these particles, why do they have the masses they do?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.440
Why is it exposed and so light compared to the mass it could have had,

34:11.440 --> 34:16.720
which we might have even expected based on the principles of special relativity and quantum

34:16.720 --> 34:22.000
mechanics? So that's a really big question. Why are they what they are? And they originate,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.920
there's like some mechanism that created the whole thing? That's one of the things we're trying to

34:25.920 --> 34:33.440
study. Why is it what it is? I mean, even just like the mechanism that creates stuff, like the way a

34:33.520 --> 34:40.560
human being is created from a single cell to embryogenesis, like the whole thing,

34:40.560 --> 34:47.200
like you build up this thing, all of it, this whole thing comes to be from just like a tiny little-

34:47.200 --> 34:48.960
Don't forget, it is interacting with the environment.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.720
Sure. Okay, right, right, right. It's not, it's not, right.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.440
It's important.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.960
Well, that's a really good question is how much of it is the environment? Is it just

34:57.920 --> 35:01.120
the environment acting on a set of constraints and

35:02.880 --> 35:07.040
like how much of it is just the information in the DNA or the information?

35:07.040 --> 35:14.560
How much is it in the initial conditions of the universe versus the some other thing acting on it?

35:14.560 --> 35:17.920
These are big questions. These are big questions in pretty much every field.

35:19.280 --> 35:24.000
You know, we, for the universe, we do consider it, you know, it's everything there is

35:24.000 --> 35:30.240
by definition, but people now think about it as one of many universes in, of course,

35:30.240 --> 35:34.800
it's a misnomer, but could there be other places where there are self-contained gravitational

35:34.800 --> 35:39.920
systems that we don't even interact with? So, but those are really important questions.

35:39.920 --> 35:43.440
And the only way we're going to answer them is, you know, we go back as far as we can.

35:43.440 --> 35:47.840
We try to think theoretically and we try to think about observational consequences.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.120
That's all we can do.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.320
One interesting way to explore the standard model is to look at your

35:53.520 --> 35:58.400
fun, nuanced disagreement with Carlo Revelli.

36:00.160 --> 36:04.640
When you talked about him writing in his book, electrons don't always exist.

36:04.640 --> 36:09.120
They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else.

36:09.120 --> 36:13.200
And you wrote that, well, I'll just read the whole thing because it's kind of interesting.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.720
Stocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded,

36:16.720 --> 36:20.880
but that doesn't mean we can't approximate their worth until they change hands.

36:20.880 --> 36:26.000
Similarly, electrons might not have definite properties, but they do exist.

36:26.640 --> 36:31.680
It's true that the electron doesn't exist as a classical object with definite

36:31.680 --> 36:36.960
position until the position is measured, but something was there which physicists

36:36.960 --> 36:41.520
use a wave function to describe. It's a fascinating nuanced disagreement.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.160
Do electrons always exist or not? Does a tree fall in the forest if nobody's there to see it?

36:48.160 --> 36:51.440
So I like to think of the universe as being out there whether or not.

36:51.440 --> 36:55.440
I mean, it would be really weird if the only time things came into existence was when I

36:55.440 --> 36:58.000
saw them or I measured them. There's a lot of weird stuff.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.600
I mean, I could believe that the Middle East doesn't exist because I'm not there now.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.880
I mean, that would be kind of ridiculous. I think we would all agree on that.

37:05.440 --> 37:10.000
So I think there's only so much that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.960
So and the whole system doesn't come into being because I'm measuring it.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.520
And so what is weird, and this isn't even a disagreement about the standard model.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.240
This is a disagreement about how you interpret quantum mechanics.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.040
I mean, I would say that those wave functions are real.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.960
I mean, one of the things that don't forget that particle physics does that

37:28.960 --> 37:32.560
quantum field theory says is that electrons can be created and destroyed.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.640
It's not that every electron has to be in the universe.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.120
I mean, that can be, I mean, that's what happens at colliders.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.880
Particles get created and destroyed.

37:40.160 --> 37:43.760
But that doesn't mean that if I have an electron in an atom, it's not there.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.240
It's really there. And we know about it. It's charge is there.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.760
So physics is a kind of way to see the world.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.800
So at the bottom, what's the bottom turtle?

37:55.840 --> 37:58.160
Do you have a sense that there's a bottom reality

37:58.800 --> 38:01.120
that we're trying to approximate with physics?

38:01.120 --> 38:04.560
I think we always have in our head, maybe, that we'd like to find that.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.680
But I have to, I mean, I might not seem so,

38:07.680 --> 38:09.520
but I think I'm kind of more humble than a lot of physicists.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.720
I'm not sure that we're ever going to get to that bottom level.

38:12.720 --> 38:16.240
But I do think we're going to keep penetrating different layers and get further.

38:16.240 --> 38:19.360
I just wonder how far away we are, you know?

38:20.080 --> 38:20.880
We all wonder that.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.640
It's not even like, what's even the measure of how far away we are?

38:24.640 --> 38:27.360
I mean, one way you can measure it is just by our everyday lives.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.360
In terms of our everyday lives, we've measured everything.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.280
In terms of what underlies it, there's a lot more to see.

38:33.280 --> 38:36.720
And so part of it has to do with how far we think we can go.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.960
I mean, it might be that the nature of reality changes so much that

38:40.960 --> 38:42.720
even these terms are different.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.760
Maybe we'll measure, you know, the notion of distance itself might break down at some point.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.120
But also to push back on that we've measured everything,

38:51.120 --> 38:53.920
maybe there's stuff we haven't even considered as measurable.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.720
For example, consciousness or there's,

38:58.320 --> 39:02.720
there might be stuff just like you said, forces unseen undetected.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.840
So it's an interesting thing.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.360
So one, and this is often a confusion that happens.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.920
So there's sort of the fundamental stuff underlying it.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.400
And then there's sort of the higher levels, what, you know,

39:12.400 --> 39:15.680
what we'll call like an effective theory at some level, you know?

39:15.680 --> 39:17.280
So we're not always working.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.400
I mean, when I throw a ball, I don't tell you where every atom is.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.440
I tell you there's a ball.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.240
And so there might be different layers of reality that are built on terms,

39:26.240 --> 39:30.400
on terms of the matter that we know about in terms of the stuff we know about that.

39:30.400 --> 39:34.800
And when I say we've measured everything, I say that with a grain of salt.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.440
I mean, I measure everything about the standard mom.

39:37.440 --> 39:42.160
So, so there's lots of phenomena that we don't understand that we,

39:42.160 --> 39:45.520
but often there are complex phenomena that will be given in terms

39:45.520 --> 39:47.600
of the fundamental ingredients that we know about.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.600
But that is an interesting question because yes, there's phenomena that are

39:51.600 --> 39:54.160
at the higher level of abstractions that emerge.

39:54.160 --> 39:58.400
But maybe like with consciousness, there is far out people that,

39:58.400 --> 40:02.240
you know, think that consciousness is panpsychist, right?

40:02.240 --> 40:07.520
That there's going to be almost like a fundamental force of physics

40:07.520 --> 40:09.840
that's consciousness that permeates all matter, right?

40:09.840 --> 40:14.080
I mean, usually when you have a crazy, sorry, okay, when you have a far out theory,

40:14.080 --> 40:18.800
the thing you do is you test all the possibilities within the constructs that exist.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.320
So you don't just jump to the most far out possibility.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.440
I mean, you can do that.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.720
But then to see if it's true, you either have to find evidence of it,

40:26.720 --> 40:29.280
or you have to show that it's not possible without that.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.400
And we're very far from that.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.800
I think one of the criticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that

40:36.800 --> 40:41.120
it requires, if I remember correctly, for dark matter to be weirder than it already is.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.800
And then I think you had a clever response to that.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.320
Can you remind?

40:46.320 --> 40:48.240
I'm not sure I remember why I said them, but I mean,

40:48.240 --> 40:50.320
we have no idea how weird dark matter is.

40:50.320 --> 40:53.440
I mean, it's based on everyone thinking they know what dark matter is.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.040
I mean, so weirder than it already is.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.480
I mean, it's not already anything.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.680
We don't know what it is.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.200
So there's no normalization here.

41:00.560 --> 41:05.040
So dark matter, do we know that if dark matter varies in density?

41:05.040 --> 41:06.480
It definitely does in the universe.

41:06.480 --> 41:10.720
Just like, I mean, so for example, there's more dark matter in galaxies

41:10.720 --> 41:12.640
than there is between galaxies.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.920
So it clumps.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.520
I mean, so it's matter.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.200
So it's distributed like matter.

41:17.200 --> 41:17.840
It is matter.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.920
It does clump.

41:19.920 --> 41:25.520
But the full details of how it clumps and the complexity of the clumping.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.920
It's understood pretty well.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.040
People do simulations.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.720
I mean, where people are always looking for things,

41:32.720 --> 41:36.000
including us as particle physics, it's sort of at small scales.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.680
Are the deviations on small scales?

41:37.680 --> 41:41.040
So that indicating other interactions or other processes

41:41.040 --> 41:44.640
or interactions with variants that is to say normal matter

41:44.640 --> 41:46.080
that we don't understand.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.480
But on large scales, we have a pretty good understanding

41:48.480 --> 41:49.680
of dark matter distribution.

41:50.400 --> 41:53.440
You were part of a recent debate on, quote,

41:53.520 --> 41:55.120
can science uncover reality?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.200
Let me ask you this question then.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.600
What do you think is the limits of science?

42:00.800 --> 42:02.640
I'm smart enough to know I have no idea.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.400
And also, it's not even clear what science means, right?

42:06.400 --> 42:10.240
Because there's the science that we do, which is particle physics.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.080
We try to find fundamental things and figure out what their effects are.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.760
There's science like biology where, you know, it's at a higher level.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.360
The kind of questions you ask are different.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.640
The kind of measurements are different.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.760
The kind of science that's going to happen in the sort of more numerical age,

42:25.760 --> 42:30.080
I mean, or even AI, or like, what does it mean to answer a question?

42:30.080 --> 42:31.680
Does it mean that we can predict it?

42:31.680 --> 42:33.120
Does it mean that we can reproduce it?

42:33.680 --> 42:36.720
So I think we're coming up against sort of the definition

42:36.720 --> 42:39.040
of what we mean by science as human beings.

42:39.840 --> 42:43.440
So in terms of the science that we can do,

42:43.440 --> 42:45.840
I don't think we'll know it until we get there.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.160
I'm, you know, we're trying to solve hard problems.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.080
And, you know, we've made progress.

42:50.080 --> 42:54.480
I mean, if you think of how much science has advanced in the last century or century and a half,

42:54.480 --> 42:55.280
it's incredible.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.320
I mean, you know, we didn't even know the universe was expanding

42:58.320 --> 43:00.080
at the beginning of the 20th century.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.000
We didn't know about quantum mechanics in the beginning of the century.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.520
We didn't know about special relativity.

43:03.520 --> 43:06.720
That's a lot in a relatively short time on,

43:07.600 --> 43:09.040
depending on how you think of time.

43:10.480 --> 43:14.400
So I think it would be premature to say we know the limitations.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.600
And at various points throughout that history, we thought we solved everything

43:17.600 --> 43:19.520
or declared or at least various people.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.800
Where we was various people.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.200
Exactly.

43:21.200 --> 43:21.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.600
Declared that we've solved everything.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.480
So this is also a good place to, maybe could you describe the difference between top down

43:28.480 --> 43:32.000
and bottom up approaches to theoretical physics that you talked about in the book?

43:32.800 --> 43:38.320
So you could try to jump in and say, I have a theory that I think is so perfect

43:40.160 --> 43:46.080
that I can predict everything from it or at least predict some salient features from it.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.120
That's top down.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.560
That would be top down.

43:48.560 --> 43:52.480
Bottom up is more like the questions we just asked.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.600
Why are masses what they are?

43:53.600 --> 43:54.800
We measure things.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.920
We want to put them together.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.720
And usually a good approach is to combine the two.

43:58.720 --> 44:03.040
If you ask a very specific question, but combine it with the methods of

44:03.840 --> 44:07.040
knowing that there could be a fundamental theory and denying it.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.160
Sometimes you make progress.

44:09.280 --> 44:14.480
The community tends to get segmented or fragmented into people who do one or the other.

44:14.480 --> 44:18.000
But there are definitely times, I mean, some of my best collaborations have been

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
with people who were more top down than I am.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.760
So that we come up with interesting ideas that we went to thought of if either one

44:23.760 --> 44:25.440
of us was working individually.

44:25.440 --> 44:29.520
Would you say the truly big leaps happened top down like Einstein?

44:30.240 --> 44:33.360
Einstein was not a top down person in the beginning.

44:33.360 --> 44:35.760
He was special relativity.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.960
It was very much him thinking about, you know, they were thought experiments,

44:38.960 --> 44:42.480
but he was very much, you know, the original theory about relativity

44:42.480 --> 44:47.120
is something like on the nature of electromagnetism, he was trying to understand

44:47.120 --> 44:52.560
how Maxwell's laws could make sense when they were, you know, seem to have different

44:52.560 --> 44:54.480
symmetries than what we had thought they were.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.640
So he was very much a bottom up person.

44:56.640 --> 44:59.440
In fact, he resisted top down for a long time.

44:59.440 --> 45:03.120
Then when he tried to do the theory of general relativity or the general theory of relativity,

45:03.120 --> 45:08.080
whichever you want to call it, incorporating gravity into the system where you need some

45:08.080 --> 45:13.840
feedback, then he was helped by a mathematician who had developed some differential geometry

45:13.840 --> 45:16.080
and helped him figure out how to write down that.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.320
And after that, he thought top down was the way to go,

45:18.320 --> 45:20.240
but he actually didn't make that much progress.

45:21.120 --> 45:25.520
But certainly, so I think it's, you know, naive to think it was just one or the other.

45:26.160 --> 45:30.400
In fact, a lot of people who made real progress were rooted in actual measurements.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.800
Well, speaking of mathematicians, what do you use a difference?

45:35.520 --> 45:38.960
Because you've had a bit of a foot in both between physics and mathematics

45:38.960 --> 45:40.640
in the way it helps us understand the world.

45:41.120 --> 45:46.000
Well, to be frank, there's a lot more overlap in physics and math, I think, than has been.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.720
I mean, well, maybe not more, but there's certainly a lot.

45:48.720 --> 45:53.440
But I think, again, the kinds of questions you're asking are usually different.

45:54.080 --> 45:59.200
Mathematicians like the structure itself, physicists are trying to concentrate on,

45:59.200 --> 46:01.360
to some extent, on the consequences for the world.

46:02.480 --> 46:03.840
But there is a lot of overlap.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.160
The string theory is an example.

46:06.160 --> 46:11.680
There's certain theories where there's a certain kind of mathematical beauty to it.

46:12.320 --> 46:16.640
There's also, you know, there's also some really cool ideas that you get in particle physics

46:16.640 --> 46:19.440
where you can describe what's going on and connect it to other ideas.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.640
That's also really beautiful.

46:21.920 --> 46:24.720
You know, I think, I think basically insights can be beautiful.

46:25.760 --> 46:30.000
You know, they might seem simple, but sometimes and sometimes they genuinely are.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.640
And sometimes they're built on a whole system that you have to understand before.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.680
I mean, if you actually saw Einstein's equations written out in components,

46:38.400 --> 46:39.680
you wouldn't think it's so beautiful.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.200
You write in a compact way.

46:41.200 --> 46:41.760
It looks nice.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.040
What do you think about the successes and the failures of string theory?

46:47.840 --> 46:50.320
To what degree do you think it succeeded?

46:50.320 --> 46:53.600
To what degree is it not succeeded yet or has failed?

46:54.400 --> 46:59.600
I think to talk about any science in terms of success and failure often misses the point,

46:59.600 --> 47:01.760
because there's not some absolute thing.

47:01.760 --> 47:07.280
And I think I do think that string theorists were a bit overly ambitious,

47:07.280 --> 47:10.800
not overly ambitious, but a little bit overly arrogant in the beginning,

47:10.800 --> 47:13.840
thinking they could solve many problems that they weren't going to solve.

47:13.840 --> 47:18.000
That's not to say the methods and advances in string theory don't exist.

47:19.840 --> 47:23.760
But they certainly weren't able to immediately solve all the problems I thought they could solve.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.880
But it has given us tools.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.480
It has given us some insights.

47:30.320 --> 47:35.040
But it becomes almost a sociological question of how much it should be one or the other.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.840
I do think that you can get caught up in the problems themselves.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.640
And sometimes you can get caught up in the methods and just do other examples.

47:43.280 --> 47:47.520
So the real physics insights often come from people who are thinking about physics as well as

47:48.400 --> 47:49.360
the math.

47:49.360 --> 47:55.440
Because you mentioned AI, is there hope that AI might be able to help

47:55.840 --> 47:59.680
find some interesting insights?

47:59.680 --> 48:02.800
I mean, another question, another way to ask this question is,

48:02.800 --> 48:07.520
how special are humans that we're able to discover novel insights about the world?

48:08.960 --> 48:09.920
That's a great question.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.560
And it depends on what kind of insights and we're going to find that out.

48:14.560 --> 48:20.560
I mean, you know, it's because it's hard to think about something that doesn't quite exist yet.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.840
I mean, I could just think about something, take a step back.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.640
You know, it's a little bit like trying to understand three, four dimensions,

48:26.640 --> 48:30.160
you go back to three dimensions, you know, so to go to something you can imagine.

48:30.720 --> 48:36.160
So you can sort of say a lot of the things in a very different level about the internet.

48:36.160 --> 48:40.320
You could say, you know, has the internet helped do things?

48:40.320 --> 48:43.600
And that's, you know, it definitely took on a life of its own in some sense.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.480
But it's also something that we're able to tame.

48:46.480 --> 48:50.720
You know, I know that I myself wouldn't have been able to write books if the internet didn't exist

48:50.720 --> 48:53.280
because I wouldn't have had the time to go to the library and look everything up.

48:53.840 --> 48:56.880
And it helped me enormously.

48:56.880 --> 49:01.360
And in some sense, AI could be that in a very nice world.

49:01.360 --> 49:08.320
It could be a tool that helps us go a step further than we would and a lot more efficiently.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.400
And it's already done that to some extent.

49:11.120 --> 49:15.040
Or it could be like the parts of the internet that we can control that are

49:15.040 --> 49:17.360
ruining politics or whatever.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.000
So and there's certainly a lot of indications that can do that.

49:20.560 --> 49:24.720
Then there are even bigger things that, you know, people speculate about,

49:24.720 --> 49:27.040
about AI being able to do its own things.

49:27.040 --> 49:32.080
But in terms of actually figuring things out, you know, we're in the early stages.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.800
Yeah, there's several directions here.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.480
One is like on the theorem proof side.

49:36.480 --> 49:39.440
So Wolfram Alpha where everything is much more precise.

49:39.440 --> 49:42.640
And we have large language model type of stuff.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.960
One of the limitations of those is it seems to come up with convincing looking things,

49:49.520 --> 49:51.200
which we don't know if it's true or not.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.000
And that's a big problem for physics.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.560
So large language models are more or less like generalizations of stuff that we have.

49:58.560 --> 50:04.320
So the question is, so there's still breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen.

50:04.320 --> 50:06.640
And maybe they are happening and maybe they'll be good.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.200
Maybe not.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.760
But that's not quite the same.

50:09.760 --> 50:14.960
I mean, maybe to some in some cases, it's just pattern recognition that leads to important things.

50:15.600 --> 50:20.080
But sometimes it could be something more insightful than that that I can't even put my finger on.

50:20.800 --> 50:25.120
So it forces us to, I mean, we don't really understand how smart we are.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.240
We don't understand how we think about things all that well, actually.

50:28.240 --> 50:32.560
But one thing is true that we are a lot more efficient right now than computers.

50:32.560 --> 50:35.200
And coming up with things, we require a lot less energy to do that.

50:35.760 --> 50:41.520
So if computers figure out how to do that, then it's going to be a totally different ball game.

50:42.080 --> 50:45.280
And so there are clearly kinds of connections that we don't know how we're making,

50:45.280 --> 50:46.640
but we are making them.

50:47.200 --> 50:50.000
And so that's going to be interesting.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.640
So I say we're in early stages, but this is changing very rapidly.

50:55.600 --> 51:02.880
But right now, I don't think that it's actually discovered new laws of physics.

51:02.880 --> 51:04.640
But could it in the future?

51:04.640 --> 51:05.360
Maybe it can.

51:06.080 --> 51:13.440
It will raise big questions about what is special about humans that we don't quite appreciate.

51:14.880 --> 51:21.120
There could be things that are like that leap of insight that happens, truly novel ideas.

51:21.920 --> 51:24.800
That could potentially be very difficult to do.

51:26.240 --> 51:28.720
So there are sort of abstract questions like that.

51:28.720 --> 51:33.520
There's also questions of how is it that we can address to some extent,

51:34.320 --> 51:37.200
how will AI be used in the context of the world we live in?

51:39.200 --> 51:42.400
At least our country is based on capitalism and a certain political system.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.680
And how will global politics deal with it?

51:45.680 --> 51:48.320
How will our capitalist system deal with it?

51:48.320 --> 51:51.360
What will be the things that we focus on doing with it?

51:51.360 --> 51:57.360
How much will researchers get control of it to be able to ask different sorts of questions?

51:57.360 --> 52:01.840
I mean, while it was starting out, people were doing these kind of toy problems.

52:01.840 --> 52:03.920
But what will it actually be applied to?

52:03.920 --> 52:06.000
And what will it be optimized to do?

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
There's a lot of questions out there that it's really important we start addressing.

52:11.840 --> 52:20.400
What to you is the most beautiful and solved problem in physics and cosmology?

52:20.400 --> 52:26.880
What to you is really exciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades.

52:26.960 --> 52:31.520
So is it what's the most beautiful and solved problem?

52:31.520 --> 52:33.120
Or what is the most beautiful and solved problem?

52:33.120 --> 52:34.320
I think we can make progress on.

52:35.760 --> 52:40.400
Oh boy, we make progress on in the next few centuries.

52:43.360 --> 52:46.960
Most of the questions, the big questions have to do with what underlies things,

52:46.960 --> 52:49.360
how things started, what's at the base of it.

52:49.360 --> 52:52.240
There's also just basic questions like that you asked earlier,

52:52.240 --> 52:53.920
how far will science take us?

52:53.920 --> 52:55.280
How much can we understand?

52:56.160 --> 53:02.240
There are questions like how we got here, what underlies it, are there, you know,

53:02.240 --> 53:07.200
but also, I mean, there's really deep questions like, you know, what fraction

53:07.200 --> 53:08.320
are we actually seeing?

53:08.320 --> 53:11.280
If there are these other forces, if there is another way of seeing the world,

53:12.000 --> 53:16.400
are there galaxies, you know, universes beyond their own that if there's so totally different,

53:16.400 --> 53:17.760
how do we even comprehend them?

53:17.760 --> 53:20.800
I mean, how do we detect like, what would we even think about them?

53:21.360 --> 53:25.760
So there's a lot about trying to get beyond.

53:26.400 --> 53:31.360
It's always just getting beyond our limited vision and limited experience

53:31.360 --> 53:35.360
and trying to see what underlies it, both at small scales and at large scales.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.040
We just don't know the answers.

53:37.040 --> 53:40.720
I mean, I'd like to think that we understand more about dark matter,

53:40.720 --> 53:44.560
about dark energy, about are there extra dimensions, things that we actually work on.

53:44.560 --> 53:47.760
Because there's probably a lot beyond what we work on that's yet to be discovered.

53:48.640 --> 53:51.840
Yeah, understanding the extra dimensions piece

53:54.080 --> 53:55.280
will be really interesting.

53:55.840 --> 53:56.320
Totally.

53:57.040 --> 54:01.440
I mean, if it is, you know, how the universe went from higher dimensions to what we see,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
are the extra dimensions present everywhere?

54:06.000 --> 54:09.680
I mean, you know, one of the really interesting pieces of physics we did,

54:09.680 --> 54:14.560
that I talked about in my first book, War Procedures, is finding out that there can be

54:15.520 --> 54:19.200
a higher dimension, but only locally do you think there's a gravity of a lower dimension.

54:19.760 --> 54:22.880
So it could be like, only locally do we think we live in three dimensions,

54:22.880 --> 54:24.880
that could be higher dimensions is different.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.640
That's not actually the gravity we have, but there's all sorts of phenomena that might be

54:28.640 --> 54:30.080
out there that we don't know about.

54:30.080 --> 54:33.040
All sorts of evolution things, time dependence that we don't know about.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.000
And of course, that's from the point of view of particle physics,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.800
from the point of view of other kinds of physics, we're just beginning.

54:38.800 --> 54:39.360
So who knows?

54:40.320 --> 54:45.440
Yeah, if the physics changes throughout, is not homogeneous throughout the universe, that's,

54:46.720 --> 54:47.520
that'll be weird.

54:48.240 --> 54:53.120
I mean, you know, for the observable universe, it's the same, but beyond the observable universe,

54:53.120 --> 54:53.520
who knows?

54:54.560 --> 54:56.160
What advice would you give?

54:58.640 --> 55:00.320
You've had an exceptional career.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.440
What advice would you give to young people, maybe high school, college,

55:04.640 --> 55:09.200
on how to have a career that can be proud of and a life that can be proud of?

55:09.840 --> 55:14.080
I think the weird thing about being a scientist or an academic in general is,

55:14.080 --> 55:17.120
you have to believe really strongly in what you do while questioning it all the time.

55:17.840 --> 55:20.640
You can't, you know, and that's, that's a hard balance to have.

55:20.640 --> 55:24.800
Sometimes it helps to collaborate with people, but to really believe that you could have good

55:24.800 --> 55:26.960
ideas at the same time, knowing they could all be wrong.

55:26.960 --> 55:32.560
That's, that's, that's a tough tightrope to walk sometimes, but to really test them out.

55:34.160 --> 55:38.080
The other thing is sometimes, you know, if you get too far buried,

55:38.080 --> 55:42.480
you look out and you think, oh, there's so much out there, and sometimes it's just good to

55:42.480 --> 55:46.160
bring it back home and just think, okay, can I have as good ideas as the person next to me,

55:46.160 --> 55:48.720
rather than, you know, the greatest physicist who ever lived.

55:49.360 --> 55:54.320
But right now, like you said, I think there's lots of big issues out there and it's hard to

55:54.320 --> 55:54.880
balance that.

55:54.880 --> 56:00.320
And sometimes it's hard to forget the role of physics, but I think, you know, Wilson said it

56:00.320 --> 56:04.640
really well when he said, you know, when they were building Fermilab, it was like,

56:04.640 --> 56:07.600
this won't defend the country, but it'll make it worth defending.

56:07.600 --> 56:11.600
You know, there's just the idea that, you know, in all this chaos, it's still important that we

56:11.600 --> 56:12.880
still make progress in these things.

56:12.880 --> 56:16.720
And sometimes, you know, when major world events are happening, it's easy to forget that.

56:17.280 --> 56:18.480
And I think those are important too.

56:18.480 --> 56:22.080
You don't want to forget those, but to try to keep that balance because we don't want to

56:22.080 --> 56:23.760
lose what it is that makes humans special.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.520
So that's the big picture.

56:25.520 --> 56:29.040
Would you also lose yourself in the simple joy of puzzle solving?

56:29.040 --> 56:30.000
Yeah. Yeah.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.840
I mean, that's, we all like solving puzzles.

56:34.480 --> 56:38.400
And actually one of the things that drives me in my research is inconsistencies.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.720
When things don't make sense, it really bugs me.

56:40.720 --> 56:45.360
And it just will go in, you know, different directions to see how could these things fit

56:45.360 --> 56:46.080
together.

56:46.080 --> 56:48.720
So it bugs you, but that motivates you.

56:48.720 --> 56:49.520
Yeah, totally.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.640
Until it doesn't.

56:50.640 --> 56:54.000
Because I think, because I have this underlying belief that it should make sense,

56:54.000 --> 56:58.320
even though the world comes at you in many ways and tells you nothing should make sense.

56:58.320 --> 57:01.920
But if you believe that it makes sense, then you look for underlying logic.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.800
And I think that's just good advice for everything to try to find like,

57:04.800 --> 57:05.920
why is it the way it is?

57:06.720 --> 57:09.760
I think, you know, we talk, I talk about effective theory in my second book,

57:09.760 --> 57:11.360
not going to have his door a lot.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.840
You know, it's sort of rather than ask the big questions.

57:13.840 --> 57:17.920
Sometimes we just ask the questions about the immediate things that we can measure.

57:17.920 --> 57:21.040
And we can, like I said, we can sometimes tell one that will fail,

57:21.040 --> 57:22.640
but we can have these effective theories.

57:22.640 --> 57:25.920
And sometimes I think, you know, when we approach these big questions,

57:25.920 --> 57:28.160
it's good to do an effective theory point.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.840
You know, why do I find this satisfying?

57:29.840 --> 57:31.840
Why is the world we have the way it is?

57:31.840 --> 57:34.160
We think things are beautiful that we live in.

57:34.160 --> 57:37.440
I mean, you know, I'm not sure if we had different senses

57:37.440 --> 57:40.000
or different ways of looking at things, we wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful.

57:40.640 --> 57:45.120
But I have to say, you know, it is kind of fantastic that no matter how many times I

57:45.120 --> 57:47.280
see a sunset, I will always find it beautiful.

57:47.280 --> 57:50.640
It's like, I don't think I ever see a sunset as a whatever.

57:50.640 --> 57:51.920
You know, it's just always beautiful.

57:51.920 --> 57:55.360
You'll always, you know, and so there's, there are things as humans, you know,

57:55.360 --> 57:58.880
clearly resonate with us, but, you know, we were maybe evolved that way.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.680
That's about us.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.640
But in terms of figuring out the universe,

58:02.640 --> 58:04.800
it's kind of amazing how far we've gotten.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.760
You know, we have discovered many, many wonderful things,

58:08.560 --> 58:09.760
but there's a lot more out there.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.960
And I hope, I hope we have the opportunity to keep going.

58:13.760 --> 58:16.960
And with effective theories, one small step at a time,

58:17.600 --> 58:19.040
just keep unraveling the mystery.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.880
But also having in mind the big questions,

58:20.880 --> 58:23.120
but doing one small step at a time, exactly.

58:23.120 --> 58:26.160
Yeah, looking out to the stars, you said the sunset.

58:26.160 --> 58:30.800
For me, it's the sunset, the sunrise, and just looking at the stars.

58:31.600 --> 58:38.880
It's wondering what's all out there and having a lot of hope that humans will figure it out.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.720
Right. I like it.

58:42.080 --> 58:49.120
Lisa, thank you for being one of the humans in the world for that are pushing it forward and

58:49.120 --> 58:51.280
figuring out this beautiful puzzle of ours.

58:51.280 --> 58:52.480
And thank you for talking today.

58:52.480 --> 58:53.360
This is amazing.

58:53.360 --> 58:53.760
Thank you.

58:54.720 --> 58:57.600
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lisa Randall.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.800

59:01.360 --> 59:04.400
And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.920
The important thing is to not stop questioning.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.760
Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.200
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
