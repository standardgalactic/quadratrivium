00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
The following is a conversation with Ye, the legendary artist, producer and designer, formerly

00:05.440 --> 00:10.160
known as Kanye West on this, the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:11.360 --> 00:19.520
Based off of our connection and just you being a friend, I need to show you my two tech companies

00:19.520 --> 00:24.000
and get your perspective on it. Because now I have friends that can give a perspective. Like

00:24.000 --> 00:27.600
when I would work on albums, I had other friends that worked on albums and they would give me

00:27.600 --> 00:31.840
their perspectives on it. You want to do this? We are doing it. This is part of it. This is part

00:31.840 --> 00:36.400
of it? Absolutely. All right. Beautiful. Oh, well, I wanted to finish. The thing is, okay,

00:36.400 --> 00:41.040
you're going to ask me different questions, but I'm about growing and building and bringing

00:41.040 --> 00:47.920
the idea to life. So when I see you, I say, oh, this guy understands how to hire engineers.

00:47.920 --> 00:52.240
Where I'm coming from, coming from Hollywood, coming from press, coming from media,

00:52.960 --> 00:59.280
all of the guys, so many of the guys that have been like voices and faces and talking heads,

00:59.280 --> 01:04.880
whatever, have not understood how to engineer product. And that's the reason why I was able

01:04.880 --> 01:11.360
to jump past everyone in the entertainment field and become whatever the net worth is.

01:11.920 --> 01:17.280
I'm going to stop putting the whole black thing on my worth. Let's just see where I am

01:17.280 --> 01:22.640
on the scale of life, because that's a cop out for me to say, rich is black guy of all time,

01:22.640 --> 01:29.600
because that's feeding into the same trauma economy that Black Lives Matter feeds into.

01:29.600 --> 01:35.680
That's why I love and respect engineers. That's the only thing that we really need to teach

01:35.680 --> 01:41.520
in school is engineering. We don't need to teach history. We don't need to teach anything

01:41.520 --> 01:47.840
that is subjective. It needs to only be engineering, taught in school, and everything

01:47.840 --> 01:56.080
else needs to be recessed. Any force subjective information is just to weaken and indoctrinate

01:56.960 --> 02:01.840
our species. And that's what schools do now. As an engineer, I love hearing you say that,

02:01.840 --> 02:07.360
but to push back, history is not, the interpretation of history might be subjective,

02:07.360 --> 02:13.040
but history has some facts, and they're useful to give a grounding to the way you do engineering.

02:13.040 --> 02:20.160
I don't 100% believe in anything, any concept of the future or any concept of history,

02:20.160 --> 02:26.640
because history was just written by the victors. If I see stuff happen on the day,

02:26.640 --> 02:32.080
that later that day, is reported wrong. How wrong is something reported a thousand years ago?

02:32.640 --> 02:38.480
And why would we argue about something that's not in the now? Because that's the only thing that

02:39.040 --> 02:42.800
everyone can agree upon is that it is now, right now.

02:42.800 --> 02:47.920
Yeah. Well, you try not to make the mistakes of the past. That's the usefulness of history,

02:47.920 --> 02:49.200
the limited usefulness of history.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.720
The biggest mistake from the past that we keep making is looking at the past.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.000
Too much. Giving too much value to the past.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.200
Too much value to the past. We are now. We are now. We are here. We are one species.

03:01.200 --> 03:08.560
We are one race. We're here. And it's time. And the leadership is changing,

03:08.560 --> 03:13.440
because you have Elon as a leader. Yay, as a leader. And we are the top leaders.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.680
We're more influential than the presidents.

03:16.560 --> 03:22.480
So you're a human being with engineering challenges before you, with the STEM player,

03:22.480 --> 03:26.880
with Parler. What's the hardest thing in front of you on the engineering front?

03:26.880 --> 03:32.160
That's the first sentence that any of our species needs to hear when they're born.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.480
You are a human being with engineering challenges,

03:36.480 --> 03:41.280
and I consider challenges to be opportunities in front of you.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.680
Literally, like, let me see a piece of paper. I need to write that down.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.960
That's the beginning of our new species constitution.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.000
I'm going to do the paper like this wide, put it in widescreen.

03:52.080 --> 04:08.000
This, this for Ridley, you are, no, let me like, you are a being

04:08.000 --> 04:26.640
with engineering opportunities or challenges opportunities.

04:29.200 --> 04:34.560
I'm sorry, I don't spell as good as John Legend opportunities

04:34.800 --> 04:45.040
and before you. I like the before, because it can mean,

04:45.040 --> 04:50.960
actually it can mean forward or before you. This right here, I've always said I'm the top five

04:50.960 --> 04:57.280
writer in human existence, but this is like, this right here is pushing me to like number four,

04:57.280 --> 04:59.440
number three. It's a good one.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.280
Because who would you say is the top, it's top writer in human existence, we know who it is.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.800
That's subjective. Who's that?

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
It's factual though. It's like, okay, who's the top person in tech history?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.560
It's not subjective.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.320
Wow.

05:12.320 --> 05:19.600
There's a non-subjective answer to both of those. Both of those people have influenced

05:20.720 --> 05:23.520
30% of our existence.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.600
So the influence is the main metric of greatness.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.480
Okay, one person, 30% of our language was, the English language was written by them,

05:32.480 --> 05:35.760
the other person, 30% of the products we use was led by them.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.560
So 30% of our language was written by them.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.920
Oh, Shakespeare, and then the product, product, product, product.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.160
Steve Jobs.

05:46.160 --> 05:51.280
You put Steve above like Elon's of the world, because Steve was a designer, not,

05:51.280 --> 05:55.680
he's a designer engineer, but he's a designer, he's a visionary in the design space.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.000
Well, I would lean to him because I'm not an engineer, right?

05:58.000 --> 05:58.560
So I'm more like-

05:58.560 --> 06:02.080
Then you're an engineer. If Steve is an engineer, you're an engineer.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.200
Essentially.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.880
He's a cultural engineer.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.960
Like the people who run the emotions of the world and run the world off of people's

06:08.960 --> 06:12.880
emotions right now are social engineers.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.600
And social engineering is so important, like city design.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.040
There's a fancier word for that.

06:20.080 --> 06:25.120
But I was in Oxner last night to see Anthony Jeselnick.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.440
And I gotta find out what his opening joke was, because I'm doing interviews and I'm thinking

06:31.440 --> 06:36.400
I'm funny. And I like that he said, he's just kept on saying 20 year anniversary,

06:36.400 --> 06:37.680
I've been doing this for 20 years.

06:38.400 --> 06:45.360
And his opening joke was so high level, I realized that I wasn't funny.

06:45.360 --> 06:49.200
I realized that this dude is a professional at what he does.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.520
And so many things are subjective. I always talk about this.

06:51.520 --> 06:57.920
It's like, you know, people are arguing like, is Emily Radikowski the hottest, you know, person?

06:57.920 --> 07:02.960
And I'm like, that's such a subjective thing.

07:02.960 --> 07:08.720
But like if you go and shoot three pointers with Steph Curry, it's not subjective, right?

07:08.720 --> 07:13.760
Or if you go and compare bank accounts with Elon, it's not subjective.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.640
And another thing that's not subjective, porn.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.600
What about it?

07:19.600 --> 07:22.240
Dicksize. It's not subjective. You can measure.

07:22.320 --> 07:30.080
But porn is more about more than just dicksize.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.600
And greatness is more than the size of the bank account, right?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.800
So there's a subjective.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.160
But greatness is subjective though.

07:36.800 --> 07:42.960
Right. So do you care about the stuff that's objective or subjective more?

07:44.640 --> 07:48.640
Because greatness to me is what matters. The bank account comes and goes.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.200
The impact on our society, like you said, social engineering,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.760
the impact on the collective intelligence of our species,

07:56.320 --> 07:59.360
that what permeates throughout the rest of the time.

07:59.360 --> 08:05.040
I like what you said. The impact, I'm taking notes.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.120
How did you say the impact?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.120
On the collective intelligence of our species.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.160
The impact on the collective.

08:14.720 --> 08:25.600
And yeah, it's writing down the words that came out of my dumb mouth.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.360
I have made it in life.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.240
There's a lot of people that have kind of like sat through.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.800
I wanted to wear a different color hoodie because I was just tired of saying this hoodie

08:36.800 --> 08:42.640
in all the interviews. And there's a lot of kids that are with me.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.680
They see what I'm saying.

08:44.240 --> 08:49.200
And they had to sit through all of the muck of all the previous interviews to get to this.

08:50.080 --> 08:59.920
Every interview has been just an emotional, it's just like been an argument up to this point.

09:00.640 --> 09:08.960
This is the first of, this is the next frontier of where our species is going to head.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.280
It starts here. It starts with you, Lex.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.600
So this is the first time I heard you say the word engineering at least so many times,

09:17.600 --> 09:20.080
which I love hearing. So this is where you're at.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.680
You're like that newborn. You're a being with engineering opportunities.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.280
Yeah. And we're all a newborn because in Christianity we say born again.

09:29.280 --> 09:34.800
We're all newborns and everyone can, everyone's shell, like the word can.

09:35.520 --> 09:43.840
The only thing about shell is it kind of dictates and can kind of let people off the hook.

09:43.840 --> 09:50.800
So I haven't found the perfect post Shakespeare and post Steve Jobs and post Elon and post

09:50.800 --> 10:02.160
Yay and post Drake way to communicate this. But we update and we do. And what the current

10:02.160 --> 10:05.760
media structure, no, it's not actually nothing is holding us.

10:05.760 --> 10:10.800
There's nothing actually holding us back because I'm still alive. I'm still alive.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.680
Like they could have killed me at, you know, George Bush don't care about black people.

10:15.680 --> 10:21.360
They could have killed me at Beyonce had the best video, but we're here now.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.440
So we just keep on leaning and leaning and leaning. And there's these things where I just

10:25.440 --> 10:32.480
think about, you know, there'll be times when I'm at war and every now and then when the,

10:33.040 --> 10:38.560
when the bomb stopped going off and all the headlines and the smearing and all that stopped

10:38.560 --> 10:45.200
going off, I think about my family and I think about Kim and I think about how, you know,

10:45.760 --> 10:51.440
King Koopa has her in the castle right now. And just on Mario Brothers, you know how it is,

10:51.760 --> 10:58.320
you go for the princess and you get to this level and it's like, I'm like, I sung the song

10:58.320 --> 11:03.360
wrong, right? And then they take the princess again. Which one are you, Mario? Yeah.

11:06.080 --> 11:13.120
What's your favorite thing, the thing you love the most about Kim? From a Mario perspective

11:13.120 --> 11:20.800
and the princess? Looking back. Was there a moment? She's definitely my favorite of all time.

11:20.800 --> 11:27.760
Yeah. Was there a moment that, you know, like that catches you off guard and you say, I love this

11:27.760 --> 11:44.080
human being? Yeah. I mean, it's just the DNA is like, she's a mix of Rob and Chris.

11:44.400 --> 11:51.440
Can you explain? I mean, that's like a really high pool right there.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.840
Those are like two geniuses.

11:58.800 --> 12:06.480
So, okay. So like the entire history of evolution of the human species created this DNA. They

12:06.480 --> 12:11.600
created this being. There's a life there. There's a set of memories and a history that brought you

12:11.680 --> 12:18.400
together and you're like, damn, I like this DNA. Yeah. And so certain people have just like high

12:19.200 --> 12:25.760
DNA. Ivanka Trump has high DNA. You know, it's like- How's your DNA? Pretty good.

12:27.760 --> 12:32.800
I think we've seen that. It's been proven. I mean, but look at my mom and look at my dad.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.000
You know, me and my dad have a water purification center in the DR

12:36.320 --> 12:44.240
right now. And my dad is the original Steve Jobs and he was blocked by people around him

12:44.240 --> 12:48.800
and people were using him and taking advantage and, you know, not believing in his vision.

12:48.800 --> 12:54.000
My dad's the educated version of yay. What did you learn about life from your dad?

12:55.440 --> 13:01.600
And my dad got girls too. But those are small details. That's a big detail. Being that I found

13:01.680 --> 13:08.320
my dad's, you know, playboy when I was five years old, it greatly affected my motivation.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.320
Yeah. Okay. So that's part of the engine that drives, yay.

13:12.320 --> 13:19.200
Absolutely. I remember when Pharrell was first in all the videos and my girl was like,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.200
girls like Pharrell. And I was like, I want girls that like me too.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.520
Funny that that's behind all the ambition, all the drive.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.280
That's how we make people. That's how people are made.

13:32.240 --> 13:39.440
It's the desire to be loved. Is that at the individual level just being noticed and also

13:39.440 --> 13:46.400
at the societal level of scale? Well, now I've gone past. I'm like at that place

13:47.200 --> 13:56.240
where Nikolai Tesla was later into his career where it wasn't about being loved. It wasn't

13:56.240 --> 14:03.360
about sitting at the dinner parties next to Anna Wintour and stuff. It was about getting the idea

14:03.360 --> 14:13.040
across. So I have these cells that are very, and I just keep on saying really Scott, but

14:13.040 --> 14:20.400
really Scott has a special anointing. It isn't just sci-fi what he's doing. There's something in

14:20.560 --> 14:25.520
there just like George Lucas. There's something different that's there.

14:28.720 --> 14:36.000
So what are you drawing? I'm drawing these new living cells that we will exist in.

14:37.440 --> 14:41.600
And this is over. Okay, let's do like,

14:42.560 --> 14:50.480
I don't like talking about money because man made money anyway. It's like four quadrillion

14:51.360 --> 14:57.440
respected dollars, and then you have other forms of currency. Of course, social currency is super

14:57.440 --> 15:07.680
important right now, but this is a drawing and it's at a pretty good place now. This would be 40,000

15:07.680 --> 15:11.280
square feet. I want to start just talking in meters. I just think we should go to

15:12.400 --> 15:16.240
anything to restore the tower of Basil like they said when the,

15:18.800 --> 15:26.560
I'm just draw a person here for scale. Yeah, that would help. Okay. What do you think of that?

15:26.560 --> 15:33.920
Look at my person see the scale in this room. All right. So wait, the dot is the person? Yeah.

15:34.880 --> 15:40.240
I'm saying it's 40,000 square feet, but that would be like. What are the other parts of the cell?

15:41.280 --> 15:45.440
Okay, so what it's a screen. It doesn't go all the way to the top and it's one

15:46.000 --> 15:50.960
hole for light, but the water and the light and air all come in from the top. So that's like

15:52.640 --> 15:59.360
like the mouth and then this is the belly button. We're God's iPhone. We're his greatest creation.

16:00.160 --> 16:05.760
So this is all connected. These are all connected. Yeah, some drawing how these other cells go next

16:05.760 --> 16:12.320
to each other. What's the vision here? Happiness. Then we talk about like, what's the motivation?

16:12.320 --> 16:21.840
Like, yeah, there's a motivation somewhere in the back of my mind of my family. And if it's like

16:22.560 --> 16:30.080
where Moses smite the rock and God didn't allow him to get to the promised land,

16:30.080 --> 16:35.920
because the promised land is family. That is the problem. That is earth. I mean, that is heaven

16:35.920 --> 16:41.840
or earth is family. Family is heaven. That's the promised land and for your family to be together.

16:43.520 --> 16:49.760
So say I smite the rock and God doesn't let me have my family back. My mission

16:50.320 --> 17:00.480
and life is still to promote families at all costs and make family's existence easier. So

17:00.480 --> 17:05.520
you take this thing, you put localized, a localized farm, say if it's in community,

17:05.520 --> 17:12.160
that we do localized growing and then we partner with Big Pharma and all and say,

17:12.160 --> 17:17.680
hey, you're actually going to make more money by making better food. Because at the end of

17:17.680 --> 17:22.400
the day, you want money right now. It's like everyone knows that between the pesticides and

17:22.400 --> 17:26.160
between the medical industry and especially America that we're keeping people sick. And

17:26.160 --> 17:32.240
we know that McDonald's makes food that kills people and Coca Cola selling sugar water and all

17:32.240 --> 17:39.440
this like just in case I haven't pissed off enough people in power. You're going to piss off the

17:39.440 --> 17:46.160
sugar. Anybody that's powered on sugar. Well, sugar, what's the health was actually a documentary

17:46.480 --> 17:52.880
on sugar. It wasn't about how bad meat was. It was like a reverse documentary on sugar.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.840
I don't know if you call it reverse like a sub, but if you watch it again, when they show sugar

17:57.840 --> 18:05.840
and it's just the sugar looks super clean. Yeah, just as I state, as I state these things,

18:06.640 --> 18:13.200
I know that I know I have protection. If I have God's protection, that's why I'm here

18:13.200 --> 18:19.440
to this state, right? So it's for me to have this platform and express exactly what I feel

18:19.440 --> 18:26.960
because it's kids out there, right? That it's kids that are going to save the world through

18:26.960 --> 18:36.080
engineering and through facts. And I've got to get download as much of the information and as much

18:36.080 --> 18:41.600
of the don't be afraid to state your facts is the biggest thing because the world is being

18:41.600 --> 18:47.280
ran by fear. And that is, no, actually God runs the world, but there's just like little cloud,

18:47.280 --> 18:54.080
this patina of our ego that deals with the money and the car and the girl we're dating and all

18:54.080 --> 18:57.520
this in the clothes you wear and spending too much on clothes. And a lot of stuff that I've

18:57.520 --> 19:02.160
been involved with promoting. So now what I'm promoting is you have the idea, you say it out loud,

19:02.160 --> 19:08.240
like if you had Tourette's, say your truth out loud. If you hate, yeah, you hate me, say that

19:08.240 --> 19:17.440
out loud, say whatever you feel out loud. Like you say it nonviolently, nonviolent. I have to

19:17.440 --> 19:25.680
say that as a shout out to Alex Jones and Trump where they try to say that when they say their

19:25.680 --> 19:30.640
truth's out loud that it's inciting violence. So let's be like really clear. I'm saying that

19:31.600 --> 19:38.640
they have criminalized free thought. I hate when people use they, like they gets to blame for

19:38.640 --> 19:44.720
everything, right? It's always they. Who the fuck is they? Exactly. The problem is they's us.

19:45.520 --> 19:52.240
Yeah. Well, I love that. What we needed to do is turn I to we. So we take the responsibility

19:52.320 --> 20:01.840
and turn they to us. So we take accountability to us. They to I to we and they to us.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.720
And that relates, it's a language at the same time you're seeing the language

20:06.720 --> 20:13.200
of our surroundings. You're seeing the language of, one of the things, okay, let's go back to the

20:13.200 --> 20:20.080
cell explanation because I'm also doing a, what's that thing when Elon just put all the information

20:20.160 --> 20:25.520
open and people could figure out, they could figure it out and open source. So I'm open sourcing

20:25.520 --> 20:35.760
this idea right now so that, you know, engineers and anointed people beings, anointed beings can

20:35.760 --> 20:44.560
collectively contribute to this, to push our species forward. So where I've got to with my

20:44.560 --> 20:51.840
research is that there will be a hole at the top that allows natural light, natural air,

20:52.640 --> 20:58.880
and there's a constant water system. So it becomes like a water city where it's a constant flow

20:59.840 --> 21:05.120
that's not, it's, it's regenerative. It's not wasting the water and it's just a constant flow.

21:05.120 --> 21:12.960
So I put the toilet really close to where this, this, I don't want to call it a wave pool,

21:12.960 --> 21:19.840
but in the pool, the water is not still. So that exists in, in water, surrounded by water.

21:19.840 --> 21:24.560
Well, the living room is, you have two rooms, you have the dry room, which people have called

21:24.560 --> 21:32.240
a living room before, and then you have the wet room. How is that a source of happiness?

21:33.520 --> 21:38.800
What is broken about our world today that that gives you in terms of the pursuit of

21:38.800 --> 21:43.200
happiness is just one of the things in the previous declaration of it.

21:43.200 --> 21:50.960
All of our buildings are based on just the industry and the economy. And then people lean

21:50.960 --> 21:58.880
into what people are used to seeing. Like what we think is attractive, because then you go back to

21:59.360 --> 22:10.880
the, you know, women who give life. So everyone wants to be attractive to the attractive.

22:11.520 --> 22:21.920
And that's the reason why the media goes and gets, you know, Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian, Emily

22:21.920 --> 22:32.080
Radikowski. Those are the only ones I'm going to, there's more. There's more, but I'm, I'm

22:32.080 --> 22:36.720
thinking of ones that I think are attractive. It is subjective. Yeah, because it's subjective. So

22:36.720 --> 22:46.880
to my subjective, which I think, I think the only guys that could argue with me on, on my opinion,

22:46.880 --> 22:52.560
on girls would be Brad and Leo, because we're the only ones with the track record, you know,

22:52.560 --> 22:58.560
everything else. So if everybody else is subjective, we've got history. So are you,

22:58.560 --> 23:04.320
are you, are you happy? Absolutely. I'm just here. It's actually,

23:04.640 --> 23:15.440
it's difficult to make me unhappy. Now I could deal with frustrations,

23:16.480 --> 23:22.720
but when those frustrations are, it's like, when you've allowed people to be in your life that

23:22.720 --> 23:27.920
shouldn't be there, and then they do the thing you knew they were going to do and you're screaming

23:27.920 --> 23:35.600
at them, but you really need to scream at yourself. Yeah. So you realize anything that's like anger

23:35.600 --> 23:39.680
or frustration, that's something that's wrong with you that needs to be dealt with.

23:41.280 --> 23:46.400
Yes. Like right now, okay, say I got this pattern cutter that I wanted

23:48.480 --> 23:53.280
to remove because I felt like she was copying our patterns into the computer,

23:53.280 --> 23:57.120
and I didn't know why she wanted to do that. And I just wanted to do the patterns by hand.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.920
And then, you know. You mean like automating the patterns? Yeah. And my head of it,

24:03.920 --> 24:05.920
because they just, that's the whole thing. It's like,

24:08.160 --> 24:12.960
it's a war of, it's a war of human beings and robots. Yeah, but that makes them more efficient,

24:12.960 --> 24:17.680
right? You don't like the efficiency. You like the creativity of the singular nature of the pattern.

24:17.680 --> 24:22.960
I believe that the human beings, and I'm saying this to you as a person who makes robots and a

24:22.960 --> 24:27.840
person who's friends. I'm deeply offended right now. Yeah. But I'll, you know, I'll let it go.

24:27.840 --> 24:35.280
Okay. So yeah, I believe that the- Yeah, it hates robots. I'm not gonna put that out. It's a joke.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.800
Robots have feelings too. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That was also a joke.

24:39.440 --> 24:45.760
We need to clarify that for future robots. But the pattern cutter, the pattern cutter,

24:45.760 --> 24:50.240
you don't like that. That had to be that you can't have that part of your life.

24:50.320 --> 24:57.200
That's not what I'm, I'm, my, everything that I'm doing is for

25:01.520 --> 25:08.880
the sake of the human race. There's things in capitalism, there's things

25:09.760 --> 25:21.200
in technology. Well, tech, technology and original human species can exist in a peaceful way.

25:23.200 --> 25:28.800
As long as the people that know how to make robots aren't using their robots to control the humans.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.840
Lex? Definitely something I have to be concerned about as we become more

25:33.920 --> 25:39.120
technological savvy. That, my friend, is why engineering isn't everything,

25:39.840 --> 25:47.360
that you have to desperately study the lessons of history. In Nazi Germany, science was used

25:48.000 --> 25:54.880
to create atrocities. Engineering the same. Engineering could be a tool of war.

25:55.840 --> 26:01.040
We are still in the Holocaust. A friend, a Jewish friend of mine said,

26:04.080 --> 26:09.360
go visit the Holocaust Museum. And my response was, let's visit our Holocaust Museum, Planned

26:09.360 --> 26:15.840
Parenthood. With all due respect, I grew up in the Soviet Union. I'm Jewish.

26:16.320 --> 26:26.880
Parts of my family perished in the Holocaust of Nazi Germany. I have to push back that there is a

26:26.880 --> 26:33.200
difference of the atrocities at that scale, at that time, on an entire people.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.720
I was going to say the number, that's the difference. It's not the number.

26:36.720 --> 26:44.080
Because six million will also, African Americans are actually Jew also, the lost tribe of Israel.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.840
Push back on that too. Okay, so everyone came from Africa.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.400
I'm African. I'm basically African American. We're brothers.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.840
And we're both Jew and we're brothers. We're human.

26:56.400 --> 27:01.280
Six million people died in the Holocaust. Over 20 million have died by the hands of abortion.

27:02.400 --> 27:09.600
The media promotes the my body, my choice, which is actually still a promotion for Planned

27:09.600 --> 27:19.200
Parenthood. 50% of Black deaths a year is actually abortion. It's not the cop with the knee.

27:19.200 --> 27:23.760
It's not Black on Black violence and gang violence. It's not heart attacks. It's actually abortion.

27:23.760 --> 27:29.520
The most dangerous place for a Black person in America is in their mother's stomach.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.280
There's 902 million abortions in the United States a year. I hear you.

27:38.240 --> 27:46.400
But there's something about the rape, the torture, the murder of children, women, men,

27:46.960 --> 27:52.720
the complete humiliation and just the suffering that was endured during World War II.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.200
That's what we deal with on our TVs right now with Black people.

27:58.160 --> 28:03.920
Soros would use Black trauma economy to win an election.

28:04.160 --> 28:09.760
And what I love is having a healthy conversation and as opposed to, there's certain things,

28:09.760 --> 28:15.280
you know, boom, this drops, people are going to have pussy hats on. Boom, this drops is going to be,

28:15.280 --> 28:19.600
you know, Black people and white people with signs. Boom, this drops. So, hey, China,

28:20.560 --> 28:27.200
hey, left agenda, hey, what we're going to do is say that our species can have a healthy conversation.

28:27.760 --> 28:31.920
Can I just linger on this? Because when you say Jewish media,

28:33.840 --> 28:38.400
there's an echo of a pain that people feel that reminds an entire...

28:38.400 --> 28:40.240
You're saying it's redundant, right?

28:41.520 --> 28:44.320
No, I'm not saying it's redundant. I'm saying it's redundant.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.680
You're saying it's redundant.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.560
It's a redundant thing.

28:47.760 --> 28:53.760
I'm saying that it's something that Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany said.

28:53.760 --> 29:02.080
I'm saying it's been said so many times in order to murder and torture Jewish people

29:02.960 --> 29:04.960
that it just rings wrong.

29:06.240 --> 29:11.600
Just like the N word when spoken by people that have the same skin color as me,

29:12.160 --> 29:15.840
it reminds people of a very dark time.

29:15.840 --> 29:19.280
I know. If Jewish people would accept that I'm Jew,

29:19.280 --> 29:23.120
then they would see what I'm saying in a different way. They would hear it in a different way.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.560
But see, the people, you saying you're Jewish, that...

29:26.560 --> 29:28.080
No, I'm Jew. Not Jewish.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.640
Jewish means like that of a Jew. I'm saying I'm Jew.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.440
You're Jew.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.320
Blood of Christ.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.600
That comes from...

29:33.600 --> 29:33.920
Right.

29:38.720 --> 29:43.280
Are you a follower of the philosophy of the black Hebrew Israelites?

29:44.320 --> 29:46.400
Because that's where the idea comes from.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.920
Not all of those folks are extremists, but some are extremists.

29:51.920 --> 29:58.000
I'm a follower of the idea. I have a vague idea that all people came from

29:58.800 --> 30:01.680
Africa, but what I wanted to do...

30:02.960 --> 30:10.160
Okay, now I could Andy Kaufman this about seven more minutes and then tell you what it is.

30:10.160 --> 30:10.640
Should I count?

30:10.640 --> 30:11.440
What the whole point is?

30:11.440 --> 30:12.800
Let's count. Seven minutes.

30:12.800 --> 30:16.160
No, I did this to do a spoiler alert.

30:16.160 --> 30:16.800
Sure, spoiler.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.280
What's the first thing I said at the beginning?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.520
We're talking about engineering and humans, we're all human.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.160
And I said, and then what did I say we shouldn't focus on?

30:26.160 --> 30:26.640
Race.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.640
Not just that. I said, they shouldn't teach this in school.

30:31.440 --> 30:31.920
History.

30:31.920 --> 30:38.320
The history because what they do, what schools are doing is exactly what the CIA

30:39.200 --> 30:46.000
does with Pixar films and Disney films. They make Bambi's mom die in the beginning,

30:46.800 --> 30:52.800
right? And off that pain comes a purchase of ice cream.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.360
Off that pain comes, I need some more toys.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.360
Off that pain comes, I need a bigger house.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.400
Off that pain comes, I need more girls than my wife.

31:00.400 --> 31:08.560
Off that pain comes, so they put that pain in to make us, now we're the orphans of capitalism,

31:08.560 --> 31:14.480
to make us be consumers and we need to be a community, not just consumers.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.400
So I could have went another seven minutes by being a person

31:19.680 --> 31:24.160
who presents himself in a way that says, well, I don't have to feel your pain

31:24.160 --> 31:26.960
because I also have pain too that's not being recognized.

31:26.960 --> 31:30.880
And in every interview, when I say, well, why did I get to the point of putting up the tweet,

31:32.400 --> 31:36.320
no one wants to understand why I got to that point, right?

31:36.320 --> 31:36.720
You had pain.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.360
You had pain.

31:37.360 --> 31:37.680
Yeah.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.800
You had pain in your heart.

31:38.800 --> 31:49.040
But let's say this, undoubtedly Jewish people have a lot of movies about that pain

31:49.040 --> 31:54.720
and black people have a lot of movies about the pain of slavery, right?

31:54.720 --> 31:59.600
It's almost impossible to find a movie about Mansa Munsa.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.440
When you go to the African History Museum in Washington, D.C.,

32:03.440 --> 32:09.200
it doesn't start with the idea of Africans being kings.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.120
It starts with the idea of Africans being slaves.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.160
But here's another interesting point about this.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.360
This was said to me one time and it stuck with me as a family member of mine.

32:20.800 --> 32:26.800
With Africans, how many times you've heard like a rapper or, you know, talk about we were kings.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.920
That's incorrect if we're Jew.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.920
If we're Jew and since we are, we weren't the kings.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.280
We were the slaves that Moses freed.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.200
Africans have always said, we've heard, you've listened to rap music and hear black people say,

32:47.200 --> 32:49.680
we kings, we blood of the pharaohs.

32:51.200 --> 32:55.680
And if we are Jew, then we weren't.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.800
We were the people that Moses freed.

32:59.200 --> 33:04.080
And when we talk about, have you heard black people talk about 400 years of slavery?

33:04.960 --> 33:09.280
All right, that is, and we're having this history lesson, right?

33:10.080 --> 33:11.600
I thought history doesn't matter.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.920
You're exploring ancient history and drawing deep wisdom from it.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.200
And at the same time saying, we need to forget all of it.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.840
We need to put that behind us.

33:21.840 --> 33:22.400
Absolutely.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.680
We need to forget it and we need to move forward.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.640
There is so much wisdom to draw from history, even the 20th century.

33:31.200 --> 33:36.800
Look at this communism without the lessons of history of the 20th century.

33:37.440 --> 33:42.560
Communism sounds like a great idea, except that some of the worst atrocities

33:43.520 --> 33:50.640
conducted by Stalin and Mao that killed 500 plus million people,

33:50.640 --> 33:56.400
not just killed, tortured, starvation, where people, the cannibalism, they ate each other.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.760
They ate their children.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.040
There's just dark people.

34:01.040 --> 34:05.680
People should read some books on this on the hall in Amor in 1930s.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.240
But I disagree.

34:06.240 --> 34:11.520
With that lesson, we would, and now it's becoming more popular, Marxism and communism.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.200
I'm not disagreeing that that happened.

34:13.760 --> 34:19.120
I'm disagreeing that we need to harp on the things that happen.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.400
Because the truth is, I'm giving a fact.

34:22.400 --> 34:29.600
50% today of, let's say, you don't call black people Jew, right?

34:29.600 --> 34:35.520
Black people's deaths today is a abortion today right now.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.480
Like that, it's not racism.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.120
That's too wide of a term.

34:41.120 --> 34:48.480
It's genocide and population control that black people are in today in America

34:48.480 --> 34:56.320
that is promoted by the music and the media that black people make that Jewish record labels

34:56.320 --> 34:59.840
get paid off of or media companies, record labels media company also.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.200
So let's give it a wider, you know,

35:01.920 --> 35:03.760
I agree with Martin Luther King.

35:04.640 --> 35:12.640
I have a dream too, that one day you would not be judged by the color of your skin or your race,

35:13.360 --> 35:16.640
black or Jew, but by the content of your character,

35:16.640 --> 35:19.840
all the assholes that fucked you over in the music industry,

35:19.840 --> 35:24.480
fuck artists over in the music industry, are individuals.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.440
They're not Jews.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.320
They are Jewish.

35:30.320 --> 35:35.440
They're human with opportunities and they took those opportunities.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.280
I don't care if they're Jewish.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.080
Do you feel like I should release that pain and separate it?

35:41.600 --> 35:42.320
Yes.

35:42.320 --> 35:47.600
Okay, so if you're saying I should release that pain and separate it,

35:47.600 --> 35:52.080
then I'm telling you, you should release your pain and separate it.

35:52.080 --> 35:59.120
And we could get to this, the list of how you are being with engineering opportunities.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.080
That's 100%.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.720
I see what you're doing, that exactly you're doing.

36:02.720 --> 36:07.680
The pain, I'm going to let it go, engineering challenges, I get it.

36:07.680 --> 36:12.400
One of the problems you highlight is people get fucked over in the music industry

36:13.040 --> 36:16.960
and get fucked over in the media, get fucked over all over the place.

36:16.960 --> 36:24.160
They created, there was a Jewish trainer that brought me to the hospital and put

36:24.160 --> 36:25.920
in press that I went to the hospital.

36:25.920 --> 36:32.400
I know friends that off of exhaustion, a Jewish doctor, they diagnosed me because they were.

36:33.360 --> 36:40.160
Diagnose me with bipolar disorder and shot me with medication and put me on medication,

36:40.160 --> 36:46.080
then put it in the press and every time, even if I wore the wrong color hat that a nigger is not

36:46.080 --> 36:53.040
supposed to wear, then they immediately say he's off of his shit, he's off his meds,

36:53.040 --> 36:58.640
he's off of his rocker and it's literally used as a scarlet letter control mechanism

36:59.200 --> 37:03.360
for the people understand the kids, the colleges, the high schools.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.320
What do you think they put me right now?

37:07.520 --> 37:10.800
They put me as the prophet, not the leader.

37:10.800 --> 37:16.320
It doesn't have to be the leader, because we need a more intelligent person to be the leader,

37:16.320 --> 37:19.360
but at least they put me as the prophet.

37:19.360 --> 37:23.840
They put me as the only person that would say this and I'm just saying that was four

37:24.560 --> 37:33.280
Jewish members that controlled my voice because for the fact that 90% of black people in entertainment

37:33.280 --> 37:40.800
from sports to music to acting are in some way tied into Jewish business people.

37:40.800 --> 37:47.440
Meaning that in some way, just like if Ram is sitting next to Obama or Jared sitting next to

37:47.440 --> 37:56.000
Trump, there's a Jewish person right there controlling the country, the Jewish controlling

37:56.000 --> 38:00.800
that who gets the best video or not, controlling what the media says about me.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.800
It's a person, not Jewish.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.680
Let me just say one thing.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.880
But they are though, that's the only thing, it just so happens that they are.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.960
That doesn't mean that I hate them, that just means that they are.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.680
But it's a dog whistle too.

38:16.240 --> 38:23.120
Let me just say, as I would love to add more love to the world, I would love you to do that

38:23.120 --> 38:27.760
as a person with a big voice, with a big powerful voice that a lot of people look up to.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.840
And when you say Jewish media, it's funny how this world works that way.

38:31.840 --> 38:40.080
When you say Jewish media or Jews are controlling the voice of black artists, black people, black

38:40.080 --> 38:40.560
artists.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.200
When you say that, I'm not allowed to say it out loud.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.160
You can say it.

38:44.160 --> 38:50.400
There's a large number of people that are hurting and have anger and even have hate in their heart

38:50.400 --> 38:57.360
when they hear Jewish media, they start, that hate starts being directed towards the Jewish people.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.720
Do you acknowledge that?

39:02.560 --> 39:10.160
Can you feel the hate in the world that comes to the surface when you say stuff like that?

39:10.960 --> 39:17.680
Okay, I feel that when we go into therapy, my dad was a therapist.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.840
And obviously I've got some therapy skills myself.

39:21.840 --> 39:28.480
A lot of people, my music is healing, these type of spa-like existences are healing,

39:28.480 --> 39:32.400
the color palace I use are healing, and we can use healing words, right?

39:32.640 --> 39:41.680
What I really feel there, I feel that there's no accountability and no responsibility on

39:41.680 --> 39:48.240
Jewish people in media to at least start with owning up with the facts of what's dealt with

39:48.240 --> 39:54.960
and tell me if I say the facts out loud, to the point of Ari Emanuel writing a letter in

39:54.960 --> 39:59.920
the Financial Times trying to take food out of my children's mouth, telling people that

39:59.920 --> 40:08.400
they're not allowed to work with me. Even Chris Como or Pierce Morgan getting me to apologize and

40:08.400 --> 40:15.520
separate Jewish business people from the families of the Jewish business people, which I did,

40:16.080 --> 40:21.600
update. I did that, that already happened. That was a shitty apology. That wasn't really an apology.

40:21.600 --> 40:27.920
But shout out for that conversation. I need to get on my knees and kiss the dick of Howard Stern.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.480
You don't need to kiss anyone's dick.

40:31.040 --> 40:34.320
That's what you guys are acting like. You guys, look at that.

40:34.320 --> 40:41.360
Because you're talking about it as a shitty opinion, apology, but where's our fucking apology?

40:41.360 --> 40:45.280
Watch this. We don't get... Thank you. Let's move on.

40:45.280 --> 40:49.040
What? Sorry. Do I need to get on my knees or no?

40:49.040 --> 40:56.560
And kiss my dick. Just escalated quickly. That's escalated quickly.

41:00.240 --> 41:07.120
No, I'm saying where's our apology, but we can't get to apology because you're telling me there's

41:07.120 --> 41:15.440
no right way for me to word it. So tell me, for me, a person who's been fucked on my deals

41:15.440 --> 41:20.800
and a person that has friends that never figured out how to make shoes with a German company

41:20.800 --> 41:24.560
that couldn't tell me to wear a BLM shirt and take off my red hat,

41:24.560 --> 41:27.200
like what would have happened if I was at Nike, right?

41:29.440 --> 41:34.400
Tell me exactly how to engineer the situation I'm in.

41:34.400 --> 41:40.000
Tell you exactly how. You got a big voice. Have the balls as a man to call out the individuals.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.840
Don't call them Jews. Call them by their name and start a war against those individuals.

41:45.840 --> 41:49.680
They're not Jewish. But if that's the case, will you help me with that?

41:50.240 --> 41:56.320
Sure. Okay. 100%. Assholes are asked. Well, let me like flip that too. I don't understand the industry.

41:56.320 --> 42:01.760
Well, I see that people are fucking people over for sure. But how do you solve that?

42:01.760 --> 42:07.280
If you run... If you right now run the world's... You're doing a million things,

42:07.280 --> 42:12.800
but say you ran also a record label. I have ran a record label. I've been ran by a record label

42:12.800 --> 42:18.240
where I was the face of a record label and had Big Sean and different people complaining to me.

42:18.240 --> 42:22.720
And I knew fuck about running a record label. I was simply just a talented producer

42:22.720 --> 42:27.760
and an influencer that then started good music, but I wasn't the one running good music.

42:27.760 --> 42:32.080
How would you do it differently? This is something I propose. I would look at

42:32.320 --> 42:44.720
the top 10 execs in three fields, in sports, film, and music. And I would look at the top 10

42:47.440 --> 42:52.960
clients, participant act talent. I would look at the top talent in each of those fields,

42:52.960 --> 42:57.680
the top 10 of them. And some of them are going to be Tom Brady. Some of them are going to be Taylor

42:57.760 --> 43:04.080
Swift. Some of them, they're not all going to be black, right? Some of them will be Adele,

43:04.080 --> 43:14.560
right? And we'll look at all their contracts transparently and we'll compare the notes

43:14.560 --> 43:20.160
and re-engineer like it's a new constitution. Because when I told my dad, when I was 19,

43:20.160 --> 43:25.040
I was going to get into the music industry, he begged me not to. He said, I heard it's treacherous.

43:25.760 --> 43:30.960
Now I'm in a position where I've been through it. I saw it. I went out, made some money somewhere

43:30.960 --> 43:37.760
else. I saw my name get smeared. I saw my family get destroyed. I saw my reputation get destroyed.

43:37.760 --> 43:43.760
And I'm back here to have this kind of... I'm back here as a being with engineering opportunities.

43:45.040 --> 43:52.160
If you say as a shitty apology, what is the version of the apology short of kissing Howard

43:52.160 --> 43:56.640
Stern's dick? I don't think anyone wants to kiss Howard Stern's dick. That's the whole point,

43:56.640 --> 44:00.400
Howard Stern. Nobody wants to kiss your dick. So shut the fuck up. I said, by the way,

44:00.400 --> 44:07.600
I'm antagonizing you, Howard Stern. I used to be a fan of you. Yeah, me too. Yeah. I'm still a fan

44:07.600 --> 44:14.080
sometimes. Now you're just doing clickbait like everybody else. Now you're just a sad old man,

44:14.080 --> 44:20.960
Howard. All right. Now, Howard Stern, this is the first time anyone's said your name in years.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.200
Your own family doesn't say your name unless they're calling to get their bills paid.

44:27.120 --> 44:34.400
You're going hard. See, that's beautiful right there. That's much better than calling Jewish

44:34.400 --> 44:40.960
media. Go after individuals. Go after individuals. You don't talk shit about me. Talk shit about me.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.200
This is great. And you know what that is? Yeah, what's that?

44:45.520 --> 44:50.720
Engineering. That's an engineer's approach. Yeah, engineers. Yeah. Yeah, you should learn some of

44:50.720 --> 44:57.680
that. We all can use our pain against each other or we can say we're being with engineering

44:57.680 --> 45:03.040
opportunities and we can know about history. So let me change something. We can have

45:05.360 --> 45:10.320
a, just to be judgmental, people say that should not judge. I've been talking to Camille Vasquez.

45:10.640 --> 45:16.000
She says, I'm very judgmental. That's what we're doing. I believe, now you could go to Bible and

45:16.000 --> 45:20.480
one thing's going to say one thing, another thing may be contradicted in a way and then the pastor

45:20.480 --> 45:31.280
has to unpack it. I believe that we are to judge. If you look at some food and it's got a fly coming

45:31.280 --> 45:36.880
out of it, you can then judge at that point. You're supposed to use your better judgment.

45:37.280 --> 45:41.040
Whenever someone doesn't want to change something they're doing, they'll say,

45:41.040 --> 45:48.320
don't judge me. But as a species, you call for me, you got the breakthrough. And by the way,

45:48.320 --> 45:56.560
it's only an engineer that I would respect to tell me of how to update how I'm communicating.

45:56.560 --> 46:04.000
Because this started off, right? I've been through all these interviews. Let me go to this. You said

46:04.000 --> 46:11.360
this was a sorry apology. I was very specific. I said the Jewish, because by the way, it's a barrage,

46:11.360 --> 46:15.280
right? It's a thing where I don't even remember the names at a certain point, right? It's like,

46:15.840 --> 46:19.680
if a girl was getting raped by men,

46:22.720 --> 46:29.600
if that person's not 18, right? And she was getting raped since 14, right? And she still

46:29.600 --> 46:38.720
got this face, this super like Irina Shake level face, right? She might say, I hate men.

46:39.920 --> 46:46.720
That woman may say, I hate men. She might get to that point because she was raped. On my contracts,

46:46.720 --> 46:51.440
and no one can say this is ramped up. No one, Howard Stern can't say this is ramped up. Ari

46:51.440 --> 46:57.120
Emmanuel can't say this is ramped up. George Soros knows damn well that I'm not ramped up.

46:57.120 --> 47:04.640
George Soros knows like, wow, this guy's like a younger guy that's looking at what I did and

47:04.640 --> 47:12.000
looking at how I control the world silently. And he's calling it out. And he's not using any of

47:12.000 --> 47:17.360
the fear tactics. I can't send his homeboys around him. I can't send his wife to him. This guy,

47:17.360 --> 47:22.720
that's what George Soros sees, right? When he's dealing with me, right? So what you guys are

47:22.720 --> 47:29.840
actually asking me to do, I'm comparing myself to that 18 year old beautiful woman that had been

47:29.840 --> 47:38.720
mistreated by men for four years of her life, right? And you're saying, as a man, you can't blame

47:38.720 --> 47:48.800
all men. And I'm saying as a responsible forward philosopher leader, okay, I'll drop the pain.

47:49.280 --> 47:57.280
And I will specify because I'm up here. I lost my fucking family. I lost my kids. I lost my best

47:57.280 --> 48:04.880
friend in fashion. I lost the black community. I lost, you know, people said I lost my mind.

48:04.880 --> 48:10.880
All of these things lost my reputation. And I'm up here just like, I just want my family,

48:11.760 --> 48:18.400
but I don't want my family to have to say what the left wants us to say. To have to say what

48:18.400 --> 48:23.920
China wants us to say. I want to be an American and protect my kids and protect my wife and raise

48:23.920 --> 48:31.200
my kids as Christians and have my wife be a Christian and innovate and America made rock

48:31.200 --> 48:37.040
and roll. I want to innovate as a creative person and be a successful American. But all of that

48:37.040 --> 48:43.120
had been taken away from me. So I'm coming back and I'm removing the PSTD right now, right? I'm

48:43.120 --> 48:47.120
standing up and saying the only way that we're going to be able to get past this and the way God

48:47.120 --> 48:54.480
is going to use me right now is for me to stop talking about the pain, stop talking about what

48:54.480 --> 49:00.560
happened and do something about it. And that's where I'm at right now in this moment. Like, yeah,

49:00.560 --> 49:05.520
people agree. At least there was something where you could say he has a reason of why he got to

49:05.520 --> 49:13.360
that tweet. And what you're doing for me today is saying, yo, that was a sorry apology. And let's

49:13.440 --> 49:22.480
specify, I'm not asking for anyone out here to empathize or sympathize for a, you know,

49:22.480 --> 49:28.800
a dude worth $11 billion that can make money disappear, I mean, appear at a thin air in five

49:28.800 --> 49:34.080
different industries, you know, I'm not asking for the I'm not asking for anybody to sympathize with

49:34.080 --> 49:40.480
someone who's married to Kim Kardashian dated Irene and shake, but like, I feel like I'm just not

49:40.480 --> 49:48.400
going to get the sympathy vote in this situation. Right. So I feel your pain. I feel, yeah, I feel

49:48.400 --> 49:52.720
like no one's going to feel my pain. Only only Brad and Leo could feel my pain. Right. So the,

49:53.760 --> 50:02.320
so, but still, but here today, when you said as a sorry apology, what's the, what's the apology

50:02.320 --> 50:10.480
that you're looking for as a, as a Jewish engineer, not say as Lex, let's not talk about

50:11.280 --> 50:20.640
you being Jewish as Lex. What's the apology that you want me to say to, am I allowed to say Jewish?

50:20.640 --> 50:26.240
Tell me, is it anti-semitic for you to say Jewish out loud? No, there's a, I don't like the allowed

50:26.720 --> 50:32.960
that presumes censorship. I think you choose, you have a powerful voice. Did I prove, did I,

50:32.960 --> 50:37.200
did I prove that there was censorship over the past two weeks? I proved it. Who censored you?

50:37.200 --> 50:45.200
Oh, drink champs. Oh my Lord. Oh, like Twitter and so on. Twitter. That has less to do. Drink

50:45.200 --> 50:52.000
champs. That hurt you, that drink champs, that Nora took it down, took down your conversation. No.

50:52.560 --> 50:57.760
It didn't hurt you. Man, you got to be honest about the pain.

50:58.720 --> 51:07.440
What's still the kids we used to be? I put my hand on the stove to see if I still bleed

51:08.800 --> 51:16.560
and nothing hurts anymore. I feel kind of free. No, do you think,

51:18.880 --> 51:27.040
you know, I went to Japan for two to three months, right? The day I had Sunday service,

51:27.680 --> 51:31.680
my kids are supposed to be there and my kids would know where to be found.

51:32.320 --> 51:40.720
And I text Kim and said, where are my kids? We get into an argument and then I get a text

51:40.720 --> 51:46.880
from a number I don't know and it's Pete Davidson bragging about being in bed with my wife.

51:46.960 --> 51:53.680
Then... Just fucking with you?

51:53.680 --> 51:59.920
Well, at that point, it's like they're trying to put me in jail or put a friend of mine in jail

52:01.680 --> 52:08.240
because then I'm going to go surround the hotel and do all, you know, do something

52:08.240 --> 52:13.520
which would have me not be able to be here. And instead I walked away from that situation.

52:13.520 --> 52:18.400
I went to Japan, like the samurai that I am, and went to the top of the mountain.

52:20.240 --> 52:27.520
Because I knew that, I mean, I knew there was no way she could love this dude,

52:27.520 --> 52:31.280
not just because he's ugly, he's not black. She likes black guys. Every guy that she,

52:32.000 --> 52:38.560
you know, is wit, looks exactly the same. Ray J, Reggie Bush, at that time Kanye West,

52:38.560 --> 52:43.040
she has a type, just like how I have a type. Like a lot of my girls look kind of similar to her

52:43.040 --> 52:47.280
because in a video game character, people have, people have their type, right? So I knew that

52:47.280 --> 52:53.360
this was like... The princess has a type and she likes Mario. Right, there you go.

52:53.360 --> 53:00.320
As somebody cares for you and hopefully can be a friend. Yay, I gotta say these words and the

53:00.320 --> 53:10.000
words about Jews is not the words of a samurai, of a great man. I would say, you know, you said

53:10.560 --> 53:15.360
something that inspired, that resonated with a lot of people when you said George Bush doesn't

53:15.360 --> 53:21.040
care about black people. I have to say, as somebody who cares for you, that yay,

53:21.040 --> 53:29.520
the artist formerly known as Kanye West, doesn't care about Jewish people. In the same way you

53:29.520 --> 53:35.520
spoke about George Bush being a politician and not giving a fuck about the poor people that

53:36.320 --> 53:42.240
suffered after Katrina, you're not giving a fuck about the suffering of the Jewish people

53:42.240 --> 53:49.840
across the world. Why am I not? Because you're feeding, you're giving strength, motivation to

53:49.840 --> 53:53.280
hate groups. But we already updated, I gave an apology, you said it wasn't good enough.

53:53.280 --> 53:56.080
Yeah, that's right. And now you're telling me, no, I'm not gonna...

53:56.080 --> 54:01.040
You don't need to kiss anyone's dick. What you have to do is to say, it was wrong to say,

54:01.040 --> 54:05.040
there's no Jewish media, there's no Jewish... There isn't.

54:05.040 --> 54:10.960
There's no control of the media by Jewish people. You're an engineer, brother. If you're an engineer

54:10.960 --> 54:16.240
and you're not holding to the truth, that's not engineering. Engineering is not, that's not,

54:16.240 --> 54:21.120
that doesn't, that's hate, that's not engineering. Engineering costs... I'm gonna build a better

54:21.120 --> 54:25.440
record label. It's called stereotypes. And I'm going to respect our... Stereotypes exist for a

54:25.440 --> 54:30.640
reason. Engineers don't do stereotypes. I do. Stereotypes are dumb. They allow you to channel

54:30.640 --> 54:34.080
hate towards the other. You know what the biggest thing is? Yeah.

54:35.040 --> 54:40.320
With something, a veteran that was sitting next to me at Cheesecake Factory last night,

54:41.360 --> 54:49.280
he said, you know, the general justice, he serves for whoever is the president, right?

54:49.280 --> 54:55.760
And he said, what's happening in politics is we're forgetting we're on the same side.

54:56.720 --> 55:01.840
We're forgetting we're on this. This is someone is practically... Now he's a nurse. So he's still,

55:02.560 --> 55:09.040
you know, fighting for humanity in a way. He went from holding, you know, guns in battle to being

55:09.840 --> 55:17.120
a nurse and when people are battling for their lives. And he said, we're forgetting we're on the

55:17.120 --> 55:26.960
same side. This is a person that no matter who becomes president, he can still be told to go to war.

55:28.160 --> 55:39.280
And the chaos that's created by the media has split the country in half. And what we... What

55:39.280 --> 55:44.880
us as beings with an engineering opportunity need to do right now is find the blue water.

55:45.600 --> 55:52.400
Where do we... Where are places that we agree on? And I want you to finish everything...

55:53.760 --> 56:03.120
I'm going to let you finish everything that you want to express to me. Get off all... I'm your

56:03.120 --> 56:08.080
scarecrow today. I'm your punching bag today for everything I did. And I want you to stand up for

56:08.080 --> 56:14.160
all of the hate that I'm your Al Gore when he lost the election. Remember, he almost became a

56:14.160 --> 56:20.160
punching bag for the lady that had voted on him. And she just said all this stuff. And he's like,

56:20.160 --> 56:26.160
I know, I agree with you, right? But there's nothing, you know, that he could do about it.

56:26.160 --> 56:31.440
With this, it's like things that you're saying, I agree with you. You know, it's like if you sit

56:31.440 --> 56:38.640
some kids in the... In the principal's office and I punch somebody, right? I took... I took my hand,

56:38.640 --> 56:47.520
right? As what it really means. Even Aria Emmanuel had to say, this is a pop icon, right? And I went

56:48.240 --> 56:56.240
and just punched an entire people at one time or said that I was about to... I went like this,

56:57.040 --> 57:02.160
right? And I got blacked out, black mirrored, done, right? And it's like, what were you even

57:02.160 --> 57:13.040
going to do? And why did you go like this? I went like this because I can't even do... I would look

57:13.040 --> 57:23.360
insane to physically show you a metaphor, a physical representation of my last 20 years

57:24.320 --> 57:31.840
of what I've been through as a musician, as a father, and as a black person with a political

57:31.840 --> 57:37.200
opinion. A great man still through the pain does the right thing. And I think the right thing

57:38.000 --> 57:43.280
is to not say that there's Jewish control of the media. That's incorrect, though. That's a

57:43.280 --> 57:48.960
fucking lie. There is. And they did come and bully me. It proved the point. No, the reason you don't

57:48.960 --> 57:57.280
say it is because the world is much bigger than the, forgive me, the narrow little world you exist in.

57:57.280 --> 58:02.080
Your impact stretches way past those little boardroom meetings over contracts.

58:02.080 --> 58:04.240
So what should I have done? What should I have done?

58:04.240 --> 58:07.040
Not say that you should be a strong man that doesn't mention,

58:07.600 --> 58:11.840
that doesn't mention religion or people and then fight. Do you want to win this fight?

58:11.840 --> 58:13.680
How do I win? How do we win?

58:13.680 --> 58:18.160
Call out individual people built. That's one way because they have a big voice. The other voice

58:18.160 --> 58:26.480
that I prefer is to build another label. I feel like you're controlling my creative narrative and

58:27.040 --> 58:29.600
because just like how you're telling me I shouldn't have said that,

58:29.600 --> 58:31.920
do you think there are people telling me I shouldn't have wore a red hat?

58:33.920 --> 58:39.040
No, because you asked me, what should I have done? You're supposed to be a scarecrow,

58:39.040 --> 58:42.560
so I thought I'm going to beat the shit out of the scarecrow with my words, right?

58:42.560 --> 58:45.040
You let me. It was consensual.

58:45.040 --> 58:48.320
The punching bag is a bit, because scarecrow actually has a different real name.

58:48.320 --> 58:48.800
Yeah, that's right. I'm not a good person.

58:48.800 --> 58:51.040
So let's say a punching bag. I shouldn't say a scarecrow.

58:51.920 --> 58:57.600
But every single person that I've sat with from the point when I wore the red hat to now has

58:57.600 --> 59:02.800
done the same thing. Sit in the principal's office and don't do what you're doing.

59:03.360 --> 59:09.840
We're in the generous closet right now together. The red hat is very different. The red hat is

59:11.040 --> 59:18.640
you have a set of beliefs. You represent half the country that has a hope, a vision for the

59:18.640 --> 59:23.680
future of America that's very different than without any purpose whatsoever saying Jewish

59:23.680 --> 59:25.440
media, Jewish control of the media.

59:25.440 --> 59:31.600
You said there's no purpose, so you're taking away my history and my reason of what my purpose was.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.400
I'm saying it was done.

59:34.400 --> 59:39.200
Also, I'm speaking my voice vocalizing.

59:39.200 --> 59:45.040
Also, it's God's plan. There's a lot of things that open up. Let me tell you something that

59:45.040 --> 59:50.800
opened up. There's a guy, like I told you, that was running STEM player who I've had issues with,

59:50.800 --> 59:58.640
we hadn't got paid on certain things, right? And he took his IQ, his know-how, his engineering

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.800
know-how to, he basically was trying to adidas me with, even though I was the bigger money in

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.960
the situation, that was fun and we funded together. And he hired these engineers and he said,

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.240
well, because of your comments, we're not going to be able to hire anybody else.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.600
And I was like, well, how many Jewish people do we have in our company? He said,

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.080
I don't know. He didn't say exactly, right? I said, do we have Black people? He said,

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:28.160
yes, I said how many? He said two. So we have like 60 full-time employees, like 40 half-time

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:41.760
and part-time. And I took as a responsibility, let's take a step back from us being one species

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:48.320
and say, hey, you're Jewish, I'm Black, right? For this example, for the sake of this example.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:57.040
And I said, wow, I'm sure I could hire more than two Black engineers. And what happens is,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.080
because there are so many businessmen that just so happen to be Jewish, that it's good

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.640
business, right? Just to monopolize. That's what people are looking. Everybody wants to be Elon,

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:15.760
right? So the- I just agree with that. Okay, but let me finish this point.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.160
I'm going to let you finish. I'm going to let you finish.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:25.040
A lot of businessmen want to be as successful as Elon and as popular as Elon. A lot. Like,

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.040
I just worded like that, which I hate the term a lot, actually. I want to be more specific,

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.200
but I don't- I haven't done the math on it. Let's say some. Factually, for sure, there are some

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.800
business people of all different walks and backgrounds that would like to be as rich

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.880
and as popular as Elon Musk. So let me just take a step back from the we're one species

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.120
into the we're separated by race, gender, socioeconomic class conversation and say,

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.640
as a black owner of two tech platforms, hardware and software, I need to take

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:06.800
action. Let's not call it affirmative. Let's just say I need to take action and I need to take

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:18.080
accountability and ensuring that black engineers are hired. And guess what? Hired together.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.800
Because when the black people that are brilliant are separated from our culture,

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.680
we forget who we are. And we'll get to a point where, you know, OJ would say, I'm not black,

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:39.280
I'm OJ. Because just to be on the golf course, we put on the golf shirt. But the golf shirt

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:46.720
might not be something that our culture would have done. And now our culture in poorer communities

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.520
everybody's got Draco on them. Everybody's got a gun on them. Oh, if you run up on me on a gas

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.240
station, I'm going to kill you. Hey, you ain't got to talk to me like a man if I haven't killed at

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.560
least five people. But you know what happens is we can kill five people, we could kill 10 people

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.600
and still be in the media as long as we play by the rules, right? Because what will happen is

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:16.080
any of these guys that have talked about killing people in different things, unless Trump

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.000
had pardoned them, right? But let's say, even if Trump had pardoned them, they could still go to

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
someone like a little boozy or meek mills or puff daddy, anybody, and say, hey, we need you to talk

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.840
shit about yay right now. And also you're not allowed, if you do want to vote for Trump or vote

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.480
outside of what this arrangement is, then we're going to put you in jail. And we're not going to

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.440
bring you down. We have this on you. You get what I'm saying? If I had ever killed someone,

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:55.920
if I wasn't the bitch with the pink polo on, I wouldn't be able to be the vocal man that I am

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.480
today. You understand what I'm saying? This is the reason why I'm happy that my gangster

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:08.080
disciple brothers kept me from the initiations, which made me feel like a pussy my whole life,

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:17.360
right? But now I am someone who legally can say this. Other people in my position,

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:24.480
they legally cannot speak. They legally cannot speak, or they will go to prison.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.120
I am in a bit of a glass prison because I don't have say so of where my children go to school.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.960
But I'm in a freedom place where I can have this conversation with you right now.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:45.040
And that is, I don't like the word breakthrough. That's God's hand on this situation.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.080
But you get what I'm saying about, if I hadn't said the tweet, I wouldn't have had to take the

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.440
accountability myself to hire black engineers into my two tech platforms.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.960
Yeah. And do you get what I'm saying? That's a beautiful personal journey you're on.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.280
But do you get what I'm saying? That personal is for my people as a whole.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:11.840
As a tribal person, as a small company, as a tribal person, I believe that I am my people.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:20.320
And the thing that businessmen have done to my people have pulled the brightest out of our tribes

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.800
and siloed them and made us lose our culture and lose who they were. All the only thing I wanted

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:34.640
to say a Virgil's funeral, which I wasn't allowed to. It was a white pastor that talked the majority

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:44.560
of the funeral. Half the funeral was pissed. And this pastor actually married me and Kim.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:51.840
He looks like Justin Timberlake a little bit. And he talked half the funeral. He knew Virgil's

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:58.160
passing, did a collaboration with him before he passed, by the way, right? A clothing collaboration.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:06.800
I didn't know Virgil was passing, but the thing I wanted to say, I saw ASAP Rocky and I saw some

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:15.760
other members of his gang, you know, in the audience at the funeral. And all I wanted to tell him is,

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:26.960
don't let them split the gang up. Don't let them split the gang up. When I did the first Yeezy,

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:35.680
because I did Kanye West two fashion shows before as a high-end luxury, all-leather kind of

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:41.520
designer, not all leather, but you know, high-end materials, mink, this kind of thing.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:50.480
And then I came back with Yeezy with Adidas. And this fashion show was so popular that Justin

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.840
Bieber had to sit in the second row, right? This thing had every name you could think of. It had

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:03.920
Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner. It was Kylie's first fashion show she'd been in.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.160
And in the second fashion show, I put Kylie and Bella Hadid next to each other

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:15.040
in the fashion show. You had Puff Daddy. At that time, Puff Daddy had beef with Drake. Drake

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.960
still came to the show and Jay-Z had to break up the fight backstage. The designers, you had Jerry

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.240
Lorenzo, that's head of Fear of God. You had Kim Schwab, head of Skims. You had Virgil Abloh, head of

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:35.360
Louis Vuitton. You had Dimna, head of Balenciaga, all working for the leader, for the philosopher,

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:43.280
for the person that put, who put this together? Me, that's who. You had these people working for

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:50.800
the king in New York, basically the boss. Yeezy in the audience, Rihanna in the audience,

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.680
Beyonce in the audience, sitting next to Anna Wintour in this audience. And guess who heard

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.720
wind of this? One of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnault caught wind of this.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:10.880
What's going on? They're building up something and we need to stop it. So then he met with me

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:17.280
and politely offered me backing from my clothing line. It would be Kanye West, they would get

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:23.520
49%, 51%, I would get 49%, they'd have control and they were going to give me all of the support

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:31.280
from Louis Vuitton. So I had to go to Adidas and I told Adidas, hey, let's adimnify the apparel.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:36.160
So Adidas, you're not going to do the apparel anymore. Hey, we had a, we had a good time,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.480
but we're going to run off with Giselle now, right? So the, that's like you told your girl

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.560
that and you're like, ah, no, we're supposed to, we had the proudest moment of our career and so.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:52.720
So then he offers me the deal and Alexander Arnault, who's went to gone on and rape and pillage

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.480
from all of the talent that I had afterwards, said, I say, before I tell Adidas to adimnify

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:05.360
the apparel, can I get a written contract from your dad, Bernard Arnault? And he says, my dad

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.360
will never go back on his word. So you already know what this thing is going, right? You can

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:16.320
spoiler alert, right? He went back on his word. So three months into the deal, I get Anna Winter,

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.800
I say, who should I use for my lawyer? She picks my lawyer for me, right? I just found out even a

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:29.440
couple of days that the lawyer demanded an airplane during negotiations, had nothing to do with me,

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.720
right? They said the Bernard Arnault got freaked out and then Alexander Arnault calls me and says,

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.360
the deal got dropped at the board. I went back and told my high maintenance wife,

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.720
I was supposed to become this designer at Louis Vuitton or the Louis Vuitton group was going

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.600
to back the Kanye West line because that's how good I've done in fashion, babe. And now the deal

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:58.240
has dropped. Now the deal has dropped. So then I did a second collection and we didn't have any

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.840
support to be able to build the collection. Then I went and found and third collection, we did it.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.480
We took over MSG. Fourth collection went and the show started an hour late. Then a week later,

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:20.320
Kim got robbed. Then I told Scooter Braun, my manager at that time, I say, I, I'm looking,

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.440
you know, I need to go to Japan. I'm tired. I'm tired. He says, no, you need to make more money.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.880
I do four more shows on a second leg of the tour and I suffer from exhaustion and go to

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.600
the hospital and then get diagnosed with a disorder. This is the first time I ever suffered

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.440
from exhaustion. By the way, I haven't been to the hospital since. I haven't been to the hospital

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:56.320
since and haven't taken, you know, medication in two years. And I'm sure there'll be people

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.480
in the media, we won't say, we're from, we'll say, well, that's obvious, right? So,

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.320
so right now I'm talking to you, right? I'm not on medication. I just go to sleep, right? I have

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.240
sleep. Have you been able to sleep? This, that's, that's, that's, that's too low hanging fruit for

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.480
you. You're, you're more, you're, I, I, I expect more. I agree. I agree. I agree. That was dumb.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:24.400
I regret it. That's like, that's like, that's like Pierce Morgan trying to grab ratings. Everybody,

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.880
you got a whole life ahead of you. You got a whole life ahead of you. You got these guys

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.640
are at the end of their life. Oh, good. Good. Good. So this story.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:40.320
Call me out of my shit. I love it. But then, amidst that, the same guy that dropped my deal,

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:47.440
Bernardo, I know, goes and hires my best friend, goes and hires my main engineer, right? It would

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.600
have been like them hiring, you know, Elon from Peter, before they figured out Paul,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.520
before they figured out PayPal. But it, it all, Paul, it sounds like, uh, it all,

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.640
Paul sounds like Paul. I just said, cause I'm a Christian. I thought it was cool.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.040
But it would have been like, what if someone could have went in and took Elon away from

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.960
Peter before they pay Paul, before they, I just, cause they pay Paul, before they pay Paul,

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.320
before they, it just too close. It just sounds so fresh. The fact that it's so close, right?

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:25.600
And that's, that's what happened, right? They broke the gang up. And I'm telling you right now,

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.960
that hadn't happened. Virgil's alive. I'm still married. You know what I'm saying? The power

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.560
structure was broken then, right? Because we were building some, Kylie wasn't a billionaire that,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:42.720
you know what I mean? We were building something together that a French colonizer came in

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:51.760
and caught it early and tried to destroy it. But the only thing is God is alive and I'm anointed.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:59.520
And even with those drawbacks, losing my wife, losing my friend, uh, uh, exhaustion, um,

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.000
all of these late night tweets that piss off an entire group, you know, like this,

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:12.240
this, the frustration still there. We work, I work for God and God runs the world and we'll see

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:19.040
what, we'll see what happens. But in those words, don't you feel that being split up?

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.600
Don't you feel you're doing the thing that you stand against, which is playing victim?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:30.720
Aren't you playing victim to the forces in the world? I didn't play, I didn't even get a chance

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.240
to play. I just said I was about to. I said like this, like, no, you played pretty damn well.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.440
What do you mean? What do you mean about to? You're like one of the greatest designers in

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:47.280
history, fashion designers. You're playing. What do you, you are playing. What does that even mean?

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:54.160
I thought you're referring to the tweet. All of them. There's a full set of things that you're

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:01.040
under attack for the tweet and everything beyond that. But like you're, you're blaming,

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:07.920
not blaming, but you're saying that the Jewish media, the Jewish record labels, the Jewish

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.160
people, forget Jewish or not. It doesn't matter. It's playing victim, right?

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:21.520
Ultimately, I am fighting a battle in the spiritual form and anyone that believes in God

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:28.160
and is looking at this interview would agree with that. And I just so happen to be a bright part

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:36.720
of God's army. I'm fighting for us to live. The greatest gift is life itself. I am pro-life.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:44.640
I am pro-God. I believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and died for our sins.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:54.720
What do you feel about another attack, another painful thing? I imagine it's super painful,

01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:03.840
is Balenciaga pulling, you had a really close relationship and friendship with their creative

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:12.000
director. Like how do you feel about all of it? I told you I sang the song. I'll sing another song

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:20.400
from one of my mentors' future. I never felt pain. I didn't felt too much pain. Like there was a day

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:27.120
where I was headed to Nashville to meet with George Farmer, who was the CEO of Parla, the day

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:36.160
when we made the announcement. At that same day, Balenciaga was taking my imagery off of their

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:44.800
site and the drink champs was being taken down. And I said, this is the happiest day of my life.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:53.280
I love cutting the grass low. People wasn't really with you. They was part-time. People switch up

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:59.680
when it's wartime. I'd rather have people who are really with me and that people who are just

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:06.080
trying to use me. Listen, as a friend, somebody cares for you. You have to be really careful.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.600
By the people, by all people always, the people that are going to try to be close to you now,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.680
you don't know if you can trust them. Even more. With the Balenciaga, I have more to say about it

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:29.200
though. Yeah. Let's do this. Dimna will still work for Yay someday. And this is just speeding the

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:36.320
process up. Have you talked? Can you share if you've talked? Yes, I talked to Dimna. We're

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:43.280
Kendrick Spirits. None of this can keep us away from each other. I brought Dimna to Gap to be able

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.400
to bring the best product in the world. At that time, I wanted to go under $100. Now I'm like,

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:58.800
okay, we're going to go $20 a product. I brought Dimna in to engineer. That's why I said engineer

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.640
by Balenciaga, Yeezy Gap engineer by Balenciaga, to engineer the best product for the people. The

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:16.000
people that they say are at the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy need chart, they're at the bottom

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:26.800
of the pyramid. Gap didn't want that. Balenciaga didn't want that. Our genders were not aligned.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:34.480
I was brought in to the Gap for political reasons and influence, like a Virgil, like a George Floyd.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.400
When popular celebrities are brought into Fortune 500 companies, it's not to raise the stock.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:50.320
It's to strengthen the position and influence. And it's definitely not to be out here letting a

01:17:50.320 --> 01:18:02.080
nigga think he's Steve Jobs. Yeah, there's people like that. But you, as a great man and visionary,

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:10.960
your job is to understand that game and be one step ahead. Well, that's why I'm telling them.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.720
That relationship, you know, some relationships only last for a summer.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.480
Yeah. You know, some last for a year, the relationship ran its course. You know,

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.760
in that relationship, I invested a lot of my social capital and actual capital.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.640
I spent somewhere between five to $10 million personally on Balenciaga. How much money do you

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:41.920
think Balenciaga had paid me in the past two years? Just take a really wild guess, a really wild

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:49.600
less than that. Just take a super wild one. Just go to the furthest extent of your imagination.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:03.920
1.2 million. Lower. 500,000. Lower. Zero. Zero. All right. And actually, two weeks ago,

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:12.720
I paid at a Saints account, $862,000, not in clothes for me from Balenciaga, from the store,

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:20.480
in royalties to Balenciaga, where the deal had been engineered, where I was coming out of my

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:31.920
pocket. So I paid, last year, I paid Demna $3 million to design the collection, right? And we

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:39.360
got it out of the Gap Marketing Fund. And he was going to deliver 160 skews or 120 skews.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:48.320
100 skews are separate items of clothing, so styles of clothing. So he ended up delivering

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.120
about 60. I feel like we're on the people's court because we actually are, right? We're in the court

01:19:53.120 --> 01:20:00.720
of public opinion. So he delivered about 60. There were all kinds of people that were working.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:06.640
Part of the reason why I had to give Demna, I wanted to compete with him. I didn't want to

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:13.600
have to get him. When I made Stronger, I did it to compete with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:19.440
because my fiance at that time liked Justin Timberlake just a little bit too much. So I made

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:25.280
it to compete. And then we had the song out. It's number one on Apple. It's blowing up. I play it

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:33.120
in a club and it sounds muddy. It doesn't sound the way Sexy Back sounded in the club. So I go to

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:42.720
Pharrell Williams to do the drums. And it doesn't... It sounds like a different record.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.560
And though it can't be a different record, because I'm like, I'm going to swap it out on radio,

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.760
right? Then I go to Swiss Beats. It sounds like a different record. I go to Timbaland,

01:20:51.760 --> 01:21:02.960
the person who did Sexy Back, and he did it in five minutes and then spent the rest of the hour

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.360
talking about how nobody could have done it, except for him, running around the studio.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.200
I'm the best. No one could have done it. That's why he had to go to me. He had to go to the king.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.880
He had a point, right? He had a point, right? So...

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.080
What makes us so muddy? Is it the beat? It was in the drums. It was some that Timbaland had in

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:28.320
those drums. Like, now, watch this. I said I'm going Def Con 3, right? And the actual...

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.400
I spelled it wrong. I have a tendency to do that. I'm not quite John Legend,

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:40.480
tight sweater level, spelling B level. So I feel a parallel to me going to Timbaland

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.520
to when I said, hey, you as an engineer, I need to work with you as an engineer that is Jewish

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:54.880
to look at these contracts and what my people, not just black people, let's say artists,

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.720
are dealing with in our contracts. These contracts need to be fixed.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.880
Everyone could be so mad at the messenger, right? Yay, you said it the wrong way.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:11.760
You're offensive. You're like Hitler now because you said it. You said this out loud,

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:19.280
but it does not... You weren't getting enough sleep. All this shit does not negate the fact

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:26.240
that we do have Houston, we have a problem. Yeah, but we is just the music industry.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:30.160
Like, there's a lot of hate that was created by just saying that, you know?

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.320
But you're saying what is just, is everything to me, right? Yeah, yeah.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.080
One person can mean everything to me, right? And for George Bush, winning an election was

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.280
everything. And then when you said George Bush doesn't care about black people, that you woke

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:52.480
him up. You woke the people up to the fact that he was narrowly being selfish. There's a sense to

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:57.600
which you're being corrupted by your own greatness. You're focusing too much on the industry that

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:03.680
you've made great, that you've rose to the very top. One of the richest artists in history,

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:10.240
one of the greatest designers... I'm not... I am the richest artist in history. Probably the

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:16.080
richest artist in history. Yeah, I don't... They say... The funny thing is they're like, oh,

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:22.160
rich is black, but it's like, oh, also rich is actor, rich is musician, rich is fashion designer,

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:26.240
like it's a bunch of riches in that one. You know what I'm saying? It's like richer than Ralph

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:32.720
Laurent, like richer than Amani, like richest, like of that, but still low. Because where do

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:39.040
you put that on the totem? Because I don't even want to... Man's bank account is in everything.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:48.160
I would say you and I are equal in a certain deep sense, no matter what the bank account says.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.400
So I wanted to give you some theme music for your moments. It's not a little muddy.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.840
Let me give you the Timberland version. Thank you.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.520
So the other thing about, like say, like Balenciaga is

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.960
Demna will work with Ye someday and

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.760
for Cedric and for Francois Pinot and Salma is a beautiful human being.

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:35.120
Five years from now, you'll hear and know the name Ye and know things that we did

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:43.920
and Balenciaga is not going to make it onto your questions. Would you, as a gambling man,

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.560
would you bet on that? I would bet on that. I can see it in your eyes.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.280
So it was actually a sad day for me, not for me,

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:58.640
but more for Balenciaga. When I heard that, I was just like, oh, shame.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.800
Let me ask you a silly question just about Demna. I read something that you two talked about,

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.440
like buttons for a few hours. They're my gum drop buttons.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.000
Just an added accent. Me and Demna only speaking Shrek.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.640
What's your philosophy with which you approach design? You are one of the great fashion designers

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.320
of our time. How do you think about it? Do you have a philosophy?

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:35.440
You know what I like about the zipper is the zipper, the zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.800
because you could get on your douchebag shit and like unzip it and give it a little bit of

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.880
that type of look. Which is the douchebag?

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.280
The douchebags that go to Vegas unbutton their dress shirt. The problem with the pullover hoodie

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.560
is you can't do the douchebag thing when you unbutton it, but then still get the stomach

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:07.920
because the thing is the ultimate look would be like a military tank pullover hoodie and if you

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.400
get a little hot, you take off the hoodie, but you're like crazy in shape.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.440
So it gives you that flexibility?

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:21.120
Yeah, the zipper is giving some flexibility and it's like maybe you want to keep your jacket

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.800
on. This is considered like a hoodie to be like a jacket. If you want to keep your jacket on, then

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:35.920
you might want to do this as well as pulling it all the way off. It's just comfort, but then you get

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:44.160
can I do a jogging pant on this with elasticity? Now people argue about climate,

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.080
where we are with the climate. I take responsibility as being the most influential

01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:04.240
designer of all time to say we're going to use biodegradable clothing. Now the issue there is

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:16.880
the elastic is not biodegradable. So that means it's actually better to use jeans and a belt

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:23.360
than to have an elastic waistband because elastic waistband is not biodegradable.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:36.720
So I use the planet as a big, the future of the planet is a big piece of the way I engineer

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.680
and the way we talk about where designs are going.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.720
The constraints on your design and engineering is given by the planet, by the future of the planet.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:49.120
Yes. That could almost make Jewish people like me again.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:57.440
Every time you say Jewish people, I think I've been maybe reading a little too much about

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:06.640
Warlord or two, but man, I recommend you listen to some audio books or read some books on the

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:15.440
Holocaust because like it's heavy. It's heavy. It will put into context the impact of your words.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.760
Would you read books on the current Holocaust that Black people are in?

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:29.520
What have you read about abortion? I've read a lot of short form writing and I listened to a lot

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:39.280
of debates because it's really humbling that the question of when does life begin is a really

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.520
difficult question. For me, it is an engineering scientist. It's a philosophical question.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.680
I mean, we could just go on population control, not like if abortion is right or wrong.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:29:00.000
We could say factually, the clinics were made by eugenics for population control and it is

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.400
controlling the population as is the never being given a 40 acres in a mule. So you don't have the

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.760
opportunity and when the people that do have the opportunity are separated from our people,

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.320
our tribe, and placed in suburban communities next to us, Chris Rocker put it, the dentist,

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:24.000
and whitewashed and made to shut the fuck up and vote left or whatever niggers are supposed

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:34.960
to do when we make it. As opposed to saying, okay, we're building schools, we're building up choirs,

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:41.680
we're building up our own leagues, basketball teams, our own factories. We started the first

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:52.160
sportswear factory in America since World War II was actually this factory I put in Cody.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:59.200
So when I'm 45 years old, we're on this journey right now. This is the other thing about this,

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.840
people, just in general, they love me so much. I'm actually a hard guy to really hate for a

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:12.960
long period of time because of my huge cock. That's what I noticed. I didn't understand why

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:19.120
you showed it to me when we first met, but now I understand. It's very nice. Congratulations.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:27.360
I know you don't talk about it, but your hat does say 24. If you run for president,

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.960
what kind of ideas would you represent?

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:43.280
That we're beings with engineering opportunities, I would represent.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:05.120
Just as you served a platform here, there's something that happened on my last run that

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:15.120
I thought, I feel, I know was brilliant. It was noisy, but it was brilliant. I had one rally,

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:23.360
and in the rally, I just let people come up and I gave them a platform. It's our responsibility

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:33.520
to listen to the pain and hear the pain and understand, even when we're the ones that

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:40.160
cause the pain, like with my tweet. It's my responsibility to hear you and understand

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:46.240
why you feel like that, but it's our responsibility as a people to understand each other,

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:58.000
to give people a voice. People need the voice, and even right now, what I'm doing or how God

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:06.000
is using me, I'm showing where our voices are being muted. There's professors that are actually

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.800
intelligent, actually have multiple degrees that have been canceled from their schools,

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:21.440
and they don't have a music industry, or a fan base, or a shoe design, or a smoking hot ex-wife

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:27.120
to complain about. They've just got the truth of what they saw and what they dedicated to this

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:35.440
country and to education that has been muted by schools that have been taken over with an agenda,

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:42.240
and so you want the brightest minds to be these professors, and then you mute them,

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:48.640
and they have nowhere to go, and you might get a guy now that went from being someone's

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:55.600
favorite professor to he's working at Starbucks like he was back in school, or like he was back

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:02.000
in high school. So even if that voice is about anger and hate, it still deserves to be heard?

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:10.160
Yeah, it deserves to be heard, and we deserve to ask why. You have to ask why. I just feel

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:18.880
like that's what's- I feel like that is- sympathize with Mr. Hugecock. I'm just saying that it just

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:26.720
needs to be- You should change that to your name on Twitter while you're still allowed on there.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.840
Yeah, do you think that would get censored? I feel like they definitely cut it down as

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:40.720
of interest. The- I'm pointing out this- I'm pointing out this truth. Now I'm saying this

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:51.120
is not a Christian thing, right? And you know, I wonder right there, when I say these jokes,

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:58.560
is it something that- because I do feel like laughter is the key- engineering and laughter,

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:07.200
right? Is the key to peace. Like when I go get my teeth cleaned and I have the nitrous, there's

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.520
something that I want to go and hug Christian, or I want to go and hug Corey Gamble. I want to go

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:18.800
and hug Howard Stern. No one wants to hug Howard Stern, but you know, just if-

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:25.120
No, no, no, no. Let's- I think- I would love to see you two hug it out and make up, even though all

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.440
the shit talking back and forth. What about talking it out, or is he going to be screaming at me?

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.400
Yeah, judgmental and that kind of stuff. No, I hope- I hope there's love there.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:44.480
You know, the thing is, I think Howard's just jealous. You know, not just- not just jealous of

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:51.040
my cock. He's also- he's jealous that I started my campaign earlier than him.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.480
You gotta let go of that jealousy. You gotta let go of that jealousy, Howard.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.880
Howard and everybody else. Jealous is a natural human thing, man.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:07.760
I wonder just as a Christian, right, when I joke and say this stuff, I- it's like, hmm, am I being

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:19.520
disobedient to God? Because as a boss, right, I'll talk to an employee and I'll be like,

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:26.560
why didn't you just listen? Because I've got the bigger plan, right? So it's like me talking to God,

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:34.400
were there things that I did in this interview that were disobedient to God? And- and for those

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.960
things, I- I pray and I repent for anything that I've said that was disobedient to God.

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.680
Humor is not one of them. Jokings. I feel like humor is the way we avoid so much suffering

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.640
in the world. It's the way to- it's like a catalyst for love. Like it's a way to-

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.920
people that have gone through some of the darkest trauma that I've ever met through war,

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:04.880
I just came back from Ukraine, they're laughing. They're- they're making jokes. That's the best

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:09.840
way to deal with dark times. I don't know what it is about, like humans. I feel like humor,

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.520
that's the best way to social engineer a good future. I think it's humor. Not taking

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.200
shit too seriously. That's the problem with censorship. One of the things that really suffer

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:26.000
is humor. Jokes. Maybe going too far in the jokes. You mentioned Anthony Jocelynik. That guy goes

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.560
hard. That guy goes really hard and it's great. He crosses all- he crosses all the lines and he's-

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.600
that's why he's a genius. And that's what people feel is refreshing when he does it. I don't know

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:41.920
what it is. But then it's like hurtful when I do it. But I'll tell you something that was interesting.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:50.640
I'm pretty sure Anthony doesn't like- sorry for the assumption, but just most comedians I know

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:58.080
didn't vote for Trump. That's interesting. That's saying there aren't comedians that did,

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:01.280
but just the ones I know because I live in California, right? But they have an appreciation

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.160
for Trump because of the sense of humor. Yeah. Gotta ask you about parlor and engineering because

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:13.680
I'm interested about that. Hey man, I'm actually trying to hold it together. You're pretty- you're

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:20.080
pretty offensive towards a lot and- I'm not looking to be offensive. I really want to bring

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.240
people together and get these sales done. I know, but the work- 100% I see your vision.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:30.960
How do we do that? With somebody who care- well, don't say Jewish media and Jewish controlled media.

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:42.640
J.M. Man, you sound- you sound like- it sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.800
that was leading up to the atrocities. Oh, he would say J.M.? Yeah, he was a brand of J.M. That's

01:37:48.800 --> 01:38:02.880
right. No, it's just the implied, like this memified prejudice towards a group in a way

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:08.080
that's going to lead to hate. And I know you don't mean that. I know you have love in your heart.

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.880
That's what I'm trying to- You know what was the prejudice towards a group that led to hate?

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:25.440
BLM. BLM took a black person, showed his death on camera, because okay, there are examples of

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:32.960
us being killed and being killed on camera, but if it was spread on camera, it was done on purpose

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:44.960
by the media, because 14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago every week, and it's not spread that much.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:53.040
They, like you said, singled out a person, directed everything on that person, right,

01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:00.800
as the martyr, and raised the people that hadn't had any- we didn't have our 40 acres of the mule,

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.600
we didn't have, you know, like a lot of things, right? Like that black people have not ever been

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:14.160
given. So once we're given just a little bit, like your life matters, right? Then we literally like,

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:24.640
okay, now we're being hurt, right? But actually, the death toll is up. The city where this happened

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:30.160
is completely been turned to a war zone. They actually, it's actually something like Candace

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:38.480
Owens can actually specify this better, but it's like its own city or something. They made it not

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:44.720
be a part of the actual state or something. It's like DC and stuff. It's like Washington DC now

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:55.840
and stuff, and that has to be from a government. You know, that's got higher level agenda written

01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.360
all over it. Yeah, they're using the death of an individual. Yeah, sure, the media are,

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.720
not the Jewish media, the media, and that's the media is fucked up. That machine

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:16.400
does, takes whatever tragedy and pushes it towards whatever narrative that gets more clicks and views

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.120
and so on. Sure, and then politicians do the same. They use the media to influence the media,

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:32.720
to tell a story. This is a simple thing I put. I believe that the idea of anti-Semitism and

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:47.520
the closeness of the Holocaust is used by certain individuals in media to not take

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:57.040
accountability for the bad things that are happening. What's happening is there's a new

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:04.560
frontier, meaning it used to be okay for somebody to be a billionaire. We thought about a billionaire,

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.880
a lot of times you think of them actually kind of being out of shape, and 20 years ago, 30 years

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.280
ago, like Onassis or something. You thought about a different way. Now you think about a

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:21.120
billionaire. You think about Elon. You think Kim. You think, yay, you think it's a new kind of

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:27.760
billionaire. It's not just Soros is a billionaire. It's a new form of billionaire. Well, right now,

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.240
what I'm calling for the industry is, I'm calling the industry out and saying, hey,

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:41.760
it just so happens that there's been times where I had my lawyer was Jewish, my regular was Jewish,

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:48.880
like eight people that basically would collude and talk without me were in groups saying, okay,

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.160
this is what the tour is going to be. This is this next house, and they were making all these

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.240
decisions, and they're making all this money. And at the end, I was like, I ended my tour,

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.640
and I don't have the money. And it just so happens that that's the case, that what they were. But

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:07.360
what I'm saying is, if everyone can say, hey, you can't point out this fact, or we're going to say

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:13.200
you're anti-Semitic, and we're going to call you Hitler, I feel that there has to be at least

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:22.240
1% of safeguarding the ability to screw the artist based on saying it's anti-Semitic

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:30.320
by pointing out that they just so happen to all be Jewish. And I don't think that's anti-Semitism.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:36.320
I just think that's, hey, this is another thing like, okay, the Kardashians, when you hear that,

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.640
do you think male or do you think female? You think female. You get what I'm saying? You think

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:48.960
this is the realities. This is why rap works, right? They're going to make an anti-women thing

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:55.200
in a second, right? And it's going to say, well, if you point out that these five women, six women,

01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:00.080
are having a meeting on where the Christmas party is, and none of the ballplayers or rappers

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.120
that they have babies with have any say so, so that Christmas happened at Courtney's house

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:10.800
all eight years when I was there. And it never happened at anyone else's black family house,

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:16.960
right? If I'm the one that pointed it out, they just don't have, they don't have their,

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:23.040
or your anti-Semitic word to say, shut the fuck up. Because this is the way it runs and

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:29.360
this is the way we want to do it. If you say that though that women are silencing the black voice,

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.080
yes, you're going to get the same response, but especially if it historically resonates.

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:42.560
But what about the fact that it's true? When you talk in groups, that breeds hate.

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.080
When you talk about individuals, it solves problems. You're an engineering.

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:54.160
Okay, but this is something I pointed out on Pierce. I said, if a black person gets pulled over with a

01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:00.880
car, and it's three other people in the car, they're also going to jail. They're not going to

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:07.040
single them out. They're going to say, you guys are all in collusion. I just described collusion

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:15.520
five times in this interview. And you keep on going back to this is like 1930. This is like this.

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:22.960
This is like that. What I'm saying is look, I want to work with you as an engineer to free

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:31.200
my people. Can we start as a being with engineer opportunities right here? I am sorry to the

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:41.440
people who had to be hurt and affected by that. Now we are here and I'm looking to solve it.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:46.560
But what happens is every time if I talk to any of these business people one by one,

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.440
because mind you, I didn't get to the tweet by not having a conversation. I had the conversations

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:57.120
beforehand before I got to the tweet. Now we're going to take it to the stage. Now we're on the

01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:03.920
world stage, right? And you saw Ari Emanuel do exactly the kind of thing that I was saying had

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:09.680
been done behind closed doors. Now he's doing it in open doors. They told Candice Owens,

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:17.920
I couldn't be on the daily wire. Like you can't even explain yourself and we don't care how you

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:23.600
got to that point either. And that's fucked up. They told Candice you can't be on daily.

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.040
Is that even about... Yes, she did. That's what they said. And you know what? And you can have

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:33.040
my voice raised or lower. I'm going to do it lower, right? Because what's happening to me by

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:42.720
I put it in your words, the media is saying not only can you not explain yourself, we don't care

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:48.160
how you got to that point. You need to apologize and you can't explain. And that's the end of the

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:54.400
story. So just apologize so we can have Mel Gibson do some more films is exactly what Ari Emanuel

01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:00.960
was saying. No one is looking to change the problem that led so many people to that same

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.280
level of frustration. And I just so happened to be the one that's not going to back up on it

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:13.200
until this changes. Because you know what? I'm sorry. I had a sleepy text. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:24.160
for everything. I'm sorry that I put that I was 512 or 511 on Tinder. Okay. My cock is not 14

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.400
inches. I lied. Okay. It's only 13. Yeah. So I'm sorry, right? So the...

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:37.280
Why are you dropping so many facts today? So what I'm saying is, but where do we get to this?

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:44.080
Because even you, as engineering, as intelligent as you are, you just like everyone else that I

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:50.080
say and was colluding won't let us get to the point of fixing it. Yeah. But I'm not, I think you're

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.720
more powerful than the media. I'm not saying you need to apologize because the media I'm saying

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.880
everything we've been talking about just because I care for you and I want you to be

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:04.320
the best possible man you can be. To me, a definition of a great man, I'm with Martin

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.520
Luther King on this. You don't talk about Jews or black people. You talk about engineering.

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:14.080
You talk about humanity. You solve problems. You identify the problems in the world and you don't

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:20.240
come from a place of resentment. This group did this, this, fuck all that. That is in the past.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.560
You just build solutions. I'm going to create a new record label. I'm going to create a new

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:28.400
design firm. I'm going to create a new social network. I'm going to do it better. I'm going to

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.480
do it right. I'm going to do it right by the people that I know don't have a voice. I'm going to

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.680
give them a voice and talk about that. Is it okay to call out collusion? Do people collude in your

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.240
business? Under you? Like the engineers that come together and say, they collude against the bosses,

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.560
right? You know why Bernardo No offered the deal and took it away from me? Collusion.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.880
Because I was too powerful with the collective that I had right there. He had to stop that at all

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:59.600
costs. They said, for whatever reason, this kid, yay, it has the ability to have all of the Kardashians,

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:06.320
Jay-Z and Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Demna, Virgil, all these people in the same room working towards

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:13.280
the same goal. I've been that person since preschool. That's called a leader, right?

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:21.440
And right now, what I'm saying is, hey, for the people in business, whatever their background

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:27.440
is, whether they turn their cell phones off on Friday or not, there's been some bad business

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:33.680
done. There's some bad business practices. And we have to change that because this game is like

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:42.560
boxing. More people end up retarded than rich. And I'm saying like beat to a pulp, driven crazy,

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.960
beat by the media to a pulp. Right now, the media has done everything they could to make me apologize

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.680
and to make me look crazy. And that one person has done anything to find out why I was frustrated

01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:02.320
enough to do that tweet. And that's facts. And that's fucked up. Well, I was hoping to. I am

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.960
finding out. We found out. I mean, but I want solutions. See, there's something about human

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.480
nature where if you focus too much on resentment. We're not focusing on anymore. Fuck the resentment.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.360
We're moving forward. Right. So there's two things I think that are required for. I mean,

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.920
this is how I've lived my life for great engineering. You surround yourself in your

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:28.240
personal life by people you trust. And then in your professional life from the engineering

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:33.680
perspective with the team, with an incredible team, and everything else doesn't matter. That

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:39.040
allows you not to focus on other groups, how they're fucking you over, how they're like trying to

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:43.440
manipulate a collude and all that kind of stuff. You focus on solutions and you find a way around

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.160
all the difficult shit. That's it. If you have people in your life, you can trust.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:53.280
That's like lifelong. You said like some people you're with for the summer,

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:59.440
for a year, find people you can be with for your whole life. Do you have people in your life

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:08.560
that you trust? Like really trust? No, I trust God. At any point, a human being can like,

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:17.440
I could like, if I like go and like, really, you know, treat this guy like a piece of shit or do

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:23.760
this and that, am I supposed to, you know, trust him to be loyal and stay in the situation? No,

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:28.720
I trust people to be people and people are flawed. And people can have the right intentions,

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:35.120
but it only makes sense for us to work together when our agendas align. When Kim was pulled

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:44.160
really far to the left, our agendas no longer, you know, aligned so that made the marriage

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.960
impossible. It aligned where it's like, oh, I could wear a red hat that can help her to get

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:55.360
Alice Johnson out of jail because Trump's willing to do that for my wife because I was the only

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.680
person in my position that stood up and say, wait a second, I like you, you know, because

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:05.120
but isn't there a deeper agenda, the human agenda of just being in love? Like that's just

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:09.600
Paul. What you're talking about, red hat is just politics, right? I mean, the world is becoming

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.000
more and more transactional every day. And actually, marriages are actually, actually

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.880
originally based on transactions, you know, and that's why they're less needed, the more autonomous

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:24.000
as we come, or the world makes it less needed. I feel like we do need each other. I feel like we

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.680
do need someone we can always, you know, count on. It's like, I'm yay, pulled away by King Koopa,

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:37.120
which is the media, the politics, the promise, oh, we're going to keep you safe. So the thing,

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:43.840
the reason why I get, you know, really frustrated with Chris Jenner is she says losing Rob Kardashian

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:49.520
was the greatest mistake of her life, but she never gave Kim's hand over in marriage,

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:56.000
because this is the bottom line. When me and Kim met, we were millionaires or whatever, right?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:02.320
You're telling me you just hand her hand over in marriage that your daughter's not successful,

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:08.000
handing your hand over in marriage to, but no, she had to still be the husband to all of her

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.520
daughters. And we see what the results are consistently. So that's where I get, you know,

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:22.880
frustrated. It's like, let that go. Let this person do what you made mistakes on. Don't make

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.960
this person relive those same mistakes and then put that agenda into my daughters too.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:34.640
Is there somebody in your life close to you that you trust enough to call you out on your

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:42.560
bullshit? We're all full of shit sometimes. What's my bullshit? Well, some of it I pointed out today,

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:46.560
but I don't know you deeply enough. What was the bullshit? Jewish media, Jewish...

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.200
That's not bullshit. The bullshit is that the Jewish media won't admit...

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:56.320
Your dad was right. Your dad was right. The words you used, you weren't...

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:00.080
And I said it, you're not going to make me say it 800 more times.

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:04.640
I don't know if you resonate it, because you keep saying like the words...

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:09.040
Did it resonate to y'all that y'all ain't do nothing about it? And that all y'all want to do

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:14.720
is have somebody apologize and sweep under the rug your bullshit that you've been doing the whole

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:21.440
time. You want the same bullshit as the other people. So you're doing the same thing that the

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:26.480
other, let's say, media, because I'm not allowed to say, has done. So until somebody says...

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:32.800
Which is what, man? Which is what? I'm trying to call you out on your bullshit because I hope

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:35.760
I'm somebody you can trust. That's it. I don't fucking trust you.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.920
Well, you should find people in your life you can trust. Don't tell me what I should do.

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:48.720
I'm not one of your BLM marchers. Listen, I'm with you on the BLM. A lot of organizations

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.320
use tragedy. And I watched the Candice Owens documentary.

01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:00.640
And what was your take on it? I think it's important to question the mainstream narratives,

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:09.120
but I don't agree with it. I still believe that George Floyd died from the knee of the cop,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.400
not from fentanyl. And even if that was the case, there's still 50% of Black deaths is actually

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:24.400
abortion. So let's get into engineering. Let's just go... How do you fix that?

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:33.680
Population control is social engineering and its most literal form. The Blacks that are under

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.480
population control, that's something that... I mean, that's just what it is.

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:42.960
African Americans are not choosing to get at the abortion. I mean, it's a choice. It's an individual

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:48.800
choice. But we're being influenced to. Well, then speak to the community and help. I mean,

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:54.800
I don't know what the engineering solutions there are. It could be you're doing that in part

01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.080
by speaking to the value and the power of family. Well, watch this. I was building

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:10.640
shelters. I bought land in Calabasas. I bought two ranches in Wyoming, 300 acres in Calabasas,

01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.160
12,000 acres in total in Wyoming. And I started building ideas for shelters.

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:24.400
And God set it on my heart to make monasteries, which would be modern day facilities that don't

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:33.920
turn people down, that have farms, that have shelter, clothing. But first of all, water.

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:40.560
First of all, knowledge, because knowledge is the most important resource to our species

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:47.120
above water. Knowledge, it's itself. Because then you can go get water. I mean, you can argue like

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:53.200
if you're a baby, how do you go out? But the baby doesn't have it. So someone with the knowledge

01:55:53.200 --> 01:56:03.760
then feeds the baby the water. But it's important that those with the knowledge teach the baby

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:10.160
how to find the water themselves. And the business people that I've been dealing with

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:16.000
have been keeping the baby sick by not sharing the information and the knowledge

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.360
with inside of those contracts. My people are sick. If I load up

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:30.400
Apple Music right now, and I play the top songs in the rap chart, I would tell you my people

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:38.080
are sick. If I go to the restaurants in opportunity zones, and we look at the calorie rating and the

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:45.440
cholesterol, I would tell you that my people are sick. If we look at the obesity rate, if you go to

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.520
just a restaurant somewhere in middle America, Denny's or something, I went to Denny's the other

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:57.280
day, you will see that my people are sick and my people meaning all people. But black people are

01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:05.280
very influential to all people. So if the media picks an overweight black woman and says,

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:14.080
this is body goals, then the media are influencing my people to stay sick. And it just so happens

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:24.960
that that night, I was so frustrated after 20 years that I had to call it out in one tweet

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:32.000
that now, even if I say, hey, okay, I was frustrated for these reasons, now it's not good enough.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.120
You've literally tried to make me re-apologize 10 times in this meeting,

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:43.520
resay this, resay that, but it doesn't change the fact that my people are sick. And I'm the only

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:50.080
person in my position that will say that my people are sick. Today, not 30 years ago, not 60 years,

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.400
my people are sick today. 50% of my peoples of deaths are abortion today. My people don't have

01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:02.560
the opportunities today, even to the point that because if J.P. Morgan had been nice to me and

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.640
if Alex Klein and STEM player had been fair to me, different things, then I wouldn't even point

01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:12.320
it out that we don't have any black, we have two black engineers. So I have to have a responsibility

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:21.600
obviously to all people, but specifically to my tribe, because tribes move. Tribalism is real

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:27.760
with black people to separate the brightest from the tribe or to separate the leaders. It is factual

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:33.280
that the CIA removed the leaders from the black community, put crack in the communities, put

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.200
guns in the communities, and locked up all the leaders and called them gang leaders, right?

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:42.800
Locked up all the leaders, locked up all the fathers. Now 72% of black mothers are raising

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:50.000
children by themselves. This is an agenda like a Tuskegee experiment set on my people, right?

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.360
And what I'm calling out for the black people in entertainment is, what are we doing? We have to

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:03.520
collude. And if we don't collude, because even if I said, hey, I'd like to make a company that's all

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:10.080
black, right? Is that okay for me to say? Is that okay for me to say? Or is that anti-Semitic?

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:16.720
See, if I hadn't crossed the line so far, then that would have sounded anti-Semitic. Now I've

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:22.800
stretched a bit, so now we can go to, okay, let's make an all black company. But that would have

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:28.000
been anti-Semitic. Just that concept, because you could word that in a different way that would

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.160
sound anti-Semitic. I don't know, man. No, no, listen, if you were, if I said I didn't want to have the

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:39.840
Jewish people in the company, would that be anti-Semitic? It would sound like it, right? You'd

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:45.200
say I'm from 1930s, right? Yeah. But for me as a tribe to say, no, I want an all black company,

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:50.640
right? I'm generally against that kind of thing. But first of all, you have the right to do whatever

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:56.640
the hell you want. Well, what I'm saying is that's what I feel may need to happen for my people to

01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:02.880
have power again, because when my people have been left under the media's control, we've been made

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:08.240
sick. We've been allowed to be sick. We've been, and we're promoting sickness. I think, at least in

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:15.040
the engineering realm, I haven't met an engineer who happens to be black who would like to be called

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:20.640
a black engineer. And when you have a company of all black people that are engineers, I don't know

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:28.240
the creative arts, I apologize. But engineering, they really tried to look at each other's humans

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:33.600
and look at the problem. And you want to know, you want to have the confidence that everybody on the

02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:44.240
team is the best possible person for the job. What I can say is the world is sick. And I have

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:53.280
slight images of utopia, slight images of happiness, slight images as a visionary and a creator.

02:00:54.240 --> 02:01:02.400
And I know for a fact, the way that business deals have been done for me are keeping the world sick.

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:12.400
Fix them. I see that's what you're trying to do. And you probably listen, people should not doubt

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:19.360
you. But I got to tell you, I have to be honest. This is silly because you don't know me.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.880
But it hurt when you say you don't trust me. You kind of lost me. I don't think anyone's ever said

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:34.720
that to me. I don't know, man. Fuck that. I don't care about views or clickbait or any of that bullshit.

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:41.280
I just thought you were one of the greatest artists ever. It'd be cool to talk to you.

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:46.160
And I feel like you got pain you're working through. And never had anyone say that to me.

02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.440
I'm just being a mess about it, I guess. It's fucked up though. But maybe it's not.

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:54.240
Maybe you shouldn't trust it, but I just haven't had that experience.

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.880
Yeah. Do you think I would trust anybody at this point in my life?

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:06.480
Yeah, it's tough. It's tough. I hear you. And it's also kind of good to see how much strength you got.

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:10.320
You're not broken by any of this. You're under a lot of attack.

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:18.080
A lot of attack by a lot of people. You have a vision and you're trying to feel your way through

02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:23.680
it. And you might get destroyed for it. That's the human, that's the risk you take.

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.040
It's a wonderful life though. What do you hope your legacy is?

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:32.800
To be forgotten. Do you think you'd be forgotten?

02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:40.560
Because the memory, there's ego and memory in the memories. Who designed the sidewalk?

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:46.720
Who designed the water fountain? Who designed the stop sign? Who designed the stop light?

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.920
These things are so ubiquitous that the person that designed them is forgotten.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:03:00.960
If it's a good idea, it's a God idea. And I don't know, VCs can own it.

02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:09.360
So you want your designs in all rounds of life to be so simple that they

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:17.440
permeate everything. They take over. And you're forgotten. That's a successful design.

02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:18.960
Is you're forgotten? Yes.

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.560
Do you have advice for people? A lot, a lot, a lot of young people look up to you.

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.520
Do you have advice for young people of how to live a life they can be proud of?

02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:33.920
Don't tweet while you're sleepy.

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:35.680
Take a nap?

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.080
Surely there's other things. I love the humor. Don't take it seriously, I suppose.

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.800
That's what that means.

02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:52.240
We don't send sleepy tweets unless you buy your own social platform the very next week

02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:57.040
called Parler. But other than that, if you're not going to buy your own social platform,

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:02.560
is that why you bought Parlers so you could be sleepy and send messages out into the world?

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.760
I actually am really interested in the engineering aspects of Parler. Is there a vision there?

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:10.080
Because I'm also super interested in Elon by Twitter.

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:20.880
I like Instagram better than Twitter. And I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg liked Instagram better than

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:27.040
Facebook or saw how valuable that was and he bought it.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.880
So you'd like to take Parler or something, whatever is the magic that makes Instagram work,

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:31.840
you want to push there?

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.440
I thought it was interesting how it felt like Snapchat made the Kardashians bully Instagram.

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.640
What's the point of Snapchat going to war on Instagram?

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.600
Yeah, I mean, just everyone wants to say, well, this is our value, Snapchat.

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.320
No one wants to lose their value to someone else's value, whatever.

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:56.400
And everything is just, what's the difference between permanent and temporary?

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:03.680
Is this a permanent structure? And until God says it's not, it's like nothing's permanent.

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:07.920
Our life is not permanent. So how do we just let go of those things?

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.960
Even like going from the name Kanye West to Yay was the beginning of just letting go

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:18.960
of some things, of these titles. Like we need to remove the titles like, hey,

02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:27.920
if I have to leave Adidas and I have to go next computers, that may take me out of the

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:35.680
billionaire standing all together. And I got to get low for having long God says I have to get low

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:43.600
and refocus. I've been reshaping, refocusing my staff. I had some people that were good

02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:48.240
and I had some people that weren't. I had too many people and I've got a vision inside of me.

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:52.960
And I'm like, this is how I make this vision. I have to bring this vision to life.

02:05:54.080 --> 02:06:01.200
I have to bring these houses to life. I was talking to one of our architects on,

02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:07.280
you know, we're actually getting close on it. I've like built it a few times. I had like the

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:16.240
domes you probably saw and I said, you know, how we transform Kim's house and we're getting there.

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:21.680
So you want to get into architecture? Like you really want this to become physical reality?

02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:25.280
Yes. And I've got close. Rome wasn't built to the day.

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:29.520
Yeah, but Rome had to start somewhere. I got to call you out on the advice.

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:33.360
There really is a lot of people that look up to you and you've lived a really difficult life

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:39.680
and you made it through all of it. What do you advise them to do?

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:48.240
Do everything that you feel. Even if you are told that it's the wrong thing. No, no, no, no, no,

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:54.480
no, but not anything violent. So do what you feel. Say what you feel. Like trust your heart.

02:06:54.560 --> 02:07:01.120
Yeah, trust your gut. Trust your instincts because that instinct is who God made you to be.

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:06.960
Not, you know, what lines up with your like frat brothers or what lines up with

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.080
what your dad wanted or what lines up with your classmates or, you know, it's just

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.320
God has something inside of you and when you walk down the street, you're thinking about it

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:22.720
and then you just see it in the window and you go down another street and you see the same thing

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:27.280
or you're thinking about a number and that number pops up or you see it on a license plate and that's

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:38.560
just, you know, something is trying to say be the maximum. Yay. You know, be the maximum you

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:48.000
and God won't give you anything that you can't handle. So for me, everything is a yes. I think

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.960
they say be like water. I know Bruce Lee said that or a matter of fact, just be

02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:00.640
because we are beings with engineering opportunities.

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:09.200
Beautifully put. Yay. I have hope. I have faith that however this turns out that

02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:14.800
you have the skill and the capacity to really add love to the world and I hope you do that.

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:20.640
I really, really hope you do that and we talked about the tension of that, the challenges and

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:27.200
the opportunities of that. I mean, I see how we could be of use to each other. You actually have

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:33.840
a particular thing for me as I eject from media because even also, you know, I'm really big at

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:39.520
like, you know, burning the Phoenix too. All you know as an engineer that your cells completely

02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:46.160
regenerate every seven years. I think I rushed the process a little bit. So I run around looking

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:52.560
like a burn victim sometimes. Yeah. But I gotta tell you, anyone I am close with, I work with,

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:57.680
there has to be trust, there has to be love and I think you've been burned quite a bit in your life.

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:02.240
Sometimes I did it myself. I put my hand on the stove.

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:09.600
Love. So how do we get to engineering? There's a deal to be done here. Not saying you're making

02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.200
this money off of that. I'm making that money off. I don't care about money, by the way.

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:20.880
Same twins. So there's dealings here. You got pain, I got pain, but we're beings with

02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:25.600
engineering opportunities. For a long time, I thought somebody should create a new social network

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:32.160
and it looks like great engineering could do that. You got two at one time from two of your

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.880
homeboys at one time. Yeah. And that's a great way. I mean, every, you know, it can be done from

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:42.880
scratch or it can be done anew with an already established platform. Yeah. I'm very excited

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:50.080
by that possibility. Parler is smaller. Twitter is larger. I wonder whether you can do any kind of

02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.560
revolutionary engineering with a large company. If anyone can, I would say it's Elon.

02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:01.760
Well, Elon can look at what we do over here. That's why I like, God does this a lot of times.

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:09.760
He creates doppelgangers. There's a lot of examples where theory happened two places at

02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.800
one time. A really similar type of personality happens at one time.

02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:18.800
It's weird. It's beautiful. It's hilarious, actually. It's kind of humorous.

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:27.680
So we should just share every piece of information together as I go build

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:33.760
Parler and as he builds up Twitter and see how to make both those better. But I'll be like,

02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:40.560
hey, I'm not going to let Snapchat bully me out of adding something to it that's best. It should

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:50.640
just be the best platform possible. That means TikTok has amazing features.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:56.240
Twitter has amazing things about it. I know this girl that's like, I like Instagram better than

02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:01.600
Twitter. She likes that Twitter has porn. But other than that, Instagram. But I was like,

02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:07.280
Instagram is porn also. It's soft. It's more subtle. It's not telling you. It's not

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:11.040
it's not conservative by any means.

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.040
And that's the thing. You have to please a lot of people with these platforms.

02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.960
And I think the goal of a platform should be to help individuals

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:32.240
maximize their long-term happiness and growth, like intellectually, spiritually,

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:35.520
psychologically, all of that. And it's a tricky thing to figure out how to do that.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:39.680
Of course, you could just have a platform that's just strictly for fun. I think that's

02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:46.560
where TikTok leans. But there has, I think there's a balance to strike. Like Twitter,

02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:50.240
there's a lot of intellectual philosophical stuff going on on Twitter, but it somehow

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:55.200
currently makes it too easy to be divisive and hateful towards each other and cancel and all

02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.080
that kind of stuff. I think we need to have these healthy conversations. That's what it is,

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:06.160
healthy conversations, healthy dialogues. That's the biggest thing. Like when I first wore the red

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:14.640
hat, the conversation is less healthy than it is today. The conversation about George Floyd,

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.600
you know, it's like, did I send the tweet the right way? Did his Candace Owens documentary

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:28.480
perfect? Is it Michael Moore? Is that documentary a perfect century self? Is it fully accurate?

02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:36.000
You know, it's two to three hours of a transmit of information through a particular, usually one

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.320
person's view. And anything you want to research, if you're interested in it,

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:50.560
you got to look at 10 versions of it, 20 versions of it. George Floyd, we've looked at one version

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:58.640
of that. Now we have a second. Well, by the time we get to the, you know, I know this is like,

02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.880
it's not my last hoodie, but it's definitely not my first hoodie that I put on. You know,

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:12.400
it's like, that's how we got to, like even this particular size of zipper or the fact that, you

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:19.120
know, for people who know, they know that that's like car heart, even though the car heart tag

02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.720
isn't there anymore, you just know by the shape of it, you feel it. So it abstracts, it takes into

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:31.520
like this Cubist place, like Picasso, Matisse, or African Cubism, or Dire Straits Money for nothing,

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:37.600
and your chicks for free. Look at that. I wouldn't think you'd reference Dire Straits. Look at you.

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:43.280
That video. Yeah, I know. It's a great video. Your encyclopedic knowledge of music is great.

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:51.520
I think that, you know, porn is not just sexual. That term actually relates to torture. Like,

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:56.320
you know what I'm saying? Like watching people beat each other up on, on Worldstar or something,

02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:01.680
you know, it's like, that's called torture porn. There's also food porn. How do you explain that?

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.880
What's food porn? Food porn is like looking at really delicious cakes and cookies and steak and so

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:12.000
on. And you're like, holy shit. Exactly. Architecture. Like this people who love architecture,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.200
when they see architecture, I know, I got friends that would be like, oh, that's porn.

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:18.720
Yeah. Architecture. Yeah. Yeah, it's like,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:27.040
that's like love, like dopamine fueled love for a thing. Yeah, we need, that's beautiful. I think

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:34.000
that's beautiful. Well, I think as long as nobody's getting hurt. The intoxication that people have,

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:39.360
you know, the worst part is like, when one person's in love and the other person's in like,

02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:46.880
that's us right now. Well, who's in like? No, because you said you love Bill Maher and you like me.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:55.600
And I love you. So that was, no, I actually love you both. All right. All right. And the funny thing

02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:10.640
is like, as a visionary, visionaries are more extreme than business people. Because a visionary

02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:17.440
would do bad business for their vision. A business person will never do bad business.

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.080
It's well put. Yeah, it's really well put. So when you say I don't care about money, it's like,

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.800
yeah, I feel you. Like I feel that I care in a way that I need that. But

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:42.560
I care about the vision that I have to a Steve Jobs level to the point of putting that above

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:49.840
my regular human existence, meaning having to go and take all the arrows,

02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:58.480
that I become a soldier of the vision. Because someone could say, a wife could say to,

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:06.960
like say, like in the 60s, their husband's about to go to war. The wife may not want

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:14.960
their husband to go to war because of their children. But he's going to war

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:18.720
because of their children.

02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:24.960
Definitely. Do you regret any aspect of just giving everything to your vision?

02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:29.200
I mean, you've spoken about that saying like, I got fucked over in the business side.

02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:34.640
I promise that I had to stop envying

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:49.760
cool people at their current cool time. If anything, if someone's cool, and I say their name a lot,

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:58.640
I'm going to flash the light on them so much that it ages their coolness. It's actually a war

02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:09.040
technique, showered in compliments. Because to be able to stay at 45 years old is still

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:16.080
be the bad kid in class. At 45, I'm still in the principal's office. Because if you look at,

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:21.760
like say fashion, right? If you think of something fashionable, it's probably going to look like the

02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:27.520
kid in the principal's office. That's going to be the fashion. And that's part of the reason why

02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:34.640
I'm the most influential person at fashion. And fashion because I refuse to leave the principal's

02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:40.000
office. If the substitute teacher comes in, I'm going to say, you got a big butt.

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:46.960
Yeah. Right back to the principal's office. And people are going to be like, yo.

02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:53.360
And that's what you keep on saying. Like, who can we talk to? Because no one can talk to me.

02:17:54.080 --> 02:18:03.280
No, I'm out of control, bro. It's just God, then me, and then fuck everybody. That's

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.360
really how I live my life. And I just want to say this one thing about the children thing,

02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:11.760
I wanted to put that point together, put that idea together that I don't like the word point.

02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:16.080
I'm really big on words, words being powerful, says the person with the sleepy tweet.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.040
You're full of contradictions.

02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.440
Yeah. I'm a human being, right? It's like, some days I'm like, I could go 30 days and be sullable.

02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:32.240
You know, like really like I'm a monk. I'm being like faithful to God. And then I'll go like working

02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:36.800
out. No carbs. Like my weight will fluctuate. And I'll have times I'm like, I don't feel like

02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:42.160
being told what to do. So I don't want to work out with a trainer. And I just want to drink this

02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:50.080
Hennessy. But I want to say this thing that I will text to Kim sometimes. I'll say, you may not

02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:58.240
understand what I'm doing right now, but you will. And that's what I would say to everyone.

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:04.560
You may not understand what I'm doing. And this gives a little bit, maybe we're like 20% there,

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:07.680
but there's still going to be people, we leave this interview and they were like,

02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:13.440
I still don't like the way you apologize. I still don't want to say what my involvement would have

02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:17.920
been to make him lead them to that point. And we just want things to be how they are. There's

02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:23.360
people in the world who want the world to stay as it is. And there's people who want to change the

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:29.680
world. And that's happened throughout time. They say that with Da Vinci halfway into a conversation,

02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.880
he could not suffer fools so much that he would walk away halfway into the conversation.

02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:44.800
And I said, well, that's why it's the Da Vinci code and not the Da Vinci world. And every time

02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:52.400
I go and piss off a group of people or do these things, on some end, it's like I could be turning

02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:59.440
my thing from a potential world vision to a code, or I could be opening up conversations with new

02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:07.200
friends that I may trust someday. That's beautiful. Because the change you will have on the world,

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:14.080
that you don't know for sure, but it'll happen across years, even decades. So you have to think

02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:18.880
in the future. Like you're working in the future. Your actions are working in the future. And a

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:23.280
lot of people will judge this conversation and others you've done and so on in the present. And

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:27.920
that doesn't matter. You know why I apologize? Why I say I'm sorry to the Jewish people that I hurt?

02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:37.200
It's not about, like I said, I'm not going to hold this apology hostage. Obviously it's about God,

02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:42.800
but God is everything. So what's the point of even having language and you can't engineer if you say

02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:51.280
God, God, God. God asks us to be judgmental so that you become a fewer doctor. It's your judgment

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:57.680
that saves grandma. And God puts that in this. We have God inside us. We're a piece of God.

02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:05.760
Also, right? So I'm going to go specific to a person. That story about Da Vinci alone

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:12.880
is enough of a reason for me to give a sincere apology to the Jewish people. Because I do believe

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.480
that there's a Da Vinci code inside of all of my misspellings and scribbles right here

02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:29.200
that God wants me to get to the world. And when I'm in my way, if God has set something on me,

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:33.600
when I'm in my way, I'm in God's way. Now I can point at other people and say, Hey,

02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:39.120
you guys are in God's way because you're not listening to me. But if I'm in my way,

02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:45.280
I'm not listening to God. And for me to be a philosopher and a leader or whatever other language,

02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:52.880
I have to listen to God. So before God, what I would do is start off as a samurai and say,

02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:57.920
I'm sorry for hurting you as a Jewish person. I'm sorry for the way that made you feel.

02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:06.000
And I'm sorry for the entire population of a race that I feel is actually my brothers because I

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:11.520
classify and feel that I'm also connected with Christ in that way, that my people came from

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:17.760
Africa in that way. And I can't say it's this exact teaching or that exact teaching, but I feel

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:22.720
that there's an important, you know, the sons of Abraham, however we want to word it, right,

02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:28.400
for us to come together and bring our different talents together to serve God collectively.

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:37.200
And he, as much of an alien as I am, he does not call for me to alienate. And that's what

02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:44.080
the problem has been, especially in politics and in America. He plays America as the TV,

02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:49.120
as the radio to the world. We invented rock and roll, right? We are the influencers of the rest

02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:55.120
of the planet. We're the youngest startup in history, right? We're the youngest country,

02:22:55.120 --> 02:23:00.880
we're the youngest superpower, right? So for me in my position, the fact that I can talk to

02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:05.440
Trump one day and be at a game with Kim Kardashian the next day and then be

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:12.560
at Paris Fashion Week, they don't want me to be involved with language of decisive,

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:20.320
divisive language, you know, proving that I can be just as racist as a racist white person.

02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:26.480
Oh, I can, I can be a racist black person also. That's not what God has called me to do. So how

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:35.040
do I simplify and say, hey, to you as a visionary, as a, as an engineer, as a person that's giving

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:40.960
me a platform that as my brother, I want to apologize to you for how that made you feel

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:47.040
and to the rest of the people that carry specifically that pain, not the pain that I

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:51.120
talk about. That doesn't seem to be as much of a pain for people when I talk about

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.280
the abortion clinics and stuff. That's, it's like, that's the argued pain even in my own community.

02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:03.840
Like not everyone thinks that's a pain, but for the Jewish community, it's collectively this was

02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:11.440
a pain and I've gone, I've gone so far just psychologically on this journey since that

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:17.200
statement had happened where I didn't want to like give up the candy in my pocket. I didn't

02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.920
want to say, Hey, I stuck my hand, my hand in the candy jar. I wanted to defend my freedom of

02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:27.680
speech. I wanted this, but even with freedom of speech, pain is pain. Causing people to hurt

02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:34.080
is not helping. Causing people to hurt is not helping. So that means I have to take a more

02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:41.760
sophisticated approach to engineering this problem. This problem is the opportunity.

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:49.680
And yes, that what could some people may deem as a mistake, would it be more genuine if I called

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:58.000
it a mistake? I think I would be hypocritical by calling a mistake with the ending of that,

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.240
the idea I'm going to say out loud. So I, I'm not, I don't try to be a hypocrite on purpose.

02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:13.200
So, but I will call it a mistake to add a genuine, to be genuine about the feeling with that mistake

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:23.440
with me as a human being, not to justify, but I have to state that God makes no mistakes,

02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:29.120
because if I hadn't made that mistake, I wouldn't be in front of you today. And that's not to justify

02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:37.920
this sleepy text, but I can tell you're a man that has love in his heart. And I hear that,

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:43.200
I hear it through the words explicitly and implicitly. And I think if we're to engineer a

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:50.000
better future, the way to do that is with love. So as one human to another, I love you, brother.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:56.160
Thank you for talking today. This is great. I like you too. Son of a bitch.

02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:05.920
