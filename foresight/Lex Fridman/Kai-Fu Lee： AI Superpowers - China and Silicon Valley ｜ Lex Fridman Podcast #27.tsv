0	2960	The following is a conversation with Kai-Fu Li.
2960	6480	He's the chairman and CEO of Sinovation Ventures
6480	10480	that manages a $2 billion dual currency investment fund
10480	14800	with a focus on developing the next generation of Chinese high-tech companies.
15440	17840	He's the former president of Google China
17840	21680	and the founder of what is now called Microsoft Research Asia,
21680	26560	an institute that trained many of the artificial intelligence leaders in China,
26560	33600	including CTOs or AI execs at Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, Lenovo, and Huawei.
34720	40000	He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine.
40560	44880	He's the author of seven best-selling books in Chinese and most recently
44880	48800	the New York Times bestseller called AI Superpowers,
48800	51760	China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.
52720	57600	He has unparalleled experience in working across major tech companies
57600	59920	and governments on applications of AI,
59920	64880	and so he has a unique perspective on global innovation in the future of AI
64880	67920	that I think is important to listen to and think about.
68880	71840	This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

80880	84560	And now here's my conversation with Kaifu Li.
85920	89280	I immigrated from Russia to U.S. when I was 13.
89280	91600	You immigrated to U.S. at about the same age.
92320	95840	The Russian people, the American people, the Chinese people,
95840	101280	each have a certain soul, a spirit that permeates throughout the generations.
102000	105040	So maybe it's a little bit of a poetic question,
105040	110960	but could you describe your sense of what defines the Chinese soul?
111920	116000	I think the Chinese soul of people today, right?
116000	121920	We're talking about people who have had centuries of burden
121920	125120	because of the poverty that the country has gone through
125120	130400	and suddenly shined with hope of prosperity
130400	133280	in the past 40 years as China opened up
133360	135120	and embraced market economy.
136320	140960	And undoubtedly, there are two sets of pressures on the people,
141600	147920	that of the tradition, that of facing difficult situations,
147920	153760	and that of hope of wanting to be the first to become successful and wealthy.
153760	158240	So that's a very strong hunger and a strong desire
158240	161040	and strong work ethic that drives China forward.
161040	163840	And is there roots to not just this generation,
163840	169920	but before that's deeper than just the new economic developments?
169920	174560	Is there something that's unique to China that you could speak to that's in the people?
175840	182000	Well, the Chinese tradition is about excellence, dedication, and results.
182560	187120	And the Chinese exams and study subjects in schools
187120	190720	have traditionally started from memorizing 10,000 characters.
191040	193440	Not an easy task to start with.
193440	198960	And further by memorizing historic philosophers' literature poetry.
198960	204160	So it really is probably the strongest road learning mechanism
204160	208800	created to make sure people had good memory and remembered things extremely well.
210080	215840	That, I think, at the same time suppresses the breakthrough innovation
216160	221840	and also enhances the speed execution, get results.
222480	226720	And that, I think, characterizes the historic basis of China.
227280	230640	That's interesting because there's echoes of that in Russian education as well,
230640	231920	as rote memorization.
231920	233760	So you memorize a lot of poetry.
233760	238400	I mean, there's just an emphasis on perfection in all forms
239200	243520	that's not conducive to perhaps what you're speaking to, which is creativity.
243520	248720	But you think that kind of education holds back the innovative spirit
248720	250320	that you might see in the United States?
250880	256400	Well, it holds back the breakthrough innovative spirits that we see in the United States.
256400	261840	But it does not hold back the valuable execution-oriented,
261840	267200	result-oriented value-creating engines, which we see China being very successful.
267920	274720	So is there a difference between a Chinese AI engineer today and an American AI engineer,
274720	276960	perhaps rooted in the culture that we just talked about,
276960	281040	or the education, or the very soul of the people, or no?
281040	284560	And what would your advice be to each if there's a difference?
285440	288560	Well, there's a lot that's similar because AI is about
289840	294800	mastering sciences, about using known technologies and trying new things.
294800	300320	But it's also about picking from many parts of possible networks to use
300320	302960	and different types of parameters to tune.
302960	305360	And that part is somewhat rote.
305360	310160	And it is also, as anyone who's built AI products can tell you,
310160	315200	a lot about cleansing the data, because AI runs better with more data.
315200	322400	And data is generally unstructured, errorful, and unclean.
322400	325520	And the effort to clean the data is immense.
326320	332720	So I think the better part of the American AI engineering process
333280	337200	is to try new things, to do things people haven't done before,
337920	342320	and to use technology to solve most, if not all, problems.
343280	347120	So to make the algorithm work, despite not so great data,
347120	349840	find error-tolerant ways to deal with the data.
350560	356960	The Chinese way would be to basically enumerate, to the fullest extent,
356960	362240	all the possible ways by a lot of machines, try lots of different ways to get it to work,
362240	367600	and spend a lot of resources and money and time cleaning up data.
367600	372880	That means the AI engineer may be writing data cleansing algorithms,
372880	379040	working with thousands of people who label or correct or do things with the data.
379040	383840	That is the incredible hard work that might lead to better results.
383840	388880	So the Chinese engineer would rely on and ask for more and more and more data,
388880	392400	and find ways to cleanse them and make them work in the system,
392400	399440	and probably less time thinking about new algorithms that can overcome data or other issues.
399440	400720	So where's your intuition?
400720	404080	What do you think the biggest impact in the next 10 years lies?
404080	412320	Is it in some breakthrough algorithms or is it in just this at scale rigor,
413040	418320	a rigorous approach to data, cleaning data, organizing data onto the same algorithms?
418320	421680	What do you think the big impact in the applied world is?
422480	426800	Well, if you're really in the company and you have to deliver results,
426800	432160	using known techniques and enhancing data seems like the more expedient approach.
432160	437120	That's very low risk and likely to generate better and better results.
437120	439840	And that's why the Chinese approach has done quite well.
440480	447440	Now, there are a lot of more challenging startups and problems, such as autonomous vehicles,
448400	453200	medical diagnosis, that existing algorithms may probably won't solve.
454240	458640	And that would put the Chinese approach more challenged
458640	465360	and give them more breakthrough innovation approach, more of an edge on those kinds of problems.
465360	466960	So let me talk to that a little more.
466960	472800	So my intuition, personally, is that data can take us extremely far.
473600	476320	So you brought up autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis.
476320	482960	So your intuition is that huge amounts of data might not be able to completely help us solve that problem.
483920	488000	Right. So breaking that down further in autonomous vehicle,
488000	493040	I think huge amounts of data probably will solve trucks driving on highways,
493040	495520	which will deliver significant value.
495520	497760	And China will probably lead in that.
499280	505680	And full L5 autonomous is likely to require new technologies we don't yet know.
506240	510320	And that might require academia and great industrial research,
510320	512400	both innovating and working together.
512400	514720	And in that case, US has an advantage.
515200	519280	So the interesting question there is, I don't know if you're familiar on the autonomous vehicle
519280	525520	space and the developments with Tesla and Elon Musk, where they are, in fact,
526480	534240	a full steam ahead into this mysterious complex world of full autonomy, L5, L4, L5,
535120	538720	and they're trying to solve that purely with data.
538720	542000	So the same kind of thing that you're saying is just for highway,
542000	544560	which is what a lot of people share your intuition.
545360	547120	They're trying to solve with data.
547120	549280	It's just to linger on that moment further.
549280	552480	Do you think possible for them to achieve success
553520	557840	with simply just a huge amount of this training on edge cases,
557840	561520	on difficult cases in urban environments, not just highway and so on?
562720	564480	I think they'll be very hard.
564480	569760	One could characterize Tesla's approach as kind of a Chinese strength approach,
569760	573280	gather all the data you can and hope that will overcome the problems.
573920	581440	But in autonomous driving, clearly a lot of the decisions aren't merely solved by aggregating data
581440	583440	and having feedback loop.
583440	587280	There are things that are more akin to human thinking.
587920	590560	And how would those be integrated and built?
591520	596320	There has not yet been a lot of success integrating human intelligence,
596320	602320	or call it expert systems, if you will, even though that's a taboo word with the machine learning.
602800	607120	And the integration of the two types of thinking hasn't yet been demonstrated.
607760	611520	And the question is, how much can you push a purely machine learning approach?
612320	617440	And of course, Tesla also has an additional constraint that they don't have all the sensors.
618320	620960	I know that they think it's foolish to use lidars,
620960	627520	but that's clearly a one less very valuable and reliable source of input
627520	630720	that they're foregoing, which may also have consequences.
632320	636320	I think the advantage, of course, is capturing data that no one has ever seen before.
636960	642080	And in some cases, such as computer vision and speech recognition,
642080	647200	I have seen Chinese companies accumulate data that's not seen anywhere in the Western world,
647200	650080	and they have delivered superior results.
650080	657040	But then speech recognition and object recognition are relatively suitable problems for deep learning
657040	664320	and don't have the potentially need for the human intelligence analytical planning elements.
664320	666320	And the same on the speech recognition side,
666320	670640	your intuition that speech recognition and the machine learning approaches to speech
670640	675840	recognition won't take us to a conversational system that can pass the Turing test,
675840	680000	which is sort of maybe akin to what driving is.
680000	682480	So it needs to have something more than just simply
683440	686800	simple language understanding, simple language generation.
686800	692400	Roughly right, I would say that based on purely machine learning approaches,
692400	701760	it's hard to imagine it could lead to a full conversational experience across arbitrary domains,
701760	703760	which is akin to L5.
703760	709760	I'm a little hesitant to use the word Turing test because the original definition was probably too easy.
710160	711280	We probably do that.
712240	715120	The spirit of the Turing test is what I was referring to.
716400	721520	So you've had major leadership research positions at Apple, Microsoft, Google.
721520	727280	So continuing on the discussion of America, Russia, Chinese soul and culture and so on,
729120	736320	what is the culture of Silicon Valley in contrast to China and maybe U.S. broadly,
736320	742000	and what is the unique culture of each of these three major companies in your view?
742000	747120	I think in aggregate, Silicon Valley companies, and we could probably include Microsoft in that,
747120	753280	even though they're not in the Valley, is really dream big and have visionary goals
753920	762240	and believe that technology will conquer all and also the self-confidence and the self-entitlement
762240	766080	that whatever they produce, the whole world should use and must use.
767200	771920	And those are historically important.
771920	778960	I think Steve Jobs' famous quote that he doesn't do focus groups.
778960	783520	He looks in the mirror and asks the person in the mirror, what do you want?
783520	789760	And that really is an inspirational comment that says the great company shouldn't just
789760	796160	ask users what they want, but develop something that users will know they want when they see it,
796160	798880	but they could never come up with themselves.
798880	805840	I think that is probably the most exhilarating description of what the essence of Silicon Valley
805840	812640	is, that this brilliant idea could cause you to build something that couldn't come out of
812640	818000	focus groups or A.B. tests. And iPhone would be an example of that.
818000	822160	No one in the age of Blackberry would write down they want an iPhone or multi-touch,
822720	827360	a browser might be another example, no one would say they want that in the days of FTP,
827360	829360	but once they see it, they want it.
829360	833200	So I think that is what Silicon Valley is best at.
835520	838800	But it also came with a lot of success.
838800	844400	These products became global platforms and there were basically no competitors anywhere.
845040	852640	And that has also led to a belief that these are the only things that one should do,
853200	857360	that companies should not tread on other company's territory.
858000	866160	So that's a, you know, Groupon and the Yelp and then OpenTable and the Grubhub would each feel,
866160	870960	okay, I'm not going to do the other company's business because that would not be the pride
871040	875600	of innovating what each of these four companies have innovated.
876880	882080	But I think the Chinese approach is do whatever it takes to win.
882720	884960	And it's a winner take all market.
884960	890880	And in fact, in the internet space, the market leader will get predominantly all the value
890880	892800	extracted out of the system.
893360	899520	So and the system isn't just defined as one narrow category,
899520	901360	but gets broader and broader.
901360	909600	So it's amazing ambition for success and domination of increasingly larger
910240	917040	product categories leading to clear market winner status and the opportunity to extract
917040	918160	tremendous value.
919040	928640	And that develops a practical, result oriented, ultra ambitious winner take all,
928720	930720	gladiatorial mentality.
931520	938640	And if what it takes is to build what the competitors built, essentially a copycat,
938640	941840	that can be done without infringing laws.
941840	947680	If what it takes is to satisfy a foreign countries need by forking the code base and
947680	950880	building something that looks really ugly and different, they'll do it.
951440	955680	So it's contrasted very sharply with the Silicon Valley approach.
956160	961840	And I think the flexibility and the speed and execution has helped the Chinese approach.
961840	969600	And I think the Silicon Valley approach is potentially challenged if every Chinese
969600	974560	entrepreneurs learning from the whole world, US and China and the American entrepreneurs
974560	978640	only look internally and write off China as a copycat.
979520	983440	And the second part of your question about the three companies,
983440	986000	the unique elements of the three companies perhaps.
986000	997440	Yeah, I think Apple represents while the user please the user and the essence of design and
997440	1006560	brand and it's the one company and perhaps the only tech company that draws people with a
1008160	1013120	strong serious desire for the product and the need and the willingness to pay a premium.
1013520	1019440	Because of the halo effect of the brand, which came from the attention to detail
1020000	1021920	and great respect for user needs.
1023360	1033680	Microsoft represents a platform approach that builds giant products that become very strong
1033680	1040880	modes that others can't do because it's well architected at the bottom level.
1041520	1046720	And the work is efficiently delegated to individuals.
1046720	1053600	And then the whole product is built by adding small parts that sum together.
1053600	1059920	So it's probably the most effective high tech assembly line that builds a very difficult
1059920	1069920	product that and the whole process of doing that is kind of a differentiation and something
1069920	1072480	competitors can't easily repeat.
1072480	1078480	Are there elements of the Chinese approach in the way Microsoft went about assembling those
1078480	1084560	little pieces and dominating essentially dominating the market for a long time or do you see those
1084560	1085520	as distinct?
1085520	1087360	I think there are elements that are the same.
1088160	1094400	I think the three American companies that had or have Chinese characteristics and obviously
1094400	1099680	as well as American characteristics are Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.
1100320	1101200	Yes, that's right.
1101200	1108880	Because these are companies that will tenaciously go after adjacent markets, build up strong
1109920	1119120	product offering and find ways to extract greater value from a sphere that's ever increasing.
1120000	1122720	And they understand the value of the platforms.
1123520	1124880	So that's the similarity.
1125520	1135840	And then with Google, I think it's a genuinely value oriented company that does have a heart
1135840	1141040	and soul and that wants to do great things for the world by connecting information.
1141840	1154160	And that has also very strong technology genes and wants to use technology and has found
1155920	1162720	out of the box ways to use technology to deliver incredible value to the end user.
1163520	1166400	If we can look at Google, for example, you mentioned heart and soul.
1166880	1173920	There seems to be an element where Google is after making the world better.
1173920	1175520	There's a more positive view.
1175520	1179840	I mean, they used to have the slogan, don't be evil and Facebook a little bit more has
1179840	1184480	a negative tend to it, at least in the perception of privacy and so on.
1184480	1191440	Do you have a sense of how these different companies can achieve because you've talked
1191440	1195280	about how much we can make the world better in all these kinds of ways with AI?
1195600	1201120	What is it about a company that can make, give it a heart and soul, gain the trust
1201120	1205760	of the public and just actually just not be evil and do good for the world?
1206800	1207760	It's really hard.
1207760	1210560	And I think Google has struggled with that.
1211760	1218160	First, that don't do evil mantra is very dangerous because every employee's definition
1218160	1219360	of evil is different.
1219360	1223120	And that has led to some difficult employee situations for them.
1223840	1229600	So I don't necessarily think that's a good value statement, but just watching the kinds
1229600	1235920	of things Google or its parent company Alphabet does in new areas like healthcare,
1235920	1240560	like, you know, eradicating mosquitoes, things that are really not in the business
1240560	1242720	of a internet tech company.
1242720	1248720	I think that shows that there is a heart and soul and desire to do good and willingness
1249680	1256880	to put in the resources to do something when they see it's good, they will pursue it.
1258240	1262400	That doesn't necessarily mean it has all the trust of the users.
1262400	1269680	I realize while most people would view Facebook as the primary target of their recent unhappiness
1269680	1274000	about Silicon Valley companies, many would put Google in that category.
1274000	1279200	And some have named Google's business practices as predatory also.
1279840	1286720	So it's kind of difficult to have the two parts of a body, the brain wants to do what
1286720	1290560	it's supposed to do for a shareholder, maximize profit, and then the heart and soul
1290560	1296080	wants to do good things that may run against what the brain wants to do.
1296080	1301680	So in this complex balancing that these companies have to do, you've mentioned that
1301680	1307280	you're concerned about a future where too few companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon
1307280	1313280	are controlling our data or controlling too much of our digital lives.
1313280	1317280	Can you elaborate on this concern and perhaps do you have a better way forward?
1318640	1323600	I think I'm hardly the most vocal complainer of this.
1324880	1327280	There are a lot louder complainers out there.
1327280	1336880	I do observe that having a lot of data does perpetuate their strength and limit competition
1336880	1338320	in many spaces.
1339360	1344080	But I also believe AI is much broader than the internet space.
1344080	1352400	So the entrepreneurial opportunities still exists in using AI to empower financial, retail,
1352400	1355360	manufacturing, education, and applications.
1355360	1362720	So I don't think it's quite a case of full monopolistic dominance that totally stifles
1362720	1363840	innovation.
1363840	1368480	But I do believe in their areas of strength, it's hard to dislodge them.
1369680	1372640	I don't know if I have a good solution.
1373280	1378320	Probably the best solution is let the entrepreneurial VC ecosystem work well
1378960	1384240	and find all the places that can create the next Google, the next Facebook.
1384240	1387920	So there will always be increasing number of challengers.
1388480	1391280	In some sense that has happened a little bit.
1391280	1397280	You see Uber, Airbnb having emerged despite the strength of the big three.
1400240	1405200	I think China as an environment may be more interesting for the emergence
1405200	1412800	because if you look at companies between let's say 50 to 300 billion dollars,
1413520	1420320	China has emerged more of such companies than the US in the last three to four years because
1420320	1425440	of the larger marketplace, because of the more fearless nature of the entrepreneurs
1426400	1430800	that and the Chinese giants are just as powerful as American ones.
1430800	1438080	Tencent Alibaba are very strong, but Bytes Dance has emerged worth 75 billion and financial.
1438080	1443040	While it's Alibaba affiliated, it's nevertheless independent and worth 150 billion.
1443840	1451120	And so I do think if we start to extend to traditional businesses, we will see very
1451120	1452640	valuable companies.
1452640	1459600	So it's probably not the case that in five or 10 years we'll still see the whole world
1459600	1461920	with these five companies having such dominance.
1462560	1468320	So you mentioned a couple of times this fascinating world of entrepreneurship in China
1469120	1471040	of the fearless nature of the entrepreneurs.
1471040	1475360	So can you maybe talk a little bit about what it takes to be an entrepreneur in China?
1475360	1477600	What are the strategies that are undertaken?
1478320	1481040	What are the ways that you success?
1481040	1486400	What is the dynamic of VCF funding of the way the government helps companies and so on?
1486400	1489360	What are the interesting aspects here that are distinct from,
1489360	1494000	that are different from the Silicon Valley world of entrepreneurship?
1495120	1502320	Well, many of the listeners probably still would brand Chinese entrepreneur as copycats.
1502960	1508000	And no doubt 10 years ago, that would not be an inaccurate description.
1509040	1515280	Back 10 years ago, an entrepreneur probably could not get funding if he or she could not describe
1515920	1519200	what product he or she is copying from the US.
1520320	1523440	The first question is, who has proven this business model,
1523440	1526400	which is a nice way of asking, who are you copying?
1527120	1534080	And that reason is understandable because China had a much lower internet penetration
1534800	1542480	and didn't have enough indigenous experience to build innovative products.
1543200	1547600	And secondly, internet was emerging.
1547600	1552880	Link startup was the way to do things, building a first minimally viable product
1552880	1554640	and then expanding was the right way to go.
1555280	1562480	And the American successes have given a shortcut that if you built your minimally viable product
1562480	1566640	based on an American product, it's guaranteed to be a decent starting point.
1566640	1567840	Then you tweak it afterwards.
1568400	1572160	So as long as there are no IP infringement, which as far as I know,
1572160	1578560	there hasn't been in the mobile and AI spaces, that's a much better shortcut.
1579360	1584400	And I think Silicon Valley would view that as still not very honorable
1585120	1589120	because that's not your own idea to start with.
1589120	1595040	But you can't really at the same time believe every idea must be your own
1595120	1598480	and believe in the link startup methodology because
1599360	1603520	link startup is intended to try many, many things and then converge when that works.
1604160	1606720	And it's meant to be iterated and changed.
1606720	1610000	So finding a decent starting point without legal violations,
1611120	1615440	there should be nothing morally dishonorable about that.
1615440	1617040	So just a quick pause on that.
1617040	1621840	It's fascinating that that's why is that not honorable, right?
1621920	1626960	Exactly as you formulated, it seems like a perfect start for business
1628000	1634400	is to take a look at Amazon and say, okay, we'll do exactly what Amazon is doing.
1634400	1639120	Let's start there in this particular market and then let's out innovate them
1639120	1642080	from that starting point and come up with new ways.
1642080	1647040	I mean, is it wrong to be, except the word copycat just sounds bad,
1647040	1648720	but is it wrong to be a copycat?
1648720	1651520	It just seems like a smart strategy.
1651520	1658960	But yes, doesn't have a heroic nature to it that like Steve Jobs,
1659920	1663760	Elon Musk sort of in something completely coming up with something completely new.
1663760	1665200	Yeah, I like the way you describe it.
1665200	1672240	It's a non-heroic acceptable way to start the company and maybe more expedient.
1672880	1680080	So that's, I think, a baggage for Silicon Valley, that if it doesn't let go,
1680720	1685040	then it may limit the ultimate ceiling of the company.
1685040	1686560	Take Snapchat as an example.
1687120	1691440	I think, you know, Evan's brilliant, he built a great product,
1691440	1696720	but he's very proud that he wants to build his own features, not copy others.
1696720	1700960	While Facebook was more willing to copy his features,
1700960	1702800	and you see what happens in the competition.
1703440	1710160	So I think putting that handcuff on the company would limit its ability to reach the maximum
1710160	1716720	potential. So back to the Chinese environment, copying was merely a way to learn from the
1716720	1723360	American masters. Just like we, if you would, we learned to play piano or painting,
1723360	1724480	you start by copying.
1724480	1728160	You don't start by innovating when you don't have the basic skill sets.
1728160	1736080	So very amazingly, the Chinese entrepreneurs, about six years ago, started to branch off
1736080	1742160	with these lean startups built on American ideas to build better products than American products.
1742160	1744240	But they did start from the American idea.
1744960	1748560	And today, WeChat is better than WhatsApp.
1748560	1749920	Weibo is better than Twitter.
1750480	1752880	Zihu is better than Quora and so on.
1752880	1757840	So that I think is Chinese entrepreneurs going to step two.
1758400	1763680	And then step three is once these entrepreneurs have done one or two of these companies,
1763680	1767360	they now look at the Chinese market and the opportunities
1767360	1770000	and come up with ideas that didn't exist elsewhere.
1770640	1777520	So products like and financial under which includes AliPay, which is mobile payments.
1778320	1784320	And also the financial products for loans built on that.
1784320	1787280	And also in education VIP kid.
1788560	1797600	And in social video, social network, TikTok, and in social e-commerce, Pinduoduo.
1798640	1801680	And then in ride sharing, Mobike.
1801680	1808080	These are all Chinese innovative products that now are being copied elsewhere.
1808720	1815440	So and an additional interesting observation is some of these products are built on unique
1815440	1821760	Chinese demographics, which may not work in the US, but may work very well in Southeast Asia,
1822400	1827760	Africa, and other developing worlds that are a few years behind China.
1827760	1832160	And a few of these products maybe are universal and are getting traction,
1832160	1834640	even in the United States, such as TikTok.
1835360	1843440	So this whole ecosystem is supported by VCs as a virtuous cycle,
1843440	1848720	because a large market with with the innovative entrepreneurs will draw a lot of money.
1849360	1853680	And then investing these companies, as the market gets larger and larger,
1853680	1857440	US mark China market is easily three, four times larger than the US.
1858320	1862160	They will create greater value and greater returns for the VCs,
1862160	1864480	thereby raising even more money.
1865360	1869840	So at Sinovation Ventures, our first fund was 15 million.
1869840	1871440	Our last fund was 500 million.
1872000	1879040	So it reflects the valuation of the companies and our us going multi stage and things like that.
1879680	1881600	It also has government support.
1882880	1886000	But not in the way most Americans would think of it.
1886000	1891120	The government actually leaves the entrepreneurial space as a private enterprise,
1891200	1896640	so the self regulating and the government would build infrastructures that would
1897280	1899200	around it to make it work better.
1899200	1904800	For example, the mass entrepreneur mass innovation plan built 8000 incubators.
1904800	1909520	So the pipeline is very strong to the VCs for autonomous vehicles.
1909520	1914240	The Chinese government is building smart highways with sensors,
1914240	1920720	smart cities that separate pedestrians from cars that may allow initially an inferior
1921120	1926800	autonomous vehicle company to launch a car without increasing with lower casualty,
1927600	1930800	because the roads or the city is smart.
1931440	1936560	And the Chinese government at local levels would have these guiding funds acting as
1936560	1939360	LPs, passive LPs to funds.
1939360	1945920	And when the fund makes money, part of the money made is given back to the GPs and potentially
1945920	1953600	other LPs to increase everybody's return at the expense of the government's return.
1953600	1961520	So that's an interesting incentive that entrusts the task of choosing entrepreneurs to VCs
1961520	1966560	who are better at it than the government by letting some of the profits move that way.
1966560	1968640	So this is really fascinating, right?
1968640	1974240	So I look at the Russian government as a case study where let me put it this way,
1974240	1980080	there's no such government driven large scale support of entrepreneurship.
1980800	1986960	And probably the same is true in the United States, but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of find a way.
1987600	1995520	So maybe in a form of advice or explanation, how did the Chinese government arrive to be this way,
1995520	2001920	so supportive on entrepreneurship to be in this particular way so forward thinking at such a
2001920	2006720	large scale, and also perhaps, how can we copy it in other countries?
2008160	2011440	How can we encourage other governments, like even the United States government,
2011440	2015520	to support infrastructure for autonomous vehicles in that same kind of way, perhaps?
2015520	2025920	Yes. So these techniques are the result of several key things, some of which may be learnable,
2025920	2027280	some of which may be very hard.
2028000	2032800	One is just trial and error and watching what everyone else is doing.
2032800	2036800	I think it's important to be humble and not feel like you know all the answers.
2036800	2040560	The guiding funds idea came from Singapore, which came from Israel,
2041360	2047760	and China made a few tweaks and turned it into a, because the Chinese cities
2047760	2052720	and government officials kind of compete with each other because they all want to
2052720	2059440	make their city more successful, so they can get the next level in their political career,
2060240	2065120	and it's somewhat competitive. So the central government made it a bit of a competition.
2065120	2071040	Everybody has a budget, they can put it on AI, or they can put it on bio, or they can put it on
2071040	2076000	energy, and then whoever gets the results, the city shines, the people are better off,
2076000	2082240	the mayor gets a promotion. So the tools, this is kind of almost like an entrepreneurial environment
2082800	2086400	for local governments to see who can do a better job.
2087440	2095040	And also many of them tried different experiments. Some have given award to
2095760	2100800	very smart researchers, just give them money and hope they'll start a company.
2100800	2108000	Some have given money to academic research labs, maybe government research labs,
2108000	2113040	to see if they can spin off some companies from the science lab or something like that.
2114000	2118960	Some have tried to recruit overseas Chinese to come back and start companies,
2118960	2123360	and they've had mixed results. The one that worked the best was the guiding funds.
2123360	2127920	So it's almost like a lean startup idea where people try different things and
2127920	2132800	what works sticks and everybody copies. So now every city has a guiding fund.
2132800	2141120	So that's how that came about. The autonomous vehicle and the massive spending in highways
2141120	2149440	and smart cities, that's a Chinese way. It's about building infrastructure to facilitate.
2149440	2155920	It's a clear division of the government's responsibility from the market. The market
2155920	2162480	should do everything in a private freeway, but there are things the market can't afford to do.
2162880	2169520	Like infrastructure. So the government always appropriates large amounts of money
2169520	2176800	for infrastructure building. This happens with not only autonomous vehicle and AI,
2176800	2185920	but happened with the 3G and 4G. You'll find that the Chinese wireless reception is better than the
2185920	2191920	US because massive spending that tries to cover the whole country, whereas in the US it may be
2191920	2198560	a little spotty. It's a government driven because I think they view the coverage of
2201040	2206160	cell access and 3G, 4G access to be a governmental infrastructure spending
2206960	2214160	as opposed to capitalistic. So of course their state-owned enterprises are also publicly traded,
2214160	2220080	but they also carry a government responsibility to deliver infrastructure to all.
2220080	2225280	So it's a different way of thinking that may be very hard to inject into western countries
2225280	2230320	to say starting tomorrow, bandwidth infrastructure and highways are going to be
2232080	2235040	governmental spending with some characteristics.
2236160	2240160	What's your sense and sorry to interrupt, but because it's such a fascinating point.
2241520	2243760	Do you think on the autonomous vehicle space
2244400	2251440	it's possible to solve the problem of full autonomy without significant investment in
2251440	2258160	infrastructure? Well, that's really hard to speculate. I think it's not a yes-no question,
2258160	2265360	but how long does it take question? You know, 15 years, 30 years, 45 years. Clearly with
2265360	2272640	infrastructure augmentation, whether it's road, city or whole city planning, building a new city,
2273280	2280800	I'm sure that will accelerate the day of the L5. I'm not knowledgeable enough and it's hard to
2280800	2287520	predict even when we're knowledgeable because a lot of it is speculative. But in the U.S.,
2287520	2292960	I don't think people would consider building a new city the size of Chicago to make it the AI
2292960	2299360	slash autonomous city. There are smaller ones being built, I'm aware of that. But is infrastructure
2300320	2306720	spent really impossible for U.S. or Western countries? I don't think so. The U.S. highway
2306720	2316400	system was built. Was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy? So maybe historians can
2316400	2322640	study how the President Eisenhower get the resources to build this massive infrastructure
2322720	2330720	that surely gave U.S. a tremendous amount of prosperity over the next decade, if not century.
2330720	2335920	If I may comment on that then, it takes us to artificial intelligence a little bit because
2335920	2341600	in order to build infrastructure, it creates a lot of jobs. So I'll be actually interested
2342320	2347520	if you would say that you're talking your book about all kinds of jobs that could and could not
2347520	2354240	be automated. I wonder if building infrastructure is one of the jobs that would not be easily
2354240	2358960	automated. It's something you can think about because I think you've mentioned somewhere in a
2358960	2366080	talk or that there might be, as jobs are being automated, a role for government to create jobs
2366080	2373200	that can't be automated. Yes, I think that's a possibility. Back in the last financial crisis,
2374160	2383280	China put a lot of money to basically give this economy a boost and a lot of it went into
2383280	2390080	infrastructure building. And I think that's a legitimate way at the government level to
2391840	2397680	deal with the employment issues as well as build out the infrastructure. As long as the
2397680	2402320	infrastructures are truly needed and as long as there isn't an employment problem, which
2403040	2411920	no, we don't know. So maybe taking a little step back, if you've been a leader and a researcher
2411920	2420880	in AI for several decades, at least 30 years, so how has AI changed in the West and the East
2420880	2424160	as you've observed as you've been deep in it over the past 30 years?
2424960	2431520	Well, AI began as the pursuit of understanding human intelligence and the term itself
2432560	2438800	represents that. But it kind of drifted into the one subarea that worked extremely well,
2438800	2445200	which is machine intelligence. And that's actually more using pattern recognition techniques to
2446560	2453840	basically do incredibly well on a limited domain, large amount of data, but relatively
2453920	2461360	simple kinds of planning tasks and not very creative. So we didn't end up building human
2461360	2468000	intelligence. We built a different machine that was a lot better than us, some problems,
2468000	2474960	but nowhere close to us on other problems. So today, I think a lot of people still misunderstand
2476160	2481840	when we say artificial intelligence and what various products can do, people still think
2481920	2487760	it's about replicating human intelligence. But the products out there really are closer to
2489120	2494240	having invented the internet or the spreadsheet or the database and getting broader adoption.
2495280	2501200	And speaking further to the fears, near-term fears that people have about AI, so you're commenting
2501200	2508560	on the general intelligence that people in the popular culture from sci-fi movies have a sense
2508560	2514720	about AI. But there's practical fears about AI, the kind, the narrow AI that you're talking about
2514720	2520480	of automating particular kinds of jobs. And you talk about them in the book. So what are the kinds
2520480	2527680	of jobs in your view that you see in the next five, 10 years beginning to be automated by AI systems,
2527680	2535200	algorithms? Yes, this is also maybe a little bit counterintuitive, because it's the routine jobs
2535200	2544000	that will be displaced the soonest. And they may not be displaced entirely, maybe 50%, 80% of a job,
2544000	2550640	but when the workload drops by that much, employment will come down. And also another part of
2550640	2556560	misunderstanding is most people think of AI replacing routine jobs, then they think of the
2556560	2562960	assembly line, the workers. Well, that will have some effect, but it's actually the routine white
2562960	2569680	color workers that's easiest to replace. Because to replace a white color worker, you just need
2569680	2578400	software. To replace a blue color worker, you need robotics, mechanical excellence, and the ability to
2578400	2587040	deal with dexterity, and maybe even unknown environments, very, very difficult. So if we were
2587040	2594960	to categorize the most dangerous white collar jobs, they would be things like back office,
2595520	2604240	people who copy and paste and deal with simple computer programs and data, and maybe paper and
2604240	2612960	OCR, and they don't make strategic decisions, they basically facilitate the process, these softwares
2612960	2618880	and paper systems don't work. So you have people dealing with new employee orientation,
2620640	2627280	searching for past lawsuits and financial documents, and doing reference check,
2627840	2633360	the basic searching and management of data, that's the most in danger of being lost. In addition to
2633360	2640480	the white collar repetitive work, a lot of simple interaction work can also be taken care of, such
2640480	2648480	as tele-sales, telemarketing, customer service, as well as many physical jobs that are in the same
2648480	2656720	location and don't require a high degree of dexterity. So fruit picking, dishwashing, assembly line,
2656720	2664000	inspection are jobs in that category. So altogether, back office is a big part.
2664960	2671920	And the other, the blue collar may be smaller initially, but over time AI will get better.
2671920	2678720	And when we start to get to over the next 15, 20 years, the ability to actually have the dexterity
2678720	2684960	of doing assembly line, that's a huge chunk of jobs. And when autonomous vehicles start to work,
2684960	2690560	initially starting with truck drivers, but eventually to all drivers, that's another huge group of
2690960	2698000	workers. So I see modest numbers in the next five years, but increasing rapidly after that.
2698000	2702720	On the worry of the jobs that are in danger and the gradual loss of jobs.
2703920	2706000	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Andrew Yang.
2706560	2707120	Yes, I am.
2707760	2713760	So there's a candidate for president of the United States whose platform Andrew Yang is based around,
2714320	2721680	in part, around job loss due to automation. And also in addition, the need perhaps of universal
2721680	2728560	basic income to support jobs that are folks who lose their job due to automation and so on. And
2728560	2736000	in general, support people under complex, unstable job market. So what are your thoughts about his
2736000	2742400	concerns, him as a candidate, his ideas in general? I think his thinking is generally in the right
2742400	2750560	direction. But his approach as a presidential candidate may be a little bit ahead of the time.
2752160	2758800	I think the displacements will happen. But will they happen soon enough for people to agree to
2758800	2766720	vote for him? The unemployment numbers are not very high yet. And I think he and I have the same
2766720	2772400	challenge. If I want to theoretically convince people this is an issue and he wants to become
2772400	2779680	the president, people have to see how can this be the case when unemployment numbers are low.
2779680	2786400	So that is the challenge. And I think we do, I do agree with him on the displacement issue,
2787280	2795440	on universal basic income. At a very vanilla level, I don't agree with it. Because I think
2795440	2803920	the main issue is retraining. So people need to be incented, not by just giving a monthly $2,000
2803920	2812400	check or $1,000 check and do whatever they want, because they don't have the know how to know what
2812400	2820400	to retrain to go into what type of a job and guidance is needed. And retraining is needed
2820400	2825040	because historically, when technology revolutions, when routine jobs were displaced,
2825040	2831760	new routine jobs came up. So there was always room for that. But with AI and automation,
2831760	2836480	the whole point is replacing all routine jobs eventually. So there will be fewer and fewer
2836480	2843840	routine jobs. And AI will create jobs, but it won't create routine jobs. Because if it creates
2843840	2850320	routine jobs, why wouldn't AI just do it? So therefore, the people who are losing the jobs
2850320	2856720	are losing routine jobs, the jobs that are becoming available are non-routine jobs. So the social
2856720	2863280	stipend needs to be put in place is for the routine workers who lost their jobs to be retrained,
2863280	2868960	maybe in six months, maybe in three years, takes a while to retrain on the non-routine job, and then
2868960	2875680	take on a job that will last for that person's lifetime. Now, having said that, if you look
2875680	2881840	deeply into Andrew's document, he does cater for that. So I'm not disagreeing with what he's trying
2881840	2888640	to do. But for simplification, sometimes he just says UBI, but simple UBI wouldn't work.
2888640	2895680	And I think you've mentioned elsewhere that the goal isn't necessarily to give people enough money
2895760	2902080	to survive or live or even to prosper. The point is to give them a job that gives them meaning.
2902640	2908480	That meaning is extremely important. That our employment, at least in the United States,
2908480	2914480	and perhaps it cares across the world, provides something that's, forgive me for saying,
2914480	2924640	greater than money. It provides meaning. So now, what kind of jobs do you think can't be automated?
2924720	2929600	You talk a little bit about creativity and compassion in your book. What aspects do you
2929600	2936320	think it's difficult to automate for an AI system? Because an AI system is currently
2936320	2942880	merely optimizing. It's not able to reason, plan, or think creatively or strategically.
2943520	2950160	It's not able to deal with complex problems. It can't come up with a new problem and solve it.
2950240	2956240	A human needs to find the problem and pose it as an optimization problem,
2956240	2964560	then have the AI work at it. So an AI would have a very hard time discovering a new drug or
2964560	2972880	discovering a new style of painting or dealing with complex tasks such as managing a company
2972880	2978000	that isn't just about optimizing the bottom line, but also about employee satisfaction,
2978640	2985360	corporate brand, and many, many other things. So that is one category of things. And because
2985360	2990560	these things are challenging, creative, complex, doing them creates a higher,
2990560	2996160	high degree of satisfaction, and therefore appealing to our desire for working, which
2996160	3001120	isn't just to make the money, make the ends meet, but also that we've accomplished something that
3001120	3007600	others maybe can't do or can't do as well. Another type of job that is much numerous
3007680	3014960	would be compassionate jobs, jobs that require compassion, empathy, human touch, human trust.
3014960	3022400	AI can't do that because AI is cold, calculating, and even if it can fake that to some extent,
3023200	3029680	it will make errors and that will make it look very silly. And also, I think even if AI did okay,
3029680	3037200	people would want to interact with another person, whether it's for some kind of a service or teacher
3037200	3045520	or doctor or concierge or a masseuse or bartender. There are so many jobs where people just don't
3045520	3053120	want to interact with a cold robot or software. I've had an entrepreneur who built an elderly care
3053120	3059760	robot, and they found that the elderly really only use it for customer service. But not to
3059760	3065360	service the product, but they click on customer service and the video of a person comes up,
3065440	3070320	and then the person says, how come my daughter didn't call me? Let me show you a picture of
3070320	3077520	her grandkids. So people earn for that, people people interaction. So even if robots improved,
3077520	3083280	people just don't want it. And those jobs are going to be increasing because AI will create a lot
3083280	3090960	of value, $16 trillion to the world in next 11 years, according to PWC. And that will give people
3091520	3099520	money to enjoy services, whether it's eating a gourmet meal, or tourism and traveling,
3099520	3106080	or having concierge services, the services revolving around every dollar of that $16
3106080	3112640	trillion will be tremendous. It will create more opportunities to service the people who did well
3112720	3122320	through AI with things. But even at the same time, the entire society is very much short in need of
3122320	3129280	many service oriented, compassionate oriented jobs. The best example is probably in healthcare
3129280	3136800	services. There's going to be 2 million new jobs, not counting replacement, just brand new incremental
3136800	3144160	jobs in the next six years in healthcare services. That includes nurses, orderly in the hospital,
3144880	3153600	elderly care, and also at home care. It's particularly lacking. And those jobs are not
3153600	3158480	likely to be filled. So there's likely to be a shortage. And the reason they're not filled
3158480	3165200	is simply because they don't pay very well. And that the social status of these jobs are
3165920	3172240	not very good. So they pay about half as much as a heavy equipment operator,
3172240	3179120	which will be replaced a lot sooner. And they pay probably comparably to someone on the assembly line.
3179840	3187200	And if so, if we ignoring all the other issues and just think about satisfaction from one's job,
3187200	3193120	someone repetitively doing the same manual action and assembly line, that can't create a lot of
3193120	3199680	job satisfaction, but someone taking care of a sick person and getting a hug and thank you from
3199680	3207200	that person and the family, I think is quite satisfying. So if only we could fix the pay
3207200	3213360	for service jobs, there are plenty of jobs that require some training or a lot of training
3213360	3221680	for the people coming off the routine jobs to take. We can easily imagine someone who was maybe a
3221680	3228560	cashier at the grocery store, as stores become automated, learns to become a nurse or a at home
3228560	3234720	care. Also do want to point out the blue collar jobs are going to stay around a bit longer,
3234720	3243120	some of them quite a bit longer. AI cannot be told go clean an arbitrary home. That's incredibly
3243120	3250000	hard, arguably is an L five level of difficulty, right? And then AI cannot be a good plumber,
3250000	3255680	because plumber is almost like a mini detective that has to figure out where the leak came from.
3255680	3264640	So yet AI probably can be an assembly line and auto mechanic and so on. So one has to study
3264640	3269760	which blue collar jobs are going away and facilitate retraining for the people to go into
3269760	3274560	the ones that won't go away or maybe even will increase. I mean, it is fascinating that it's
3274560	3281680	easier to build a world champion chess player than it is to build a mediocre plumber.
3283040	3288880	Very true. And that goes counterintuitive to a lot of people's understanding of what artificial
3288880	3294640	intelligence is. So it sounds, I mean, you're painting a pretty optimistic picture about
3294640	3298880	retraining about the number of jobs and actually the meaningful nature of those jobs
3299440	3305200	once we automate repetitive tasks. So overall, are you optimistic about
3306800	3313120	the future where much of the repetitive tasks are automated, that there is a lot of room for
3313120	3318880	humans for the compassionate for the creative input that only humans can provide?
3319920	3327520	I am optimistic if we start to take action. If we have no action in the next five years,
3327520	3333040	I think it's going to be hard to deal with the devastating losses that will emerge.
3334400	3338560	So if we start thinking about retraining, maybe with the low hanging fruits,
3339280	3345360	explaining to vocational schools why they should train more plumbers than auto mechanics,
3346560	3351440	maybe starting with some government subsidy for corporations to have more training
3352400	3358960	positions. We start to explain to people why retraining is important. We start to think about
3358960	3365520	what the future of education, how that needs to be tweaked for the era of AI. If we start to make
3365520	3370560	incremental progress and a greater number of people understand, then there's no reason to think we
3370560	3377200	can't deal with this because this technological revolution is arguably similar to what electricity,
3377200	3382560	industrial revolutions and internet brought about. Do you think there's a role for policy,
3382560	3386880	for governments to step in to help with policy to create a better world?
3388080	3393280	Absolutely, and the governments don't have to believe an employment will go up,
3393920	3398160	and they don't have to believe automation will be this fast to do something.
3399280	3405520	Revamping vocational school would be one example. Another is if there's a big gap in healthcare
3405520	3412720	service employment, and we know that a country's population is growing older, more longevity,
3412720	3419040	living older, because people over 80 require five times as much care as those under 80,
3419600	3426880	then it is a good time to incent training programs for elderly care to find ways to improve the pay.
3427440	3433760	Maybe one way would be to offer as part of Medicare or the equivalent program for people
3433760	3442000	over 80 to be entitled to a few hours of elderly care at home, and then that might be reimbursable,
3442000	3448720	and that will stimulate the service industry around the policy.
3448720	3455280	Do you have concerns about large entities, whether it's governments or companies,
3455280	3460800	controlling the future of AI development in general? So we talked about companies,
3460800	3469360	do you have a better sense that governments can better represent the interests of the people
3469360	3474720	than companies, or do you believe companies are better at representing the interests of the people,
3474720	3476560	or is there no easy answer?
3476560	3479440	I don't think there's an easy answer, because it's a double-edged sword.
3480000	3485440	The companies and governments can provide better services with more access to data and more access
3485440	3493440	to AI, but that also leads to greater power, which can lead to uncontrollable problems,
3493440	3497040	whether it's monopoly or corruption in the government.
3497680	3504880	So I think one has to be careful to look at how much data that companies and governments have,
3504880	3509120	and some kind of checks and balances would be helpful.
3509200	3515680	So again, I come from Russia. There's something called the Cold War.
3516720	3520640	So let me ask a difficult question here, looking at conflict.
3520640	3525280	Steven Pinker wrote a great book that conflict all over the world is decreasing in general,
3525280	3531760	but do you have a sense that having written the book AI Superpowers,
3531760	3537760	do you see a major international conflict potentially arising between major nations,
3537760	3542960	whatever they are, whether it's Russia, China, European nations, United States,
3542960	3550080	or others in the next 10, 20, 50 years around AI, around the digital space, cyber space?
3550080	3558320	Do you worry about that? Is that something we need to think about and try to alleviate or prevent?
3559520	3566000	I believe in greater engagement. A lot of the worries about more powerful AI
3566720	3580320	are based on a arms race metaphor. And when you extrapolate into military kinds of scenarios,
3581440	3588080	AI can automate and autonomous weapons that needs to be controlled somehow,
3588800	3596880	and autonomous decision making can lead to not enough time to fix international crises.
3597600	3604000	So I actually believe a Cold War mentality would be very dangerous, because should
3604000	3609920	two countries rely on AI to make certain decisions and they don't talk to each other,
3609920	3614000	they do their own scenario planning, then something could easily go wrong.
3614960	3623280	I think engagement, interaction, some protocols to avoid inadvertent disasters
3623280	3629040	is actually needed. So it's natural for each country to want to be the best,
3629040	3637840	whether it's in nuclear technologies or AI or bio. But I think it's important to realize if
3638640	3644880	each country has a black box AI and don't talk to each other, that probably presents greater
3646400	3653600	challenges to humanity than if they interacted. I think there can still be competition,
3653600	3661120	but with some degree of protocol for interaction. Just like when there was a nuclear competition,
3662080	3668400	there were some protocol for deterrence among US, Russia and China. And I think
3668960	3675280	that engagement is needed. So of course, we're still far from AI presenting that kind of danger.
3675920	3682880	But what I worry the most about is the level of engagement seems to be coming down.
3682880	3689680	The level of distrust seems to be going up, especially from the US towards other large
3689680	3695360	countries such as China and Russia. Is there a way to make that better? So that's beautifully
3695360	3706960	put, level of engagement and even just basic trust and communication as opposed to making
3706960	3716320	artificial enemies out of particular countries. Do you have a sense how we can make it better?
3717120	3724320	actionable items that as a society we can take on? I'm not an expert at geopolitics,
3724880	3733120	but I would say that we look pretty foolish as humankind when we are faced with the opportunity
3733120	3746160	to create 16 trillion dollars for humanity. And yet we're not solving fundamental problems with
3746640	3753040	parts of the world still in poverty. And for the first time, we have the resources to overcome
3753040	3758640	poverty and hunger. We're not using it on that, but we're fueling competition among superpowers.
3758640	3765520	And that's a very unfortunate thing. If we become utopian for a moment, imagine a
3765840	3776400	benevolent world government that has this 16 trillion dollars and maybe some AI to figure
3776400	3782480	out how to use it to deal with diseases and problems and hate and things like that,
3782480	3788640	world would be a lot better off. So what is wrong with the current world? I think the people
3788720	3795680	with more skill than I should think about this. And then the geopolitics issue with
3795680	3801520	superpower competition is one side of the issue. There's another side which I worry maybe even
3803200	3810560	more, which is as the 16 trillion dollars all gets made by US and China and a few of the other
3810560	3815840	developed countries, the poorer country will get nothing because they don't have technology.
3816800	3824480	And the wealth disparity and inequality will increase. So a poorer country with a large
3824480	3831280	population will not only benefit from the AI boom or other technology booms, but they will have
3831280	3837440	their workers who previously had hoped they could do the China model and do outsource manufacturing
3837440	3843360	or the India model. So they could do the outsource process or call center while all those jobs are
3843360	3851920	going to be gone in 10 or 15 years. So the individual citizen may be a net liability,
3851920	3859120	I mean financially speaking to a poorer country and not an asset to claw itself out of poverty.
3859760	3867280	So in that kind of situation, these large countries with not much tech are going to be
3867280	3874960	facing a downward spiral and it's unclear what could be done. And then when we look back and say
3874960	3880560	there's 16 trillion dollars being created and it's all being kept by US, China and other developed
3880560	3888000	countries, it just doesn't feel right. So I hope people who know about geopolitics can find solutions
3888000	3894240	that's beyond my expertise. So different countries that we've talked about have different value
3894240	3901280	systems. If you look at the United States to an almost extreme degree, there is an absolute
3901280	3906000	desire for freedom of speech. If you look at a country where I was raised, that desire just
3906000	3914880	amongst the people is not as elevated as it is to basically fundamental level
3914880	3919040	to the essence of what it means to be America. And the same is true with China,
3919040	3928400	there's different value systems. There is some censorship of internet content that China and
3928400	3936000	Russia and many other countries undertake. Do you see that having effects on innovation,
3936640	3941520	other aspects of some of the tech stuff AI development we talked about, and maybe from
3941520	3947840	another angle, do you see that changing in different ways over the next 10 years, 20 years,
3947840	3954480	50 years as China continues to grow as it does now in its tech innovation?
3955600	3962880	There's a common belief that full freedom of speech and expression is correlated with creativity,
3962880	3971760	which is correlated with entrepreneurial success. I think empirically, we have seen that is not
3971760	3979680	true. And China has been successful. That's not to say the fundamental values are not right or
3979680	3987840	not the best, but it's just that that perfect correlation isn't there. It's hard to read the
3987840	3994880	tea leaves on an opening up or not in any country. And I've not been very good at that in my past
3994880	4004880	predictions. But I do believe every country shares some fundamental value, a lot of fundamental
4004880	4017200	values for the long term. So you know, China is drafting its privacy policy for individual citizens.
4017200	4025200	And they don't look that different from the American or European ones. So people do want
4025200	4033360	to protect their privacy and have the opportunity to express. And I think the fundamental values
4033360	4041040	are there. The question is in the execution and timing, how soon or when will that start to open
4041040	4047920	up? So as long as each government knows, ultimately, people want that kind of protection,
4049120	4054960	there should be a plan to move towards that as to when or how, and I'm not an expert.
4056160	4062480	On the point of privacy to me, it's really interesting. So AI needs data to create a
4062480	4067360	personalized, awesome experience. I'm just speaking generally in terms of products.
4068080	4073040	And then we have currently, depending on the age and depending on the demographics of who we're
4073040	4078960	talking about, some people are more or less concerned about the amount of data they hand over.
4078960	4087280	So in your view, how do we get this balance right? That we provide an amazing experience to
4087920	4093440	people that use products? You look at Facebook, you know, the more Facebook knows about you,
4093440	4101040	yes, it's scary to say, the better it can probably, a better experience it can probably create.
4101040	4103280	So in your view, how do we get that balance right?
4105120	4114320	Yes, I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding that it's okay and possible to just rip all the
4114320	4121120	data out from a provider and give it back to you. So you can deny them access to further data
4121120	4127440	and still enjoy the services we have. If we take back all the data, all the services will give us
4127440	4133520	nonsense. We'll no longer be able to use products that function well in terms of, you know,
4134480	4140880	right ranking, right products, right user experience. So yet I do understand we don't
4140880	4150240	want to permit misuse of the data. From legal policy standpoint, I think there can be severe
4150240	4159680	punishment for those who have egregious misuse of the data. That's, I think, a good first step,
4159680	4165920	actually China in this side, on this aspect has very strong laws about people who sell or give
4165920	4173600	data to other companies. And that over the past few years, since that law came into effect,
4173600	4183760	pretty much eradicated the illegal distribution sharing of data. Additionally, I think giving,
4185440	4194640	I think technology is often a very good way to solve technology misuse. So can we come up with
4194640	4200080	new technologies that will let us have our cake and eat it too? People are looking into
4200080	4206240	homomorphic encryption, which is letting you keep the data, have it encrypted and train on
4206240	4211760	encrypted data. Of course, we haven't solved that one yet, but that kind of direction may be worth
4211760	4218720	pursuing. Also federated learning, which would allow one hospital to train on its hospitals,
4218720	4224080	patient data fully, because they have a license for that. And then hospitals will then share
4224080	4230640	their models, not data but models, to create a supra AI. And that also maybe has some promise.
4230640	4238720	So I would want to encourage us to be open-minded and think of this as not just the policy binary,
4238720	4244880	yes, no, but letting the technologists try to find solutions to let us have our cake and eat it too,
4244880	4251680	or have most of our cake and eat most of it too. Finally, I think giving each end user a choice
4251760	4257680	is important. And having transparency is important. Also, I think that's universal. But
4258480	4263840	the choice you give to the user should not be at a granular level that the user cannot understand.
4264720	4271360	GDPR today causes all these pop-ups of yes, no, will you give this site this right to use this part
4271360	4277840	of your data? I don't think any user understands what they're saying yes or no to. And I suspect
4277840	4284400	most are just saying yes because they don't understand it. So while GDPR in its current
4284400	4291440	implementation has lived up to its promise of transparency and user choice, it implemented
4291440	4300640	it in such a way that really didn't deliver the spirit of GDPR. They fit the letter but not the
4300640	4308640	spirit. So again, I think we need to think about is there a way to fit the spirit of GDPR by using
4308640	4316080	some kind of technology? Can we have a slider that's an AI trying to figure out how much you want to
4316080	4324160	slide between perfect protection security of your personal data versus a high degree of convenience
4324160	4330640	with some risks of not having full privacy? Each user should have some preference and that gives
4330640	4336560	you the user choice. But maybe we should turn the problem on its head and ask, can there be an AI
4336560	4342080	algorithm that can customize this? Because we can understand the slider but we sure cannot
4342080	4349040	understand every pop-up question. And I think getting that right requires getting the balance
4349120	4356080	between what we talked about earlier, which is hard and soul versus profit driven decisions and
4356080	4363680	strategy. I think from my perspective, the best way to make a lot of money in the long term is to
4363680	4371840	keep your heart and soul intact. I think getting that slider right in the short term may feel like
4371840	4378560	you'll be sacrificing profit. But in the long term, you'll be getting user trust and providing a
4378560	4385680	great experience. Do you share that kind of view in general? Yes, absolutely. I sure would hope
4385680	4392960	there is a way we can do long term projects that really do the right thing. I think a lot of people
4392960	4399040	who embrace GDPR, their heart's in the right place. I think they just need to figure out
4399040	4404640	how to build a solution. I've heard utopians talk about solutions that get me excited but
4404640	4411200	I'm not sure how in the current funding environment they can get started. People talk about, imagine
4411200	4421200	this crowdsourced data collection that we all trust and then we have these agents that we
4421920	4430720	ask them to ask the trusted agent, that agent only, that platform. So a trusted joint platform
4431200	4443040	that we all believe is trustworthy that can give us all the close loop personal suggestions
4443040	4448960	by the new social network, new search engine, new e-commerce engine that has access to even
4448960	4456720	more of our data but not directly but indirectly. So I think that general concept of licensing
4456720	4462160	to some trusted engine and finding a way to trust that engine seems like a great idea
4462160	4467600	but if you think how long it's going to take to implement and tweak and develop it right
4467600	4472560	as well as to collect all the trusts and the data from the people, it's beyond the
4472560	4477200	current cycle of venture capital. So how do you do that is a big question.
4478000	4482960	You've recently had a fight with cancer, stage 4 lymphoma
4484640	4491760	and in a sort of deep personal level, what did it feel like in the darker moments to face your
4491760	4501360	own mortality? Well I've been the workaholic my whole life and I've basically worked 9.96,
4501360	4508800	9am to 9pm, 6 days a week roughly and I didn't really pay a lot of attention to my family,
4508800	4514960	friends and people who loved me and my life revolved around optimizing for work. While my
4514960	4524560	work was not routine, my optimization really what made my life basically a very mechanical
4524560	4531840	process but I got a lot of highs out of it because of accomplishments that I thought were
4532800	4539440	really important and dear and the highest priority to me but when I faced mortality and the possible
4539440	4546000	death in matter of months, I suddenly realized that this really meant nothing to me, that I
4546000	4551680	didn't feel like working for another minute, that if I had six months left in my life I would spend
4551920	4559920	all with my loved ones and thanking them, giving them love back and apologizing to them that I
4559920	4569520	lived my life the wrong way. So that moment of reckoning caused me to really rethink that why
4569520	4578800	we exist in this world is something that we might be too much shaped by the society to think that
4578800	4588160	success and accomplishments is why we live but while that can get you periodic successes and
4588160	4597440	satisfaction, it's really in them facing death you see what's truly important to you. So as a result
4597440	4604480	of going through them, the challenges with cancer, I've resolved to live a more balanced
4604480	4612880	lifestyle. I'm now in remission, knock on wood and I'm spending more time with my family, my wife
4612880	4621120	travels with me, when my kids need me, I spend more time with them and before I used to prioritize
4621120	4626400	everything around work when I had a little bit of time I would dole it out to my family. Now
4627040	4631680	when my family needs something, really needs something, I drop everything at work and go to
4631680	4638880	them and then in the time remaining, I allocate to work. But one's family is very understanding,
4638880	4647040	it's not like they will take 50 hours a week from me. So I'm actually able to still work pretty hard,
4647040	4654560	maybe 10 hours less per week. So I realize the most important thing in my life is really love
4654560	4661280	and the people I love and I give that the highest priority. It isn't the only thing I do but when
4661280	4669360	that is needed, I put that at the top priority and I feel much better and I feel much more balanced.
4670000	4678160	And I think this also gives a hint as to a life of routine work, a life of pursuit of numbers.
4678720	4685520	While my job was not routine, it wasn't pursuit of numbers, pursuit of can I make more money,
4685520	4692320	can I fund more great companies, can I raise more money, can I make sure our VCs ranked higher and
4692320	4700240	higher every year. This competitive nature of driving for bigger numbers and better numbers
4700800	4711760	became a endless pursuit of that's mechanical. And bigger numbers really didn't make me happier
4711760	4715600	and faced with death, I realized bigger numbers really meant nothing.
4716320	4723680	And what was important is that people who have given their heart and their love to me deserve
4723680	4730960	for me to do the same. So there's deep profound truth in that, that everyone should hear and
4730960	4739360	internalize and that's really powerful for you to say that. I have to ask sort of a difficult
4740320	4748800	question here. So I've competed in sports my whole life, looking historically. I'd like to
4749600	4757440	challenge some aspect of that a little bit on the point of hard work, that it feels that there are
4757440	4764560	certain aspects that is the greatest, the most beautiful aspects of human nature is the ability
4764560	4772880	to become obsessed of becoming extremely passionate to the point where yes, flaws are revealed
4773600	4780960	and just giving yourself fully to a task. That is, in another sense, you mentioned love being
4780960	4786800	important, but in another sense, this kind of obsession, this pure exhibition of passion and
4786800	4793120	hard work is truly what it means to be human. What lessons should we take this deeper because
4793120	4799440	you've accomplished incredible things. You say it chasing numbers, but really, there's some incredible
4799440	4808480	work there. So how do you think about that? When you look back in your 20s, your 30s, what would
4808480	4814480	you do differently? Would you really take back some of the incredible hard work?
4815280	4824800	I would, but it's in percentages. We're both computer scientists. So I think when one balances
4824800	4831920	one's life, when one is younger, you might give a smaller percentage to family, but you would still
4831920	4836800	give them high priority. And when you get older, you would give a larger percentage to them and
4836800	4842800	still the high priority. And when you're near retirement, you give most of it to them and the
4842800	4850000	highest priority. So I think the key point is not that we would work 20 hours less for the whole
4850000	4858800	life and just spend it aimlessly with the family, but that when the family has a need, when your
4858800	4865520	wife is having a baby, when your daughter has a birthday, or when they're depressed, or when
4865520	4870720	they're celebrating something, or when they have a get together, or when we have family time,
4871360	4880320	that it's important for us to put down our phone and PC and be 100% with them. And that priority
4881200	4889440	on the things that really matter isn't going to be so taxing that it would eliminate or even
4889440	4895360	dramatically reduce our accomplishments. It might have some impact, but it might also have other
4895360	4900480	impact because if you have a happier family, maybe you fight less. If you fight less, you don't
4900480	4907760	spend time taking care of all the aftermath of a fight. So it's unclear that it would take more
4907760	4915280	time. And if it did, I'd be willing to take that reduction. And it's not a dramatic number,
4915280	4921440	but it's a number that I think would give me a greater degree of happiness and knowing that
4921520	4929280	I've done the right thing and still have plenty of hours to get the success that I want to get.
4929920	4936320	So given the many successful companies that you've launched and much success throughout your career,
4937680	4946720	what advice would you give to young people today looking, or it doesn't have to be young,
4946720	4953600	but people today looking to launch and to create the next $1 billion tech startup or even AI-based
4953600	4963680	startup? I would suggest that people understand technology waves move quickly. What worked two
4963680	4970960	years ago may not work today. And that is very much a case in point for AI. I think two years ago,
4971600	4976720	or maybe three years ago, you certainly could say, I have a couple of super smart PhDs,
4977360	4983120	and we're not sure what we're going to do, but here's how we're going to start and get funding
4983120	4990400	for a very high valuation. Those days are over because AI is going from rocket science towards
4990400	4999680	mainstream, not yet commodity, but more mainstream. So first, the creation of any company to
4999680	5008240	venture capitalists has to be creation of business value and monetary value. And when you have a very
5008240	5017200	scarce commodity, VCs may be willing to accept greater uncertainty. But now the number of people
5017200	5023760	who have the equivalent of PhD three years ago, because that can be learned more quickly,
5023760	5030320	platforms are emerging, the cost to become an AI engineer is much lower, and there are many more
5030320	5036560	AI engineers. So the market is different. So I would suggest someone who wants to build an AI
5036560	5045120	company be thinking about the normal business questions. What customer cases are you trying to
5045120	5050800	address? What kind of pain are you trying to address? How does that translate to value?
5050800	5058400	How will you extract value and get paid through what channel? And how much business value will
5058400	5066640	get created? That today needs to be thought about much earlier up front than it did three years ago.
5066640	5073440	The scarcity question of AI talent has changed. The number of AI talent has changed. So now you
5073440	5080560	need not just AI, but also understanding of business customer and the marketplace.
5081920	5092160	So I also think you should have a more reasonable valuation expectation and growth expectation.
5092160	5097760	There's going to be more competition. But the good news, though, is that AI technologies
5097760	5106080	are now more available in open source. TensorFlow, PyTorch and such tools are much easier to use.
5106640	5114400	So you should be able to experiment and get results iteratively faster than before. So
5115200	5122240	take more of a business mindset to this. Think less of this as a laboratory taken
5122240	5128720	into a company because we've gone beyond that stage. The only exception is if you truly have a
5128720	5135040	breakthrough in some technology that really no one has, then the old way still works. But I think
5135040	5141920	that's harder and harder now. So I know you believe, as many do, that we're far from creating an
5141920	5150720	artificial general intelligence system. But say once we do, and you get to ask her one question,
5151280	5152720	what would that question be?
5157520	5159840	What is it that differentiates you and me?
5162080	5165600	Beautifully put. Kaifu, thank you so much for your time today.
5165600	5166320	Thank you.
