00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar-winning actor who

00:05.040 --> 00:11.360
has starred in seven The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, and House of Cards.

00:11.360 --> 00:17.140
He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting performances of characters who often

00:17.140 --> 00:20.920
embody the dark side of human nature.

00:20.920 --> 00:25.960
Seven years ago, he was cut from House of Cards and canceled by Hollywood in the world when

00:25.960 --> 00:32.520
Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually abused him in 1986.

00:32.520 --> 00:38.920
Anthony Rapp then filed a civil lawsuit seeking $40 million.

00:38.920 --> 00:46.280
In this trial, and all civil and criminal trials that followed, Kevin was acquitted.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.280
He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.920
In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do.

00:57.920 --> 01:03.320
I also encourage you to listen to Kevin's Dan Wooten and Allison Pearson interviews

01:03.320 --> 01:09.360
for additional details and responses to the allegations.

01:09.360 --> 01:16.320
As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life

01:16.440 --> 01:22.520
is that I will talk with everyone, with empathy and with backbone.

01:22.520 --> 01:28.040
For each guest, I hope to explore their life's work, life's story, and what and how they

01:28.040 --> 01:35.160
think, and do so honestly and fully, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance, and

01:35.160 --> 01:36.840
the flaws.

01:36.840 --> 01:43.160
I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to a worse possible caricature

01:43.160 --> 01:45.200
of their sins either.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.480
The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too often does, often rushing to a final

01:50.480 --> 01:53.120
judgment before the facts are in.

01:53.120 --> 02:00.560
I will try to do better than that, to respect due process, in service of the truth.

02:00.560 --> 02:05.320
And I hope to have the courage to always think independently and to speak honestly, from

02:05.320 --> 02:10.360
the heart, even when the eyes of the outraged mob are on me.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.920
Again, my goal is to understand human beings, at their best and at their worst.

02:16.920 --> 02:23.280
And hope is such an understanding leads to more compassion and wisdom in the world.

02:23.280 --> 02:31.400
I will make mistakes, and when I do, I will work hard to improve.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.840
I love you all.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.480
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.720
And now, dear friends, here's Kevin Spacey.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.480
You played a serial killer in the movie Seven.

02:48.480 --> 02:55.320
Your performance was one of, if not the greatest portrayal of a murderer on screen ever.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.560
What was your process of becoming him?

02:57.560 --> 03:00.080
John Doe, the serial killer.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.960
The truth is, I didn't get the part.

03:04.960 --> 03:11.600
I had been in Los Angeles making a couple of films, Swimming of Sharks and Usual Suspects.

03:11.600 --> 03:18.160
And then I did a film called Outbreak that Morgan Freeman was in.

03:18.160 --> 03:29.800
And I went in to audition for David Fincher in probably late November of 94.

03:29.800 --> 03:34.080
And I auditioned for this part and didn't get it.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.360
And I went back to New York.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.960
And I think they started shooting like December 12th.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.960
And I'm in New York.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.120
I'm back in my wonderful apartment on West 12th Street, and my mom has come to visit

03:50.120 --> 03:51.680
for Christmas.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.440
And it's December 23rd.

03:54.440 --> 03:59.040
And it's like seven o'clock at night, and my phone rings.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.880
And it's Arnold Copelson, who's the producer of Seven.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.840
And he's very jovial, and he's very friendly, and he says, how are you doing?

04:07.840 --> 04:08.840
And I said, fine.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.520
And he said, listen, do you remember that film you came in for, Seven?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.040
And I said, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

04:14.040 --> 04:20.280
He goes, well, it turns out that we hired an actor and we started shooting.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.440
And then yesterday, David fired him.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.360
And David would like you to get on a plane on Sunday and come to Los Angeles and start

04:29.360 --> 04:32.560
shooting on Tuesday.

04:32.560 --> 04:41.520
And I was like, OK, would it be imposing to say, can I read it again?

04:41.520 --> 04:45.640
Because it's been a while now, and I'd like to.

04:45.640 --> 04:49.040
So they sent a script over.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.960
I read the script that night.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.680
I thought about it.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.040
And I had this feeling.

05:00.040 --> 05:09.840
I can't even quite describe it, but I had this feeling that it would be really good

05:09.840 --> 05:14.480
if I didn't take billing in the film.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.560
And the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the time this film would come out,

05:18.560 --> 05:24.360
it would be the last one of the three movies that I just shot, the fourth one.

05:24.360 --> 05:29.880
And if any of those films broke through or did well, if it was going to be Brad Pitt

05:29.880 --> 05:34.280
and Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, and you don't show up for the first

05:34.280 --> 05:38.560
25, 30, 40 minutes, people are going to figure out who you're playing.

05:38.560 --> 05:45.600
So people should know that you play the serial killer in the movie and the serial killer

05:45.600 --> 05:49.120
shows up more than halfway through the movie.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
Very late in the movie.

05:50.120 --> 05:55.320
And when you say billing, it's like the posters, the VHS cover and everything.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.320
You're gone.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.320
You're not there.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.320
Not there.

05:58.320 --> 06:04.480
The Green Line Cinema told me to go fuck myself, that they absolutely could use my picture

06:04.480 --> 06:06.400
and my image and all that.

06:06.400 --> 06:12.120
And this became a little bit of a, I'd say, 24-hour conversation.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.840
And it was Fincher who said, I actually think this is a really cool idea.

06:16.840 --> 06:24.840
So the compromise was, I'm the first credit at the end of the movie when the credits start.

06:24.840 --> 06:31.800
So I got on a plane on that Sunday and I flew to Los Angeles and I went into where they

06:31.800 --> 06:36.320
were shooting and I went into the makeup room and David Fincher was there and we were talking

06:36.320 --> 06:44.360
about what should I do, how should I look and I just had my hair short for outbreak

06:44.360 --> 06:51.520
because I was playing a military character and I just looked at the hairdresser and I

06:51.520 --> 06:53.160
said, do you have a razor?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.800
And Fincher went, are you kidding?

06:55.800 --> 06:58.200
And I said, no.

06:58.200 --> 07:02.440
He goes, if you shave your head, I'll shave mine.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.160
So we both shaved our heads.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.440
And then I started shooting the next day.

07:09.440 --> 07:17.600
So my long-winded answer to your question is that I didn't have that much time to think

07:17.600 --> 07:22.120
about how to build that character.

07:22.120 --> 07:33.120
What I think in the end Fincher was able to do so brilliantly with such terror was to set

07:33.120 --> 07:37.760
the audience up to meet this character.

07:37.760 --> 07:44.400
I think the last scene, the ending scene and the car ride leading up to it where it's mostly

07:44.400 --> 07:51.800
on you in conversation with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is one of the greatest scenes

07:51.800 --> 07:53.680
in film history.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.080
So people somehow didn't see the movie.

07:56.080 --> 08:01.120
There's these five murders that happen that are inspired by five of the seven deadly sins

08:01.120 --> 08:07.960
and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins.

08:07.960 --> 08:16.200
And there's this calm subtlety about you and your performance is just terrifying.

08:16.200 --> 08:24.080
Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but in the contrast

08:24.080 --> 08:30.280
is the terrifying sense that you get in the audience that builds up to the twist at the

08:30.280 --> 08:36.720
end or the surprise at the end with the famous What's in the Box from Brad Pitt.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.240
Brad Pitt's character's wife, her head.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.240
Yeah.

08:42.240 --> 08:47.880
I can really only tell you that while we were shooting that scene in the car, while we were

08:47.880 --> 08:55.640
out in the desert in that place where all those electrical wires were, David just kept

08:55.640 --> 09:01.520
saying less, do less.

09:01.520 --> 09:10.240
And I just tried to, I mean, I remember he kept saying to me, remember, you're in control.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.800
Like you're going to win.

09:13.800 --> 09:20.040
And knowing that should allow you to have tremendous confidence.

09:20.040 --> 09:30.760
And I just followed that lead and I just think it's the kind of film that so many of

09:30.760 --> 09:37.320
the elements that had been at work from the beginning of the movie, in terms of its style,

09:37.320 --> 09:42.680
in terms of how he built this terror, in terms of how he built for the audience a sense of

09:42.680 --> 09:50.360
this person being one of the scariest people they might ever encounter, it really allowed

09:50.360 --> 09:58.760
me to be able to not have to do that much, just say the words and mean them.

09:58.760 --> 10:13.000
And I think it also is, it's an example of what makes tragedy so difficult.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.960
I mean, very often tragedy is people operating without enough information.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.000
They don't have all the facts, Romeo and Juliet.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
They don't have all the facts.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.520
They don't know what we know as an audience.

10:29.040 --> 10:40.200
So in the end, whether Brad Pitt's character ends up shooting John Doe or turning the gun

10:40.200 --> 10:45.400
on himself, which was a discussion, I mean, there were a number of alternative endings

10:45.400 --> 10:49.360
that were discussed.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.960
Nothing ends up being tied up in a nice little bow.

10:52.960 --> 11:03.840
It is complicated and shows how nobody wins in the end when you're not operating with

11:03.840 --> 11:05.280
all the information.

11:05.280 --> 11:16.200
When you say, say the words and mean them, what does mean them mean?

11:16.200 --> 11:25.840
I've been very fortunate to be directed by Fincher a couple of times and he would say

11:25.840 --> 11:33.440
to me sometimes, I don't believe a thing that is coming out of your mouth.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.320
Shall we try it again?

11:37.320 --> 11:43.040
And you go, okay, yeah, we can try it again.

11:43.040 --> 11:54.520
And sometimes he'll do take and then you'll look to see if he has any added genius to hand

11:54.520 --> 11:55.520
you.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.760
And he just goes, let's do it again and then let's do it again.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.960
And sometimes I say this in all humility.

12:03.960 --> 12:09.120
He's literally trying to beat the acting out of you.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.920
And by continually saying, do it again, do it again, do it again, and not giving you

12:12.920 --> 12:26.120
any specifics, he is systematically shredding you of all pretense of all, because look,

12:26.120 --> 12:30.120
very often, you know, actors would come in on the set and we've thought about the scene

12:30.120 --> 12:33.480
and we've worked out, you know, I've got this prop and I'm gonna do this thing with a can

12:33.480 --> 12:38.800
and you know, all these things, all the tea, I'm gonna do a thing with that thing.

12:38.800 --> 12:44.680
And David is the kind of director where he just wants you to stop adding all that crap

12:44.680 --> 12:50.880
and just say the words and say them quickly and mean them.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.560
And it takes a while to get to that place.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.200
I'll tell you a story.

12:56.200 --> 13:02.120
This is a story I just love because it's in the exactly the same wheelhouse.

13:02.120 --> 13:06.800
So Jack Lemmon's first movie was a film called It Should Happen to You and it was directed

13:06.800 --> 13:08.040
by George Kuecher.

13:08.040 --> 13:13.120
And Jack tells the story and it was just an incredibly charming story to hear Jack tell.

13:13.120 --> 13:18.760
He said, so I'm doing his picture and let me tell you, this is a terrific part for me

13:18.760 --> 13:19.840
and I'm doing a scene.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.840
It's on my first day.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.080
It's in my first day and it's a terrific scene.

13:23.080 --> 13:27.320
And he goes, we do the first take and George Kuecher comes up to me and he says, Jack,

13:27.320 --> 13:31.120
I said, yeah, he said, could you do, let's do another one, but just do a little less

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
in this one.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.040
And Jack said, a little less, a little less than what I just did.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.320
He said, yeah, just a little less.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.440
So he goes, we do another take and I think, boy, that was it.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.400
I mean, let's just go home.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.360
And Kuecher walked up to him and said, Jack, let's do another one.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.000
This time just a little bit less.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.280
And Jack said, less than what I just did now.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.520
He said, yeah, just a little bit less.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
He goes, oh, okay.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.240
So he did another take and Kuecher came up and he said, Jack, just a little bit less.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.200
And Jack said, a little less than what I just did.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
He said, yes.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.200
He said, well, if I do any less, I'm not going to be acting.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.080
And Kuecher said, exactly, Jack, exactly.

14:06.840 --> 14:12.520
I mean, I guess what you're saying is it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom

14:12.520 --> 14:19.240
of a little less because the power, if we just stick even on seven of your

14:19.240 --> 14:21.920
performance is in the tiniest of subtleties.

14:22.160 --> 14:27.000
Like when you say, oh, you didn't know, and you turn your head a little bit and

14:27.000 --> 14:35.280
a little bit like the little bit, maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.240
That's subtlety.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.280
That's less.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.840
That's hard to get to, I suppose.

14:40.040 --> 14:40.360
Yeah.

14:40.960 --> 14:48.560
And also because I so well remember, I think the work that Brad did and also

14:48.560 --> 14:52.160
Morgan did in that scene, but the work that Brad had to do, where he had to go.

14:52.920 --> 14:56.480
I remember rehearsing with him as we were all staying at this little hotel

14:56.480 --> 14:57.600
nearby that location.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.440
And we rehearsed the night before we started shooting that sequence.

15:00.440 --> 15:09.360
And I just, I mean, it was just incredible to see the levels of emotions he had to go

15:09.360 --> 15:13.800
through and then the decision of what do I do?

15:15.240 --> 15:17.760
Because if I do what he wants me to do, then he wins.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.160
But if I don't do it, then I'm, what kind of a man, husband am I?

15:22.360 --> 15:24.840
I just thought he did really incredible work.

15:24.920 --> 15:33.120
So it was also not easy to not react to the power of what he was throwing at me.

15:34.520 --> 15:39.200
I just thought it was an extraordinary, a really extraordinary scene.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.040
So what's it like being in that scene?

15:41.040 --> 15:47.440
So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is going over the top, just having

15:47.440 --> 15:53.800
a mental breakdown and is weighing these extremely difficult moral choices, as you're

15:53.800 --> 16:01.480
saying, but he's like screaming and in pain and tormented while you're very subtly smiling.

16:02.600 --> 16:06.680
In terms of the writing and in terms of what the characters had to do is it was an

16:06.680 --> 16:15.520
incredible culmination of how this character could manipulate in the way that he did.

16:15.840 --> 16:20.840
And, and in the end, succeed.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.280
You mentioned Fincher likes to do a lot of takes.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.720
That's the, the famous thing about David Fincher.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.960
So what are the pros and cons of that?

16:30.480 --> 16:34.400
I think I read that he does some crazy amount.

16:34.800 --> 16:41.600
He averages 25 to 65 takes and most directors do less than 10.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.080
So.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.440
Yeah, sometimes it's timing.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.040
Sometimes it's literally, he has a stopwatch and he's, he's timing it.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.280
He's timing how long a scene is taking.

16:53.200 --> 16:58.320
And then he'll say, you need to take a minute off this scene.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.560
Like a minute, yeah, a minute off this scene.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.920
I want it to move like this.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.360
So let's pick it up.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.280
Let's pick up the pace.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.320
Let's take, let's see if we can take a minute off.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.640
Why the speed?

17:10.640 --> 17:13.600
Why, why say it fast is the important thing for him, you think?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.960
I think because Fincher hates indulgence.

17:21.040 --> 17:27.240
And he wants, he wants people to talk the way they do in life, which is, you know, we

17:27.240 --> 17:34.560
don't take big dramatic pauses, you know, before we speak, we speak, we say what we want.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.200
We, you know.

17:36.040 --> 17:40.840
And I guess actors like the dramatic pauses and the, the, the indulge in the dramatic

17:40.840 --> 17:40.880
pauses.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.520
They didn't always like the dramatic pauses.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.800
I mean, look, you didn't want to, you go back any student of acting, you go back to

17:46.800 --> 17:49.320
the 30s and the 40s, 50s.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.920
The speed at which actors spoke, not just in the comedies, which of course, you know,

17:57.920 --> 18:02.520
you look at any Preston Sturges movie and it's incredible how fast people are talking

18:02.520 --> 18:07.440
and how, and how funny things are when they happen that fast.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.360
But then, you know, acting styles changed.

18:12.360 --> 18:19.160
We got into a different kind of thing in the late fifties and sixties and, and, you know,

18:19.200 --> 18:25.240
a lot of actors are feeling it, which is, I'm not saying it's, it's a, it's a bad thing.

18:25.240 --> 18:34.360
It's just that if you want to keep an audience engaged as Fincher does, and I believe

18:34.400 --> 18:47.520
successfully does in all of his work, pace, timing, movement, clarity, speed are admirable

18:48.160 --> 18:48.840
to achieve.

18:49.440 --> 18:53.920
And all of that, he wants the actor to be as natural as possible, to strip away all

18:53.920 --> 18:57.920
the bullshit of acting and become human.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.200
Look, I've been lucky with other directors.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.760
Sam Mendes is similar.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.240
I remember when I walked in to maybe the first rehearsal for Richard, the third that

19:06.240 --> 19:14.240
we were doing, I had brought with me a canopy of, of ailments that my Richard was

19:14.240 --> 19:21.640
going to suffer from, and Sam, you know, eventually whittled it down to like three,

19:21.640 --> 19:25.120
like maybe your arm and maybe thing, and maybe your leg.

19:25.320 --> 19:29.480
But let's get rid of the other 10 things that you brought into the room because I was,

19:29.480 --> 19:32.880
you know, I was so excited to, you know, capture this character.

19:32.880 --> 19:39.480
So, you know, very often, Trevor, known as this way, a lot, a lot of wonderful directors

19:39.520 --> 19:45.120
I've worked with, they're really good at helping you trim and edit.

19:46.280 --> 19:52.440
David Fincher said about you, he's talking in general, I think, but also specifically

19:52.440 --> 19:57.760
in the moment of House of Cards said that you have exceptional skill both as an actor

19:57.800 --> 20:02.480
and as a performer, which he says are different things.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.920
So he defines the former as dramatization of a text and the latter as the

20:06.960 --> 20:08.400
seduction of an audience.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.320
Do you see wisdom in that distinction?

20:14.400 --> 20:19.840
And what does it take to do both the dramatization of a text and the seduction of an audience?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.160
Those are two very interesting descriptions.

20:25.120 --> 20:32.080
When I think, I guess when I think performer, I tend to think entertaining.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.040
I tend to think, I tend to think comedy.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.840
I tend to think winning over an audience.

20:36.840 --> 20:48.160
I tend to think that there's something about that quality of wanting to have people enjoy

20:48.160 --> 20:49.160
themselves.

20:51.360 --> 21:01.000
And when you saddle that against what maybe he means as an actor, which is more dramatic

21:01.000 --> 21:13.080
or more text driven, more, look, I've always believed that my job, not every actor feels

21:13.080 --> 21:17.120
this way, but my job, the way that I've looked at it is that my job is to serve the writing.

21:19.720 --> 21:26.520
And that if I serve the writing, I will in a sense serve myself because I'll be in the

21:26.520 --> 21:30.280
right world, I'll be in the right context, I'll be in the right style.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.080
I'll have embraced what a director's, you know, it's not my painting.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.240
It's someone else's painting.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.440
I'm a series of colors and someone else's painting.

21:41.600 --> 21:52.440
And the barometer for me has always been that when people stop me and talk to me about a

21:52.440 --> 22:00.360
character I've played and reference their name as if they actually exist, that's when I feel

22:00.360 --> 22:02.120
like I've gotten close to doing my job.

22:03.880 --> 22:09.000
Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation is remembering that your name is

22:09.000 --> 22:18.360
Kevin, not Frank or John or any of these characters because they live deeply in the psyche.

22:18.440 --> 22:26.680
To me, that's the greatest compliment for me as an actor.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.840
I love being able to go.

22:30.840 --> 22:39.960
I mean, when I think about performers who inspire me and I remember when I was young

22:39.960 --> 22:46.040
and I was introduced to Spencer Tracey, Henry Fonda, Catherine Hepburn,

22:47.080 --> 22:48.680
I just, I believed who they were.

22:48.680 --> 22:49.720
I knew nothing about them.

22:49.720 --> 22:54.600
They were just these extraordinary characters doing this extraordinary stuff.

22:55.160 --> 23:04.600
And then I think more recently contemporary when I think of the work that Philip Seymour

23:04.600 --> 23:11.960
Hoffman did and Heath Ledger and people that when I think about what they could be doing,

23:11.960 --> 23:16.200
what they could do, what they would have done had they stayed with us.

23:18.440 --> 23:25.480
I'm so excited when I go into a cinema or I go into a play and I completely am taken

23:26.360 --> 23:32.840
to some place that I believe exists and characters that become real.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.920
And those characters become lifelong companions.

23:36.920 --> 23:41.800
Like for me, they travel with you and even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature,

23:41.800 --> 23:42.520
they're always there.

23:44.760 --> 23:51.720
I feel like I almost met them and gotten to know them and gotten to become friends with them almost,

23:51.720 --> 23:54.280
Hannibal Lecter or Forrest Gump.

23:55.240 --> 23:59.080
I mean, I feel like I'm like best friends with Forrest Gump.

23:59.080 --> 24:03.080
I know the guy and I guess he's played by some guy named Tom,

24:03.080 --> 24:05.400
but like Forrest Gump is the guy I'm friends with.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.760
And I think everybody feels like that when they're in the audience with great characters.

24:10.760 --> 24:16.680
They just kind of, they become part of you in some way, the good, the bad and the ugly of them.

24:18.040 --> 24:27.000
One of the things that I feel that I try to do in my work is when I read something for the first

24:27.000 --> 24:37.160
time, when I read a script or play, and I am absolutely devastated by it.

24:37.160 --> 24:43.800
It is, it is the most extraordinary, the most beautiful, the most life affirming or terrifying.

24:46.120 --> 24:54.440
It's then a process weirdly of working backwards because I want to work in such a way that

24:54.440 --> 24:57.720
that's the experience I give to the audience when they first see it,

24:58.600 --> 25:02.200
that they have the experience I had when I read it.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.520
I remember that there's been times in the creative process when

25:08.280 --> 25:11.960
something was pointed out to me or something was, I remember I was doing a play

25:12.680 --> 25:19.080
and I was having this really tough time with one of the last scenes in the play and I just

25:19.080 --> 25:23.720
couldn't figure it out. I was in rehearsal and although we had a director in that play,

25:23.800 --> 25:27.800
I called another friend of mine who was also a director and I had him come over and I said,

25:27.800 --> 25:32.920
look, this scene, I'm just having the toughest. I cannot seem to crack this scene.

25:33.960 --> 25:38.680
We read it through a couple of times and then this wonderful director named John Swanbeck

25:39.400 --> 25:41.640
who would eventually direct me in a film called The Big Kahuna.

25:42.280 --> 25:46.920
But this is before that, he said to me the most incredible thing he just said,

25:48.120 --> 25:53.000
all right, what's the last line you have in this scene before you fall over and fall asleep?

25:53.000 --> 26:00.040
And I said, the last line is that last drink, the old KO. And he went, okay,

26:01.640 --> 26:07.720
I want you to think about what that line actually means and then work backwards.

26:10.040 --> 26:16.440
And so he left and I sort of was left with this, what? Like, what does that mean? How am I supposed

26:17.720 --> 26:20.760
to? And then like a couple of days went by, a couple of days went by and I thought,

26:20.760 --> 26:28.120
okay, so I said, what does that line actually mean? Well, that last drink, the old KO. KO

26:29.480 --> 26:39.400
is knockout, which is a boxing term. It's the only boxing term the writer uses in the play.

26:40.040 --> 26:48.440
And then I went back and I realized my friend was so smart and so incredible to have said,

26:48.440 --> 26:53.480
ask a question you haven't thought of asking yet. I realized that the playwright wrote

26:54.040 --> 27:00.840
the last round, the eighth round between these two brothers, and it was a fight, physical as

27:00.840 --> 27:05.320
well as emotional. And when I brought that into the rehearsal room to the directors doing that play,

27:06.440 --> 27:12.040
he liked that idea. And we staged that scene as if it was the eighth round, although the audience

27:12.040 --> 27:18.600
wouldn't have known that. But just what I loved about that was that somebody said to me,

27:20.360 --> 27:24.200
ask yourself a question you haven't asked yourself yet. What does that line mean and

27:24.200 --> 27:31.640
then work backwards? What is that like a catalyst for thinking deeply about what is

27:31.640 --> 27:36.360
magical about this play, this story, this narrative? That's what that is, like thinking

27:36.360 --> 27:41.400
backwards, that's what that does? Yeah. But also because it's this incredible,

27:43.240 --> 27:47.320
why didn't I think to ask that question myself? That's what you have directors for, that's what

27:47.320 --> 27:53.960
you have. So many places where ideas can come from. But that just illustrates that even though in

27:53.960 --> 27:59.880
my brain I go, I always like to work backwards. I missed it in that one and I'm very grateful to

28:00.760 --> 28:07.640
to my friend for having pushed me into being able to realize what that meant and

28:08.600 --> 28:16.120
to ask the interesting question. I like the poetry and the humility of I'm just a series

28:16.120 --> 28:23.800
of collars in someone else's painting. That was a good line. That said, you've talked about

28:23.800 --> 28:28.920
improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again and

28:28.920 --> 28:35.080
yet never make it the same. And you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text.

28:35.800 --> 28:42.520
So where's the room for the improvisation? That it's never the same? Well, there's two

28:42.520 --> 28:50.520
slightly different contexts, I think. One is in the rehearsal room, improvisation can be a wonderful

28:50.520 --> 28:57.880
device. I mean, Sam Mendes, for example, will start, he'll start a scene and he does this wonderful

28:57.880 --> 29:05.000
thing. He brings rugs and he brings chairs and sofas in and he says, well, let's put two chairs

29:05.000 --> 29:09.480
here and here. You guys, let's start in these chairs far apart from each other. Let's see what

29:09.480 --> 29:13.720
happens with the scene if you're that far apart. And so we'll do the scene that way and then he

29:13.720 --> 29:19.560
goes, okay, let's bring a rug in and let's bring these chairs much closer and let's see what happens

29:19.560 --> 29:27.160
if the space between you is. And so then you try it that way. And then it's a little harder in

29:27.160 --> 29:36.680
Shakespeare to improv. But in any situation where you want to try and see where could a scene go,

29:36.680 --> 29:40.440
where would the scene go if I didn't make that choice? Where would the scene go if I made this

29:40.440 --> 29:45.640
choice? Where would the scene go if I didn't say that or I said something else? So that's how improv

29:45.640 --> 30:01.320
can be a valuable process to learn about limits and boundaries and what's going on with a character

30:01.320 --> 30:09.000
that somehow you discover in trying something that isn't on the page. Then there's the different

30:09.000 --> 30:14.680
thing which is the trying to make it fresh and trying to make it new. And that is really a

30:14.680 --> 30:27.080
reference to theater. I'll put it to you this way. Anybody loves sports, right? So you go and you

30:27.080 --> 30:34.280
watch on a pitch, you watch on a tennis game, you watch basketball, you watch football. Yeah,

30:34.280 --> 30:39.320
the rules are the same. But it's a different game every time you're out on that court or on that field.

30:40.200 --> 30:54.600
It's no different in theater. Yes, it's the same lines. Maybe even blocking is similar. But what's

30:54.600 --> 31:04.600
different is attack, intention, how you are growing in a role and watching your fellow actors grow in

31:05.560 --> 31:11.960
theirs and how every night it's a new audience and they're reacting differently. And you literally,

31:12.840 --> 31:23.640
where you can go from week one of performances in a play to week 12 is extraordinary. And the

31:23.640 --> 31:31.480
difference between theater and film is that no matter how good someone might think you are in a

31:31.560 --> 31:40.120
movie, you'll never be any better. It's frozen. Whereas I can be better tomorrow night than I

31:40.120 --> 31:49.880
was tonight. I can be better in a week than I was tonight. It is a living, breathing, shifting,

31:49.880 --> 31:58.040
changing, growing thing every single day. But also in theater, there's no safety net. If you fuck it up,

31:59.000 --> 32:03.480
everybody gets to see you do that. And if you start giggling on stage, everyone gets to see you

32:03.480 --> 32:12.680
do that too, which I am very guilty of. I mean, there is something of a seduction of an audience

32:12.680 --> 32:20.040
in theater even more intense than there is when you're talking about film. I got a chance to watch

32:20.040 --> 32:26.280
the documentary now in the wings on a world stage, which is behind the scenes of you mentioned

32:27.240 --> 32:31.880
you teaming up with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage Richard III,

32:34.040 --> 32:37.080
a play by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn

32:38.120 --> 32:43.960
you haven't really done much Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie. But there's

32:43.960 --> 32:48.760
a lot of interesting behind the scenes stuff there. First of all, the camaraderie of everybody,

32:48.760 --> 32:53.640
how like the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.840
But the another interesting thing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes trying different

32:58.840 --> 33:04.120
stuff. It seemed like everybody was really open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves,

33:04.120 --> 33:12.280
taking risks, all that. I suppose that's part of acting in general, but theater especially.

33:12.280 --> 33:16.280
Just take risks. It's okay to embarrass a shit out of yourself, including the director.

33:17.240 --> 33:25.480
And it's also because you become a family. It's unlike a movie where I might have a scene with

33:25.480 --> 33:29.240
so and so on this day and then another scene with them in a week and a half,

33:29.240 --> 33:34.040
and then that's the only scenes we have in the whole movie together. Every single day

33:35.160 --> 33:40.680
when you show up in the rehearsal room, it's the whole company. You're all up for it every day.

33:40.760 --> 33:49.480
You're learning, you're growing, you're trying, and there is an incredible trust that happens.

33:50.520 --> 33:55.720
And I was of course fortunate that some of the things I learned and observed about

33:57.960 --> 34:01.880
being a part of that family, being included in that family and being a part of creating that

34:01.880 --> 34:08.360
family, I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon who led many companies that I was

34:08.360 --> 34:15.400
fortunate to work in and be a part of. There's also a sad moment where at the end,

34:15.400 --> 34:20.280
everybody is really sad to say goodbye because you do form a family and then it's over.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.000
I guess somebody said that that's just part of theater. It's like,

34:26.120 --> 34:29.080
I mean, they should kind of assume goodbye and that this is it.

34:30.200 --> 34:35.000
Yeah, and also there are sometimes when like six months later, I'll wake up

34:35.080 --> 34:39.160
middle of the night and I'll go, that's how to play that scene.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.280
Oh God, I just finally figured it out.

34:45.640 --> 34:50.040
So maybe you could speak a little bit more to that. What's the difference between film acting and

34:50.040 --> 34:55.400
live theater acting? I don't really think there is any. I think there's just,

34:57.640 --> 35:03.320
you eventually learn about yourself on film, you know, when I first did like my first

35:03.560 --> 35:10.840
episode of The Equalizer, you know, it's just horrible. It's just so bad,

35:11.880 --> 35:17.160
but I didn't know about myself. I didn't slowly begin to learn about yourself, but

35:18.280 --> 35:23.960
I think good acting is good acting. And I think that, you know, if a camera's right here, you

35:23.960 --> 35:30.200
know that your front row is also your back row. You just don't have to do so much.

35:30.200 --> 35:39.000
There is in theater a particular kind of energy, almost like an athlete,

35:39.560 --> 35:45.960
that you have to have vocally to be able to get up seven performances a week and never lose your

35:45.960 --> 35:49.480
voice and always be there and always be alive and always be doing the best work you can,

35:50.040 --> 35:53.880
that you just don't require in film. You know, you don't have to have the same,

35:54.120 --> 36:03.640
it just doesn't require the same kind of stamina that doing a play does.

36:04.360 --> 36:09.640
It just feels like also in theater, you have to become the character more intensely because

36:10.600 --> 36:14.440
you can't take a break. You can't take a bathroom break. You're like on stage.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.400
There's no, this is you. Yeah, but you have no idea what's going on on stage with the actors.

36:19.400 --> 36:26.440
I mean, I have literally laughed through speeches that I had to give because

36:26.440 --> 36:31.400
my fellow actors were putting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever

36:31.400 --> 36:35.960
they were doing to make me laugh. So they're just having fun. They're having the time of their life.

36:35.960 --> 36:41.640
And by the way, Judy Dench is the worst giggler of all. I mean, they had to bring the curtain down

36:41.640 --> 36:47.160
on her and Maggie Smith because they were laughing so hard, they could not continue the play.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.760
So even when you're doing like a dramatic monologue still, they're still fucking with you.

36:50.760 --> 36:56.920
There's stuff. Okay, that's great. That's good to know. You also said an interesting line that

36:56.920 --> 37:09.560
improvisation helps you learn about the character. Can you explain that? So like through maybe playing

37:09.560 --> 37:15.480
with the different ways of saying the words or the different ways to bring the words to life,

37:16.040 --> 37:19.640
you get to learn about yourself, about the character you're playing.

37:19.640 --> 37:29.320
It can be helpful. But improv is, I'm such a big believer in the writing and in serving the writing

37:29.320 --> 37:36.280
and doing the words the writer wrote. That improv for me, unless you're just doing like

37:36.280 --> 37:42.600
comedy and you know, like, I mean, I love improv and in comedy, it's brilliant. So much fun to

37:42.600 --> 37:48.760
watch people just come up with something right there. But that's where you're looking for laughs

37:48.760 --> 37:56.920
and you're specifically in a little scene that's being created. But I think improv has had value.

37:59.640 --> 38:09.720
But I have not experienced it as much in doing plays as I have sometimes in doing film where

38:10.040 --> 38:15.320
you'll start off rehearsing and a director may say, let's just go off book and see what happens.

38:15.960 --> 38:21.800
And I've had moments in film where someone went off book and it was terrifying.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.480
There was a scene I had in Glen Gary Glen Ross

38:30.040 --> 38:37.640
where the character I play has fucked something up, just screwed something up and Pacino is livid.

38:37.960 --> 38:45.720
And so we had the scene where Al is walking like this and the camera is moving with him

38:46.680 --> 38:56.120
and he is chewing me a new asshole. And in the middle of the take Al starts talking about me.

38:58.280 --> 39:05.880
Oh, Kevin, you don't think we know how you got this job? You don't think we know

39:05.880 --> 39:11.080
who's dick you've been sucking on to get this part in this movie? And I'm now,

39:12.600 --> 39:19.400
I'm literally like, I don't know what the hell is happening, but I'm reacting.

39:21.240 --> 39:28.760
We got to the end of that take. Al walked up to me and went, oh, that was so good. Oh my god,

39:28.760 --> 39:34.360
that was so good. Just so you know, the sound, I asked them not to record. So you have no dialogue.

39:34.360 --> 39:41.480
So it's just me. Oh, that was so good. You look like a car wreck. And I was like, yeah.

39:43.240 --> 39:50.680
And it was actually an incredibly generous thing that he gave me so that I would react.

39:51.720 --> 39:58.520
Oh, wow. Did they use that shot? Because you were in the shot. It was my close-up.

39:58.760 --> 40:03.000
Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that's the take. That was an intense, right? I mean,

40:03.000 --> 40:08.520
what was it like if we can just linger on that, just that intense scene with Al Pacino?

40:10.040 --> 40:14.920
Well, he's the reason I got the movie. A lot of people might think because Jack was in the film

40:14.920 --> 40:19.480
that he had something to do with it. But actually, I was doing a play called Lost in Yonkers on

40:19.480 --> 40:24.440
Broadway. And we had the same dresser who worked with him, a girl named Laura. It was wonderful.

40:25.400 --> 40:33.160
Laura Beattie. And she told Al that he should come and see this play because she wanted to see

40:33.160 --> 40:40.040
me in this play. I was playing this gangster's fun, fun, fun part. So I didn't know Pacino came

40:40.040 --> 40:45.160
on some night and saw this play. And then like three days later, I got a call to come in and

40:45.160 --> 40:50.120
auditioned for this Glenn Gray, Glenn Ross, which of course I knew is a play, David Mambis play.

40:50.840 --> 40:59.400
And then I auditioned. Jamie Foley was the director who would eventually direct a bunch of House of

40:59.400 --> 41:06.440
Cards. Wonderful, wonderful guy. And I got the part. Well, I didn't quite get the part. They were

41:06.440 --> 41:11.880
going to bring together the actors that they thought they were going to give the parts to on a Saturday

41:11.880 --> 41:17.000
at Al's office. And they asked me if I would come and do a read through. And I said, who's going to

41:17.960 --> 41:22.280
be there? And they said, well, so-and-so-and-so-and-so-and-so. And Jack Lemon is flying in. And I said,

41:22.280 --> 41:27.560
don't tell Mr. Lemon that I'm doing the read through. Is that possible? And I'm like, sure.

41:28.120 --> 41:34.200
So I'll never forget this. Jack was sitting in the chair in Pacino's office doing the New

41:34.200 --> 41:39.880
York Times crossword puzzle as he did every day. And I walked in the door and he went, oh, Jesus

41:39.880 --> 41:45.640
Christ. Is it possible you could get a job without me? Jesus Christ. I'm so tired of holding up your

41:45.640 --> 41:55.080
end of it. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. So I got the job because of Pacino. And it was really one of the

41:55.080 --> 42:01.480
first major roles that I ever had in a film. And to be working with that group.

42:02.360 --> 42:09.960
Yeah, that's one of the greatest ensemble casts ever. We got Al Pacino, Jack Lemon,

42:10.760 --> 42:19.960
Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, you, Jonathan Price. It's just incredible. And I would have to

42:19.960 --> 42:25.240
say, I mean, maybe you can comment. You've talked about how much of a mentor and a friend Jack

42:25.240 --> 42:30.040
Lemon has been. That's one of his greatest performances ever. Ever. You have a scene at

42:30.040 --> 42:35.400
the end of the movie with him. That was really powerful. Like firing on all cylinders. You're

42:36.360 --> 42:42.520
playing the stain to perfection. And he's playing desperation to perfection.

42:43.480 --> 42:48.360
What a scene. What was that like? Just like at the top of your game, the two of you. Well,

42:48.360 --> 42:54.120
by that time, we had done Long Day's Journey Tonight in the theater. We'd done a mini series

42:54.120 --> 43:01.000
called The Murder of Mary Fagan on NBC. We'd done a film called Dad, that Gary David Goldberg directed

43:01.960 --> 43:08.360
with Ted Danson. So this was the fourth time we were working together and we knew each other.

43:08.360 --> 43:15.160
We'd become, he'd become my father figure. And I don't know if you know that I originally met

43:15.160 --> 43:21.160
Jack Lemon when I was very, very young. He was doing a production at the Mark Taper

43:21.160 --> 43:26.840
Forum of a Chateau Casey play called Juno and the Peacock with Walter Matthew and Maureen Stapleton.

43:26.840 --> 43:36.360
And on a Saturday in December of 1974, my junior high school drama class went to a workshop. It was

43:36.360 --> 43:43.080
called How to Audition. And we did this workshop. Many schools in Southern California were part

43:43.080 --> 43:47.640
of this Drama Teachers Association. So we got these incredible experiences of being able to go

43:47.640 --> 43:52.680
see professional productions and be involved in these workshops or festivals. So I had to get up

43:52.680 --> 43:59.320
and do a monologue in front of Mr. Lemon when I was 13 years old. And he walked up to me at the

43:59.320 --> 44:03.640
end of that and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, that was a touch of terrific. He said,

44:03.640 --> 44:08.200
no, everything I've been talking about, you just did. What's your name? I said, Kevin, he said,

44:08.200 --> 44:11.480
let me tell you something. When you get finished with high school, as I'm sure you're going to go

44:11.480 --> 44:15.080
on and do theater, you should go to New York and you should study to be an actor because this is

44:15.080 --> 44:24.920
what you're meant to do with your life. And he was like an idol. And 12 years later, I read in

44:24.920 --> 44:28.760
the New York Times that he was coming to Broadway to do this production of A Long Day's Journey

44:28.760 --> 44:35.880
tonight, a year and some months after I read this article, and I was like, I'm going to play Jamie in

44:35.880 --> 44:44.600
that production. And I then, with a lot of opposition, the cast and director didn't want to

44:44.600 --> 44:52.120
see me. They said that the director, Jonathan Miller, wanted movie actors to play the two sons.

44:53.960 --> 45:00.280
And ultimately, I found out that Jonathan Miller, the director, was coming to New York to do a

45:00.280 --> 45:08.680
series of lectures at Alice Tully Hall. And I went to try to figure out how I could maybe meet him.

45:09.960 --> 45:16.760
And I was sitting in that theater listening to this incredible lecture he was doing, and sitting

45:16.760 --> 45:25.160
next to me was an elderly woman. I mean, elderly, 80 something, and she was asleep.

45:25.960 --> 45:35.400
But sticking out of her handbag, which was on the floor, was an invitation to a cocktail reception

45:35.400 --> 45:44.600
on her, Dr. Jonathan Miller. And so I thought, you know, she's tired. She's probably going to go home.

45:45.000 --> 45:53.000
So I took that and walked into this cocktail reception, and ultimately went over to Dr. Miller,

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
who was incredibly kind, and said, sit down, always very curious, what brings young people

45:59.000 --> 46:04.920
to my lectures? And I said to him, Eugene O'Neill brought me here. And he was like, what? I've always

46:04.920 --> 46:11.640
wanted to meet him. Where is he? And I told him that I'd been trying for seven months to get

46:12.040 --> 46:19.320
an audition for a long day's journey, and that his American cast directors were telling my agents

46:19.320 --> 46:24.760
that he wanted big American movie stars. And at that moment, he turned and he saw

46:25.720 --> 46:31.480
one of those cast directors who was there that night. So I knew he was going to be in New York

46:31.480 --> 46:39.240
starting auditions that week. And she was staring daggers at me. And he just got it.

46:40.200 --> 46:45.320
And he said, someone have a pen. And he took the paper and started writing. He said, listen,

46:45.320 --> 46:50.040
Kevin, there are many situations in which casting directors have a lot of say and a lot of power

46:50.040 --> 46:54.440
and a lot of leverage. And then there are other situations where they just take directors' messages.

46:54.440 --> 46:57.960
And on this one, they're taking my messages. This is where I'm staying. Make sure you people get to

46:57.960 --> 47:05.240
me. We start auditions on Thursday. And on Thursday, I had an opportunity to come in and audition

47:06.120 --> 47:14.120
for this play that I've been working on and preparing. And at the end of it, I did four scenes

47:14.120 --> 47:18.920
at the end of it. He said to me that unless someone else came in and blew him against the wall,

47:18.920 --> 47:23.960
like I had just done, as far as he was concerned, I pretty much had the part, but I couldn't tell

47:23.960 --> 47:29.320
my agents that yet because I had to come back and read with Mr. Lemon. And so three months later,

47:29.320 --> 47:37.320
in August of 1985, I found myself in a room with Jack Lemon again at 890 Broadway, which is where

47:37.320 --> 47:43.160
they rehearsed a lot of Broadway plays. And we did four scenes together and I was toppling over him.

47:43.160 --> 47:49.640
I was pushing him. I was relentless. And I'll never forget at the end of that.

47:53.320 --> 47:57.160
Lemon came over to me. He put his hand on my shoulder and he said, that would you touch it?

47:57.160 --> 48:01.080
Terrific. I never thought we'd find the rotten kid, but he's it. Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?

48:03.400 --> 48:11.480
And I ended up spending the next year of my life with that man. So it turns out he was right.

48:14.360 --> 48:21.880
Yeah. This world works in mysterious ways. It also speaks to the fact of the power of somebody

48:21.880 --> 48:27.960
you look up to giving words of encouragement, because those can just reverberate through your

48:27.960 --> 48:34.920
whole life and just make the path clear. I've always, we used to joke that if every

48:34.920 --> 48:38.440
contract came with a Jack Lemon clause, it would be a more beautiful world.

48:40.120 --> 48:46.520
Beautifully said. Jack Lemon is one of the greatest actors ever. What do you think makes him so damn good?

48:47.400 --> 48:49.400
Wow.

48:55.640 --> 49:05.480
I think he truly set out in his life to accomplish what his father said to him on his deathbed.

49:07.240 --> 49:11.080
His father was died. His father was, by the way, called the Donut King in Boston.

49:11.400 --> 49:18.600
And not in the entertainment business at all. He was literally owned a donut company. And

49:20.280 --> 49:24.280
when he was passing away, Jack said, the last thing my father said to me was,

49:25.160 --> 49:33.480
go out there and spread a little sunshine. And I truly think that's what Jack loved to do.

49:33.480 --> 49:46.040
I remember this, and I don't know if this will answer your question, but I think it's revealing

49:46.040 --> 49:53.640
about what he's able to do and what he was able to do and how that ultimately influenced what I

49:53.640 --> 49:59.960
was able to do. Sam Endes had never directed a film before American Beauty.

50:02.120 --> 50:09.640
And so what he did was he took the best elements of theater and applied them to the process. So we

50:09.640 --> 50:15.160
rehearsed it like a play in a soundstage where everything was laid out like it would be in a

50:15.160 --> 50:24.600
play and this couch will be here. And he'd sent me a couple of tapes. He'd sent me two cassette

50:24.600 --> 50:31.560
tapes, one that he'd like to call pre-Lester before he begins to move in a new direction,

50:31.560 --> 50:39.080
and then post-Lester. And they just were different songs. And then he said to me one day, and I

50:39.080 --> 50:45.240
think always thought this was brilliant of Sam to use lemon, knowing what lemon meant to me.

50:46.600 --> 50:51.640
He said, when was the last time you watched The Apartment? I said, I don't know. I mean,

50:52.200 --> 50:55.880
I love that movie so much because I want you to watch it again and then let's talk.

50:58.360 --> 51:03.480
So I went and I watched the movie again and we sat down and Sam said,

51:03.640 --> 51:13.320
what lemon does in that film is incredible because there is never a moment in the movie

51:14.200 --> 51:24.200
where we see him change. He just evolves. And he becomes the man he becomes because

51:24.200 --> 51:29.720
of the experiences that he has through the course of the film. But there's this remarkable

51:29.720 --> 51:36.680
consistency in who he becomes. And that's what I need you to do is Lester. I don't want the

51:36.680 --> 51:45.000
audience to ever see him change. I want him to evolve. And so we did some, I mean, first of all,

51:45.000 --> 51:51.320
it was just a great direction. And then second of all, we did some things that people don't know

51:51.320 --> 52:01.640
we did to aid that gradual shift of that man's character. First of all, I had to be in the

52:01.640 --> 52:06.040
best shape from the beginning of the movie because we didn't shoot it in sequence. So

52:06.840 --> 52:13.080
I was in this crazy shape. I had this wonderful trainer named Mike Torsche who just was incredible.

52:13.640 --> 52:21.880
But so what we did was in order to then show this gradual shift was I had three different

52:21.880 --> 52:30.120
hairpieces. I had three different kinds of costumes of different colors and sizes. And I had different

52:30.120 --> 52:38.520
makeup. So in the beginning, I was wearing a kind of drab, dull, slightly, you know,

52:38.520 --> 52:45.080
uninspired hairpiece. And my makeup was kind of gray and boring. And I was a little bit,

52:45.080 --> 52:49.560
there were times when I was like too much like this and Sam would go, Kevin, you look like

52:49.560 --> 52:53.640
Walter Mathau, would you please stand up a little bit? We're sort of midway through at this point.

52:54.600 --> 53:02.760
And then at a certain point, the wig changed and it had little highlights in it, a little more

53:02.760 --> 53:09.160
color, a little more, the makeup became a little, the suits got a little tighter. And then finally,

53:09.160 --> 53:16.280
a third wig that was golden highlights and sunshine and, and, you know, rosy cheeks and tight fit.

53:16.920 --> 53:20.680
And these are what we call theatrical tricks. You know, this is, this is how you,

53:21.240 --> 53:27.720
an audience doesn't even know it's happening. But it is this gradual. And I just always felt that

53:27.720 --> 53:37.480
that was such a brilliant way because he knew what I felt about Jack. And when you watch the

53:37.480 --> 53:44.520
apartment, it is extraordinary that he doesn't ever change. He just, so I'm, I'm,

53:44.520 --> 54:02.120
and in fact, I, I thanked Jack when I won the Oscar. And I, I did my thank you speech and I

54:02.120 --> 54:07.080
walked off stage and I remember I had to sit down for a moment because I didn't want to go,

54:07.080 --> 54:10.840
I didn't want to go to the press room because I wanted to see if Sam was going to win.

54:11.800 --> 54:18.840
And so I was waiting and my phone rang and it was lemon. He said, you're a son of a bitch.

54:20.040 --> 54:25.720
I said, I said, what? He goes, do you, first of all, congratulations and thanks for thanking me

54:25.720 --> 54:29.400
because, you know, God knows you couldn't have done it without me. He said, second of all,

54:29.960 --> 54:35.400
he said, you know how long it took me to win from supporting actor. I won it for Mr. Roberts and

54:35.400 --> 54:39.640
it took me like 10, 12 years to win Oscar. You did it in four, you son of a bitch.

54:41.800 --> 54:48.920
Yeah. The apartment was, I mean, it's widely considered one of the greatest movies ever.

54:50.760 --> 54:55.640
People sometimes refer to it as a comedy, which is an interesting kind of classification.

54:56.200 --> 55:02.120
I suppose that's a lesson about comedy that the best, the best comedy is the one that's

55:02.120 --> 55:06.440
basically a tragedy. Well, I mean, some people think Clockwork Orange is a comedy.

55:07.320 --> 55:11.880
And I'm not saying there are some good laughs in Clockwork Orange, but yeah, you know, it's...

55:12.760 --> 55:18.920
I mean, yeah. What's that line between comedy and tragedy for you?

55:23.080 --> 55:31.640
Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time because I've tried always to find the humor

55:32.440 --> 55:42.760
unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate sometimes, maybe shocking, but I've tried and

55:42.760 --> 55:51.640
I think almost every dramatic role I've had to have a sense of humor and to be able to bring

55:52.520 --> 55:58.760
that along with everything else that is serious. Because frankly,

55:58.840 --> 56:06.200
that's how we deal with stuff in life, you know? I think Sam Mendes actually said in the

56:06.200 --> 56:14.440
now documentary something like, with great theater, with great stories, you find humor

56:15.080 --> 56:21.480
on the journey to the heart of darkness, something like this. Very poetic, it stood out to me.

56:21.480 --> 56:26.120
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't be that poetic. I'm very sorry. But it's true. I mean,

56:27.080 --> 56:30.440
the people I've interacted in this world have been to a war zone and

56:32.440 --> 56:38.040
the ones who have lost the most and have suffered the most are usually the ones who are able to

56:40.040 --> 56:45.880
make jokes the quickest and the jokes are often dark and absurd and cost every single line,

56:46.440 --> 56:50.440
no political correctness, all of that. Sure. Well, I mean, you know, it's like

56:51.400 --> 56:57.080
the Great Mary Tyler Moore show where they can't stop giggling at the clown's funeral. I mean,

56:57.080 --> 57:03.640
it's just one of the great episodes ever. Giggling at a funeral is as bad as farting at a funeral

57:03.640 --> 57:13.000
and I'm sure that there's some people who've done both. Oh, man. So you mentioned American beauty

57:13.320 --> 57:22.280
and the idea of not changing but evolving. That's really interesting because that movie is about

57:22.920 --> 57:29.320
like finding yourself. So it's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters

57:29.320 --> 57:38.120
in their own ways, finding their own identity in a world where maybe a system, a materialistic

57:38.120 --> 57:43.400
system that wants you to be like everyone else. And so, I mean, Lester just really transforms

57:43.400 --> 57:48.840
himself throughout the movie and you're saying the challenge there is to still be the same human

57:48.840 --> 58:01.960
being fundamentally. Yeah, and I also think that the film was powerful because you had three

58:02.920 --> 58:12.200
very honest and genuine portrayal of young people and then you had Lester behaving like a young

58:12.200 --> 58:23.720
person, doing things that were unexpected. And I think that the honesty with which it dealt with

58:23.720 --> 58:29.240
those issues that those teenagers were going through and the honesty with which it dealt with

58:29.240 --> 58:37.720
what Lester was going through, I think are some of the reasons why the film had the response that

58:37.720 --> 58:46.120
it did from so many people. I mean, I used to get stopped and someone would say to me,

58:47.240 --> 58:52.920
when I first saw American beauty, I was married. And the second time I saw it, I wasn't.

58:53.080 --> 58:59.720
And I was like, well, we weren't trying to increase the divorce rate. It wasn't our intention, but

59:00.520 --> 59:11.960
it is interesting how so many people have those kinds of crazy fantasies. And what I

59:13.480 --> 59:17.960
admired so much about who Lester was as a person, why I wanted to play him is because in the end,

59:18.760 --> 59:24.680
he makes the right decision. I think a lot of people live lives of quiet desperation

59:26.440 --> 59:36.280
in a job they don't like. In a marriage they're unhappy in and to see somebody

59:37.560 --> 59:44.440
living that life and then saying, fuck it in every way possible. And not just in a cynical way,

59:44.440 --> 59:51.640
but in a way that opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world. That's the beauty in American

59:51.640 --> 59:58.280
beauty. Well, you may have to blackmail your boss to get there, but you know. And in that,

59:58.280 --> 01:00:07.080
there's a bunch of humor also. In the anger and the absurdity of taking a stand against the

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:14.760
conformity of life, there's this humor. And I read somewhere that the scene, the dinner scene,

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:24.280
which is kind of play-like, where Lester slams the plate against the wall, was improvised by you,

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:31.400
the slamming of the plate against the wall. No. No. Absolutely. The internet lies once again.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:40.600
Absolutely written and directed. Can't take credit for that.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:45.880
The plate. Okay. Well, that was a genius interaction there. There's something about the

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:51.240
dinner table and losing your shit at the dinner table. Having a fight and losing your shit at the

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:59.720
dinner table. Where else? Yellowstone was another situation where there's a family

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.080
at the dinner table and then one of them says, fucking, I'm not eating this anymore and I'm

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.840
going to create a scene. Right. It's a beautiful kind of environment for dramatic scenes.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.400
Or Nicholson in The Shining. There's some family scenes gone awry in that movie.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.600
The contrast between you and Annette Benning in that scene

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:29.000
creates the genius of that scene. So how much of acting is the dance between two actors?

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:41.720
Well, with Annette, I just adored working with her. And we were the two actors that Sam wanted

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:48.680
from the very beginning, much against the will of the higher ups who wanted other actors to

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:59.320
play those roles. But I've known Annette since we did a screen test together from Milos Forman

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.640
for a film he did of the Les Léves-en-Dangerous movie. It was a different film from that one,

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.960
but it was the same story. And I've always thought she is just remarkable. And I think that

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:20.840
the work she did in that film, the relationship that we were able to build,

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:29.320
for me, the saddest part of that success was that she didn't win the Oscar,

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:37.240
and I felt she should have. What kind of interesting direction did you get from Sam

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:44.280
and how you approached playing Lester and how to take on the different scenes?

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.680
There's a lot of just brilliant scenes in that movie.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:56.040
Well, I'll share with you a story that most people don't know, which is our first two days

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:03.480
of shooting were in Smiley's, the place where I get a job in a fast food place.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.640
Yeah, it's a burger joint. And I guess it was like maybe

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:15.800
the third day or the fourth day of shooting, we'd now done that. And I said to Sam,

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.600
so how are the dailies? How do they look? He goes, which ones? I said, well, the first

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:30.280
Smiley's. He goes, oh, they're shit. And I went, yeah, no, how were they? He goes, no, they're

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:37.960
shit. I hate them. I hate everything about them. I hate the costumes. I hate the location.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:46.360
I hate that you're inside. I hate the way you acted. I hate everything but the script.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.760
So I've gone back to the studio and asked them if we can reshoot the first two days.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:04:01.480
And it was like, Sam, this is your very first movie. You're going back to Steven Spielberg

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:09.960
and saying, I need to reshoot the first two days entirely. Yeah. And that's exactly what we did.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.600
A couple of weeks later, they decided that it was now a drive through because Annette and

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:23.160
Peter Galler used to come into the place and ordered from the counter. Now, Sam decided,

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.440
it has to be a drive through. You have to be in the window of the drive through,

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.160
change the costumes, and we reshot those first two days. And Sam said,

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:40.040
it was actually a moment of incredible confidence because he said the worst thing that could

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:47.160
possibly have happened happened in my first two days. And after that, I was like, I know what

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:52.200
I'm doing and I knew I had to reshoot it and it was absolutely right. And I guess that's what a

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:58.520
great director must do is have the guts in that moment to reshoot everything. That's a pretty

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:05.560
gutsy move. Two other little things to share with you about Sam, but the way he is, you wouldn't

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:16.840
know it, but the original script opened and closed with a trial. Ricky was accused of Lester's murder.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.720
And the movie was bookended by this trial. It's a very different movie.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:32.440
Which they shot the entire trial for weeks. And I used to fly in my dreams.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.080
You know those opening shots over the neighborhood? I used to come into those shots in my bathrobe

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:46.360
flying. And then when I hit the ground and the newspaper was thrown at me by the newspaper guy

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:52.840
and I caught it, the alarm would go off and I'd wake up in bed. I spent five days being hung by

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:59.640
wires and filming these sequences of flying through my dreams. And Sam said to me,

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:06.760
yeah, the flying sequences are all gone and the trial is gone. And I was like, what?

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:14.920
What are you talking about? And here's my other little favorite story about Sam and that.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:21.480
When we were shooting in the valley, one of those places I flew, this was an indoor set.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:29.800
Sam said to me in the morning, hey, at lunch, I just want to record a guide track of all the

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.600
dialogue, all of your narration, because they just needed an editing as a guide. And I said, sure.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.120
So I remember we came outside of this in this hallway where I had a dressing room in this

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:47.960
little studio we were in. And Sam had like a cassette tape recorder and like a little microphone.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:56.600
And we put it on the floor and he pushed record. And I read the entire narration.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:08.440
And I never did it again. That's the narration in the movie. Because Sam said, when he listened to it,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.320
I wasn't trying to do anything. He said, you had no idea where these things were going,

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:19.480
where they were going to be placed, what they were going to mean. You just read it so

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:28.040
innocently, so purely, so directly that I knew if I brought you into a studio and put headphones

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:37.640
on you and had you do it again, it would change the ease with which you'd done it. And so they

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:45.000
just fixed all of the problems that they had with this little cassette. And that is the way I did

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.520
it. And the only time I did it was in this little hallway. And once again, a great performance lies

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:59.400
in being doing less. Yeah. Yeah. The innocence and the purity of less. He knew I would have

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:06.600
come into the studio and fucked it up. Yeah. What do you think about the notion of beauty that

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:12.120
permeates American beauty? What do you think that theme is with the roses, with the rose petals,

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:21.960
the characters that are living this mundane existence slowly opening their eyes up to what is

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.720
beautiful in life? See, it's funny. I don't think of the roses and I don't think of her body and

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:38.680
the poster and I don't think of those things as the beauty. I think of the bag. I think that

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:48.440
there are things we miss that are right in front of us that are truly beautiful.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.240
The little things, the simple things. Yeah. And in fact, I'll even tell you something that I always

01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:04.280
thought was so incredible. When we shot the scenes in the office where Lester worked,

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.120
the job he hated, there was a bulletin board behind me on a wall.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:18.760
And someone who was watching a cut or early dailies who was in the marketing department

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:27.880
saw that someone had cut out a little piece of paper and stuck it and it said, look closer.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:35.240
And they presented that to Sam as the idea of what that should, that could go on the poster.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:43.880
The idea of looking closer was such a brilliant idea, but it wasn't, I mean, it wasn't like,

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.520
it wasn't in the script. It was just on a wall behind me and someone happened to

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:55.080
zoom in on it and see it and thought, that's what this movie's about. This movie's about

01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:03.640
taking the time to look closer. And I think that in itself is just beautiful.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:10.600
Mortality also permeates the film. It starts with acknowledging that death is on the way,

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:21.080
that Lester's time is finite. You ever think about your own death? Yeah. Scared of it?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.640
When I was at my lowest point, yes, it scared me.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:37.160
What does that fear look like? What's the nature of the fear? What are you afraid of?

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.280
That there's no way out.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.280
That there's no answer.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:54.600
That nothing makes sense.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:05.320
See, the interesting thing about Lester is facing the same fear. He seemed to be somehow liberated

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.040
and accepted everything and then saw the beauty of it.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:17.320
Because he got there. He was given the opportunity to reinvent himself and to

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:30.120
try things he'd never tried, to ask questions he'd never asked, to trust his instincts

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:40.440
and to become the best version of himself he could become. And so Dick Van Dyke, who has

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:49.000
become an extraordinary friend of mine, Dick is 98 years old. And he says, you know, if I'd known

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.400
I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself. When I spend time with him,

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:03.400
I'm just moved by every day, you know, he gets up and he goes, it's a good day, I woke up.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:16.280
And I learn a lot about, I have a different feeling about death now than I did seven years ago.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:29.000
And I'm on the path to being able to be in a place where

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:36.200
I've resolved the things I needed to resolve and won't probably get to all of it in my lifetime,

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:43.880
but I certainly would like to be at a place where if I were to drop dead tomorrow,

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.880
it would have been an amazing life. So Lester got there, it sounds like Dick Van Dyke got there,

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:57.480
he tried to get there. Sure. You said you feared death at your lowest point. What was the lowest

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:08.680
point? It was November 1st of 2017, and then Thanksgiving Day of that same year.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:17.160
So let's talk about it. Let's talk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual allegations

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:24.120
against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world for the last seven years.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:31.880
I would like to personally understand the sins, the bad things you did and the bad things you

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.560
didn't do. So I also should say that the thing I hope to do here is to

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:47.080
give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty that the mass hysteria machine of

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:54.600
the internet and clickbait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.640
There were criminal and civil trials brought against you,

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.840
including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued you for $40 million.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:14.280
In these trials, you were acquitted, found not guilty and not liable. Is that right? Yes. I think

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:22.840
that's really important again in terms of due process. And I read a lot and I watched a lot

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:29.640
in preparation for this on this point, including, of course, the recently detailed interviews you

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:36.680
did with Dan Wooten and then Allison Pearson of the Telegraph. And those are all focused on this

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:42.040
topic and they go in detail where you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.760
interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that and everything I looked at,

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:52.120
as I understand, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.520
Sort of in the sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right? That's correct.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:04.440
You always respected the explicit no from people. Again, the sexual context. Is that right? That is

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:11.320
correct. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right? Never. And also,

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.880
as is sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this, you've never explicitly offered to exchange

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:23.960
sexual favors for career advancement, correct? Correct. In terms of bad behavior, what did you

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:31.640
do? What was the worst of it? And how often did you do it? I have heard now quite often that

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:37.320
everybody has a Kevin Spacey story. And what that tells me is that I hit on a lot of guys.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:44.360
How often did you cross the line? And what does that mean to you? I did a lot of horsing around.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.400
I had a lot of things that at the time I thought were sort of playful and fun. And I have learned

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:58.040
since we're not. And I have had to recognize that I crossed some boundaries and I did some

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:04.120
things that were wrong and I made some mistakes. And that's in my past. I mean, I've been working

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:11.640
so hard over these last seven years to have the conversations I needed to have, to listen to people,

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.400
to understand things from a different perspective than the one that I had,

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.840
and to say, I will never behave that way again for the rest of my life.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.160
Just to clarify, I think you're often too pushy with the flirting.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:37.800
And that manifests itself in multiple ways. But just to make clear, you never prevented anyone

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:46.280
from leaving if they wanted to. You always took the explicit no from people as an answer. No, stop.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.840
You took that for the answer. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.280
And you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.000
These are some of the sort of accusations that have been made. And in the court of law, multiple

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.320
times have been shown not to be true. But I have had a sexual life and I've fallen in love.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:20.280
And I've been so admiring of people that I, I mean, I'm so romantic. I'm such a romantic person

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:26.600
that there's this whole side of me that hasn't been talked about, isn't being discussed. But

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:34.040
that's who I know. That's the person I know. It's been very upsetting to hear that some people have

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.080
said I, I mean, I don't have a violent bone in my body, but to hear people describe things as

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:48.120
having been very aggressive is incredibly difficult for me. And I'm deeply sorry that

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:55.640
I ever offended anyone or hurt anyone in any way. It is, it is crushing to me. And I have to work

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:04.600
very hard to show and to prove that I have learned I got the memo and I will never,

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.520
ever, ever behave in those ways again. From everything I've seen in public

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:14.280
interactions with you, people love you. Colleagues love you, coworkers love you. They,

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:19.400
there's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between the

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.920
people you work with. And by the way, not to take anything away from my accountability for

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.200
things I did where I got it wrong, I crossed the line, I pushed some boundaries. I accept all of

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:40.840
that. But I live in an industry in which flirtation, attraction, people meeting in the workspace and

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:50.520
ending up marrying each other and having children. And so it is a, it is a, it is a space and a place

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:58.200
where these notions of family, these notions of attraction, these notions of, it's always

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.560
complicated if you meet someone in the workspace and find yourselves attracted to each other.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:09.320
You have to be mindful of that. And you have to be very mindful that you don't ever want anyone to

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:18.120
feel that their job is in jeopardy. Or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:26.200
to be with you. So those are important things to just acknowledge. Another complexity to this

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:32.920
as I've seen is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you. A huge number of

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:38.040
people in the industry that look up to you. So just and love you. I've seen just from this

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.320
documentary, just a lot of people just love being around you, learning from you what it means to

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:50.680
create great theater, great film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:57.960
say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's a admiration dynamic that

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:03.000
is easy to miss and easy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand?

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:10.600
Yes. And I also understand that there are people who met me and spent a very brief period of time

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:20.200
with me, but presumed I was now going to be their mentor. And then behaved in a way that I was unaware

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:30.280
of that they were either participating or flirting along or encouraging me without me having any idea

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:41.080
that at the end of the day they were expecting something. So these are about relationships.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:46.680
So these are about two people. These are about people making decisions, people making choices,

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:55.960
and I accept my accountability in that. But there are a number of things that I've been accused of

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:05.000
that just simply did not happen. And I can't say, and I don't think it would be right for me to say,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.600
well, everything that's ever been I've been accused of is true because we've now proved

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:18.920
that it isn't and it wasn't. But I am perfectly willing to accept that I had behaviors that were

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:27.480
wrong and that I shouldn't have done and I am regretful for. I think that also speaks to

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:34.760
dark side of fame. The sense I got is that there are some people, potentially a lot of people,

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.960
trying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.200
So not you using them, but they trying to use you.

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:56.600
What's that like? How do you know if somebody likes you for you for Kevin or likes you for

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.480
like you said, you're romantic, you see a person and you're like, I like this person

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.520
and they seem to like you. How do you know if they like you for you?

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:17.000
Well, to some degree, I would say that I have been able to trust my instincts on that and that

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:23.720
most of the time been right. But obviously in the last number of years,

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.680
not just with people who've accused me, but just also people in my own industry,

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:33.800
to realize that, oh, I thought we had a friendship, but I guess that was about an inch thick and

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:43.800
not what I thought it was. But look, one shouldn't be surprised by that. I have to also say,

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.520
you know, you said a little while ago that the world had canceled me and I have to

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:56.360
disagree with you. I have to disagree because for seven years, I've been stopped by people

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:03.400
sometimes every day, sometimes multiple, multiple times a day. And the conversations that I have

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:10.760
with people, the generosity that they share, the kindness that they show, and how much they want

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:18.040
to know when I'm getting back to work tells me that while there may be a very loud minority,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.640
there is a quieter majority. In the industry, have you been betrayed

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.560
in life and how do you not let that make you cynical?

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:41.240
I think betrayal is a really interesting word. But I think if you're going to be betrayed,

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:48.440
it has to be by those who truly know you. And I can tell you that I have not been betrayed.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.760
What's the beautiful way to put it?

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:58.680
For the times you cross the line, do you take responsibility for the wrongs you've done?

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:05.400
Yes. Are you sorry to the people you may have hurt emotionally? Yes.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:15.960
And I have spoken to many of them. Privately. Privately, which is where a man should be made.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:25.000
Were they able to start finding forgiveness? Absolutely. Some of the most moving conversations

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:34.600
that I have had when I was determined to take accountability have been those people who said,

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.760
thank you so much, and I think I can forgive you now.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.600
If you got a chance to talk to the Kevin Spacey of 30 to 40 years ago,

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:54.680
what would you tell him to change about his ways? How would you do it? What would be your approach?

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.560
Would you be nice about it? Would you smack him around?

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.840
I think if I were to go back that far, I probably would have found a way to

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:12.440
not have been as concerned about my revealing my sexuality and hiding that for as long as I did.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:22.680
I think that had a lot to do with confusion and a lot to do with mistrust, both my own and other

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:29.480
peoples. For most of your life, you were not open with the public about being gay.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.360
What was the hardest thing about keeping who you love a secret?

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:46.440
That I didn't find the right moment of celebration to be able to share that.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.640
There must be a thing that weighs on you to not be able to fully

01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:04.440
celebrate your love. Ian McKellen said, he was 49 when he came out,

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:12.200
27 years he'd been a professional actor being in the closet. He said he felt it was like he was

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:20.680
living a part of his life not being truthful and that he felt that it affected his work

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:26.840
when he did come out because he no longer felt like he had anything to hide. I absolutely believe

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:37.400
that that is what my experience has been and will continue to be. I am sorry about the way I came out,

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:46.120
but Evan and I had already had the conversation. I had already decided to come out.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:54.120
It wasn't like, oh, I was forced to come out, but it was something I decided to do. By the way,

01:26:54.120 --> 01:27:00.200
much against Evan's advice, I came out in that statement and he wishes that I had not done so.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:09.240
Yeah, you made a statement when the initial accusation happened. It could be up there as

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:19.800
one of the worst social media posts of all time. It's like two for one.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.800
Don't hold back. No, come on. Really tell me how you feel.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:29.800
The first part, you kind of implicitly admitted to doing something bad, which was later shown

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.400
and proved completely to never have happened. It was a lie.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.360
I basically said that I didn't remember what this person was that Anthony Rapp was claiming

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.680
from 31 years before. I had no memory of it, but if it had happened, if this embarrassing moment

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:53.000
had happened, then I would owe him an apology. That was what I said. Then I said, and while I'm

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.600
at it, I think I'll come out. It was definitely not the greatest coming-out party ever. I will admit

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.480
that. From the public perception, the first part of that, so first of all, the second part is a

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.920
horrible way to come out. Yes, we all agree. Then the first part, from the public viewpoint,

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:17.400
they see guilt in that, which also is tragic because at least that particular accusation is

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.000
a very dramatic one. It's a $40 million lawsuit. It's a big deal, and an underage person was shown

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:30.520
to be false. You're melding two things together. The lawsuit didn't happen until 2020, and then

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.120
it didn't get to court until 2022. We're back in 2017 when it was just an accusation he made

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:44.920
in BuzzFeed Magazine. Look, I was backed into a corner. When someone says, you were so drunk,

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:51.080
you won't remember this thing happened, what's your first instinct? Is your first instinct to

01:28:51.080 --> 01:29:00.280
say this person's a liar, or is your first instinct to go, what? 31 years at a party,

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.640
I don't even remember throwing? Obviously, a lot of investigation happened after that,

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.480
in which we were then able to prove in that court case that it had never occurred. But at the moment,

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:22.280
I was sort of being taught, I couldn't push back. You have to be kind. I think even to me now,

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.880
none of it sounds right, but I don't know that I could have said anything that would have been

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:35.720
satisfactory to anybody. Okay. That is an almost convincing explanation for the worst social

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.840
media post of all time. I almost accept it. I'm really surprised. I guess you haven't read a lot

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:45.720
of media posts because I can't believe that's the actual worst one. It's beautifully bad,

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:51.800
is how bad that social media post is. As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone came out

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:59.800
in support of you recently, speaking to your character. A lot of people who know you, and some

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:05.560
of whom I know, who have worked with you privately, show support for you, but are afraid to speak up

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:11.640
publicly. What do you make of that? I mean, to me personally, this just makes me sad because

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:19.080
perhaps that's the nature of the industry, that it's difficult to do that, but I just wish it

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.760
would be a little bit more courage in the world. I don't think it's about the industry. I think

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:28.200
it's about our time. I guess the time that we're in, and people are very afraid.

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.880
Just afraid, just a general fear. No, they're literally afraid that

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.560
they're going to get canceled if they stand up for someone who has been.

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.520
I think it's... I mean, we've seen this many times in history. This is not the first time it's

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:58.680
happened. So as you said, your darkest moment in 2017, when all of this went down, one of the

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.240
things that happened is you were no longer in the house of cards for the last season.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:10.360
Let's go to the beginning of that show. Okay. One of the greatest TV series of all time,

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.520
a dark, fascinating character in Frank Underwood, a ruthless, cunning, borderline, evil politician.

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:24.280
What are some interesting aspects to the process you went through becoming Frank Underwood?

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.080
Maybe, Richard III, there's a lot of elements there in your performance that maybe

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:41.080
inspired that character. Is that fair or no? I'll give you one very interesting, specific

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:51.880
education that I got in doing Richard III and closing that show

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:59.480
at BAM in March of 2012, and two months later, started shooting house of cards.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.200
There is something called direct address.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:18.280
In Shakespeare, you have Hamlet talks to the world, but when Shakespeare wrote Richard III,

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:24.280
it was the first time he created something called direct address, which is the character looks

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:31.320
at each person close by. It is a different kind of

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:37.560
sharing than when a character is doing a monologue, an opening of Henry IV.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:44.920
And while there are some people who believe that direct address was invented in Ferris

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:51.640
Bueller, it wasn't. It was Shakespeare who invented it. So I had just had this experience

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:59.400
every night in theaters all over the world, seeing how people reacted

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:05.880
to becoming a co-conspirator, because that's what it's about.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:15.560
And what I tried to do and what Fincher really helped me with in those beginning days

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:23.880
was how to look in that camera and imagine I was talking to my best friend.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.280
Because you're sharing the secret of the darkness of how this game is played

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:39.000
with that best friend. Yeah, and there were many times when I suppose the writers thought I was

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.720
crazy, where I would see a script and I would see like this moment where this direct address

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:48.680
would happen and say all this stuff and I'd go, when we do a read-through of the script, I go,

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.320
I don't think I need to say any of that. And they were like, what do you mean? I said,

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:59.880
well, the audience knows all of that. All I have to do is look. They know exactly what's going on.

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:07.480
I don't need to say a thing. So I was often cutting dialogue because it just wasn't needed,

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:12.840
because that relationship that I'd learned that I'd experienced doing Richard III,

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:21.560
was so extraordinary. Where I literally watched people, they were like, oh, I'm in on the thing

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.520
and this is so awesome. And then suddenly, wait, he killed the kids. He killed those kids in the

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:35.080
tower. Oh, maybe it's not so. And you literally would watch them start to reverse their having had

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:41.560
such a great time with Richard III in the first, you know, three acts. I thought this is going to

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:56.680
happen in this show. If this intimacy can actually land, and I think just think there was some

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:03.000
brilliant writing and we always attempted to do it in one take. No matter how long something was,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.240
we would try to do it in one take, the direct addresses. So there was never a cut. When we

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:15.960
went out on locations, we started to then find ways to cut it and make it slightly broader.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.520
But that's interesting because you're doing a bunch of with both Richard III and Frank Underwood,

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:28.040
a bunch of dark, borderline evil things. And then I guess the idea is you're going to be

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.280
losing the audience and then you win them back over with the addresses.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:40.520
That's the remarkable thing is against their instincts and their better sense of what they

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.400
should and should not do, they still rallied around Frank Underwood.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.520
And I saw even with the documentary, the glimmers of that with Richard III,

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.360
I mean, you were seducing the audience. Like there was such a chemistry between you and the

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.320
audience on stage. Yeah. Well, in that production, that's absolutely true.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.640
Also, Richard is one of the weirder, weird, I mean by weird,

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:18.520
was an early play of Shakespeare's. And he's basically never offstage. I mean,

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.800
I remember when we did the first run through, I had no idea what the next scene was every time I

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:28.600
came offstage. I had no idea what was next. They literally had to drag me from one place to another

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:34.520
scene. Now it's the scene with Hastings. And now it's the scene. But I now understand these

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:41.160
wonderful stories that you can read in old books about Shakespeare's time that actors

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:47.960
grabbed Shakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him up against the wall. So you

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.360
ever write a part like this again, I'm going to kill you. And that's why in later plays,

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:57.640
he started to have a pageant happened and then a wedding happened. And the main character was

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:04.120
offstage resting because the actor had said, you can't do this to us. There's no breaks.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.840
And it's true. There's very few breaks in Richard III. You're on stage most of the time.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.640
The comedic aspect of Richard III and Frank Underwood. Is that a component that helps bring out

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.560
the full complexity of the darkness that is Frank Underwood?

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:29.240
I certainly can't take credit for Shakespeare having written something that is funny or

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.440
Bo Williman and his team to have written something that is funny, is fundamentally funny.

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:44.440
It just depends on how I interpret it. That's one of the great things why we love

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:51.800
you know, in a year's time, we can see five different Hamlets. We can see four Richard

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:58.440
the Thirds. We can see two Richard the Seconds. That's part of the thrill that we don't own these

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:06.760
parts. We borrow them and we interpret them. And what Ian McKellen might do with a role

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:12.200
could be completely different from what I might do because of the way we perceive it.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:18.360
And also, very often in terms of going for humor, it's very often a director will say,

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.240
why don't you say that with a bit of irony? Why don't you try that with a bit of boba?

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:29.800
Yeah, there's often like that, like a wry smile. The line that jumps to me when you're talking about

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:40.520
Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, I love that woman more than sharks love blood.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:50.120
I mean, I guess there's a lot of ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:57.560
humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together.

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.120
I also think that one should just acknowledge that where he was from,

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:10.920
there is something that happens when you do an accent. And in fact, sometimes when I would say

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.600
to Bo or one of the other writers, this is really good and I love the idea,

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:23.480
but it rhythmically doesn't help. I need at least two more words to rhythmically make this work

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:32.280
in his accent because it just doesn't scan. And that's not iambic pentameter. I'm not talking

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:38.760
about that. There is that as well in Shakespeare, but there was sometimes when it's too many lines,

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:44.920
it's not enough lines in order for me to make this work for the way he speaks, the way he sounds,

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:53.560
and what that accent does to emphasis. How much of that character in terms of the musicality

01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:01.160
of the way he speaks is Bill Clinton? Not really at all. I mean, Clinton, you know,

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:09.640
Bill Clinton, he had a way of talking, you know, that he was very slow and he felt your pain,

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:22.280
you know. But Frank Underwood was a deeper, more direct and less poetic in the way that

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.800
Clinton would talk. I'll tell you this Clinton story that you like.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:34.280
So we decided to do a performance of the Iceman cometh for the Democratic Party

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.920
on Broadway and the president is going to come. He's going to see this four and a half hour play

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.640
and then we're going to do this event afterward. And a couple weeks before we're going to do this

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.160
event, someone at the White House calls and says, listen, it's very unusual to get the president

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:55.320
for like six and a half hours. So we're suggesting that the president come and see the first act

01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:02.440
and then he goes. And I knew what was happening. Now, first of all, Clinton knows this play.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.400
He knows what this play is about. And I, you know, as gently as I could said, well,

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.080
if the president is thinking of leaving at intermission, then I'm afraid we're going to have

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:20.200
to cancel the event. There's just no way that, so anyway, then I don't know, it's fine. Now,

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:24.760
I know what was happening. What was happening was that someone had read the play and they were

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:31.800
quite concerned. And I'll tell you why. Because the play is about this character that I portrayed

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:37.480
named Hickey. And in the course of the play, as things get more and more revealed, you realize

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:43.160
that this man that I'm playing has been a philanderer. He's cheated on his wife quite a lot.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:52.280
And by the end of the play, he is arrested and taken off because he ended up ending his wife's

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:58.840
life because she forgave him too much and he couldn't live with it. So now imagine this,

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:05.240
there's 2,000 people at the Brooks Acton's Theater watching President Clinton watching this play.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:12.040
And at the end of the night, we take our curtain call. They bring out the presidential podium.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.680
Bill Clinton stands up there and he says,

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:24.200
Well, I suppose we should all thank Kevin and this extraordinary company of actors

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.200
for giving us all way too much to think about.

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:40.360
And the audience fell over and laughed her and then he gave a great speech. And I thought

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.440
that was a pretty good way to handle that.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:48.200
Well, in that way, him and Frank Arnold would share like a charisma. There's certain presidents that

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:53.160
just have politicians that just have this charisma. You can't stop listening to them.

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.040
Some of it is the accent, but some of it is some other magical thing.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:07.000
When I was starting to do research, I wanted to meet with the whip, Kevin McCarthy.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:13.320
And he wouldn't meet with me until I called his office back and said,

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:19.560
tell him I'm playing a Democrat, not a Republican. And then he met with me.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.400
Nice.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.040
And he was helpful. He took me to whip meetings.

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.720
Politicians. So you worked with David Fincher there. He was the executive producer, but

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.120
he also directed the first two episodes. Yeah.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:42.440
High level. What was it like working with him again? In which ways do you think he

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.800
helped guide you and the show to become the great show that it was?

01:43:48.280 --> 01:44:02.840
I give him a huge amount of the credit and not just for what he established,

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:12.760
but the fact that every director after stayed within that world. I think that's why the series had

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.800
a very consistent feeling to it. It was like watching a very long movie.

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.640
The style, where the camera went, what it did, what it didn't do, how we used this,

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:30.520
how we used that, how we didn't do this. There were things that he laid the foundation for

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:39.800
that we managed to maintain pretty much until Bo Williman left the show.

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:46.280
They got rid of Fincher, and I was sort of the last man standing in terms of

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:52.920
fighting again. Netflix had never had any creative control at all. We had complete creative control,

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:59.080
but over time, they started to get themselves involved because, look, this is what happens

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.920
to networks. They'd never made a television show before ever, and then four years later,

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:11.080
they were the best. Then you're going to get suggestions about casting and about writing and

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:19.480
about whose music and scenes. There was a considerable amount of pushback that I had to do

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:24.520
when they started to get involved in ways that I thought was affecting the quality of the show.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:31.960
What are those battles like? I heard that there was a battle of the execs, like you mentioned

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.640
early on about your name not being on the billing for Seven. I heard that there's battles about the

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:49.400
ending of Seven, which was pretty dark. What's that battle like? How often does that happen?

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:59.000
How do you win that battle? It feels like there's a line where the networks or the execs are really

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:07.160
afraid of crossing that line into this strange, uncomfortable place. Then the great directors

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:16.120
and great actors flirt with that line. It can happen in different ways. I remember one argument

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:23.000
we had was we had specifically shot a scene so that there would be no score in that scene,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.120
so that there was no music. It was just two people talking. Then we end up seeing a cut where

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:36.280
they've decided to put music in. It is against everything that scene is supposed to be about.

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:41.800
You have to go and say, guys, this was intentional. We did not want score. Now you've

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:47.320
added score because you think it's too quiet. You think our audience can't listen to two people

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:52.120
talk for two and a half minutes. This show has proved anything. It's proved that people have

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:57.800
patience and they're willing to watch an entire season over a weekend. There are those kind of

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:08.040
arguments that can happen. There are different arguments on different levels and they sometimes

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.920
have to do with, I mean, look, go back to the godfather. They wanted to fire Pacino because

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:18.200
they didn't see anything happening. They saw nothing happening, so they wanted to fire Pacino.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.960
And then finally, Coppola thought, I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.600
and they'll do that scene now. That was the first scene where they went, yeah, actually,

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.040
there's something going on there. So Pacino kept the role.

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:39.960
You think that godfathers when Pacino was like the Pacino we know was born? Or is that more like

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:46.200
there's the character that really over the top, insensible woman? There's like stages, I suppose.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:52.360
Yeah, of course. Look, I think that we can't forget that Pacino is also an animal of the theater.

01:47:53.480 --> 01:48:00.600
He does a lot of plays and he started off doing plays and movies where Panic and Needle Park was

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:07.800
his first. And yeah, I think there's that period of time when he was doing some incredible parts

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:14.520
and incredible movies. When I did a series called Wise Guy, I got cast on a Thursday

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.240
and I flew up to Vancouver on a Saturday and I started shooting on Monday. And all I had time

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:25.880
to do was watch The Godfather in Superco and then I went to work. Would you say,

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.600
ridiculous question, Godfather's greatest film of all time?

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:40.040
Well, certainly, yes, yes. But I also look, I'm allowed to change my opinion. I can next week

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:46.120
say it's Lawrence of Arabia or a week after that, I can say Sullivan's Travels. I mean,

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:50.840
that's the wonderful thing about movies and particularly great movies is when you see them

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.680
again, it's like seeing them for the first time. And you pick up things that you didn't see the last

01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:03.320
time. And for that day, you fall in love with that movie. You might even say to a friend that

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:09.160
that is the greatest movie of all time. And also I think it's the degree with which directors are

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:20.200
daring. I mean, Kubrick decided to cast one actor to play three major roles in Dr. Strangelove.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:28.360
I mean, who has the balls to do that today? I was going to mention when we're talking about seven

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:36.840
that just if you're looking at the greatest performances portrayals of murderers, so obviously

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:41.640
like I mentioned, Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, that's up there. Seven to me is like

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:46.520
competing for first place with Silence of the Lambs. But then there's a different one

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:56.680
with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, right, with a shot. And there's, as opposed to a murderer

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:03.000
who's always been a murderer, here's a person like an American beauty who becomes that,

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:10.760
who descends into madness. I read also that Jack Nicholson improvised here's Johnny in that scene.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:16.760
I believe that. That's a very different performance than yours in Seven. What do you make of that

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:25.000
performance? Nicholson's always been such an incredible actor because he has absolutely no

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:32.200
shame about being demonstrative and over the top. And he also has no problem playing characters who

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.320
were deeply flawed. And he interested in that. I have a pretty good Nicholson story though,

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:42.040
nobody knows. You also have a pretty good Nicholson impression, but what's the story?

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:50.280
Story is a story was told to me by a sound man, Dennis Maitland, who's a great, great, great guy.

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:57.160
He said he was very excited because he got on Pritzze's Honor, which was Jack Nicholson,

01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:02.520
Angelica Houston, directed by John Houston. And he said, I was so excited. It was my first day

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:08.360
on the movie and I get told to go into Mr. Nicholson's trailer and mic him up for the first scene.

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:16.760
So I knock on the trailer door and I hear, yes. And come on in. I come inside and Mr. Nicholson

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:22.360
is changing out of his regular clothes and he's putting, he's going to put on his costume. And

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:28.440
so I'm setting up the mic and I'm getting ready. And I said, Mr. Nicholson, I just wanted to tell

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:34.120
you, I'm extremely excited to be working with you again. It's a great pleasure. And Jack goes,

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.640
did we work together before? And he says, yes, yes, we, we did. And he goes, what,

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:46.920
what film did we do together? He says, well, we did Missouri Breaks. Nicholson goes, oh my God,

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:53.000
Missouri Breaks. Jesus Christ, we were out of our minds on that film. Holy shit. Jesus Christ,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.680
wonder I'm alive. My God, there was so much drugs going on and we were stoned out of our minds.

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:05.160
Holy shit. And just then he folds the pants that he's just taken off over his arm and an eighth

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:16.280
of coke drops out on the floor. Dennis looks at it. Nicholson looks at it. Jack goes,

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:25.480
have more in these pants since Missouri Breaks. Man, I love that guy unapologetically himself.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:31.800
Oh yeah. Your impression of him, look at the AFI was just, is just great.

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:37.560
Well, that was for, that was for Mike Nichols. Oh yeah. He had a big impact in your career.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:43.000
He's really important. Can you talk about him? Like what, what role did he play in your life?

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:51.560
I think it was, yeah, it was 1984. I went into audition for the national tour of a play called

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.520
The Real Thing, which Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close were doing on Broadway that Mr. Nichols

01:52:56.520 --> 01:53:01.560
had directed. So I went in to read for this character Brody, who is a Scottish character.

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:09.160
And I did the audition and Mike Nichols comes down the aisle of the theater and he's asking me

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:12.680
questions about where'd you go to school and what have you been doing. And I just come back from

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.400
doing a bunch of years of regional theater and different theaters. So I was in New York and

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:24.600
meeting Mike Nichols was just incredible. So Mr. Nichols went, have you, have you seen the other

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:29.320
play that I directed up the block called Hurley Burley? And I said, no, I haven't. He says, why

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:35.400
not? I said, I can't afford a Broadway ticket. He said, we can arrange that. I'd like you to go

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.840
see that play and then I'd like you to come in next week and audition for that. I was like, okay.

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:50.040
So I went to see Hurley Burley, William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken, Candace Bergen,

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:59.240
Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller. And I watched this play. David Ray played about Hollywood.

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:07.560
This is crazy. I mean, Bill Hurt was like unbelievable. It was extraordinary. Chris Walken,

01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:13.320
so there's this Harvey Keitel. Walken came in later. Harvey Keitel's playing this part.

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:19.480
And I come in and I audition for it and Nichols says, I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel,

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:26.440
I want you to understudy Phil. And I'm like, Phil? I mean, Harvey Keitel is like in his 40s,

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:31.240
he looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody on stage. I'm just like 24 year old.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:36.840
And Nichols said, it's just all about attitude. If you believe you can beat the shit out of

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:42.920
everybody on stage, the audience will too. So I then started to learn Phil.

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:49.320
Phil. And the way it works when you're in understudy, unless you're in name,

01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:53.800
they don't let you rehearse on the stage. You just rehearse in a rehearsal room.

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:58.040
But I used to sneak onto the stage and rehearse and try to figure out where the props were.

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:06.760
Anyway, one day I get a call, you're going on today, it's Phil. So I went on.

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:12.120
Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence, who's the stage manager. Spacey's going on as Phil. So

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:19.080
Nichols comes down and watches the second act, comes backstage. He says, that was really good.

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:26.120
How soon could you learn Mickey? Mickey was the role that Ron Silver was playing,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:34.440
Chris Walken also played. I said, I don't know. Maybe a couple of weeks. He goes,

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:44.440
learn Mickey too. So I learned Mickey. And then one day I'm told, you're going on tomorrow night

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:53.480
is Mickey. Nichols comes, sees the second act, comes backstage, says, that was really good.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:56:01.640
I mean, that was really funny. How soon could you learn Eddie? And so I became like the pinch

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.400
hitter on Hurley Burley. I learned all the male parts, including Jerry Stiller's, although I

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:14.840
never went on his Jerry Stiller's part. And then I left the play. I guess about two months later,

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:20.360
I get this phone call from Mike Nichols. He's like, Kevin, how are you? And I'm like, I'm fine.

01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:26.520
What can I do for you? He says, well, I'm going to make a film this summer with Mandy and Meryl.

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:35.560
And there's a role I'd like you to come in and audition for. So I went in, auditioned, cast me

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:42.120
as this mugger on a subway. Then there's this whole upheaval that happens because he then

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:49.160
doesn't continue with Mandy Pitemkin. Mandy leaves the movie and he asks Jack Nicholson to come in

01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:56.840
and replace Mandy Pitemkin. So now I had no scenes with him, but I'm in a movie with Jack

01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:03.800
Nicholson and Meryl Streep. And my first scene in this movie, which I shot on my birthday, July 26th

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:12.280
of 85, I got to wink at Meryl Streep in this scene. And I was so nervous. I literally couldn't

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:20.600
wink. Nichols had to like, calm me down and help me wink. But that became my first, my very first

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:27.480
film. And he was incredible. And he let me come and watch when they were shooting scenes. I wasn't in.

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:33.880
And I remember ending up one day in the makeup trailer on the same day we were working. Jack and

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.680
me, we had no scene together. But I remember him coming in and they put him down in the chair and

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:45.000
they put cucumbers, frozen cucumbers on his eyes and did his neck. And then they raised him up and

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.440
did his face. And then I remember Nicholson went like this, looked in the mirror and he went,

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.880
another day, another $50,000. And walked out of the trailer.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:08.280
What was Christopher Walker like? Oh, so he's a theater guy too. Oh, yeah. He started out as a

01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:16.440
course boy, dancer. Oh, I can see that. Yeah. I know I'm walking a long time and I did a

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:25.000
Saturday Live where I did, we did these Star Wars auditions. I did Chris Walken as Hans.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:32.200
So good. And I'll never forget this. I was in Los Angeles about two weeks after and I was at

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:36.520
Chateau Marmal. There's some party happening at Chateau Marmal. And I saw Chris Walken come

01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:43.160
out of onto the balcony and I was like, Oh, it's Chris Walken. And he walked up to me and he went,

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:48.680
Kevin, I saw you little sketch. It was funny. Haha.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:00.920
Oh, man, it was a really good sketch. And that guy, there's certain people that are truly unique

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:08.840
and unapologetic, continue being that throughout their whole career, the way they talk, the

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:15.400
musicality of how they talk, how they are, their way of being, he's that. And it somehow works.

01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:24.360
His watch. Yeah. I mean, it works in so many different contexts. He plays like a mobster in

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:30.760
true romance. And it's like genius. That's genius. But he could be anything. He could be soft. He

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:36.200
could be a badass, all of it. And he's always Christopher Walken, but somehow works for all

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:42.920
these different characters. So I guess we were talking about House of Cards like two hours ago

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:50.120
before we took a tangent upon a tangent, but there's a moment in episode one where President

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.760
Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him a Secretary of State.

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:01.880
Was this when the monster in Frank was born? Or was the monster always there? The sort of,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:09.480
for you looking at that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there's loyalty

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:16.040
and that broke him? Or did he always know that there is, this whole world is about manipulation

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:22.200
and do anything to get power? Well, I mean, it might have been the first moment an audience saw

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:28.280
him be betrayed, but it certainly was not the first betrayal he'd experienced. And once you start

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.160
to get to know him and learn about his life and learn about his father and learn about his, you

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:39.400
know, friends and learn about their relationship and learn what he was like even as a cadet,

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.560
I think you start to realize that this is a man who has

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:54.600
very strong beliefs about loyalty. And so it wasn't the first, it was just the first moment that

02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:02.440
in terms of the storyline that's being built, Night Takes King was the name of our production

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:09.960
company. Yeah. What do you think motivated him at that moment and throughout the show?

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:16.680
Was it all about power and also legacy? Or was there some small part underneath it all where he

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:26.360
wanted to actually do good in the world? No, I think power is a afterthought.

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:33.240
What he loved more than anything was being able to predict how human beings would react.

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:45.000
He was a behavioral psychologist and he could know like he was 17 moves ahead in the chess game.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:51.880
He could know if he did this at this moment that eventually this would happen.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:02:03.560
He was able to be predictive and was usually right. He knew just how far he needed to push someone

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.280
to get them to do what he needed them to do in order to make the next step work.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:16.760
You've played a bunch of evil characters. Well, you call them evil. But you don't,

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.680
but the reason I say that, I don't mean to be snarky about it, but the reason I say it that way

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:29.560
is because I never judge the people I play. And the people that I have played or that any actor

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:40.120
has played don't necessarily view themselves as this label. It's easy to say, but that's not

02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:48.920
the way I can think. I cannot judge a character I play and then play them well. I have to be

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.400
free of judgment. I have to just play them and let the cards drop where they may

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:00.520
and let an audience judge. I mean, the fact that you use that word is perfectly fine.

02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:07.320
But it's like people asking me, was I really from K-Pax or not? It just entirely depends on

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:15.640
your perspective. Do roles like that, like seven, like Frank Underwood,

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:26.440
like a lesser from American beauty, did they change you psychologically as a person? So walking

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:35.400
around in the skin of these characters, these complex characters with very different moral

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:50.920
systems. I absolutely believe that wandering around in someone else's ideas, in someone else's clothes,

02:03:52.440 --> 02:04:02.920
in someone else's shoes, teaches you enormous empathy and that goes to the heart of not judging

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:13.160
and I have found that I have been so moved by, I mean, look, yes, you've identified the darker

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:21.160
characters, but I put Clarence Darrow three times. I've played a play called National Anthems. I've

02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:29.320
done movies like Recount. I've done films like The Ref. I've done films in which that doesn't

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:36.440
exist in any of those characters, those qualities, paid forward. And so it is

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:48.200
incredible to be able to embrace those things that I admire and that are like me and those

02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:55.800
things that I don't admire and aren't like me, but I have to put them on an equal footing and say,

02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:05.480
I have to just play them as best I can and not decide to wield judgment over them.

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.560
Without judgment.

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.000
Without judgment.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.960
In Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn famously writes about the line between good

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:24.440
and evil and that it runs to the heart of every man. So the full paragraph there when he talks

02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:31.400
about the line. During the life of any heart, this line keeps changing place. Sometimes it is

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:37.480
squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish.

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:44.920
One and the same human being is at various ages under various circumstances a totally different

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:52.600
human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:59.560
change. And to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil. What do you think about this note

02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:07.640
that we're all capable of good and evil and throughout life that line moves and shifts

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:09.400
throughout the day, throughout every hour?

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:16.840
Yeah, I mean one of the things that I've been focused on

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:23.240
very succinctly is the idea that every day is an opportunity.

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:36.520
It's an opportunity to make better decisions, to learn and to grow.

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:51.400
And I also think that, look, I grew up not knowing if my parents loved me, particularly my father.

02:06:55.320 --> 02:07:02.040
I never had a sense that I was loved and that stayed with me my whole life.

02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:15.720
And when I think back at who my father was and more succinctly who he became,

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:28.040
it was a gradual and slow and sad development.

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:37.720
When I've gone back and now I've looked at diaries my father kept and albums he kept, particularly

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:44.920
when he was a medic in the U.S. Army, served our country with distinction.

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:54.120
When the war was over and they went to Germany, the things my father said, the things that he

02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:59.160
wrote, the things that he believed were as patriotic as any American soldier who had ever served.

02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:07.240
But then when he came back to America and he had a dream of being a journalist

02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:13.320
or his big hope was that he was going to be the great American novelist.

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:18.120
He wanted to be a creative novelist and so he sat in this office and he wrote

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:24.600
for 45 years and never published anything.

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:30.120
And somewhere along the way in order to make money he

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:38.680
became what they call a technical procedure writer, which the best way to describe that is

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:45.000
that if you built the F-16 aircraft, my father would have written the manual to tell you how to do it.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.960
I mean as boring, as technical, as tedious as you can imagine.

02:08:52.040 --> 02:09:02.280
And so somewhere in the 60s and into the 70s my father fell in with groups of people and individuals

02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:10.520
pretend intellectuals who started to give him reasons why he was not successful as a white

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:21.000
Aryan man in the United States. And over time my father became a white supremacist.

02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:34.680
And I cannot tell you the amount of times as a young boy that my father would sit me down

02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:42.920
and lecture me for hours and hours and hours about his

02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:54.120
fucked up ideas of America, of prejudice, of white supremacy. And thank God for my sister

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:57.720
who said don't listen to a thing he says he's out of his mind.

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:06.200
And even though I was young I knew everything he was saying was against people and I loved people.

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:19.240
I had so many wonderful friends. My best friend Mike, who's still my close friend to this day,

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:26.360
I was afraid to bring him to my house because I was afraid that my father would find out he was

02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:33.960
Jewish or that my father would leave his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag

02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:46.360
or his pictures of Hitler or Nazi books or what he might say. So when I found theater

02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:57.400
in the eighth grade and debate club and choir and festivals and plays and

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:06.760
everything I could do to participate in that wouldn't make me have to come back home, I did.

02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:24.280
And I had to reconcile who he became because the gap between that man who was in the U.S.

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:37.480
army as a medic and the man he became I could never fill that gap but I've forgiven him.

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:44.280
But then at the same time I've had to look at my mother and say

02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:51.800
she made excuses for him. Oh he just needs to get it off his chest or it doesn't matter just let him

02:11:51.800 --> 02:12:02.200
say. So while on the outside I would say oh yeah my mother loved me but she didn't protect me.

02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:15.960
So was the was all the stuff that she expressed and all of the attention and all the love that I

02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:22.600
felt was that because I became successful and I was able to fulfill an emptiness that she'd

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:30.440
lived with her whole life with him? I don't know but I've had to ask myself

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:39.080
those questions over these last years to try to reconcile that for myself.

02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:46.040
And the thing you wanted from them and for them is less hate and more love.

02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:55.960
Did your dad say he loves you? I don't have any memory of that. I was in a program and they were

02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:03.960
showing us an experiment that they'd done with psychologists and mothers and fathers and their

02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.440
children and the children were anywhere between six months and a year sitting in a little crib.

02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:15.160
And the exercise was this parents are playing with the baby right there toys yada yada babies

02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:19.880
laughing at and then the psychologists would say stop and the parent would go like this.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:29.800
And you would then watch for the next two and a half three minutes this child trying to get their

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:38.120
parents attention in any possible way and I remember when I was sitting in this theater watching this

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:48.520
baby I saw myself that was me screaming and reaching out and trying to get my parents

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:55.560
attention that was me and that was not something I'd I'd ever remembered before

02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:59.320
but I I knew that what that baby was going through.

02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:12.120
Is there some elements of politics and maybe the private sector that are captured by the by

02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:18.520
house of cards like how true to life do you think that is from everything you've seen about politics

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:25.080
for maybe everything you've seen about the politicians of this particular elections.

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:33.240
I heard so many different reactions from politicians about house of cards some would say

02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:38.840
oh it's not like that at all and then others would say it's closer to the truth than anyone

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:44.360
wants to admit and I think I fall down in the side of that idea.

02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:54.600
I have to interview some world leaders some big politicians

02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:03.400
in your understanding of trying to become Frank Underwood what advice would you give

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:11.400
in interviewing Frank Underwood. How to how to get it to say anything that's at all honest.

02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:15.720
Well in Frank's case all you have to do is tell him to look into the camera and he'll tell

02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.600
he'll tell you what you want to hear. Unfortunately we don't get that look

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:26.520
into the the mind of a person the way we do with Frank Underwood in real life sadly.

02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:32.040
Well but you could say to somebody you like the series house of cards you know I'd love

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:37.240
for you to just look into the camera and tell us what's really going on what you really feel about

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:43.880
blah blah blah. That's a good technique I'll try that with Zelensky with Putin.

02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:53.160
What do you hope your legacy as an actor is and as a human being. People ask me now

02:15:54.600 --> 02:16:02.280
what's your favorite performance you've ever given and my answer is I haven't given it yet.

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:13.080
So there's a lot more that I want to be challenged by be inspired by.

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:23.480
There's a lot that I don't know there's a lot I have to learn

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:31.560
and that is a very exciting place to feel that I'm in.

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.360
You know it's been interesting because you know we're we're going back we're talking

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:47.880
and you know it's it's nice to go back every now and then but I'm focused on on what's next.

02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:51.640
Do you hope the world forgives you.

02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.320
People go to church every week to be forgiven

02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:09.240
and I believe that forgiveness and I believe that redemption are beautiful things. I mean look

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:16.440
don't forget I live in an industry in which there is a tremendous amount of conversation about

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.280
redemption from a lot of people who are very serious people in very serious positions

02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:31.240
who believe in it. I mean that guy who finally got out of prison he was wrongly accused that guy

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:38.200
who served his time and got out of prison. We see so many people saying let's find a path for that

02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:47.800
person let's help that person rejoin society but there is an odd situation if you're in the

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:56.440
entertainment industry you're not offered that kind of a path and I hope that the fear that

02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:03.240
people are experiencing will eventually subside and common sense will get back to the table.

02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:09.720
If it does do you think you have another Oscar worthy performance in you.

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.280
Listen if it would piss off Jack Lemmon again for me to win a third time I absolutely think so yeah.

02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:22.600
Well you have to mention him again you know Ernest Hemingway once said that the world is

02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:29.960
a fine place and worth fighting for and I agree with him on both counts. Kevin thank you so much

02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:35.960
for talking to me thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kevin Spacey to support

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:41.160
this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some

02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:49.560
words from Meryl Streep acting is not about being someone different it's finding the similarity

02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:57.480
in what is apparently different and then finding myself in there thank you for listening and hope

02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:07.480
to see you next time.
