0	5680	I tweet that and then I finish the day and I wake up the next morning and I glance at my phone.
5680	11840	I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are quote-tweeting it and demanding a retraction
11840	15760	and whatever. And I go, uh-oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention.
17360	24800	I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got a hundred messages
25360	31360	from, you should have aborted your son to, we're gonna find all of you to whatever else.
31360	35760	My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have a hundred DMs
36960	43920	to everything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know,
45760	50400	your Jewish faith, this and that and the other thing. And so at that point to me,
50400	54640	I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet.
55040	58800	And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed,
59360	66400	yes, the attacks escalated. It went through Candace Owens and then at foxnews.com, Newsmax,
66400	70240	kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible.
72480	77520	The following is a conversation with David Pakman, a left-wing progressive political commentator
77520	83600	and host of the David Pakman show. I hope to continue to have many conversations on politics
83600	88880	with prominent, insightful, and sometimes controversial figures across the political
88880	94320	spectrum. David and I have been planning to speak for a long time and I'm sure we'll speak many
94320	100560	more times. This conversation was challenging, eye-opening, and fun. This is the Lex Rudman
100560	106240	podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,
106240	113040	here's David Pakman. Are there interesting differences to you between terms like liberal,
113040	118160	Democrat, left-wing, leftist, progressive, socialist, communist, Marxist, far left,
118160	122160	center left, all of these labels? Is there interesting distinctions between them?
122160	126960	Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions. One is if you just want to say let's define each of these
126960	132080	as political terms, they're all different terms. You can be a progressive ideologically, but not
132080	136960	be a member of the Democratic Party. Many say the Democratic Party isn't even really very progressive,
136960	142720	so these are certainly terms that we could define in order to have a conversation about
142720	149120	the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation. Sometimes the terms are used
149840	157440	in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not really linked to policy
158080	163200	or any particular political question, but they can be used positively or negatively to just kind
163200	168880	of say, here's the image of this individual that I have in my mind. So like Marxist is
168880	176320	right now very popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats. There's very
176320	181520	few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of power in the United States, but even among the
181520	186400	general population. So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because
186480	191600	we want to compare and contrast the ideas that a particular group might bring to the discussion,
191600	196160	or are we using them as insults or to stifle conversation? There are terms that can be used to
196160	202080	start conversation or to stop it. And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month.
202720	207440	So the term leftist, I think, is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context
207440	218160	to describe what an outraged left-wing commentator? I think what you're kind of grasping onto is that
218800	225360	there's probably some set of ideas that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on
225360	231040	the left. The discussion of how that term is mostly being used is not about policy ideas. You're
231120	238960	accurately identifying that. And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear
238960	243600	and leftist is being used as a smear more at this point. Okay. But sometimes some of these
243600	249440	terms are useful. Can we try to pick the terms that are useful, like liberal and progressive and
249440	256880	Democrat, liberal and progressive? Is there an interesting, definable distinction between liberal
256880	263280	and progressive to you? That's maybe one of the most interesting ones. 10 years ago, liberal often
263280	271760	meant what now we mean by progressive. More recently, the progressive socialist-leaning
272320	279600	part of the political spectrum has started to use liberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who
279600	285040	is not really left enough. So liberal is very interesting because I remember talking with
285040	290080	my audience years ago, maybe eight years ago or something like that, where I identified I'm going
290080	296160	to now use the term progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs because liberal has now
296160	301680	been made a smear, it's being shifted into something else, and it also means more of like a center left
301680	310160	politics. So it's changed in some sense by necessity, by force, and also because the spectrum has
310160	316880	shifted to some degree. So the term liberal has evolved. Now liberal meaning some kind of
317680	323840	embodiment of the mainstream Democratic party, almost? To some degree. Sometimes I'm called,
323840	330080	I'm written off by, within my space, there are all sorts of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can
330080	336800	talk about, about where I am versus should be, could be, or am wrongly placed. And sometimes
337600	344080	an attack on me is he's just a lib, meaning I'm not left enough. I'm not progressive,
344640	349600	socialist, wherever else you want to go. So yeah, the problem with a lot of these terms and
349600	355280	they're used very casually by people who call into my show is that unless we actually define them
355280	359680	each time, they very often mean very different things to different people and often come with
359680	364640	an agenda attached to them. And so I find that they often stifle meaningful conversation rather
364640	372080	than encourage it. Do you sense that there's a drifting of what is the threshold to be a progressive
372080	378240	or is there, should we use progressive synonymously with Democratic socialist?
379040	384080	I think we should not use it synonymously with Democratic socialist. And this is where there's
384080	389600	another linguistic confusion and a political confusion. So we'll first talk about the linguistic
389600	396960	one. Social democracy versus Democratic socialism, very similar words in a different order. Okay.
398480	406640	My, the way I operate is Democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one would
406640	412720	seek to socialize ownership of the means of production as an example. Social democracy is a
412720	418160	very highly regulated form of capitalism, the likes of which we would see in Northern Europe,
418160	424800	Denmark, et cetera. These are very different things. I associate progressivism in 2023
425360	430960	with social democracy and would consider Democratic socialism a form of actual socialism that is
430960	435920	different. We're no longer talking about a capitalist organization of society.
435920	442160	So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in how society operates then?
442160	448720	Absolutely. And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about socializing
448720	456240	a couple more things than we socialize in most modern capitalist countries. I had this
456240	461280	conversation with Patrick Bet David recently. Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized
461280	466960	the military already in the United States. We've socialized some healthcare in the sense of like
466960	473680	the VA and Medicaid, et cetera. We're talking about socializing a couple more things still in a
473680	480160	capitalist country. Democratic socialism would be something beyond that. And as someone who is not
480160	486560	a Democratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best advocate for explaining exactly how
486560	491040	that system would function, but it would have some version of socializing ownership of the
491040	496880	means of production, businesses, et cetera. So you mentioned you appeared on the PBD podcast
496880	505360	with Patrick Bet David. The debate was pretty intense. I should say, I personally enjoyed it.
505360	510960	I thought, actually, you did well. And I thought Patrick did well. It was a good conversation.
510960	514800	I think there was a little bit of tension. Yeah. And I thought that Patrick actually,
515440	518880	so I disagreed with the internet, I thought Patrick just took on a kind of devil's advocate.
519760	525280	He was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you. But the internet thought that
525280	530400	he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas. I thought the tension between ideas,
531600	536960	I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with Donald Trump and Trump supporters.
536960	542320	That certainly could be the case. And people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can
542320	547440	imagine from this was your best thing you've ever done in public to you got humiliated and
547440	551920	your mother should have aborted you. And everything in between. So take your pick. But
553440	558320	the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me after was it incredibly
558320	564000	tense and awkward and because it seemed so combative. And I think I'm so used to those
564000	568560	types of tensions in the discussions that I have, that it's very comfortable to me. It's not like
568560	573600	afterwards, it's there's a grudge or it's tense or whatever the case may be. I'm very comfortable.
574400	577680	I disagree with people and that's it. So I did not find anything that happened
577680	580240	inappropriate. I disagreed with a lot of the things he said, certainly.
581200	586080	So you've also spoken with Michael Knowles, I think about the idea of what is a woman.
588320	591840	Can you speak broadly about your conversations with the people you disagree with?
593920	596160	Some of the cases, it feels like it's gone wrong.
596720	599120	The conversations have gone wrong. Yeah.
599120	603680	Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple different things and I'm the first to tell you that
604640	610560	depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different attitude about how, quote,
610560	616160	seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether I think it's going to be a deep policy discussion
616160	620880	versus whether it's going to be more of a performance for an audience that is expecting
620880	624160	a certain thing. And I think there's different types of shows. When I was interviewed by this
624160	628720	guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different, for example, than when I'm talking to
628720	634960	Patrick Bette David, just to give two examples. I think the reason I stopped doing the Michael
634960	639360	Knowles show was the number of threats I would get after the fact. That's really the reason.
639360	643760	I was glad to engage with him to the extent that the interviews were interesting and we could
643760	650240	organize it reasonably efficiently. But the reason I stepped away was sort of the aftermath.
650240	657200	But I did find him to be someone who was abundantly clear about his view and where he comes from.
657200	661760	And while I could not possibly disagree more with him in terms of politics and culture and
661760	667840	our backgrounds, everything is just so different, I found it easy to engage in the conversation
667840	671200	just because of how upfront and clear he was about what his beliefs were.
672240	676560	But the number of threats was too much. Yeah, it was just too much. And this,
677440	682480	I don't know how much you saw about this recent Twitter dust-up I was involved in that peaked
682480	687440	with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting about me and then declining from there.
687440	692080	Oh, let's talk through it. I didn't see it. I have to understand. The way you study Shakespeare,
692080	695920	I have to study your Twitter. I have to understand how much of a sarcasm.
696480	700400	It's mostly sarcasm. I mean, here's the thing. And I know that there are people who will say,
700400	705680	David, you're dealing with such serious issues. It's really not okay not to take everything
705680	712960	you do completely seriously. But my view is it's so incredible that I've between chance and timing
712960	717840	and so different things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally and it's
717840	722960	a career and it's financially sustainable and all these different things. I don't want to end up
722960	728720	taking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and all of these other things.
728720	733680	And this could have gone a completely different way. So my approach to a lot of this is let's not
733680	737440	take ourselves too seriously. And in particular on Twitter, a platform that
738480	744560	the degree to which it should be taken very seriously maybe has changed over time. I'm always
744560	747200	sort of thinking a little bit tongue-in-cheek on Twitter.
747200	749440	So what happened with Donald Trump Jr.?
749440	750080	So...
750080	751360	Or the full arc of it.
751360	756560	Yeah, to give you a one-minute arc and then we can pick whichever parts we want. After
757440	761280	a mass shooting, now you might say there's like two or three a day. You're correct.
761280	770000	After the Nashville mass shooting at a Christian school, I tweeted snarkily tongue-in-cheek to
770880	776400	point that thoughts and prayers not only aren't particularly useful after a shooting,
776400	783200	they also don't prevent shootings, that there's some confusion about how there would be a shooting
783200	788880	at a Christian school, given that it is a place where prayer is taking place. I think I jokingly
788880	792400	said something like, were they not praying enough or correctly?
792400	795120	In my deep journalistic integrity.
795120	795840	You have it.
795840	796640	I have your tweet.
796640	797200	Beautiful.
797200	797760	Beautiful.
797760	803280	This is the only display of journalistic integrity I will show today. Okay.
803280	804880	And I have a couple of responses.
804880	805200	Beautiful.
805200	807040	And you deleted the tweet since then.
807040	807760	Which I regret.
808560	809040	Oh, interesting.
809040	810000	And we can talk about that.
810000	813040	I would love to, because it's such an interesting decision.
813680	819120	Because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often
819120	824960	understand how it's going to be read. It's going to be analyzed like I mentioned Shakespeare.
824960	831120	Like there's certain, the use of certain words that you regret saying in a certain kind of way,
831120	836080	maybe just because it wasn't as eloquent as powerful, it didn't actually convey the thing,
837120	839680	or is the distraction to the main message, all that kind of stuff.
839680	844000	Okay. The actual tweet is very surprising that there would be a mass shooting at a Christian
844000	849040	school, given that lack of prayer is often blamed for these horrible events.
849040	854400	Is it possible they weren't praying enough or correctly, despite being a Christian school?
855200	865760	And a lot of people quote, retweeted that, which I'm assuming was the criticism.
865760	870160	So Colin Wright wrote, I used to consider you a reasonable progressive, but you clearly
870720	875600	devolved into partisan hackery. I'm an atheist. It cannot begin to fathom using the murder of
875600	880720	children and adults at a Christian school as an opportunity to dunk on the concept of prayer.
880720	884400	And you responded, I'm dunking on the people who send thoughts and prayers
884400	889440	and do nothing else. And the shootings continue. Okay. I'm sure there's a lot of other interactions.
889440	892000	There's a few other 100,000 interactions.
892000	894240	So that you want the arc leading to the leading.
894240	895200	Yes, please. Sorry.
895280	896720	I just wanted to display the...
896720	899280	Do you know what time of day I tweeted the original one?
899280	902800	I feel like it was in the afternoon or evening on a Monday.
904880	909600	3.42 p.m. on 27th, March 27th.
909600	910960	Which was a Monday. Okay.
910960	913920	So basically, I tweet that and then I finish the day.
913920	917120	So you tweet and then you go on with your day.
917120	922320	I might have looked once at Twitter and it had 2000 likes and a few people saying,
922720	927040	this might have missed the mark, but it's sort of like it's one of my 20,000 tweets.
927040	929680	I don't know. I wake up the next morning.
929680	932960	My baby daughter did not sleep till 7.30 the way I would like.
932960	937920	So she's up at 6 a.m. and I get up and I'm just there starting to make breakfast.
937920	940720	And I glance at my phone and I'm starting to...
940720	943440	This was when verified meant a different thing than it means now.
944160	950320	I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are quote tweeting it and demanding a retraction
950320	954240	and whatever. And I go, uh-oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention.
955840	958640	I then continue about my day.
958640	964400	Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got 100 messages from,
964400	969840	you should have aborted your son to, we're gonna find all of you to whatever else.
969840	971200	My dad has no idea what's going on.
971200	976960	He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs to everything else you can imagine.
977920	987040	And I start to get emails about your Jewish faith, this and that, and the other thing.
987040	991840	And so at that point, to me, I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse.
991840	997200	And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed,
997760	1004800	yes, the attacks escalated. It went through Candice Owens and then at FoxNews.com, Newsmax,
1004880	1011920	kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. I mean, thousands and thousands of the,
1011920	1018400	okay. But once I told my audience about what happened, I got thousands of messages from
1018400	1026160	people saying, David, only someone who doesn't know you and is determined to interpret this in
1026160	1032480	the worst possible faith would think you're blaming kids who died for getting shot. Of course,
1032480	1038240	you weren't doing that. I wish you hadn't deleted it so that it would still be up and you would now
1038240	1044800	see the tide kind of turning on it. This was not a fun three days, regardless. But I do regret
1044800	1052320	having deleted it because I wanted to do the quickest thing I thought I could to get people
1052320	1058480	to stop trying to find family members and send them threats. And so around noon, that's what I did.
1058480	1061920	And the truth is the threats didn't stop anyway because everybody had screenshoted it.
1062480	1064080	And I do wish I had left it up.
1065040	1070400	And is there some degree, maybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that?
1071120	1079360	In that, it feeds the mockery engine that fuels Twitter. So like, does that tweet really
1079360	1090640	represent what you believe? It absolutely represents the disgust with a politics that includes saying
1090640	1097920	we can't touch guns. We just, we can't. But we're willing to point to mental health or say we need
1097920	1105280	more prayer in schools or whatever. 1000 percent, it represents that view. Is it the type of snark
1105280	1111280	and sarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the topic rather than whatever the
1111280	1116240	number of characters is now on Twitter? No, definitely not. And so I am very cognizant
1116240	1121440	of the fact that it was unnecessarily provocative how it was written.
1123120	1128640	I think I asked a similar question to Ben Shapiro. Do you worry that this style of presentation
1128640	1136000	can turn you from being a deeply thoughtful, objective political thinker to somebody who's
1136000	1142480	just a partisan hack or partisan, what's a good word, talking head?
1143040	1146000	Do you mean with regard to Twitter or the format of my show in general?
1146640	1154160	So Twitter for now, let's start with Twitter for now. And can you silo your style of communication
1154240	1157680	on Twitter from being a virus that affects your mind?
1157680	1163840	Right. I don't have deep thoughts about the Twitter component beyond, I think,
1163840	1169280	across all sorts of disciplines. This is not the best way to most effectively solve problems
1170160	1173760	and figure out solutions to complex issues. You're talking about Twitter.
1173760	1179520	Now, right now I'm talking about Twitter. That being said, I think all of us, to some degree,
1179520	1185760	have to adapt our content to the platform that we're using in the same way that what I post to
1185760	1191360	YouTube is different than what I post to TikTok. What I post to Twitter is also different.
1191360	1199600	Do I think Twitter has been an unmitigated good for society? No. Have I chosen to step into
1199600	1204880	Twitter as one of the ways in which I get my message out with the good and the bad? Yes.
1205600	1211760	And I think that there is a deep conversation to be had there. I think zooming out a little bit
1212320	1215840	in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would come up because I think it's really interesting,
1216560	1221680	I will often get emails from people who say two things. I will get the, you would have
1221680	1228000	such a bigger audience if you did X type emails. And usually they are plays to sensationalism,
1228880	1235520	salacious and titillating content, more pop culture stuff, et cetera. On the other hand,
1235520	1241280	it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing really isn't as serious as it could be. And it
1241280	1246960	seems like you could do something more serious. And you should consider doing deep dives. Once
1246960	1250720	it was do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge. And I was like, nobody will watch that. So
1251680	1257520	it's not by accident that my show is the way it is, right? In an hour, I'm thinking of all the
1257520	1264080	platforms I'm on and I'm saying, okay, I want to do a relatively deep dive on the federal budget.
1264640	1271360	And I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office.
1271360	1276400	And I'm going to do a segment about the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made
1276400	1281840	up three words and said he endorsed a candidate who's named, right? I'm crafting that in total
1281840	1287520	to find a balance between let's build this audience as much as I can in order to have a
1287520	1293440	bigger base to get my message out there and include the more serious stuff with the hope
1293440	1297600	that there's a little bit of something for everyone. And I'm finding a balance between those two
1297600	1303200	sides of the spectrum. It's a deliberate thing. And I'm aware that if I were producing my show
1303200	1307360	50 years ago, the balance would probably be different and it would probably change again.
1307360	1312000	If the show was audio only rather than having all these video platforms,
1312000	1318320	it would also be different. But it's a decision that's proactively made to try to get the best
1318320	1321360	and most out of the hour that I'm creating every day.
1321360	1328400	It just feels like there's an entire machine fed by Twitter and journalism that wants to divide
1328400	1335920	people and the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division
1335920	1341520	feels like it's a tension with objective clear thinking sometimes. And so that's the,
1342880	1352800	I worry that there's a drug to it. There's too much fun to mock ridiculous people on the other side.
1353520	1361280	I think you're right about that. And the fact that that is true to me supports,
1361840	1365840	I've talked with my audience about, you know, like the old food pyramid, which I guess was
1365840	1368880	like wrong, but let's imagine that there was a pyramid that made sense.
1369440	1370480	What's at the bottom bread?
1371040	1375600	I think like whole grains, maybe. I don't remember. It's been a while since I saw that.
1376160	1379440	Junk food is at the very top. I'm very open with my audience.
1380240	1384080	The vast majority of what I do is the top of that pyramid.
1385040	1391840	And I tell people very openly, I don't consume a lot of the type of content I produce.
1392800	1398240	And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical thinking,
1398240	1403600	epistemology, how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world.
1404480	1408880	After that, reading history, economics, philosophy, etc.
1409680	1415120	After that, now we're getting into current events, I would mostly be looking at consuming
1416720	1423520	primary source reporting, things like associated press, whatever. I know everybody will have a
1423520	1429280	different list of what counts there. After that is when I'd say indulge in some of the commentary
1429280	1435280	type stuff that I do. If you find that I'm thoughtful enough to make it into that,
1435360	1439680	but I'm very open. And really, what I try to do on my show often is,
1439680	1444000	in being that at the top of the pyramid, tell people there's all this other stuff
1444000	1448960	that should be forming your foundation that I hope you're consuming in addition to just
1448960	1451200	watching me. And I'm very open with my audience about that.
1451920	1457520	What about the shape, the dynamics, the characteristics of your audience? Is there
1457520	1463920	some degree to which you're through mocking maybe Republicans that there's a
1466000	1469440	lean to that audience and then you become captured by the audience? Do you worry about
1469440	1477440	the audience capture? I worry about it. I'm relatively comfortable that it's not shaping
1477440	1485040	the program to a great degree in the sense that at this point, I have a pretty good sense of the
1485040	1490400	things I can say that will upset what I might call my core audience. One of the interesting things
1490400	1495840	just to briefly go back to the Twitter thing was those people who were furious with me on Twitter
1495840	1501200	and they contacted my advertisers and some advertisers dropped me and on and on and on.
1501920	1507200	None of them are actually in my audience. None of them are regular consumers of my audience.
1507200	1511200	They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, hey, look at this.
1511200	1515200	The people who follow Candace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value,
1515200	1519760	they're not in my audience. And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk
1519760	1525120	about that will generate displeasure, I guess you could say with my audience. Sometimes when
1525120	1529440	I touch the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that will happen. Sometimes on vaccines,
1529440	1534480	there's a portion of my audience that is more generally skeptical of vaccines.
1535440	1543120	Sometimes on some foreign policy issues. Or I'm not a big fan of Marianne Williamson,
1543120	1549200	nor Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s challenges to Joe Biden, not because I love Joe Biden,
1549200	1552480	but because I don't consider them to be the most serious challengers. I know there's people in
1552480	1557200	my audience who don't like that. They get mad at me about that. And I'm totally okay with that
1557760	1564000	and that tension with my core audience. So in that sense, I don't feel as though I've had that
1564000	1570320	audience capture take place. But I know it can happen. And I'm very open to being told ways
1570320	1577280	in which it may be happening without me noticing. So I've made a call for questions on Reddit
1577280	1582080	for this conversation. There's a lot of good questions that I'll probably bring up. But
1582080	1589920	one of them was about Marianne Williamson asking why David thinks she is a garbage candidate,
1590640	1597040	which of course, I've never said, but perhaps you have more eloquently criticized. So let's
1597040	1604000	go there to the 2024 election. Okay. So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running
1604000	1609680	again. Donald Trump officially announced that he's running again. And if that's the matchup,
1609680	1615280	who do you think wins? If the elections held today, I think Biden.
1615520	1623200	What? Well, first of all, I believe he won last time. And if I start with the results from 2020,
1623760	1630080	and I think to myself, what has happened since then that would push or pull voters one way or
1630080	1637200	the other, I have a hard time making a case that Trump is in a better position today than he was
1637200	1643040	in November of 2020. So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an
1643040	1651600	election with a known outcome. What has changed? And I can't make a case for circumstances having
1651600	1656720	changed in Trump's favor to give a couple of state level examples. Florida seems to be kind of
1656720	1664240	moving more to the Republican side since 2020. But Trump won that state already in 2020. So it
1664240	1670080	wouldn't really change the outcome. Arizona was close. I think Arizona has moved to the left
1670080	1676000	since 2020. So I don't see Trump taking that one. Wisconsin, I think the same sort of thing applies.
1676000	1681840	So being very practical, that would be kind of the start of my reasoning.
1683440	1688960	Do you think Joe Biden is a better candidate now than he was in 2020?
1690240	1697440	I think he's a worse candidate. This is going to sound agist, but I think he's a worse candidate
1697440	1705280	in that he's even older and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates,
1705280	1712080	particularly on the Democratic voting side. So he's going to be four years older and in a sense
1712080	1719040	that could be a liability. However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments. Now,
1719040	1722400	you might not like the things he's done in which case that would hurt him,
1722480	1728400	but he has started to accumulate a not insignificant number of accomplishments.
1728400	1732640	Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act and COVID Stimulus,
1733440	1737200	but also less well-known things like a bunch of little tweaks to health care,
1737840	1741280	a bunch of little tweaks to student lending. There's been a lot of little things.
1742800	1748240	At the macro level, I don't actually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this the same way
1748240	1752960	I didn't credit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but Inflation has started
1752960	1758160	to come down significantly. The stock market's quite steady, these sort of things. I think looking
1758160	1764160	historically, it's a pretty okay environment for Joe Biden with the exception that he was
1764160	1769680	already the oldest president to be inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat his own record in
1769680	1772880	January of 2025. And I just don't know how voters are going to see that.
1773600	1779680	So in terms of just a public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden? So if I were
1779680	1787040	to give criticism towards Trump, it would be that his chaotic, maybe to the point of being
1787040	1791760	disrespectful to a lot of different groups, to a lot of different ideas, to a lot of different
1791760	1796320	nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff. And then the criticism towards Biden would be that
1797280	1804960	he may be perhaps because of age or any other kind of cognitive capabilities is not really there
1804960	1810960	mentally as in the way that perhaps you could say that Barack Obama was there,
1810960	1817760	just mentally being able to handle all kinds of aspects of being a public representative of a
1817760	1825600	nation to the world and to the people of that nation. So which in the competition of personality
1825600	1832160	flaws, which do you think is more powerful? You've laid out fair and I believe accurate
1832160	1840240	assessments of elements of both of those men. You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value
1840240	1845600	each of those assessments, which is where I think the kind of meat of this question really is.
1847520	1852800	I don't see, and I know that Biden's going to get us into World War III, World War III,
1852880	1860480	doesn't seem to be happening. I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on.
1861040	1869040	I don't see them as dangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this kind of
1869840	1878240	environment with our traditional Western allies and geopolitics, etc. in the way that the sort
1878320	1883360	of unhinged personality of Trump combined with his lack of knowledge about most issues
1884080	1891520	is a threat. So for me, if those two are the candidates, Biden would be my choice. Now,
1891520	1896960	are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side? Yes. If I knew the president
1896960	1902560	would be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump? Absolutely. It's so funny
1902560	1909120	when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference seemed so significant between them.
1909680	1915120	Thinking back, I'm sure I would disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his views on LGBT,
1915120	1920960	or I know are different than mine, but it seems without looking at him with rose-colored glasses,
1920960	1926160	so comparatively benign given the four years of Trump. So that's kind of where I come down.
1926160	1933760	Even McCain and Obama, the differences seemed quite drastic. Yeah. McCain was interesting
1933760	1939360	because Palin, as his running mate, opened the door to the sort of cartoonish stuff that we've
1939360	1945840	started to see on the Republican side. Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor-Green, it started going in
1945840	1951120	that direction, which has made the party a bit of a joke. Aside from what you believe the tax rate
1951120	1958320	would be. You can say taxes are too high, but Jewish space lasers come on, but I agree with
1958320	1963760	you on McCain also. Going back to the political terms we talked about, where in that spectrum do
1963760	1969600	you place yourself today? Which of the label do you think captures your political views?
1969600	1976960	Progressive Social Democrat, which again, is a capitalist. I own my own business. I pay the
1976960	1982480	taxes I'm legally required to pay and not a penny more and all those things. That's where I place
1982480	1989520	myself. Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden? Yes. Where does the AOC fit into that?
1991440	1996400	That's a good question. What do you think about AOC as a candidate? Do you think she eventually
1996400	2005280	runs? I think that if she doesn't run into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal in the
2005280	2015440	sense of some personal impropriety, but I mean some kind of major political problem, it seems that
2015440	2021600	she has the staying power to be an American elected politics for a long time. Whether she would even
2021600	2026720	want to be president versus maybe going to the Senate or being governor or whatever the case
2026720	2032080	may be, I have no idea what her ambitions are in that sense. But certainly, policy aside,
2032640	2042160	she has this combination of charisma, likeability to some, but also something about her personality
2042160	2047920	that angers the people who don't like her in a way that only fuels her presence,
2048960	2053840	which I think applies to Trump as well, that I do think that she has the potential to have
2053840	2056880	significant staying power in American politics. President, I don't know.
2056880	2062080	Do you think that's the future of political elections and politics in general,
2062720	2067280	is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side, like AOC and Trump did?
2067280	2074080	I think it's an aspect of it. I think it's also understanding how to communicate policy ideas.
2075280	2079280	Trump, I have things I can praise Trump about if we want to get to that segment at some point.
2079280	2084080	You let me know when that is, but I do think that there are some things Trump is very good at,
2084080	2088400	and this is why it's very hard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes
2088400	2094960	to actually fight Trump in a national primary. And one of those things is
2095760	2100800	Trump has a, even though he often says very strange things, that if you transcribe them,
2100800	2105200	you go, what language is that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the moment,
2105200	2112400	the way he relates to adversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that he is very much
2112400	2116000	aware of how it is going to be seen by the audience. And so that's why a lot of times it's
2116000	2120000	more about, doesn't matter that a word salad came out of his mouth, how he immediately responded
2120000	2127280	and related to the person, very good. So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared
2127280	2133200	all the time, often out of context, is extraordinarily important. Knowing how to use social media,
2133200	2137840	which every election cycle, that means something different. But understanding how to use social
2137840	2144720	media, very important. Those things are absolutely so important. And whether you're able to do a
2144720	2151040	deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful, but I would say it's a bad thing. It's becoming
2151040	2156480	less important in terms of figuring out who we want to represent us. So just lingering on the AOC,
2156480	2162160	and then maybe let's throw in Bernie Sanders on that. Yeah. So where do you place yourself and
2162160	2169440	how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe Biden, and David Backman?
2170160	2177600	My instinct is, and I'm going to answer it, the thing that makes this tough is Bernie says,
2178240	2185120	he's a democratic socialist. He ran as a social democrat. He didn't run on anything that was
2185120	2190960	really socialism. So I'm going by their public facing platforms.
2190960	2195440	I've been listening to him for many, many years and all the way back to the Tom Hartman show.
2195440	2201280	And I think using the terms as you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever been a
2201280	2209440	democratic socialist. I haven't heard him speak about socialism. I think I've heard him speak about
2210320	2216080	social programs and the value of social programs throughout the history of the United States and
2216640	2220960	how they've been beneficial. My understanding is very similar to yours, although there may be
2220960	2225680	stuff from the 70s where he really was talking about bona fide. We've all did some shit in the
2225680	2229840	70s. Yeah, you and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the 70s. I feel like I would
2229840	2235760	did, yeah. My sense would be Biden is like center left, and then I'm to the left of that,
2236960	2244160	but maybe just inside of where AOC and Bernie are very, very similar to Bernie. I mean, I identify
2244160	2250160	with a lot of Bernie's ideas, maybe their implementation I'm more flexible on. I'll give you
2250160	2256640	one example, Medicare for all. One way of trying to get healthcare to everybody, which Bernie's
2256640	2261520	very big on, is you take the current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit,
2261520	2267520	make it available to everybody, pay for it through taxation. Interesting. However, I'm open to other
2267520	2274080	models if they get everybody healthcare, that is good quality and affordable. Singapore has
2274080	2280080	an interesting model, Germany has an interesting model. I am more agnostic about how we do it
2280080	2286080	than just saying, let's expand Medicare. Whether that puts me to the right of Bernie, I don't know,
2286080	2289040	but I'm not like exactly right there on it has to be Medicare for all.
2289600	2295120	Yeah, that's more of a, that's more just flexibility versus dogmatism. So I don't
2295200	2298960	know if that puts you to the left or to the right. I don't either. What do you think about
2298960	2306720	the term manipulation or the corruption in the DNC that perhaps tipped the scales against Bernie
2306720	2309840	in the election? Do you think there was such a thing? 2016 or 2020?
2314000	2319760	Both, I would say. In different, the dynamics there were different with Hillary Clinton and
2320400	2324160	the pressure from Hillary Clinton as a candidate and so on. Yeah, what, I mean,
2324720	2329440	was there, why didn't Bernie win? I guess there's one way to ask.
2329440	2336000	Okay. I think there's a couple of things here. First, the DNC, I'm not a Democrat,
2336000	2341280	just your audience may not know, I'm just an independent. I mostly vote for candidates that
2341280	2345520	end up being Democrats in local elections. Often there's no party designation. So, okay,
2345520	2349360	I'm obviously on the left, I'm not denying that, but the Democratic Party as an institution is
2349360	2354480	never really been interesting to me. You're still a rebel that resists belonging to any institution.
2354480	2361680	Exactly right, exactly right. And whether it matters, I don't know. The DNC and the RNC
2362320	2367840	really are organizations that to some degree exist to justify their own existence because
2367840	2375840	if they were no longer necessary, they would go away. And so they have to assert their value
2375840	2380160	and their importance. They do this in a number of different ways, organizing the way that the
2380160	2386640	nominee is chosen, the convention, working with states on everything from redistricting to whatever
2386640	2391040	else the case may be, setting the order of primaries and having some involvement in how
2391040	2398320	that's all going to happen. And also coordinating behind the scenes, I guess they would describe it
2398320	2404000	as making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways. We might see it and say,
2404000	2409600	they're picking the winner. There's nothing illegal about them being involved in picking
2409600	2415120	the winner, but we might say it's not in people's interests. I think the 2020 primary was really
2415120	2423280	interesting. Bernie supporter, myself, I started telling my audience after a couple primaries and
2423280	2429120	even before based on polling and different things, I see a real uphill battle here for Bernie.
2430080	2436320	And it's really important. People in my audience are not the average union worker in Michigan
2436320	2441120	who is mostly working and raising a family and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote
2441120	2445760	on election day. If you spend a lot of time on Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated
2445760	2453760	sense of Bernie's popularity within the Democratic Party. That was my sense. And to some degree,
2454720	2460480	we saw that in certain states. I don't have the exact primary order and results in front of me
2460480	2466880	or in my head, but the big turning point was South Carolina. South Carolina was when Joe Biden,
2466880	2473040	one and one handily, understood to be because of the larger African-American population in South
2473040	2478320	Carolina. And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now, whether it was the
2478320	2482960	day after or the day before, some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of support,
2483520	2491360	got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden. And to some degree, of course, it was all organized
2491360	2497680	and timed to help Joe Biden. There's no doubt about that. This is what the DNC does. It's hard
2497680	2504880	for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like, if we believe they were there to be
2504880	2510320	unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on the side as possible, it would make sense to be furious
2510320	2516000	that they've gone against their stated kind of mandate. But we know that the DNC
2517120	2522240	negotiates and is working behind the scenes and has a favorite, that favorite was Hillary in 2016,
2522240	2528480	2020. So I share the frustration about the power that the DNC has, but for people who were saying
2528480	2533040	they did something illegal or whatever else the case may be, that doesn't seem to be the case.
2533600	2538800	But this is part of why, I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans and
2538880	2543120	Democrats. And there's probably four major changes that have to happen in order to make that a
2543120	2550240	reality. But I share the frustration of folks while recognizing that Reddit was not accurately
2550240	2555440	representing Bernie's level of popularity. Still, I wish that the bias wasn't towards the,
2556240	2561600	what could be negatively termed a deep state, towards the bureaucracy, towards the momentum
2561600	2567120	of the past, which I think Joe Biden kind of represents, versus new ideas, which is funny
2567120	2572880	to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas, because he's also an older gentleman.
2572880	2578240	Well, it's a frame, it's a lot of framing. And the other aspect to that is, on paper,
2579360	2585440	Joe Biden's platform was arguably the most progressive of any Democratic candidate who
2585440	2589920	won the nomination. Now, of course, there were people who challenged the nominations who were to
2589920	2597360	Joe Biden's left. A lot of this is perspective. And that's how you end up saying the guy who's
2597360	2601200	a couple of years older than Biden is actually the guy with the fresh perspective, which is
2601200	2605760	interesting because I don't disagree with you. Yeah. And then you also have to say the perspective
2605760	2610960	doesn't always align with the policies. You're right. The actual policies of Joe Biden are different
2610960	2616560	than maybe the perception of Joe Biden. Or what he ran on. I mean, just two examples I would give
2616640	2623120	are, during his campaign, he played up a little bit his interest in doing student loan forgiveness
2623120	2628480	and something on cannabis. I never bought it. I told my audience, I think he's saying this stuff
2628480	2633280	because this is the way the tide is kind of, the wind is blowing and he's being advised to
2633280	2636960	say this stuff. I don't think he's going to do very much on either of these things. He did actually
2636960	2643360	do some student loan stuff. But that would be two examples, I think. Okay, let's go to the
2643760	2650480	something you alluded to, which is the pros and cons of a particular candidate. Well, what do you,
2650480	2659040	as a critic of Trump, what do you are the pros, the strengths of Donald Trump,
2659040	2664800	and what do you are as big as weaknesses? The strengths of Trump. Let's see how I can frame
2664800	2670160	them in a way that is both accurate and accurately assesses my feeling about it.
2670160	2673920	It could be taken out of context most masterfully through the clipping process.
2673920	2684080	Yes, Trump's strengths are mostly superficial and in terms of presentation. Trump was able to,
2684800	2690880	I call it a grift, some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people.
2690880	2698080	Trump, as a rich guy from New York City, was able to convince people that he spent most of his life
2698080	2705200	trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind, that he knew
2705200	2712880	why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy, and that he had solutions that he was going to
2712880	2719280	bring forward. The truth is, he never really liked those people, and as soon as they weren't useful
2719280	2724960	to him for a brief period of time, that love affair with his followers stopped, and then
2724960	2730640	now it's back that he needs them again, he didn't really understand the causes of the problems that
2730640	2735040	those folks were experiencing, and his solutions were laughable. Jared was going to solve the
2735040	2739920	Israeli-Palestinian conflict in year one, he was going to replace Obamacare in 2017,
2739920	2745200	things that were never going anywhere, anywhere. But what he did really well was,
2745200	2752640	he put up a united front of, I know what is ailing you, I know how to fix it, and I know how to fix
2753040	2758400	it, I guess because he's a businessman, and he's been above the fray of politics for so long,
2758960	2762640	knowing how to use political donations to his advantage, he called that smart, etc.
2762640	2770240	I think that's his greatest strength. Why do you say that the Jared plan for Israel-Palestine
2770240	2774720	and the plan for healthcare to improve Obamacare, why do you say that's laughable?
2774720	2779600	Well, only someone, I would include the North Korea plan as well, which I'm glad to talk about,
2780160	2787840	only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues
2788400	2794400	could so arrogantly say that they could solve them in that way and on that timeframe. I'm all
2794400	2802480	for optimism and bringing a new face to things, absolutely, without a doubt, but a wall with
2802480	2808720	Mexico that Mexico will pay for at the end of my first term. I know there are people who believed
2808720	2813120	it because they would call into my show and say, I'm voting for Trump because of it, but it's hard
2813120	2818880	to believe that anybody serious would fall for that unless you were deliberately wanting to just
2818880	2824080	believe whatever was being fed to you or you just hadn't ever thought about these issues before.
2824080	2831120	The healthcare plan, in 2017, they proposed one would have led to 24 million or so people ending
2831120	2835280	up without healthcare, didn't go anywhere because it was so terrible, and then in August of 2020,
2835280	2841600	Trump said, in two weeks, I'm going to finally have my healthcare proposal. It's 2023. We still
2841600	2846320	never got it. With all of these things when you think them through, it was just sort of arrogance,
2846320	2852560	and I get the perspective of, I want optimism and I liked that optimism. It worked. I mean, fair.
2852560	2857200	A lot of people saw it and liked it. As someone who followed a lot of those issues closely,
2858080	2860800	they seemed, of course, like impossible promises.
2860880	2866000	What's a double-edged sword? It's a pushback a little bit. If you look at the things I have
2867520	2870960	a little bit more knowledge about, which is the space of artificial intelligence,
2872080	2875280	there's a company called DeepMind and it's a company called OpenAI
2876160	2880320	that we'll laugh at for a long time when they were talking about that they're going to solve
2880320	2887360	intelligence. Now, they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT,
2887920	2893600	they've made progress that most of the community would not have imagined they'd be able to make.
2894160	2899840	Everything from AlphaGo beating the World Go champion, just all the different
2900640	2906160	steps in progress they can get into were surprised to everybody, and they are legitimately
2908880	2915920	fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence. The other aspect, he gets a lot of
2915920	2922960	criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk. I can say a lot of things like SpaceX,
2923520	2928000	so commercial space flight, he was laughed at for a long time that that's possible.
2929520	2934000	Same thing with autopilot in Tesla, autonomous vehicles, his approach was
2934000	2940400	harshly criticized by all the experts and still criticized, to this day, deeply criticized,
2940480	2946480	and I as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a
2946480	2953600	semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising. The reason I mention that is sometimes
2953600	2963840	it feels like you need the guy or the gal who makes those preposterous, ambitious statements,
2964240	2971680	we're going to solve healthcare this year. And then there's experts like yourself,
2971680	2977600	that are looking, thinking, have you read anything about the history of Israel-Palestine,
2977600	2984480	is a good example of that. Do you know there's a history there? Do you realize how complicated,
2984480	2989440	how many people have tried, how many people have failed, how many millions of people hate each other
2989520	2998240	in this little place, in this land? Sometimes the expertise can really weigh you down,
2998240	3004800	so to push back, sometimes you have to have the almost be naive and stupid and just rush in
3004800	3007840	with an optimism in order to actually make some progress.
3007840	3013520	I agree with you 100%. I think it's interesting that all of the examples you gave of successes
3013520	3016320	are from the technology space. Not politics yet.
3016320	3021200	Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on some of these
3021200	3025840	issues more quickly without a doubt. I do think at some point though, when it comes down to voting
3025840	3030960	and saying one of these people is going to be ostensibly in charge for four years through all
3030960	3035920	of the departments and secretaries and choices that they make, we do want to apply some level of
3035920	3041760	realism with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space and they're good examples.
3041760	3046000	There's no question about it. One thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley
3046000	3053760	Hope's new book about North Korea and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter,
3053760	3060000	but in the background of the book, it's written, much of what is written about happens during the
3060000	3064800	Trump era and when Trump did the first and then the second, I guess you'd call them summits with
3064800	3072720	Kim Jong-un. It actually did seem like to some degree, Trump's, we're going to handle this like
3072720	3080640	I do a business deal approach to Kim Jong-un. In some sense, it actually was logical because of
3080640	3087520	Kim Jong-un and the way that it was so ego-driven and they both as sort of authoritarian strongmen
3087520	3092000	types to different degrees wanted that. There was actually a kernel where I actually thought,
3092000	3097280	as I read it, Trump's initial idea wasn't crazy. The problem was he knew nothing about the backstory
3097280	3102400	of the relationship. He fell for all sorts of lies from Kim Jong-un and he made offers that
3102400	3106720	didn't make any sense to me. It fell apart. Fine. But that's an example where I think Trump's
3106720	3112640	personality was not actually at its base, the problem when it came to North Korea.
3112640	3116640	Well, there's other things of this nature that could go in, or some people argue,
3116640	3121920	goes into the strengths and pros of Donald Trump. For China, for example, terrorist on China.
3122640	3126800	Can you make the case that there's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump
3126960	3131200	acted with China? It's really tough. And I'll give you a couple reasons why.
3131200	3139600	Okay, then also cons. It's tough to make. So the China thing is really, so just very recently to
3139600	3144320	when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed by a guy named Mark Levin.
3144960	3150720	And Trump proposed a new, I call it a conspiracy theory, maybe it will strike you as something
3150720	3157120	different about China, COVID and tariffs. And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs
3157120	3164080	cost China so much money, China sent the US so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as
3164080	3170640	punishment. Now there's a couple problems with that. One, American companies pay the tariffs.
3171680	3177440	Trump still doesn't seem to know this. Trump seems to believe that when he puts a tariff on Chinese
3177520	3184320	imports, someone in China is cutting a check to the United States. American companies buy the
3184320	3188800	stuff from China, and then American companies cut a check to the United States for the tariff.
3190160	3194160	Trump doesn't seem to get that. But it still has a sting to the Chinese economy.
3194160	3199280	You can make the argument that if there is a suitable alternative domestically or from a
3199280	3205360	different country, that it will reduce imports, but it didn't happen. And we actually have reports
3205360	3213360	now that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter million American jobs. The other problem with
3213360	3224320	that idea is China created and released a virus in order to hurt you. But as of today, 5.7 of the
3224320	3230080	6.8 million deaths were in other countries. It's a very indirect way. You're mostly killing people
3230080	3237200	in other countries to hurt Trump. This is the sort of thing where when I think about how Trump
3237200	3243840	dealt with China, it's very scary. Because given another four years, who knows what he might do
3243840	3251280	if he still doesn't understand how tariffs work? Geopolitics operates in complicated ways with
3251280	3258080	carrots and sticks. Henry Kissinger has written quite a lot about this. In some sense, the positive
3258080	3265440	aspect here that Donald Trump is willing to take big risks in the game of geopolitics
3265440	3273120	with this giant superpower that is China. And a lot of others are too afraid, too afraid to call
3273120	3281280	them out, to come to the table and criticize. I certainly think that's an argument that can be
3281280	3288800	made. My question would be, what tangible positive outcomes did it lead to? And it's tough to identify
3288800	3294400	any. But I think it's a great thing. I mean, listen, one of the things you're kind of getting at,
3294400	3301200	maybe indirectly, is that there's been this sense that politics has been done very similarly for a
3301200	3306320	long time. And even between Democrats and Republicans, still, even with some policy
3306320	3312160	differences, there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC mostly dealing
3312160	3317280	with issues that don't directly affect. I get that. I'm with you on that. I think the question
3317280	3323920	is to whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than extraordinarily humiliating in many ways.
3323920	3328720	I just come down on it was an absolute and total humiliation. But I understand that
3328720	3334080	you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude was refreshing in some way.
3334080	3338000	That's a reasonable position for someone to take. I disagree with it, but I understand it.
3338000	3340480	But it's trying and feeling better than not trying.
3342000	3347520	This goes well beyond politics. Wayne Gretzky is waiting about this. Michael Jordan is waiting about
3347520	3352880	this. Is it better to have tried and failed than never? Is it better to have loved and lost
3352880	3357920	than never to have loved? I don't know. I mean, listen, we live through four years of Trump.
3357920	3364640	We know what that four-year term was like, and it's very hard for me to say that the things
3364640	3370160	he tried were overwhelmingly reasonable. But I get the point you're trying to make,
3370160	3375760	and I appreciate it. If we don't do any of it, then where do we end up? Sure. We know where we
3375760	3382080	ended up with Trump, and it was pretty embarrassing. Okay, let's linger on some more strengths.
3382080	3386400	We didn't start any new wars. Is there something to that?
3386400	3390960	Yeah, it's interesting. There's a few different approaches to dealing with that.
3392160	3398160	First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who like to
3398160	3402480	say that was that Hillary Clinton was going to start three wars. Sometimes they say four wars.
3402480	3409360	Sometimes they say five wars. Okay. The geopolitical situation during the four years that Trump was
3409360	3415680	in office, I don't know that they obviously lent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was able
3415680	3420960	to keep us out of. I think the Russia thing is interesting because now it's very popular to go
3421520	3427680	back and say, the reason Putin didn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump and to somehow give
3427680	3434880	Trump credit for that. There's a counterpoint to it, which is Putin under Trump, particularly if
3434880	3440480	Trump got four more years, would have been able to maybe consolidate power in other ways because
3440480	3444160	of his relationship with Trump. I'm not coming down on one side or the other. It's not my area
3444160	3449760	of expertise, but it's not the open shut slam dunk that Trump likes to say it is. Putin didn't
3449760	3457200	invade because he knew I would crush him. Okay. It's not obvious to me that there were imminently
3457200	3465120	wars that would have started during that time. That being said, for all the criticism of Obama
3465120	3471200	during Crimea, Trump seemed to just forget about that after all the criticism and say,
3471200	3476960	I'm not actually going to do anything about that. There are foreign policy criticisms that could be
3476960	3483120	made, but it is true. No new wars were started under Trump. I like that. I don't like wars.
3483120	3488240	What do you think about his handling of COVID? Can you say what are the pros and cons of his
3488240	3493760	handling of COVID? The con for him is he'd be president right now if he had handled it differently.
3494400	3500480	I think it's abundantly clear. Early on, and there's now a lot of really good reporting about
3500480	3506000	the conversations he was having with Jared Kushner and others. He became convinced either because
3506000	3509280	of things he was being told or because he decided this is the way it's going to be.
3509280	3514880	This is going to go away. Fine. It's in China. Okay. It's in China and Italy. Okay. We have 15
3514880	3520800	cases, but it'll soon be zero. We'll be opened by Easter of 2020. None of it happened.
3522480	3528480	If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan and I've said this to
3528480	3534080	Patrick Bet-David, and they tend to all see my side of this. If Trump had said, listen,
3534960	3541120	we don't know how bad this is going to be, but I care too much about the American people to
3541120	3547280	take a shot. It's not going to be two weeks. It's going to be a little bit, but I need your help.
3547280	3550880	We're going to bring everybody together. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican.
3550880	3555120	We're going to have MAGA masks, and you could have kept 50 cents on the dollar to pay off,
3555120	3562240	store me or whoever. But it would have been, I think he wins reelection because the perception
3562240	3568800	was, and reality is a version of that, the perception was that he was way too cavalier
3568800	3576720	about it early on. People died who didn't need to die. I think that it was arguably
3577760	3582880	the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that he was going to get himself
3582880	3587520	reelected. Well, to push back on that, I mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns
3587520	3592080	kind of a solution to COVID. I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy.
3594080	3599200	There's several solutions to a pandemic, broadly speaking, and one of them is vaccine,
3599920	3607120	and so you didn't mention that. He'd fast-tracked the development. His administration fast-tracked
3607120	3612320	the development of the vaccine, which, surprising, he didn't really take much credit for.
3612320	3615360	I think he did. I think he tried. There's a couple, there's a lot there.
3615360	3623200	Well, to me, it seems like you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures that
3623920	3629040	his decisions for fast-tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives.
3629040	3633360	You could, in the Trumpian way, make that case.
3633360	3638080	So a couple different things. I know you don't necessarily follow Trump's rallies as closely
3638080	3646320	as I do, and I'm jealous of you for that, but he did tout the vaccine stuff hugely for a while
3647440	3654000	until his audience turned against him, and then he had to draw this line where he was going,
3654000	3657920	I made the vaccines, which none of you have to take, by the way,
3657920	3661840	freedom. You don't have to take them, but it's fantastic, and nobody else could have done it,
3661840	3665920	but don't worry, nobody's going to make you take the vaccine. And he actually got booed at a couple
3665920	3669040	of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines. But let's back up a little bit.
3669760	3675920	Fast-tracking. My understanding of what he did is he did what any president in his situation would
3675920	3682400	do and what many world leaders elsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to pre-purchase supply
3682400	3688240	of vaccine in order to provide money to pharmaceutical companies to scale up the manufacturing,
3688240	3694080	which is absolutely fine. But he wants, one of the stories he tells is it usually takes
3694080	3701680	12 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months, thanks to me. Decades of mRNA technology
3701680	3708320	being developed created the platform in which you can make a particular vaccine in nine months,
3708320	3713360	didn't have anything to do with Trump. He did pre-fund and say, we will buy huge supply,
3713360	3718240	and that provided liquidity to the pharmaceutical companies. But he also delegated control to
3719040	3725760	to people, to experts that enable that kind of fast-tracking of vaccines.
3726400	3730400	He was very eager for the FDA to approve it because he saw that there would be a political
3730400	3734400	benefit. And he didn't get in the way, I guess. He didn't get in the way. Fair. I think now we're
3734400	3738640	on the same page. He did not get in the way of vaccines being developed, which is good.
3739200	3743280	Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way.
3744240	3748400	I don't disagree with that. I'm not aware of really any governments that got in the way.
3748400	3753680	I mean, it seemed given the global situation, everybody, European countries were pre-purchasing
3753680	3759920	vaccine. African countries were who were going to be later to receive vaccines, were partnering
3759920	3764560	with the European countries that had pre-purchased. But the most interesting thing about all of this
3764560	3770000	is Trump did play up the vaccines for a long time until his crowd didn't want to hear about it
3770000	3775040	anymore, which was crazy. It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created,
3775040	3780400	to some degree. One of the effects of all this that makes me truly sad is this division over
3780400	3786640	the vaccines has created distrust in science. And also what makes me sad is the scientific
3788160	3792640	leaders, Anthony Fauci, being one of the representatives of that community,
3792640	3799600	I would say completely dropped the ball. They spoke with arrogance.
3800320	3806240	They spoke down to people. They spoke in a way that a great scientist does not speak,
3806240	3813760	which is they spoke with certainty, without humility. They have all the wisdom and all
3813760	3818000	of us are too dumb to understand it, but they're going to be the parent that tells us exactly
3818000	3825600	what to do versus speaking to the immensity of the problem, the deep core of the problem,
3825600	3830800	being the uncertainty. We don't know what to do. The terrifying thing about the pandemic,
3830800	3835200	we don't know anything about it as it's happening. And so you have to make decisions. You have to
3835200	3842480	take risks about, well, maybe you have to overreact in order to protect the populace. But it's in the
3842560	3849760	face of uncertainty. They have to do that, not empowered by science somehow. And the deep
3849760	3859120	expertise that somebody like Anthony Fauci claims to have. I'm really troubled by the
3859120	3863600	distrust in science that resulted from that. And you have to blame the leaders to the degree.
3864800	3868800	Leaders take responsibility. And I think Anthony Fauci was the scientific leader behind
3869760	3876560	the American response to the pandemic. And I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative
3876560	3885120	of science. I don't know if interested is the right word, but the Fauci review
3885920	3890720	is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you mentioned,
3890720	3897040	which is the distrust in science. And sometimes I'll get voicemails or emails from people in my
3897120	3904000	audience who say that I have had to backpedal on certain things related to this. And one of the
3904000	3910160	things I tried to do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when we really didn't
3910160	3915360	have complete information. So there was this period where hydroxychloroquine was first sort
3915360	3922720	of mentioned as a possible treatment, prophylactic or proactive treatment for COVID or active treatment
3922720	3927600	for COVID, along with a bunch of other stuff. There was ivermectin, there was vitamin D,
3927600	3934960	there were all sorts of different things. And I tried to be careful to say, right now, we don't
3934960	3940800	have rigorous science that tells us that some of these things work. It doesn't mean that won't come
3940800	3944960	in the future, at which point, if there was something as cheap as hydroxychloroquine that
3944960	3952000	treated COVID effectively, unbelievable, fantastic. It's not, there's no way it ever will be determined.
3952000	3956800	We don't have that information right now. So it's not super wise right now to go and start
3956800	3962640	taking this stuff. We eventually learned, like with vitamin D, having an appropriate vitamin D
3962640	3969680	level does seem to be, based on what I most recently read, generally protective and a good
3969680	3974240	thing when it comes to infections of different, great. Okay, so that one we figured out.
3974800	3981200	One of the really difficult things is that the quote truth about the vaccines did change. And
3981200	3985920	the original, again, this is all, I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone who's synthesizing
3985920	3994960	the medical data and writing about it. Originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain
3995680	4000160	did seem to be very effective, not only at preventing death and serious illness,
4000160	4005120	but also transmission. There were people then saying it doesn't prevent transmission.
4006000	4013200	Over time, as the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that. At that
4013200	4017440	point, I started telling my audience something different because as far as I was concerned,
4017440	4022320	the reality on the ground had changed. In my mind, that's how science works. It's not backpedaling.
4022320	4026800	It's we're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world.
4026800	4033120	Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends, virologists and biologists,
4033120	4037360	they have way more humility than people like Anthony Fauci who was speaking about this,
4037360	4041840	or the CEO of Pfizer who was speaking about this. This is the fundamental problem here,
4041840	4050480	is the way science works is there's usually a lot more humility and a lot more transparency about
4050480	4058000	what we know and what we don't know. And people like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial
4058080	4063920	for the world if he speaks with more certainty. But because of the political division that formed
4063920	4069920	around that, that certainty resulted and became completely counterproductive, that people didn't
4069920	4075840	trust anything about the vaccine, didn't trust any institutions that contained the experts that
4075840	4080080	actually knew what they were doing, and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of the
4080080	4086320	mouths of scientists, some large percentage of the population. So that made you completely
4086320	4094160	ineffective at scale as a society trying to respond to a terrible pandemic. And that's where I
4094160	4100800	put a lot of blame on leaders. So political leaders and scientific leaders are the ones that
4100800	4107280	should inspire us to all get together and respond. That should be the case for the pandemic.
4107280	4110560	That should be the case in the time of war, all this kind of stuff.
4111200	4115840	I generally agree with you. And for me, it's really about shared blame. And there were a lot
4115840	4120320	of different reasons why that the early communication wasn't good. Part of it was,
4120880	4127840	I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy rather than overconfidence. I would prefer, listen, we don't
4127840	4133840	really know right now whether masks do X or Y. What we do know is the supply is really limited
4133840	4138320	of this type of mask. We're going to try to keep them for the frontline workers. I love that.
4138320	4142480	That's the way I want to be communicated to. A call was made to do it differently,
4142480	4147440	which was to say the masks don't actually help. But the real reason is they want to keep them
4147440	4152400	for healthcare workers. And then later, the masks are what's going to solve. I'm with you 100%.
4153120	4158880	I think the other layer to it is you can't ignore the political situation at the time.
4159600	4164880	If Trump had one reelection and the vaccine distribution had taken place while Trump was
4164880	4170640	president rather than Biden, my belief is that the same number of Democrats would have gotten
4170640	4175680	vaccinated, but way more Republicans would have as well because they were following not science
4175680	4180480	but political leaders. And when it was Biden in DC instead of Trump, a lot of those people said,
4180480	4185360	I don't trust the vaccine. But wait, it's Trump's vaccine, I thought. Yeah, but something about the
4185360	4189840	way Biden's distributing it. So I do think you can't ignore that political layer. I agree with
4189840	4195360	you the communication was a disaster. Let me ask you about Joe Biden. What are the strengths
4195360	4200880	and weaknesses of Joe Biden? Weaknesses, I think, are some of the things you've identified.
4201440	4211120	He is not seen as high energy. He is not the same Joe Biden that debated Paul Ryan in 2012
4211120	4220640	and ran circles around him in just an incredible debate performance. He is not inspiring in the way
4220640	4226400	that someone like a Barack Obama was to people coming up and starting to get interested in
4226400	4233680	politics. I think a lot of those are fair criticisms. I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot
4233680	4239840	of the things that younger voters are interested in. I mentioned cannabis reform. I mentioned
4239840	4248320	student loans. So I think that that's a deficit for Biden. I think the upside to Biden is when it
4248320	4255120	comes to foreign policy, diplomacy, high-level negotiations, knowing how to engage with allies
4255120	4260880	in a productive way, it's tough to find someone with more experience than Biden. I know that there
4260880	4265680	are counterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include, that was the old Biden, the new Biden
4265680	4270400	doesn't have it. That includes, that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long.
4270400	4275440	Nobody should be around that long in politics. Perfectly reasonable criticisms to talk about.
4275440	4282800	But I do see that as one of his strengths. And he also is good at knowing when he can work with
4282800	4290240	Republicans and when he can't and not wasting more time than is sort of expected for posturing
4290240	4295760	reasons. And I think that that's a good thing. Do you think he's actually there? So in day-to-day
4295760	4302320	operational government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think he is an active
4302320	4308560	and practicing executive? I don't know that I can say that it's because of what may be going on
4308560	4316640	cognitively, but my sense from the people I talk to is that he's very much involved in the highest
4316640	4324160	level geopolitical and big domestic economic stuff, but that a lot of the smaller issues that
4324160	4329200	presidents might or might not be in sort of plugged into, that he's not plugged into the
4329200	4332960	details of a lot of the lower level stuff. I mean, you could probably apply the same exact
4332960	4338000	criticism even more so towards the Donald Trump administration in terms of being a practicing
4338000	4343920	active executive who's paying attention. Like for example, like Vladimir Putin is somebody
4346000	4352640	who loves the role of the executive, has a huge amount of meetings, has constantly tracking
4352640	4358560	information about agriculture and all the different subsystems of government. Stalin,
4359440	4364480	funny enough, was also extremely good at this. So certain people just love the job of being an
4364480	4373520	executive. And I'm not sure if Donald Trump did and I'm not sure if Joe Biden in his current
4373520	4379200	state has the cognitive capability to. That's a good question. Kim Jong-un's another one,
4379200	4386720	by the way. There's videos of him examining a factory where they make plates and making very
4386720	4390560	specific comments about how the plates should be made. I think that in that case, there's a lot
4390560	4396560	of propaganda value to it. With Trump, I think you're probably right. He did get involved in
4396560	4401440	the minutiae of things. I mean, once he pulled out a weather map and with a Sharpie drew a
4401440	4406800	different hurricane path that was more politically convenient to him. That's pretty micro, saying
4406880	4411520	the weather channel is wrong. I see what you did there. Okay. So that's a micro. He went to
4411520	4416400	Puerto Rico and he gave out paper towels after a hurricane. Now he was shooting them like free
4416400	4421920	throws, which didn't look very good. So he will get involved in the micro when it's advantageous.
4421920	4425760	You know what I mean? But I do agree with you that he wants to just kind of make it so. Build
4425760	4430080	the wall. I don't know. Just build it. Figure it out. Get it done. Quick pause. Bath and break?
4430080	4436320	Sure. You're hilarious. And just for the sake of completeness, I should mention,
4436320	4442000	the subreddit wouldbiden has done. There's also what Trump has done, but it's not as active.
4442000	4447520	And it has like this master list of all the accomplishments. I recommend people look at it
4447520	4454400	because there's a kind of rigorous and interesting with links list of all the things he's done.
4454400	4461520	Just list some of them restored daily press briefings, cancel the Keystone pipeline, reverse
4461520	4466240	Trump's Muslim ban, required masks on federal property, rejoins the Paris climate agreement,
4466240	4471680	extends student loan payment freeze, extend eviction freeze, historic stimulus bill,
4471680	4476480	as you mentioned, ends funding for border wall, and so on and so forth DACA,
4477280	4482320	border strengthening of DACA, rejoins the World Health Organization. And the timing of this,
4482320	4488240	of course, is important. Yeah, several historic stimulus bills, which of course,
4488240	4493920	you could criticize or support, raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and federal employees
4493920	4502560	for $15. There's a lot. There's a lot. It makes you realize with both Trump and Biden that there's
4502560	4509920	a bunch of small details that matter, like that matter on people's lives, like actual little
4509920	4517040	policies. Trump did a lot of stuff as far as I heard for the military, like not big stuff,
4517120	4522240	but small stuff. Yeah, I'd be curious what you're thinking of. I mean, I know one of the
4522240	4525520	big things under Trump was we're going to get trans people out of the military.
4526960	4532480	That's not what I was referring to. You weren't referring to that. Trump's hilarious with these
4532480	4536640	stories that he tells, and one of the stories, and you get to know them if you follow him at all,
4537280	4541760	he tells the story, you know, when I came into office, the generals came to me and they said,
4541760	4546640	sir, the cupboards are bare. We have no bullets. And so I rebuilt the military. You know, the
4546640	4551280	cupboards were bare when Obama left it and it was just terrible, but I rebuilt it and the generals,
4551280	4554960	I've got the best generals, they said, sir, it's incredible what you were able to do. You look
4554960	4559040	into it and it's like, yeah, that's not really true. Like it is true that there are armaments that
4559040	4563280	just like on a schedule do get replaced and that's part of the military industrial complex, but
4563280	4568480	there's nothing like special Trump really did. But these stories become, they take on like a life
4568480	4572560	of their own. And it's interesting to sometimes try to dig down and figure out like, was there any
4572560	4577200	policy connected to that? Or is that just a story? Do you think it's possible to have a good conversation
4577200	4583520	with each of them? Donald Trump and Joe Biden in a podcast context or in a debate context?
4584480	4588240	Absolutely. Yeah. You're saying like, could I with either of them? Oh, 100%.
4589040	4593200	Joe Biden too? Sure. Yeah. But can you dig into that a little more?
4593200	4598320	Well, I mean, I don't know what, I think there's maybe something implicit in your question,
4598320	4602800	but that's deeper about the nature of politics and politicians. Yes.
4602800	4608800	I think with either of them, I mean, the political differences wouldn't be an impediment to having
4608800	4615520	a good conversation with either of them. I think one of the things that's really tough in my experience
4615520	4621680	when talking to elected officials is they could be super interesting about 100 different topics,
4622480	4629120	but handlers decide or try to get you to talk about something you don't really care about and
4629120	4634720	something really narrow, which doesn't bring out your best nor their best. And that's a frustration.
4634720	4638640	But I think that given an unstructured three-hour conversation, I think it would be interesting
4638640	4644400	to talk to both. I mean, listen, with Biden, aside from his view on cannabis or whatever,
4644400	4651520	his background and the incredible unimaginable family tragedy that he had in his first wife
4651520	4659120	and multiple kids dying. I mean, it's just incredible. And with Trump, I think also you
4659120	4662720	could have an interesting conversation. Yeah, those are the human beings with a life story.
4664880	4668400	And they're some of the most successful humans who have ever lived to have
4669520	4674880	rose to this highest office in interesting complex ways. Yes.
4674880	4679680	I mean, one of the things I'm troubled by maybe you can speak to is why we're so negative
4680320	4687440	towards presidential candidates and presidents. Why? It's just they go through this shit storm,
4687440	4693520	no matter who they are. Yeah. They're like hated. Like all the conspiracy theories and just
4695200	4700560	the dynamics of how we talk about them is vicious. If you just look at reply,
4700560	4708160	Steven Barack Obama on Twitter, it's like, what is going on here? Why? Because we look at other
4708160	4714320	leaders and other spaces and we're generally positive about it. Yeah, there's a couple different
4714320	4720320	things. There's this dynamic, which is really unfortunate, which is you ask people, do you
4720320	4726000	approve of the job a particular president is doing? And very often, if at any point, while they were
4726000	4729920	in office, they did something you don't like, people will say, I don't approve. And so by its
4729920	4733920	nature, what that means is just like the longer you're in office, the lower your approval ratings
4733920	4739600	going to be. And very often, that's the way it works. I mean, there's major events like 9-11,
4739600	4744560	Spike George W. Bush's approval to an incredible level, then it came back down with the Iraq War.
4744560	4747440	But there's this unfortunate thing that when people are just asked,
4747440	4753040	you think Biden's doing a good job? If four months ago, Biden did something on healthcare
4753040	4757280	that somebody didn't like, even if you like most of it, a lot of people from that point forward
4757280	4761200	will say, I don't approve. They might still vote for them because they like him better than the
4761200	4766080	alternative or whatever. It's just the dynamic of politics. And I agree, it's very...
4766080	4767760	Does it have to be that way? Do you think?
4767760	4772640	I don't think it has to be that way. But to unwind it, so many things would have to change.
4773440	4779840	I think our election system is part of why politics is the way it is, where you have two choices,
4779840	4784880	and it's first past the post. And we have this electoral college, so that depending on which
4784880	4789280	state you vote in, the kind of meaning and significance of your vote is different. If you
4789280	4794640	vote in Montana, it's the Republican candidate, it's going to win, and that changes the dynamics.
4794640	4801280	I think that's part of it. I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life
4801280	4807360	a lot. We've become, and by we, I mean people in the United States to some degree who talk
4807360	4813360	about this stuff, we've become uncomfortable when there is disagreement, and it bleeds over into,
4813360	4817760	now we can't have a normal interpersonal relationship anymore. I'm from Argentina,
4817760	4824160	and in Argentina, it's really common, even in my family. There are incredibly heated political
4824160	4828880	debates at the start, the middle, the end of some kind of gathering. But then everybody just goes
4828880	4836080	back to like, okay, we disagree on some things, but that's okay. And we can now go and finish
4836080	4841040	cooking the beef or whatever it is that we're doing. And I experienced this even with people who
4841040	4846320	come up to me on the street, and they go, just earlier today, a guy came up to me and he said,
4846400	4852560	RFK all the way, baby, talking about Bobby Kennedy Jr. And I just kind of, I said, oh,
4852560	4857840	all right, let's see what happens. And then there was another moment where the guy ended
4857840	4861520	up standing next to me for maybe longer than he thought, and I could tell this guy's getting so
4861520	4865280	awkward because it was an utterance he thought that would just be on the fly and he'd be gone.
4865280	4869760	But now we're standing next to each other waiting for our sandwiches. It's like no big deal. It's
4869760	4875280	just, oh, okay, you like Bobby Kennedy Jr. I don't plan to vote for it. It's fine. And that's like
4875280	4880720	a socio-cultural thing. I think there's lots of other countries. I've spent time in Italy. I have
4880720	4885040	relatives in Israel where like shouting at each other is sort of like normal. And then you just
4885040	4889680	go back and finish them. It sounds like shouting. I'm sort of exaggerating, but very animated,
4889680	4894480	what seemed like big disagreements. And then everybody's cool. I wish it were more normal.
4894480	4900880	So maybe the mechanism of going from shouting to being cool again needs to improve. Because maybe
4900880	4905760	we can't solve the shouting at each other. Maybe not. So maybe we need to somehow figure out the
4905760	4910960	de-escalation, like making up. I've had a few recent fights with friends like that.
4911600	4923920	For politics. No. But political style, emotionally drenched stuff. And it was interesting to go
4923920	4928960	through that full process and then make up at the end, but it was a process. And it was a process
4929040	4936000	that required being in person and talking through it. And it was stressful, the whole thing. And
4936000	4941200	maybe because most of our interactions are online, we don't get a chance to do that in person,
4941200	4946160	making up again. I don't know, but do you think it's a feature or a bug of the system that we're
4946160	4953920	so, we just hate the powerful? You mentioned the online part. You mentioned it earlier perfectly,
4953920	4961520	which is you take contentious political issues. You create a platform that rewards
4962160	4967760	controversy and disagreement and limits the number of characters you can use to express yourself.
4968320	4974640	You kind of throw it into a baking dish and mix the entire thing up. It's complete and total chaos.
4974640	4979200	And one of the things that I've talked before about all the angry emails and threats and stuff
4979200	4984480	that I get, I'm acutely aware that if I had in person conversations with most of these people,
4985120	4989840	the conversations would basically be like, oh, we have different views about how to solve some
4989840	4996000	of the problems we're facing. We probably agree about what the problem is. And we probably share
4996000	5001600	many values. But on these particular four issues, we may have very different views. But that's okay.
5002560	5010000	Online, that's not the case. And it leads to the mess that we get ourselves in. But I think
5010000	5013840	that it's a feature of a lot of the systems that are being used to disseminate information.
5014720	5022800	Again, let me linger on that. Do you regret some of the mockery and the snark you use on Twitter
5022800	5026080	and even in your show that feeds that division?
5026960	5035840	I don't regret it in the sense that it's a calculated part or tool that I use in addition to
5036480	5041120	figuring out how to simplify complicated concepts and choosing stories that I think are
5041120	5048480	underrepresented. It's all part of the package of what I'm doing. I recognize that my show is not
5048480	5057520	the audio visual version of a peer reviewed, randomized controlled trial about views on abortion
5057520	5063840	or whatever the case. I'm very much aware of that. But I don't regret including it as a tool
5064800	5069840	that I've used to build the community in some total that I've built over the last more than
5069840	5075040	10 years. I guess I could ask about the different trajectories you think your show might take. So
5075600	5080400	the dynamic you had with Donald Trump Jr. and maybe Candice Owens is the more appropriate
5080400	5087440	comparison. Are you okay having that dance for the next few years between you and Candice Owens
5087440	5094640	and just the mockery, the division that's a part of that process and taking part in that?
5095520	5106800	I'm fine with it in the sense of personally, I tolerate it well until it crosses the line
5107600	5114480	and people pull my family in. If we set the family stuff aside, just in the digital space,
5114480	5119440	you're okay with that. Now the truth is Candice Owens has had me blocked for years up until
5119440	5124960	this incident. She unblocked me. She unblocked me just to tweet about what I tweeted about.
5124960	5129440	I don't know the backstory of that genuinely. I have no idea. So I don't have a sense that
5129440	5134160	she's super interested in engaging with me on that. But all of these people, I mean, Candice
5134160	5138560	Owens is welcome on my show anytime. Don Jr. is welcome on my show anytime. It's been a decade
5138560	5144880	since I had Ben Shapiro on. He's welcome anytime. I'm glad to have these conversations and I think
5144960	5150480	it's an important thing. And also, I wish that everybody was willing to have the conversations
5150480	5154800	in good faith rather than as performance. It's not even really performance art,
5154800	5157680	rather than being simply performative for an audience that you have.
5158240	5164640	In terms of your motivations, do you worry about the effects of something you spoke about offline
5164640	5172560	or the YouTube algorithm? Are you driven by the number of views your videos get?
5173440	5178800	Or are you driven by something else? So in my world, I guess I would say,
5179600	5187520	the number of views that any platform generates is a metric that I can choose how to interpret.
5187520	5192160	I can choose to interpret it as I've created content that's interesting to people
5193040	5197520	or I've created content that's really angering people and that's why they're showing up. They
5197520	5201360	don't actually like it. It's because they're angry or whatever else the case may be. But
5201360	5206000	it is true that there are algorithmic changes that can take place. Something happened in early
5206000	5211200	January that affected us on YouTube or there are periods on TikTok where you can tell we're
5211200	5216560	doing all the same things, something has happened and then you never usually figure out what it is.
5216560	5222560	So for me, it's sort of just like a general tool to see what is the level of interest in what I'm
5222560	5227600	doing and are the numbers so out of whack with what I would expect that I should look into whether
5227600	5231520	something deeper is happening. Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case
5231520	5238480	may be? I had a debate once with someone who accused me of using clickbait to generate views
5238480	5242800	and we had a really interesting conversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that.
5243360	5249680	Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent what's in the video?
5250400	5254640	No, what's in the title is in the video. I go, okay, so it's not that the title is dishonest.
5254640	5259840	Are you saying I'm deliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience?
5260480	5262800	And they said, yeah, that's kind of what I mean. And I said,
5262800	5266480	isn't that kind of what we're all doing? The alternative would be choosing titles
5266480	5270480	to generate a smaller audience, which seems like a real kind of waste of time. So
5271600	5275760	I'm trying to navigate and play the game in a way that's comfortable,
5276400	5280160	but use the metrics more as a tool than as something to obsess over.
5280720	5287280	Nevertheless, the metrics are what they are and that they are able to affect your psyche.
5288960	5294080	It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views and all that
5294080	5301680	on YouTube for me. It's difficult not to let it affect how you think about ideas.
5302800	5307280	So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare
5307280	5312400	generated very few views. It's difficult for you to still care about healthcare.
5313360	5319440	There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views. And I think that's
5319440	5327040	a really dangerous thing. Mostly it's probably beneficial because it probably makes you a better
5327040	5333200	presenter. If you do care about a topic a lot, you become more charismatic, more you learn
5333200	5339440	sort of in Jimmy, Mr. Beast, the way how to present the ideas better. But it also can affect
5339440	5343520	which topics you choose to cover, what you choose to think about those topics,
5344720	5349360	audience capture those topics. And that's a really scary effect. I'm really worried about my own
5349360	5356800	mind in that. So I run from that aggressively. One of the things that I include in my overall
5356800	5363040	approaches, I don't think about any one clip. I think about an entire show or a week of shows
5363040	5370240	or a month of shows. And so it's less about does anyone clip do well. My view going in is
5370240	5374880	I'm going to do stuff that won't do that well, but I think it's really important to do. And I
5374880	5380400	want to make it part of my show. And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence,
5380400	5384720	I know that that's not going to get 500,000 or a million views. I know it's just not going to.
5385360	5392160	And the first day it'll get 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care. That's fine. There's a group of people
5392160	5396800	in my audience that values this stuff. And I want to keep doing this stuff. I'll end up surprised
5396800	5403600	sometime. And two weeks later has 150,000 views because it started being shared. Great. But I
5403600	5410320	don't go into it thinking these all need to be home runs by that metric. I always go in saying I
5410320	5414880	want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that is less titillating and salacious,
5414880	5421200	but is important to do. It's more researched, etc. And so that's the way I try to resist exactly
5421280	5425280	what you're talking about. And I think you have to probably know yourself. For me, metrics,
5425280	5429840	I just like numbers too much. And for me, metrics do affect me. That's just why I don't pay attention
5429840	5436960	at all. I would love to hire somebody in the team who cares because we currently have folks who
5436960	5443360	just all of us just don't care because he probably is good to care enough to kind of just do good
5443360	5449280	thumbnails and this kind of stuff to pay attention. But to me personally, I just find inner peace and
5449280	5456320	focus if I don't think about the numbers at all. Because I find myself... I just remember a long
5456320	5464320	time ago when I started a podcast, I would think that I failed if it didn't do well. Like if I didn't
5464320	5468880	celebrate the person well enough, I didn't do a good job enough of a conversation. Well,
5468880	5474560	that's not necessarily at all what that means. It's hard not to... This is tough stuff. I mean,
5474560	5482160	yeah, I know exactly what you're saying. And part of it is... I mean, it starts in my... You have a
5482160	5486800	little bit of a different situation than me because you're doing long form conversations with people
5486800	5491520	and the prep is a little bit different. One of the things in my space because I'm reacting mostly
5491520	5495360	to what's going on in the news and then also picking topics to dive into a little bit more deeply
5495920	5501360	is I have very little control over the news cycle. And there is a meta metric or a macro
5501360	5507920	metric that affects me that will quadruple my audience and then take 75% of it away,
5507920	5514480	which is the seasonality of election cycles. And the first few election cycles, it's very tough
5514480	5520000	because I go, it's October. I'm like, at this rate, we're going to have 20 million subscribers by
5520000	5526320	the next... These numbers are unbelievable. And then it's January 30th, the inauguration's over,
5526880	5532960	the debate is about the debt ceiling and nothing's going on. And I go, nobody's watching my content.
5532960	5539360	I must have forgotten to upload a... Something must be wrong. It's completely beyond my control.
5539360	5544320	So I just... And I think part of what you're saying is I try to focus on the things I can control
5544960	5549280	and understand those that I really have no control over whatsoever and try not to worry about them.
5550080	5557120	And try to do the things that make you happy at the end of the day. You mentioned RFK, the guy you
5557120	5563040	met. What do you think about some of the other candidates outside of Joe Biden in the Democratic
5563040	5569520	Party, RFK Jr.? What do you think of him as a candidate? I've met him. We once had dinner and
5569520	5575920	we have a number of friends in common, which is what makes this a little more awkward. But I think
5575920	5583760	his campaign is basically sort of like a chaos candidacy to raise awareness and maybe raise
5583760	5588640	money either for his book or his anti-vaccine organization, Children's Defense Fund, I believe
5588640	5593840	it's called. I think there's some reporting that Steve Bannon really liked the idea of him running
5593840	5599760	as a Democrat, again, to just generate chaos. I don't find it super interesting. I don't find
5599760	5608400	it worthy of that much discussion. Smart guy, nice guy, has been doing anti-vaccine work that I
5608400	5613440	don't find particularly inspiring for a long time. So it's not just anti-COVID vaccine? It's more
5613440	5617440	broader than that? He's been in that space long before the COVID vaccines. Yeah. Yeah, I don't
5617440	5623840	find it super interesting. Well, he also wrote the book The Real Anthony Fauci. Is that the name
5623840	5629200	of the book? Did he write that? That's interesting. I don't know. I'm not sure about that. I'm aware
5629200	5635680	of that book. I didn't know he wrote it. I think, but it's been on my reading list to get... I've
5635680	5642400	been trying to get a good balanced reading list about the COVID pandemic to understand what the
5642400	5649920	hell happened. And anytime I start to try to go into that place, I'm exhausted by it. Well,
5649920	5655520	it's interesting to me that you wouldn't wait longer before delving into those books to have
5655600	5664880	maybe a more clear hindsight. But I think this is a pretty good time. You don't think so. It depends
5664880	5670160	on your goals. If you're thinking of it as a historical event, yes, you should probably wait
5670160	5678400	longer. But if you're thinking about understanding what is broken about our system that we responded
5678400	5684000	so poorly, that there was so much division, what is broken about our political system that
5684960	5690320	it didn't unite us. It divided us. Who's to blame? There's probably a lot of different
5690320	5695120	narratives. But I feel like the more you learn about this, the better you can understand. I read
5695920	5699440	on just Vladimir Putin, I read like five biographies already, maybe more.
5701040	5706800	Just it helps to really understand the people involved, the organizations involved. I don't
5706800	5712720	know. Everything from the scientists to the political leaders. It felt like the blog posts and
5712720	5717360	the tweets didn't quite cap it. They didn't quite cap it. No, one of the things I read a ton,
5717360	5724080	I don't read any modern political books, so I don't read the memoirs of elected officials.
5725280	5730320	I just feel like I get enough of it in my job. So my reading list is just other things. It's
5730320	5736560	history, it's narrative nonfiction, economics, et cetera. And that's my bias because I'm so
5736560	5740560	overloaded with a lot of the stuff you're talking about. I haven't read any of Obama's books.
5740560	5744400	I didn't read John Bolton's book. I don't read any of that stuff,
5745040	5748720	although I'm sure there is value to be gleaned from it.
5750400	5754640	What about the other candidate that, according to the subreddit, and as you mentioned,
5754640	5761760	you've criticized a little bit, Marianne Williamson. Do you think, what are the pros and cons of her
5761760	5768880	as a candidate? This is another area where many in my audience really are angry with me. I don't
5768880	5773680	find her candidacy super interesting. I'll tell you the pros and the cons as I see them.
5773680	5778560	I do think that we have elected officials in the US, particularly presidents,
5778560	5785360	from a really narrow range of backgrounds. So it's lawyers and sometimes business people,
5785360	5790560	very, very often lawyers. I think we would benefit from a much greater diversity of backgrounds.
5790560	5796320	And I once said, and that would include people from education, people from the science world,
5796320	5800240	people with backgrounds maybe running nonprofits, et cetera. Now, Marianne Williamson did, I guess,
5800240	5804720	at one point, run some kind of small nonprofit. And some in my audience thought that credential alone
5804720	5809840	would make me fall head over heels in love with the idea of a Marianne candidacy. I've interviewed
5809840	5817840	for her. It's just not for me is the way I like to say it. The background of the woo-woo type stuff
5818960	5824640	is a bit off-putting to me. I understand that someone with literal Christian Bible beliefs
5824640	5831040	that also I don't like, maybe I'm more willing to accept, as most of our presidents, of course,
5831040	5837120	have had those views because they're otherwise more qualified. But some of the things that she
5837120	5843440	says just strike me as, I just don't know. I'll give you an example. When she was on with Russell
5843440	5849360	Brand, she said, there's no such thing as clinical depression. It just means someone in a clinic
5849440	5854720	told you you have depression. I don't believe that to be the case. I think we have an understanding.
5854720	5858160	There's two types of depression. There's like a genetic predisposition depression.
5858160	5863680	There's like a acute something's happening in my life, temporary depression. When she was asked
5863680	5869760	about it recently, she said, I didn't mean it. I was just trying to impress Russell Brand.
5871120	5875440	I don't know if I'm more bothered by the thing she first said or by the fact that she wanted to
5875440	5881200	impress Russell Brand. But it's just like, it's just really not for me. And I agree with her on,
5881200	5886400	we need to take the climate more seriously. We need to expand access to health. I'm with
5886400	5891840	all of that stuff. Now, I want to say one other thing about this. Anybody who wants to run should
5891840	5898720	run. I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested primary for Joe Biden. Absolutely.
5898720	5902320	So you think it should be contested? Well, what I mean by contested is so there's two
5902320	5906560	parts to what we mean by contested. Will the DNC organize debates? And we'll get to that in a second.
5906560	5912000	But should anybody who's on the left get out of the way because Joe Biden is president and he's
5912000	5917680	running for reelection? Absolutely not. The question about, should there be debates? I would
5917680	5924240	like there to be debates. The DNC pretty clearly isn't going to organize them. I think if you did
5924240	5929520	them, you would have to say at what polling level do you qualify? And I don't know exactly where you
5929520	5934400	put that number. But I think it would be a great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage with, if you
5934400	5939280	can get what, 6%, 8%. I'm not really sure what the number would be. I'm totally all for that.
5940000	5943600	Why is a set of candidates, at least from my perspective, so weak?
5945520	5948480	Do you have an understanding of this? There's a lot of different answers to this.
5950160	5954720	One aspect to this, which I think is more of a socio-cultural thing, which I've recently
5954720	5961360	read about to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at it
5961360	5964560	because of what you need to do to become president. And it includes
5965600	5972640	all but completely abandoning your existing day-to-day life job, which you may depend on,
5972640	5980560	and family to some degree. It's horribly negative, as we already talked about. And at the end of all
5980560	5985520	of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild, and maybe you're not in a position to be able to
5985520	5991840	do that, or you win. And then now you've got four years of being one of the most hated people,
5991840	5996320	no matter how good a job you do. So I think by its nature, it turns off a lot of people that
5996320	6002160	would otherwise be good. I also think that there's a lot of posturing from within the parties about,
6002160	6006720	well, you might be good, but it's not your time yet, so you should wait. And then let's talk about
6006720	6010640	maybe a Senate seat here and there. So it's like a company, essentially, and they're figuring out
6010640	6015920	where they want to place people. I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates
6015920	6021360	most people aren't super thrilled with. So it's difficult for somebody who's young or an outsider
6021360	6028720	to quickly become a candidate? I think that that's true. And I think also, in a lot of ways, it's
6028720	6034080	just not... I mean, would you want to be president? No. I mean, I can't because I wasn't born in the
6034080	6040400	U.S., so it's easy for me to say, but... If everyone says no, then we'll get the people that we have.
6041360	6044080	No, I understand that. So I would love to help somehow.
6044960	6049600	Sure. And I feel like there's not even a mechanism for helping, except through the
6049600	6055360	democratic, through the voting process. But I'm just annoyed how little technology there is in
6055360	6060720	the whole process, how little innovation there is in the whole process, all of this.
6060720	6067200	The sad thing is this is written about a lot, which is there's this thing called political
6067200	6074160	hobbyism. And I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are political
6074160	6081200	hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some degree. And I've written
6081200	6087280	a lot about how... I've read a lot and talked a lot about how, okay, we vote every two years or
6087280	6092000	every four years in our local elections, et cetera. And then we think about politics all the time.
6092640	6097520	Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death. But what are you actually
6097520	6103120	going to do about the kids starving in this country and the nuclear buildup in that country?
6103120	6108480	It's okay. If everybody refocused their attention on their immediate communities, and that could mean
6108480	6113520	any number, it could mean the town or city you live in, or it might mean an athletic club or
6113600	6118160	whatever. If everybody, this time they spent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else,
6118160	6121440	which might put me out of a job, that's okay. I'm willing to lose my job because I think it
6121440	6126160	would be so beneficial. Then our communities would just be that much better, because you can
6126160	6130560	actually affect change in a much more tangible way locally, whether it's... People talk about
6130560	6137120	potholes, but other things as well. Yeah. And I wish our system was more amenable to that kind
6137120	6143440	of contribution, hopefully through the digital space it would be. Let me ask you about on the
6143440	6150080	Republican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him as a candidate running against Donald Trump?
6150080	6156480	I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't
6156480	6163520	even started, has sort of started to implode. And this was something that I started thinking about
6163520	6169760	in September, October. He really doesn't seem ready for prime time in the sense that just being
6169760	6175200	confronted, and confronted's not even the right word, just being asked about some topics he didn't
6175200	6182640	really seem to want to talk about, he responded in such a sort of disproportionate, unhinged way
6182640	6188640	during his recent trip to Asia. He was asked about, why aren't you or why are you responding,
6188640	6194160	but in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you? And he went into this weird bobblehead thing with
6194160	6198880	a weird smile, and something came out that didn't make any sense, and he sort of got mad at the
6198880	6203760	reporter. And it was just like, if you can't handle that, you can't be on a debate stage with
6203760	6208080	Donald Trump. And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage,
6208080	6214080	he can make you look pretty silly. He was recently asked about his role at Guantanamo Bay when he
6214080	6220640	was an officer in, I forget, which branch of the armed forces. And he just sort of attacked
6220640	6226640	the journalist asking the question, and it just looked very bad. And there are increasingly big
6226640	6230560	Republican donors who are not fans of Trump, and we're sort of hoping to put their eggs in the
6230560	6234080	Ron DeSantis basket, who are saying, this guy just doesn't have what it takes, I don't think he can
6234080	6239520	do it. So I don't know if DeSantis will be able to get away. Once you're polling 20-something,
6239520	6244400	like he is, and you haven't even announced, it's very attractive. And he probably to some degree
6244400	6250720	is thinking, if I wait till 20-28, I might not have this opportunity again. But Trump's polling
6250720	6257440	52-53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump vote, he has to figure out
6257440	6260800	how to take something more from Trump. I just don't know how he does it.
6261360	6265360	First of all, the implosion aspect, that's part of the process, isn't it? You kind of implode
6266080	6270320	a bunch of times. And then rebuild yourself.
6270320	6273280	And rebuild them because the new cycle kind of forgets.
6273280	6279200	It's possible. The problem is, the first debate is in August. So that's only a few months away.
6279920	6287120	And the decision's going to have to be made pretty soon. And unless he can get a new momentum going,
6287840	6291600	I just don't know how he gets what he needs in order to really have a shot.
6291600	6293920	So would anyone else run against Donald Trump?
6293920	6297360	It's very tough right now. I mean, there are other people running. There's this guy Vivek
6297360	6302560	Ramaswamy who's running. Nikki Haley is running. Her campaign basically dead on arrival.
6303920	6308800	Trump actually does better in polls the more people run. When it's just him and DeSantis,
6308800	6314400	that's the best scenario for DeSantis. It's not great for DeSantis, but it's certainly better.
6315680	6319760	But I think the difficulty is, this is a question for Republicans to figure out.
6320720	6324800	The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party
6326560	6331760	still believe this guy's not good for their party. But many of them recognize that most of the voters
6331760	6338000	are still behind him. You can always say it's early. His polling doesn't really mean anything.
6338000	6342240	Anything could happen. Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that lead.
6342240	6346640	If he got more, if he was arrested two more times and had more indictments and it just
6346640	6350480	became like, this guy can't even campaign because he's so busy going from court to court,
6351120	6354000	maybe that would make a difference. It's really tough to imagine.
6355360	6358880	You said that there are three categories of people who vote Republican,
6358880	6364800	and that Trump introduced the fourth one. Can you go through the four categories?
6364800	6370320	Sure. So you've got your pro-business low tax Republicans. These are mostly people like Mitt
6370320	6374800	Romney. Mitt Romney has a bit of the social conservatism as well. He's Mormon and that's
6374800	6378480	there. But Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a Northeast sort of Republican, I mean,
6378480	6383680	I know Utah, but Governor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax pro-business type guy.
6384320	6390160	You've got your libertarian type Republicans who are primarily about freedom and liberty.
6390160	6394160	Often they are actually more socially liberal where they go, I don't care about gay marriage,
6395200	6401280	I don't care so much about abortion. And that overlapped a little bit with the Tea Party
6401280	6405440	movement in 2010, although Tea Party did have a religious component, but sort of like the
6405440	6409600	libertarian freedom minded folks. And then the religious conservatives, people that support
6409600	6415840	candidates like Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz, et cetera, where their big thing are social issues.
6415840	6422000	Often they actually want Christianity being civil government. They don't want separation
6422000	6426240	of church and state. Those are traditionally the three Republican groups. The one that Trump
6426240	6430720	introduced was people who just didn't really pay attention to politics, but either followed
6430720	6439040	celebrity or had grievances that they didn't yet have a scapegoat for and were sort of right-leaning
6439040	6444560	culturally, even though they didn't attribute that to Republicanism. And Trump was able to
6444560	6449600	bring them into politics often for the first time as voters. They could be part of any of
6449600	6455440	those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of be their own thing. But they're more
6455520	6459680	kind of like cult of personality. I'm here for Trump types.
6459680	6464160	Did it have to do anything about the culture wars and the identity politics, all that kind of stuff?
6465440	6470240	Yeah. I mean, so in 2016, when Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues the way they are now.
6470880	6474960	So I think at that time, it certainly was not a factor.
6474960	6479200	What was the mobilizing issue? I don't know. It was just anti-Hillary in 2016.
6479840	6486880	He did a good job on anti-Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying real economic problems, wage
6486880	6492720	depression, lack of jobs in parts of the country, Ohio and Indiana. Trump rightly identified. We
6492720	6497200	have an issue here. We don't have enough entrepreneurship, et cetera. But there was also a
6497200	6502960	lot of scapegoating that was China and people coming through the US-Mexico border were popular
6502960	6507440	scapegoats for a lot of those problems. This gets us kind of to populism.
6508320	6515840	Populism is a rhetoric, and populism as a rhetoric doesn't necessarily come with particular policies.
6516400	6523600	You can be a user of populist rhetoric and propose solutions that would be more aligned
6523600	6529120	with Bernie or Tucker Carlson. Populists will often identify the plight of the middle class.
6530080	6535360	The difference would be Bernie will say, we've got to put some restrictions on how much
6536000	6540240	billionaires can make, and we've got to reinvest in these social programs.
6540240	6547600	Tucker will say, BLM taking your house and a brown person from Mexico taking your job
6547600	6553280	are what we need to deal with. So the populist rhetoric can lend itself to very different
6553280	6556320	policy, and Trump used that very effectively in 2016.
6556880	6562960	Why do you think Hillary Clinton was hated as intensely as she was by a certain percent
6562960	6568720	of the population? It feels like that's the first election I witnessed where there's a lot of hate.
6570480	6577600	Maybe I'm misremembered. I don't remember Obama. I don't remember the degree of hate.
6577600	6581520	There was conspiracy theories that he wasn't born in this country, but I don't remember
6582240	6587040	hate towards Obama. Record death threats under Obama more than any previous president.
6587040	6591840	Towards him. Yeah. Do you mean more hate between voters?
6591840	6598400	Between voters, between voters, but that's I guess what I was speaking to, but that hate was
6598400	6606240	directed towards the narrative, the thread that connected all of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton.
6607200	6613760	Few different things. And I'm not ranking these. These are just all things that come to mind.
6614640	6620640	One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time,
6621200	6627200	from her time as First Lady, through a senator, secretary of state, etc. So I think that
6628000	6634880	there was enough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards her for different
6634880	6644320	reasons. So time. Secondly, Trump's branding of her as crooked was very effective where there
6644320	6649600	were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned. If you ask them what is the crime,
6649600	6654240	they don't know. But she should definitely be locked up. That became a very big thing.
6655280	6664320	The email story, as it were, and James Comey doing a second public event about that investigation,
6664320	6667840	even though there wasn't any actual news about it, just doing a second event about it at the last
6667840	6673840	minute, I think hurt her and also generated some hate. And I don't find Hillary Clinton to be
6673840	6679280	particularly likable, although I voted for her. I thought she was the better candidate. And I think
6679280	6685200	that there are others who also didn't find her particularly likable. Those are a lot of impediments
6685200	6689520	to becoming president. I was trying to understand why there's so many conspiracy theories about
6689520	6696800	Clintons in general, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And maybe I'm not researched well enough.
6697760	6702560	Of the why of it? The why of it, actually, the extent of the conspiracy theories,
6704240	6707360	the conspiracy theories that they've killed a lot of people, this kind of stuff.
6708000	6712000	It's hard for me to speak to them because I'm aware that they exist, but I'm not an expert in
6712000	6717680	them because they seem so obviously baseless to the degree that I've researched them a little bit,
6717680	6722320	and then I move on. And it's been years since I've looked at this stuff. I know there's the Seth
6722320	6728480	Rich one and there's the Clinton body count one. I think there's one connected to Epstein,
6728480	6733520	if I recall correctly. There's all sorts of these different ones. Without speaking to any of them
6733520	6739280	specifically because I'm not the expert on Clinton conspiracies, it does seem as though
6739920	6745120	this stuff for so long has generated an audience. I mean, I remember in the supermarket
6745120	6750160	when Bill Clinton was president at the checkout seeing the tabloids and there were stuff about
6750160	6756000	Hillary birthing alien baby. It seems like it's been titillating to people for a very long time.
6756880	6762320	Well, another question from Reddit speaking of aliens. I would be curious to hear David's views
6762320	6768160	on conspiracies and conspiracy theories, the extent to which real conspiracies happen,
6768160	6774400	and why conspiracies that have little evidence behind them managed to be so compelling to people
6774400	6781440	regardless. Also, please bring up aliens and UAPs. Okay. Where do we start? The conspiracy. What?
6782240	6790240	So, what in general, as a person who thinks about politics, thinks about this world,
6791040	6796400	like where do conspiracy theories fit in for you? I think there have been conspiracies. And by
6796400	6803040	conspiracies, I'm using a colloquial definition, which is basically individuals working together
6803040	6812800	to, in a clandestine way, impact or affect some kind of event or phenomenon very, very broadly.
6812800	6819920	I mean, certainly that those things have happened. To jump around to some of the things that were
6819920	6826800	in there, I think the reason that conspiracy theories are so compelling is that it's really
6826800	6835040	tough for a lot of people to accept there are random events, not predictable specifically,
6835040	6839200	at a stochastic level, we might be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable,
6840320	6846720	bad events in many ways. I could be the victim of one or you could or my family could. That's
6846720	6852480	really scary to a lot of people, understandably so. And for some people, it's less scary and more
6852480	6858880	soothing in a way to say there aren't really random events like this. Somebody planned it,
6859440	6863520	and if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would have
6863520	6871520	known exactly when. That's just a psychological level easier to accept for people. And I get that
6871520	6877520	to some degree because, listen, it's not the most exciting thing that everything can just
6877520	6882640	be going fine and something absolutely horrible happens and kills who knows some number of people.
6883840	6888400	So I think that's the biggest attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories. It doesn't apply
6888400	6893600	to all of them though. But yeah, but there's still a basic understanding of human nature where
6895280	6902160	some people are greedy and want power and are corrupted by power. So there's these compelling
6902160	6912720	narratives that stick that, I don't know, the vaccine is an opportunity for a powerful
6913280	6919360	billionaire to implant chips into you so you can control you further. Right. It doesn't seem,
6922000	6928480	what do I want to say? It's like, for some reason, that doesn't seem as crazy as it should.
6928960	6935920	Because you think maybe Hollywood contributes to that. But you think, yeah, you could imagine
6935920	6942880	an evil person, a person that wants more control, more power, and is also at the same time able to
6942880	6947440	convince themselves, as history shows, that they're actually have the best interest of the populace
6947440	6953040	in mind, that they're trying to do good for the world. So they do evil while trying to do good.
6953040	6960080	And you can kind of imagine it. So it's like, why not? And you listen to people in power,
6961440	6970880	authorities, they kind of look and sound shady. The transparency, especially the older ones,
6970880	6976480	I think younger folks are better at being real and transparent and just revealing their flaws
6976480	6980800	in the basic humanity. But people that are a little bit older in the positions of power,
6980800	6986240	they're more polished. It feels like they're presenting a narrative where the truth is hidden
6986240	6993280	in the shadows. I don't think there's anything wrong with suspecting. Maybe a public figure
6993280	6999120	isn't giving me the full story, totally reasonable thing to question. I don't think there's anything
6999120	7006000	wrong with exploring a lot of these different things. I think the problem becomes, and I know
7006000	7010640	you've talked about this in so many different ways with other guests, the problem becomes when we
7010720	7016640	lose a shared understanding of how we would assess whether any of these things are true.
7017200	7024880	And then both alleged evidence and an absence of evidence both become supportive of the conspiracy
7024880	7029520	theory. Because if there's bad evidence, you manipulate it and say it's good evidence. If
7029520	7034000	there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried out
7034000	7038480	the thing or whatever. So unless we can have a shared understanding of how we would determine
7038480	7043120	what's true, these are common conversations often between atheists and religious folks.
7043680	7049040	How can we determine, is my faith in something or my desire for something to be true a good
7049040	7052240	way to evaluate whether it is true? They're really similar questions.
7053200	7057520	Well, let me ask you about Trump on that front. About the election, 2020 election,
7058640	7063200	maybe the better question is about January 6th. Do you think January 6th was a big deal?
7063920	7064320	I do.
7065360	7066240	How big of a deal?
7066960	7067680	Compared to what?
7069360	7070000	Civil War.
7071440	7073200	I think it was less of a big deal than the Civil War.
7075200	7080400	It's a very interesting thing, though, because we have not only the event, that's clever,
7080400	7087760	actually. It's not only the event, but it's what led up to it and what has happened since and did
7087760	7098240	it change what is considered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they disagree
7098240	7103280	with the results of an election? So I think that there are further reaching consequences than just
7103280	7109120	was the six-hour period on January 6th, a bigger or smaller deal than the Civil War,
7109120	7116240	and there's so much wrapped up into it. Many conspiracy theories flowed from January 6th as
7116240	7121840	well. 60 Minutes recently featured a guy named Ray Epps, who was targeted by some on the right,
7122800	7126880	claiming that he was an instigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those lines.
7128000	7133280	There were people claiming that no real, it was like a no true Scotsman sort of thing, like
7133280	7140160	Trump supporters wouldn't riot. So by definition, it must have been Antifa, police let him in,
7140160	7143360	or police were, you know, all these different things. I think it was a big deal in a lot of
7143360	7149360	ways because it completely made us have to go back to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters
7149360	7155680	of valid discussion and activism in the United States? But what aspect of the January 6th
7156560	7165360	was bad for you? Well, I mean, if you're thinking from a big philosophical political
7165360	7173200	perspective, so presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died
7174240	7180480	is not the only metric to consider here. Absolutely. I think the sum total of what it means
7181120	7186880	about how the United States operates is what's most concerning, and I'll kind of just like
7186880	7194560	flesh it out a little bit. So summer of 2020, Trump's already saying they're going to cheat.
7195440	7201520	Now, the polling is close, but it shows that Biden's in a good position. People aren't happy
7201520	7207280	with Trump. Any reasonable person would look and say it's going to be close, but Biden certainly
7207280	7210880	wouldn't be a crazy thing if Biden won. Trump's already saying they're going to
7210880	7214000	cheat with mail-in ballots, or they're going to cheat with early voting, or they're going to
7214000	7218000	cheat with machines, or we should do only in person, or whatever else the case may be.
7218560	7224640	We have the election. We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go,
7224640	7228800	some states stopped counting at 10 p.m., some states count all of the mail-in stuff up front,
7228800	7235120	some don't. Everything was completely predictable. At 2 a.m., Trump comes out and says,
7235120	7240640	I won. Okay, but where are you getting that, sir? As he claims people always refer to him,
7240640	7247040	where are you getting that? And with that statement, immediately we see that there is a
7247040	7252560	large portion of this country that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second,
7253360	7259200	the polling all said this was a real possibility. The counting schedules are all being adhered to.
7261120	7267440	But Trump won. That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't happen. It builds. People are donating
7267440	7272960	millions to Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define, and lawsuits, which go nowhere,
7272960	7277600	and it builds and builds and builds. And we have a total separation from a factual reality.
7277600	7283360	There's no reason to think, by December 1, give three weeks to look through some of this stuff.
7283360	7288720	By December 1, there's no reasonable case to be made that Trump actually won. But it doesn't end
7288720	7295600	there. It goes into maybe we can just send different electors, even though Biden won Arizona.
7295600	7299280	Let's just send, I don't remember how many electors it is in Arizona. Let's just send
7299280	7303760	Republican electors to say we vote for Trump. But that's not democracy. That's not the way
7303760	7310480	the system works. Let's make sure we're ready. Ready for what exactly? And then it builds to
7311200	7317520	maybe Mike Pence can just prevent Biden from being president, or maybe we can just interfere in
7317520	7324080	this other way. And then it gets to let's break into the Capitol. It's the height of saying
7324800	7331920	we no longer comport ourselves attached to what is a verifiable factual reality.
7332640	7339920	And when we no longer do that, we're also willing to commit crimes, property crimes,
7339920	7345760	violent crimes, different degrees, in order to try to have something other than democracy.
7345760	7349600	It wouldn't be democracy if any of those things had happened.
7349600	7356080	Yeah, I think it's not the height of it. I think there's still a case to be made that that
7356960	7364240	did not leave the realm of protest versus a violation of the principles of democracy.
7364800	7372000	So to me, the height of what could happen on January 6th is if Donald Trump was much
7372000	7375600	better executive, he could take control of the military.
7375600	7380480	If it had succeeded. No, not even succeeded. The attempt would have been more
7382240	7388480	empowered. I understand. So like the way not to bring up Hitler every other word,
7388480	7393440	which is something your subreddit also told me not to do. It's kind of an important figure.
7393440	7397680	It's interesting to study that moment in history because it reveals so much about human nature
7397680	7401760	and that all of us are capable of good and evil. But thank you to your subredditor or
7401840	7406480	redditor for your contribution to the conversation. I will keep bringing up
7406480	7411040	Hitler and the Third Reich and I'll keep bringing up Stalin. There's so much to learn from that.
7411040	7420720	Anyway, an effective practice authoritarian could roll the tanks out into the city streets
7421680	7431760	to establish order and in so doing pause the process of democracy as opposed to a few protesters
7431760	7438640	breaking in to a questionably protected building. I agree that what you're saying would be worse.
7438640	7443440	I don't want to use it to minimize what the protesters were intent on doing. They failed,
7443440	7449040	fortunately. To you, the intention was there. Well, the intention was Trump should remain
7449120	7453760	president. That's the intention. And to what lengths they would have been willing to go if
7454480	7459840	by the evening, early evening, they were sort of forced out. I don't know. I agree with you
7459840	7464480	that Trump trying to use the military would absolutely be worse. There's these reports
7464480	7467760	that he tried to seize voting machines, which is kind of funny because it's like,
7467760	7471680	once you get the machine at Mar-a-Lago, what do you do with it exactly? I don't know. There's
7471680	7477280	like a comedic element to Trump sitting around with voting machines. But he did float trying to
7477280	7482560	do some other things. I don't believe there's reporting that he actually tried to use the
7482560	7487920	military. I wanted to what degree this opened the door to further things like this with other
7489520	7496320	candidates, even in the Democratic Party also. Do you think there would be more and more
7496320	7502000	questioning of the election results? There has been already. It's very clearly the playbook.
7502000	7507840	Kerry Lake lost. She ran for governor in Arizona, 2022. She lost. What I mean by that is her
7507840	7513200	opponent received more votes. It's like very clear what it means that she lost. She insists to this
7513200	7520560	day that she won, to this day. She did the same grift Trump did about donate. We've got a case.
7520560	7527920	We won in the case. You didn't win. They just set a court date. Lies upon grift upon lies.
7528320	7536240	They did it then. It's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be part
7536240	7538480	of the playbook. Do you think people on the left will start doing it?
7540240	7544800	I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say it never
7544800	7549120	could. It certainly could. People on the left could start using it as a tactic. Right now,
7549120	7553520	there's not a sign that that's going to happen, but it's certainly good. My expectation is,
7554160	7559040	and I'm not a betting man, but I would bet money. If Joe Biden loses in November of 2024,
7560000	7565840	he will say, I lost. He will call the winner. He will concede and he will leave the White House
7565840	7571520	in an orderly fashion. You don't think there will be claims of a hacked election? The ability to
7571520	7579200	hack elections is becoming more and more effective with the developments on the artificial intelligence
7579760	7586160	side. The difficulty is you're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything
7586160	7590800	about the election? Imagine there really was evidence of a hacked election. Then I would want
7590800	7596320	those claims to be made, but the way elections have gone in the past, I don't expect that that's
7596320	7601280	a claim that would be made. No. Speaking of evidence of things that were claimed,
7601840	7611120	what do you think about the Hunter Biden laptop? Or as you tweeted, the laptop from hell TM.
7612560	7617600	To what degree was this laptop story important and to what degree was it not?
7618640	7627440	At this point, I have said many times, if there is any reason to believe that Hunter Biden, Joe
7627520	7635760	Biden, Naomi Biden, Jill Biden, Hillary, Obama, Doug, and if there's any evidence any of them
7635760	7641920	committed a crime, they should be investigated, they should be charged, and they should be tried.
7642720	7648080	Period. The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long,
7648960	7659760	and we still have zero actual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly involving Joe Biden.
7659760	7666320	There's the claim from some that references to the big guy are about Joe Biden getting 10%
7666320	7670960	for some illicit. It's been years they've been saying this, they've not been able to bring forward
7670960	7680560	any evidence on it. My assessment of the Hunter Biden laptop is, it seems to mostly be a story
7681280	7688560	about nude images released without someone's consent, which is illegal in most states and violates
7688560	7695280	Twitter's own policies. That's the main story to me. Beyond that, I don't know how many people
7695280	7699600	have a copy of this hard drive at this point. Rudy had it. Tucker, do you remember when Tucker,
7700080	7707680	this is unbelievable. Tucker said that he mailed himself a copy, a USB stick,
7707680	7714080	and it got lost in the mail. You have the mother load proving the criminality of Joe and Hunter
7714080	7718960	Biden. You just dropped it off with a stamp and it got lost in the mail. You don't have a backup
7718960	7724640	copy. I'm ready for the evidence to come forward. Hunter Biden has nothing to do with Joe Biden's
7724720	7729600	administration, but as a person who, if he committed a crime, charge him, investigate him,
7729600	7734720	whatever. It's almost getting satirical, the degree to which they're talking about the Hunter
7734720	7740720	Biden laptop. What do you think about the social media aspect of this, that story got censored?
7742480	7747120	What do you think about censorship in general on social media, that that story, during an
7747120	7755440	important time in the electoral process, got censored? As a matter of principle, I think we
7755440	7761120	have to define what we mean by censorship, but I'm against censorship short of illegal content,
7761120	7766160	I guess is the way I would put it. I do respect the company's right to have terms of service and
7766160	7770960	to enforce them, as long as they're not illegal. If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content
7770960	7779520	from Jewish people, okay, now we've got a problem on our hands. But what is dubious to me is the
7779520	7786400	claim that had people been able to see Hunter Biden's genitals, they would have voted for Trump,
7786400	7792160	which I know it's like, David, you're making light of and, but at the end of the day,
7792160	7797360	what exactly is the claim that if you had known more about Hunter Biden, I guess,
7797360	7801840	allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem and seeing pictures,
7801840	7806640	you wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden? I mean, I know me as a voter, I don't feel that way.
7807840	7815760	I think it's less about the content of the story and about the actions of a social media company
7816560	7821920	to control what you see and what you don't see. So you could imagine a social media company like
7821920	7826800	Facebook and Twitter making the same kind of decision about a more impactful story than
7827680	7832320	if you dick pics on a laptop. Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different,
7832880	7836560	right? But I do, my general view, though, on the Hunter Biden story is,
7837440	7843440	had the articles not contained those images that were illegal in many states and violated
7843440	7847600	Twitter's policies, I would say publish it. Absolutely. I don't think it would have had
7847600	7852000	an impact, but I would be in favor of it being, of the links being allowed 100%.
7852960	7857120	Okay. You mentioned Tucker. What do you think about Tucker getting fired from Fox?
7858080	7861280	You're a media person that works independently. Yes.
7863120	7866000	Tucker was a media person who doesn't work independently. Right.
7868000	7873680	Yeah, what do you think about that particular situation? Is it representative of some big
7873680	7877840	shift that's happening in mainstream media? What would the shift be?
7878240	7883920	Basically, mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and less and less
7883920	7889280	and less, and there's going to give more power to individual commentators. Basically,
7889280	7893200	Tucker Carlson just starting a podcast. So, a YouTube channel.
7893200	7897680	I think that's what he should do. I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going
7897680	7902960	to work for Newsmax or whatever the case may be. But the firing fundamentally was not a politically
7903680	7908480	oriented firing that suggests Fox News is changing its tune politically in any way. There's no
7908480	7913840	evidence of that whatsoever. Tucker Carlson basically became a legal problem for Fox News.
7913840	7921360	There's really four points to it. One is the $787.5 million settlement with Dominion, partially
7921360	7927920	was because of the claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program. So, to some degree,
7927920	7935440	Tucker's program was a prominent node of the problematic claims that became the subject
7935440	7939120	of the lawsuit. That's number one. Number two, Smartmatic, which is another voting machine
7939120	7944960	company, still has a similarly sized lawsuit against Fox News based on the exact same sorts
7944960	7949840	of claims. It may cost Fox News again. So, this is now two problems that Tucker's a big contributor
7949840	7956240	to. Number three, former Tucker staffer has brought a lawsuit, and I don't remember the
7956240	7961840	exact claims, but I know that there are claims of different types of discrimination. It seems
7961840	7966880	like it has legs and that may be a third payout related to Tucker Carlson. And based on the 60
7966880	7972320	minutes piece from a few weeks ago, Ray Epps saying Tucker ruined his life by fomenting conspiracies
7972320	7979600	about him around January 6. That's ripe for another lawsuit. So, to me, Tucker's firing was a risk
7979600	7985920	mitigation strategy of many that will be employed as these lawsuits come forward.
7985920	7990960	There's no evidence that it's because Fox didn't like. And what we mean by that,
7990960	7994960	are we talking about Rupert Murdoch doesn't like or the, I don't know. But I don't have
7994960	7999280	any reason to believe it's because Tucker's ideas were no longer welcome on Fox. Certainly,
7999280	8005200	the audience liked them. So, interesting. It's not even about the ratings. It's about just the
8005200	8011120	legal costs. Fox is interesting. The ratings question is interesting because Fox, unlike
8011120	8018320	most other or every other cable news channel, they negotiate a fee from every cable subscriber.
8018320	8022560	If you have Fox News as a channel, even if you don't watch it, Fox gets a little bit of money.
8022560	8028240	They are dramatically less dependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC. So, the ratings
8028240	8031040	question is an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that.
8032000	8040000	Another question from Reddit. Both sides are the same in quotes. Is a meme notion that has spread
8040880	8045520	far and wide in American political discourse on the internet? To what extent do you agree or
8045520	8051760	disagree with this notion? And why do you think it is so popular? Now, this Reddit comment also
8051760	8057280	says that podcasts like Russell Brand and Joe Rogan or the legendary comic George Carlin are
8057280	8064560	examples of big proponents of this notion, all of which I kind of disagree with. Russell Brand,
8064640	8072960	Joe Rogan and George Carlin claim that both sides are the same and use that. All politicians are
8072960	8079840	crooked and they suck and this kind of thing. I don't know if that's true. Maybe George Carlin.
8079840	8086880	Anyway, let's leave that aside. To what degree do you agree with this notion that both sides
8086880	8093280	are the same? Left and right, the crooked corrupt politicians, they do what politicians do.
8093280	8097840	I don't agree that it's the same. I think there are different factions that like to say that
8099280	8105920	for different reasons. There are some individuals who want to present themselves as kind of being
8105920	8110480	above the fray of partisan politics. And so, I call it enlightened centrism.
8111920	8115520	Do you mean that positively or negatively? No, I mean it negatively. Yeah, it's a bit
8115520	8122240	of a pejorative. The idea that I am not going to fall for being a Democrat or a Republican,
8122800	8129120	I can see that these are just two sides of the same coin, equally bad, lying to everyone. Okay,
8129120	8133680	so that's one, it's sort of like it's popular at dinner parties in some circles to go,
8134640	8140080	both all these politicians left and right. So that's one side of it. The other side of it is that
8140800	8150080	it's often used when your side has really stepped in it. It's a popular way to acknowledge
8150880	8156560	that your side has done something wrong. But while framing it as it's not uniquely wrong,
8157120	8160720	and it's not worse than what anybody else does. And I find that it's one of the
8161440	8168560	lamest and most kind of cringe-inducing things to hear because of the what comes next.
8169200	8176320	And usually what comes next is not a good, accurate criticism of something that took place
8176320	8181280	and a discussion of how to solve a real problem that we have. I find it a conversation stifler.
8181280	8186320	It also is used to kind of suppress voter turnout, not actively. It's not that the people who say
8186320	8191600	that go around saying don't vote. But the idea, of course, is the more people that believe that it
8191600	8196160	doesn't really make a difference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout. And I want
8196160	8200080	voter turnout to be as high as possible, not as low as possible. So I also dislike it for that
8200080	8206640	reason. So is it possible to say that one side is worse than the other in modern current political
8207520	8214720	climate? Listen, I'm a person on the left. I'm not pretending to come here as not knowing that my
8214720	8218800	view is biased because I'm a person of the left. If you ask Ben Shapiro, he'll tell you something
8218800	8226400	different. I think in 2023, some total, the influence of the American right wing, if the
8226400	8233120	American right wing were to get everything it wants, it would be a horrifying reality. If the
8233120	8238880	left were to get everything it wants, we'd have to figure out a few things, including exactly how
8238880	8245520	we pay for certain programs. But they're mostly noble goals. And I believe that they are more
8245520	8252160	supportive of an individual self determining what they want to do in life and how they want to live
8252160	8257280	and is more in line with the idea of freedom and liberty than what the right is currently
8257280	8262800	proposing. That's my view. And of course, people will disagree with me all day. No, we get to
8262800	8266960	freedom and liberty the way that the right wants to do it. Okay, well, we can have that conversation.
8266960	8275840	So I think you've implied in your answer, it was kind of focused on policy. It felt like it was
8275840	8280960	focused on policy. There's other stuff that people worry about, particularly with the left.
8282160	8289600	What maybe termed the woke mind virus. Where have I heard who's using that term a lot now?
8289600	8296640	I'm trying to think. I'm not sure. I'm not sure where it comes up. But the cultural aspect of
8296640	8305120	this, that if you give a lot of power to people on the left, as you gave as an example, there would
8305120	8313200	be a lot of kind of censorship and suppression of speech and a kind of dividing up of a society of
8313200	8320400	who's allowed to basically a reallocation of resources not based on merit, but based on some
8320400	8326320	kind of high ethical notions of what is right. And only a very small percentage of the population
8326320	8333040	gets to decide what is what is fair, what is right, which is, you know, we already have a
8333040	8340880	small portion of the population deciding fair. I don't know how many different ways I can say
8340880	8346240	kind of a negative characterization of folks on the left when we're now comparing it,
8346240	8352000	just as a to play devil's advocate. So is that something that you worry about? So setting policies
8352000	8359600	aside, wokeism, how big of a problem is it? This is a great conversation. So two sides of it.
8359840	8367120	Okay. We have new polling that seems to suggest so-called wokeism is kind of more popular in
8367120	8372000	the United States than anti-wokeism. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. This is the less
8372000	8377040	interesting part. We'll go to the more interesting part second. Sometimes what people mean by wokeism
8377040	8387520	is an overreaction to a perceived injustice that goes beyond what would be fair and equitable.
8388320	8391920	There was this really interesting poll and it asks questions like, for example,
8391920	8398000	do you believe society has gone too far, not far enough, or just about the right amount,
8398720	8406560	in dealing with issues affecting the trans community? The woke position, which is society
8406560	8412880	hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular than we've gone too far. Now the right wing media
8412880	8417360	narrative is we've gone way too far. This is out of control. And there are lots of other
8417360	8423360	similar answers. It's not a huge margin. A lot of these are like 58 to 42, 60 to 40. It's not
8423360	8429920	like 90 to 10. But by a small margin, the so-called woke perspective of we actually haven't yet done
8429920	8436240	enough to fix some of these issues is a little bit more popular. So if we went back to DeSantis,
8436240	8441600	this is part of why I think DeSantis' anti-woke agenda may just be a political misstep.
8441600	8447920	That's a really interesting result. I wonder how the questions are framed. But it's still
8447920	8456480	interesting, nevertheless, no matter what, to hear that people are majority of people in America
8456480	8461680	are woke, not in the negative sense of the word. The poll didn't use the term woke, right? This
8461680	8467360	is a critical thing. Let's use the term woke positively. The term has kind of been perverted
8468160	8471920	four years ago when the term was started to be used, I would have said, oh, yeah,
8471920	8479200	woke just means like I have become aware of problems that are bigger than any one person
8479200	8486160	can fix for themselves that relate to the system. And we might disagree on which problems fall
8486160	8491440	into that category, but it was kind of benign. I think now it just means like outrageously
8492400	8498320	left wing, maybe even with socialist or Marxist undertones, it's becoming a pejorative at this.
8498320	8505760	But also like bullies. Sure, censors. Yeah, but people that go around calling others racist,
8507440	8516560	sometimes oftentimes without any proof of or justification. Fair. But that's a few folks
8516560	8521120	on Twitter, you're saying like the polling is starting to show that like, no, they're still
8522960	8528160	most Americans still care about these issues and want to want to want to improve, want to make
8528160	8532080	progress. I think that's the case. And they want to do it in a genuine way that doesn't suppress
8532080	8537520	or oppress anybody. But now let me get to like to what degree do I think that actual when it goes
8537520	8543840	too far is a problem. It absolutely exists. We can find instances of where this exists on the left.
8544800	8551520	I've been told many times that as a Jewish, Argentinian immigrant to the United States,
8552800	8561920	I actually don't qualify as oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the U.S.
8561920	8567440	and my family had just enough money to leave Argentina. So there's this kind of like oppression
8567440	8572640	Olympics thing where I've been told you don't get to comment, for example, like a topic in the
8572640	8581200	Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latin X? In Spanish, there's an analogous movement
8581920	8589440	where words by their nature sort of like have a gender. So like the word for friend is amigo.
8590640	8595920	But if it's a woman, you would say amiga. So right from there, you can tell the gender that
8595920	8602240	we're talking about. And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos. It's the male with an S,
8602240	8606400	but it could include both. There's a movement now which wants to do away with that and put the
8606400	8614080	letter E in. It's a new word. It's a gender neutral word. Amigos, totally new. I don't like that.
8614800	8619040	And I don't know anyone. No one in my family uses it. And I think it's kind of like a strange
8619040	8625920	imposition from someone kind of with a solution in search of a problem. I've been told you moved
8625920	8629600	to the U.S. long ago and like your English is good and like you look wide and said like you
8629600	8634800	don't get to weigh in on that. That, I think, is an example, if I understand correctly, of the
8634800	8639200	type of thing you're talking about. I'm kind of being bullied. I'm fine. I'm surviving fine, but
8639200	8643680	I'm being bullied over it and disqualified and saying you don't get to speak on this issue.
8643680	8650080	All of those examples, all of that stuff, I am completely against and I tell people on the left,
8650080	8654320	we're actually hurting our own movement with this stuff. I just don't think it's as big
8655360	8658880	as some others believe. You don't think it's an existential threat to
8658880	8664640	our civilization in the West? No, I don't. And I mean, look, we've got a Biden administration.
8664640	8670960	I see Biden as center left. Those who see Biden as extreme far left. This stuff has played
8670960	8674880	almost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years of his administration.
8674880	8677200	Were there people that see him far left as far left?
8678160	8682480	There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a Marxist socialist communist.
8684320	8688320	I haven't heard that because I don't think that would stick very much.
8688400	8689760	He says it at every rally.
8692000	8694080	Which I also tell us that you don't watch these things.
8694080	8698480	I love how deeply researched you are in Trump. I can only imagine how good your
8698480	8701200	Trump impression is at this point. It's not very, sadly, it's not good.
8701200	8702080	It's not, all right.
8702080	8707280	No, and I'll say one other thing on that. Take trans because just to talk about it a little
8707280	8712640	bit, we haven't dealt with it much. The trans issue has become huge, I believe, because the
8712640	8716720	right is obsessed with it. The right is very much not concerned with gay men anymore. It used to
8716720	8721760	be that gay men is like, oh, we have to stop gay men from adopting and unnatural and pedophiles.
8721760	8729200	Now it's trans, it's drag shows, et cetera. I do think that there is a fair question to say,
8729200	8738000	how do we deal with trans women in a very small short list of sports? That's real.
8738720	8746000	My view, though, is I go, okay, we have all issues. We have issues related to gender and
8746000	8753280	sexual orientation. We have issues related to trans. Within that, we have specifically sports.
8753280	8761920	You can eliminate from that trans men. Nobody's worried about biological women who are trans.
8761920	8766720	And then when you say it's only in certain sports that it matters, hey, I'm right there.
8766720	8771680	I think it's a complicated question. I don't know how we deal with it. I would ask leagues
8771680	8776640	that have experienced with this already and whatever. The problem I have is pretending that
8776640	8786080	the vanguard of left-wing politics right now is trying to force trans women into sports.
8786080	8791760	It's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were.
8792400	8800400	But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to continue discussing it. I mean,
8800400	8806960	I feel like even in institutions, even at universities, it feels like these ideas of
8806960	8814800	diversity, inclusion, and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of what a university
8814800	8823200	should also care about, which is merit. And it feels like reprioritization is going a little
8823200	8830080	too far the other way, meaning prioritizing this kind of amorphous concept of diversity
8830720	8837280	is moving away, is giving power to people that don't care about merit, and it just want to bully
8837280	8849680	people with a big stick that says racism or sexism or anti-diversity. And it kind of suffocates the
8849680	8857840	people that care about merit, about meritocracy, about inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds
8857840	8861840	to succeed. And it's just you kind of observe that. I'm sure that happens in all kinds of
8861840	8866160	institutions. And the concern, I think the people that are concerned about wokeism
8866160	8871760	are concerned about at scale, what impact does that have on a society when there's so much
8871760	8880560	conversation about racism and oppression, not to talk about merit, like who's the actual good
8880560	8885600	person in the room, the best person in the room. Generically, that's a concern to me. The degree
8885600	8892000	to which it's happening at different institutions, I think is worthy of exploration. I know people
8892000	8897360	who work in academia that are getting out of academia because they don't like the environment
8897360	8901600	on their campuses for exactly the reason you're saying. So it exists. There's no question about
8901600	8907280	it. I also think that the idea of a perfect meritocracy is maybe not necessarily the goal,
8907280	8914320	in the sense that when you talk about perfect meritocracy, someone wrote a book about this
8914320	8918560	who I interviewed about a year and a half ago, whose name escapes me. There are problems with
8918640	8928560	perfect meritocracy. I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal opportunity for people,
8928560	8934640	understanding that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people,
8935200	8939040	generally speaking, to determine the path that they want to take and giving them,
8939760	8945600	if it's possible, the ability to pursue that without suppressing, limiting. I mean,
8945600	8950640	this is like relatively uncontroversial stuff among, I would argue 95% of the left
8951760	8955200	with the caveats of what you're talking about, which I agree exist.
8955200	8959360	It would be nice to know the actual data. Sometimes people blow stuff out of proportion.
8959360	8965520	What is, it's hard to measure how much self-censorship happens at university campuses.
8965520	8970480	That's true. I think also it's sort of like the pit bull bite stories thing,
8970560	8975600	where when a pit bull bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on
8976240	8982000	because it fits a certain narrative. There are right-wing publications that are very
8982000	8988240	interested in making this seem as if it is an epidemic. I'm the first to say it is happening
8988240	8992800	to a degree. I don't know the degree that it's happening to. I know a lot of people in academia,
8992800	8994720	only a couple of them say that it's an issue.
8994800	8999120	Would they say it though if they believed it?
8999120	9002480	I think they would say it to me. These are just personal contacts.
9002480	9003760	It's not like I'm going to go blabbing.
9003760	9009520	To push back, I kind of agree with you, but at the same time, most, I mean,
9010160	9014960	I'm deeply connected in academia of a huge number of colleagues. Most people
9016320	9020480	self-censor by not thinking about it at all. They're like, screw it.
9020480	9021280	That's deeper.
9021280	9025680	Whatever. I'm just going to focus on the thing I love doing, which is the work,
9025680	9033200	and they don't think about, they basically remove themselves from politics and social issues,
9033200	9037040	and they just kind of say, I'm going to do my engineering. I'm going to do my mathematics.
9037040	9041440	Sure. The problem with that is it's kind of, you can't go anywhere further to figure it out.
9041440	9044480	It's sort of like there's this funny clip where Jordan Peterson says,
9044480	9048240	even atheists are actually religious. They just don't know it. It's like,
9048240	9052800	it's hard to test that. I don't know. Okay. I mean, I don't, but it's a fair point.
9052800	9056960	That means there may be some people, if it has become so toxic for some people,
9056960	9061040	they may have repressed it way down into their subconscious, but I don't know how we would
9061040	9065760	know that. But you know symptoms of it because when certain people speak up,
9067040	9073520	kind of lightly, and then a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old responds and is outraged,
9074080	9080080	the fact that the administration listens to that 19 and 20-year-old and then reprimands
9080080	9086080	whoever spoke up a little bit, that's a really dangerous sign to me. And I don't really care
9086080	9091200	about these, like, so I'm more with you. I don't think it's a big issue, but then I notice it.
9091200	9096240	I wonder, wait a minute, would this kind of environment allow a young Noam Chowsky to be
9096240	9103600	around? With this environment allow, like, I don't know, like what tenure was designed for,
9103600	9109680	which is to have controversial thinkers and not kind of weird controversial things,
9109680	9113440	but really people that challenge things that should be challenged.
9113440	9119920	Yeah. I sympathize with that significantly. I always try to look at specific examples.
9119920	9123920	And sometimes I'll look at people, I'll ask for them and people will send me five.
9124000	9128720	And one of them is a legit bona fide example of what we're talking about. And four are kind of like,
9130000	9134640	there was a complaint and it was investigated, but the teacher's tenure was never in jeopardy.
9134640	9141120	And I don't know that I chalk this up to a big woke event. What do you think the kind of apparatus
9141120	9144400	of the four-year degree in college is going to look like in 20 years?
9145440	9151840	Oh, that's, I mean, we're like, day by day, that seems to be changing with GPT. I don't know if
9151840	9156400	you've gotten a chance to interact with chat GPT. Absolutely. My entire show now is written by chat
9156400	9165520	GPT. I mean, there's a, that's partially a joke. It is only because it stopped looking at the
9165520	9169920	internet in 2021. If it was current, I could completely just tune it out. No, I'm kidding,
9169920	9175760	but it's a fascinating tool. And it's changing the nature of how we do homework assignments,
9175760	9180480	it's changing the nature of how we learn, how we look up new information, how we explore
9180560	9187520	information, how we care about things we're interested in. I think it, I don't think we'll have
9189040	9194400	value for a university degree in 20 years the way we do now. I just think it changes everything. I
9194400	9202400	think language models. I mean, Google search has already, and Wikipedia has already transformed,
9202400	9209120	I would say, our civilization, but it's, there was still a value for basic education. I don't,
9209120	9216560	I think that starts to dissipate with chat GPT. So I don't, I don't know. I really, I really don't
9216560	9221280	think there's a university the way we think of a university in 20, 20, 30 years. I mean,
9221280	9226320	I have a personal interest in it, in that my daughter is 10 months old. And I'm doing the 529
9226320	9232880	account, I'm going through the motions as if, but I also recognize, you know, if she went to the
9232880	9239680	schools I went to, just with the rate of tuition increase, you're talking 200K a year by the time
9239680	9245440	she's 18. And what happens with wages relative to that, this is like separate from the technological
9245440	9253120	thing. And in my mind, I'm thinking, is this going to continue being the right path? What I would
9253120	9259840	love to see is so many people that I interact with just by virtue of what I do, have no foundation
9259920	9264080	in critical thinking, epistemology, philosophy, or media literacy. And
9265440	9271600	if there were some way to make that the core of some basic education that everybody's receiving,
9272560	9279280	which goes beyond, you know, chat GPT can do so many things, but I've not yet seen good examples
9279280	9285520	of how it can teach you to think. Maybe you have a different view on how chat GPT can teach a user
9285600	9291680	to think, but those skills seem to be so lacking in so many of the people I interact with. If there's
9291680	9296800	any positive change to come from a changing dynamic with higher education, I wish it would be to go
9296800	9304400	in that direction. Well, no, chat GPT is actually much better at helping me think than any educator,
9304400	9308800	even books that I've encountered, because it's very good at presenting the full picture,
9309520	9314880	even better than a lot of Wikipedia articles, you know, on questions like the virus leak from
9314880	9320480	a lab, the COVID leak from a lab. This just presents to you all the different hypotheses,
9320480	9327280	the amount of evidence available to it. It's like a full, calm, objective picture of it.
9327280	9331440	There's no partisanship. It's like a really nice list of things that's available.
9331440	9338400	But I guess what I mean is, does it tell you how as a thinking human, you should evaluate the
9338400	9342000	strength of each of the paragraphs it presents to you? You can literally ask the question.
9342000	9345520	You can ask it to do it. Oh, fair. Okay. And then it's actually a fun,
9346720	9353280	it's fun to ask chat GPT that question, because you get good answers. And so you basically
9354400	9362880	have a kind of socratic, like a deep, intimate, like great podcast style conversation with an AI
9362880	9369280	system every single day, for as many hours as you want, especially as it improves and as the
9369280	9374240	interfaces by which you communicate with a thing improves. So yeah, I think, I think it will do
9374240	9380240	exactly that, which is teach you how to think, because you will offload the memory effects
9381120	9389440	and equations and whatever else school teaches you, you'll offload that to AI. And instead,
9389440	9395920	you'll be using your human mind, which is what it for now is uniquely good at, which is asking good
9395920	9402240	questions, thinking through the complexities of issues when there's multiple perspectives on it,
9402240	9406000	all of that. Well, then I stand corrected, maybe then I don't know what college is going to be in
9406000	9412880	20 years. Well, but you were sort of commenting, I see to the financial aspect of it, like, why does
9412880	9420400	it even make sense? Yeah. I'm thinking about the transformative effects of AI and what starts
9420400	9428720	to ask, what is even education? Right. What are you supposed, what is the purpose of education?
9428720	9433520	So one is to give you kind of a background knowledge on a bunch of different topics,
9433520	9437680	but the other is to discover the thing you're truly passionate about, and the thing you're
9437680	9442640	really good at, such that you can make money, and you can contribute to society and have a
9442640	9448880	fulfilling life. Yeah, and also learning to interact with other people, relationships are built,
9448960	9454640	socializing, and so many other things as well. But is that, you know, that is the big value of
9454640	9459840	university? Yeah. And maybe you should be called something else. Can you get that for less than
9459840	9464400	200K a year somewhere else? Yeah, no, it's a fair question. Kind of social club. And you know, one
9464400	9468800	of the things I think about also is people who are well connected, I mean, this has always been,
9468800	9474480	this isn't new, right? But if you're well connected, and you have a sort of drive towards
9474480	9478480	entrepreneurship and doing your own thing, and you're not pursuing a field that is very licensing
9478480	9484800	dependent like medicine or law, getting started four years earlier with some internships can be
9484800	9490080	a privilege in some cases. But again, that path is available to the people that would likely do
9490080	9495520	well regardless of whether they went to college. And so it's a very privileged, self-selected group
9495520	9504000	anyway. Another question from Reddit. Ask David to explain why American-style libertarianism
9504000	9510000	is an unserious philosophy. I don't know what they mean by American-style libertarianism.
9510000	9518080	I've talked before about these kind of utopian libertarians where, you know, we have, we don't
9518080	9525760	have police. You just kind of like hire a for-profit company if you want protection. And if there's a
9525760	9530720	conflict between two of these private security companies, then I don't know, you figure it out
9530720	9535920	somehow. So it's almost like anarchism. So take care of that. Yeah. If by, I don't know what the
9535920	9541360	question means by that American-style libertarianism. But in general, my problems with libertarianism
9541360	9548320	as it is often presented come from the work of sociology as well as human psychology,
9548320	9553520	which is the reality that once you get a group that's bigger than 150 people,
9554480	9560080	you really have to start centralizing some decisions unless you're going to subdivide
9560080	9566480	the 150 endlessly into 275s that now no longer have contact. But then that's not really one
9566480	9572320	society. Now it's two. I've not seen good evidence. And I've read a fair bit about this that once you
9572320	9578720	get beyond 150, you can keep all decisions decentralized. And once you say some things
9578720	9584560	need to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it. And it's going to be some version
9584560	9589680	of government that conflicts with aspects of libertarianism. Well, it could be companies,
9589680	9595520	right? It could be more market-driven, which is the idea of anarchism that you're not,
9596080	9599760	you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence.
9599760	9608560	You know, and then if you think that the markets are efficient at delivering, especially in this
9608560	9616480	21st century and beyond, where a market could have perfect information about people. So one
9616480	9620800	of the issues is that you can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information. But now
9620800	9630240	in a digital age, we can be higher bandwidth participants in the market. So if you're choosing
9630240	9634720	between different security companies or you're choosing between different providers of different
9634720	9641120	services, you could do so more efficiently and more effectively in the digital space.
9641120	9648400	So you could kind of imagine it, but we haven't successfully done it without governments.
9648400	9655520	Yeah. And I think there's a practical, once you get beyond 150, you also start specializing.
9656720	9661040	It just is a matter of fact, you don't have, everybody isn't growing their own food. Some
9661040	9665600	people grow the food and other people do other things. And you come across a lot of the problems
9665600	9670960	that started at the agricultural revolution. And whether you say that it's a company that's
9670960	9676320	solving it or a government, the problems are going to be very similar. And I've not read
9676320	9679680	anything that to my satisfaction explains how you deal with that.
9680240	9684160	Well, there's underlying principles of libertarianism, which is putting priority at the
9684720	9690480	freedom of the individual, right? And that's a compelling notion.
9690480	9695440	Yeah. Whenever I do these various political compass things that put you on two axes,
9695440	9701920	on the authoritarian libertarian axis, I am way down on the libertarian side as a left libertarian.
9701920	9710560	So my tendencies are always anti-authoritarian and towards that option when it makes sense.
9711120	9714800	So I sympathize with that a lot. Another question from Reddit,
9714800	9718880	ask David what issues he disagrees with you on. Is there something?
9718880	9723760	I have no idea. Okay, that's great. There you go. There's no issues. Perfect agreement.
9724880	9728800	What's your view on Tesla? That's a good opportunity to ask. What do you think is
9729760	9735840	the strengths and weaknesses of Elon Musk? You mentioned Twitter, have you paid your $8?
9735840	9739600	I have not paid my $8. I don't see the point in paying for it. I have no problem paying for
9739600	9747040	services. I use a ton of services. I'll try the free. I'll go to the paid. Right now, so the way
9747040	9755360	I used to use the verified feed was I would post a tweet and then the next day when I review what's
9755360	9758800	going on in my social media, I would look at the replies to the tweet, which would give me a mix
9758800	9764080	of replies from verified and unverified people. But then I would also look at the verified and see
9764080	9772480	who that are verified public folks have responded to me or maybe I want to engage with whatever
9772480	9777920	the case may be. I don't even understand why I would look at the verified feed anymore. So I
9777920	9783680	never do because it's random folks who I don't know. It sort of lost its utility to me.
9784400	9790080	Oh, yeah. Sorry to interrupt. But the idea is if everybody who's human pays the $8,
9790080	9794240	it shows to you that it's not bots. It's at least humans.
9794240	9797600	From the reports about the number of people that have bought the blue checkmark,
9797600	9802880	I think we may be a thousand years from enough signups in order to make that sort of like a
9802880	9806800	reality. That was the idea. That was the idea. It's an interesting idea. Honestly,
9807040	9814080	for my experience, obviously, I was seeing all sorts of attack comments, some of which were,
9814080	9818240	I'm sure, from bots. But I'm ignoring all of those comments anyway. So it really didn't affect
9818240	9822400	my experience that much. I mean, here's the thing about Elon. And I say this, people sometimes
9822400	9828720	are like, David, you obviously hate Elon or you obviously love Elon. I was an investor in Tesla
9828720	9835760	starting in 2015. I've since sold all my shares. Great run. I'm on my second Tesla right now.
9836560	9841600	I probably won't get a third one because I think that electric vehicle technology
9842240	9847600	is now maturing such that when my lease is up, I'm going to have many more options with the
9847600	9851200	range and charging network that's important to me. But I could be wrong. Maybe, you know, I don't
9851200	9856720	know. I have no, the cult of personality around people, they mean nothing to me. So for me,
9856720	9864160	it's just like people are people. Nobody has only good ideas. Fine. I think that what Elon Musk did
9864240	9869360	accelerating and pushing forward the battery and electric vehicle technology is unbelievable.
9870800	9878400	It's a one person wrecking ball in the best sense of saying, we're not going to slow play this and do,
9879120	9885600	okay, now Toyota hasn't actually entered, but now whoever, we've got a 90 mile range car and
9885600	9890480	next year it'll be 110. And it's just like, we're doing this right now. You can compete or you can
9890480	9896800	opt out and look at what's happened. Fantastic. On the Twitter side of things, I don't really get
9896800	9903200	the whole plan. I don't know if it started maybe as kind of a goof of some kind and it developed
9903200	9908320	into, I guess I have to buy it. And I think something about it ended up with, there was a
9908320	9912000	clause invoked where I think he did try to get out of buying it, but then was forced to to some
9912000	9917840	degree. Yeah, he was forced. The way Twitter used to work was you followed people. And when you
9917840	9922400	looked at your feed, you either saw the posts from the people you were following in reverse
9922400	9928640	chronological order or posts from the people you followed algorithmically tailored to what
9928640	9935280	you're most likely to want to see. And if you didn't follow someone, you generally wouldn't
9935280	9940480	see their posts unless it was like a sponsored tweet or someone you follow quoted or retweeted them.
9940480	9948080	Fine. The for you feed, TikTok, I believe first had a so-called for you feed. The idea is this is
9948080	9954480	stuff you might like based on, I don't know what, either demographic data about you, your other
9954480	9959680	habits, whatever. And so it's useless to me. It's just basically mostly right-wing content that
9959680	9964880	is not interesting to me. Why do you think that is? I mean, so the signals that are used to generate
9964880	9974000	the for you page is looking at all your likes, all your comments, all your blocks and mutes,
9974000	9979040	and all that. I mean, I don't know what I was looking at. Okay. So it's supposed to be very
9979040	9983760	pleasant for you. I'm sure other people go, wow, this for you thing is awesome. Like if you had
9984560	9989760	insert some right-wing or sitting here, they would go, Twitter used to suppress right-wing voices.
9989760	9994400	And now finally, they're getting the fair shake that they deserve in the for you feed.
9994400	10001200	Okay. I mean, I wonder if there's left-wing folks setting their feelings of Elon aside
10001200	10005680	that are enjoying the for you page. That's a really important question because it's supposed to be
10005680	10008320	people on the left and people on the right should be enjoying the for you page.
10008320	10014880	Sure. Yeah. I mean, so for me, my thought on Elon is some incredible successes. I don't know about
10014880	10021840	Twitter. I do think that I don't believe Elon is a right-winger. And when you see interviews with him,
10023440	10030320	certainly, at least socially and in many ways culturally, seems very moderate or even
10030320	10034160	somewhat on the left in my experience. So I don't think it's Elon's a right-winger. I don't that's
10034160	10040640	not an interesting critique. It does seem though that throughout the Twitter escapade, he certainly
10040640	10046560	ended up closer to some voices that may be influencing him in a particular way.
10047680	10052880	That's giving some people that impression. But as far as the Elon hate or the Elon love,
10053440	10057600	it's just a person who's done some interesting things, some of which I like and some of which
10057600	10068160	I could kind of leave aside. I have seen folks drift towards the right more
10070240	10073200	in response to just the viciousness of attacks from the left.
10074000	10079200	Like who? Well, Elon. So you do think he's drifted towards the right?
10079440	10088720	So I don't think at the core, but I think on the surface. I think Joe Rogan has as well
10088720	10095200	on the surface because maybe you can correct me, but it feels like people on the left attack
10095200	10105120	more viciously. That has not been my experience. Let me know because my sense was that they
10105120	10111120	attack people on the left viciously as well. Left attacks its own because you're not progressive
10111120	10116320	enough. It's just this kind of bullying that happens very intensely.
10116320	10126080	No, you're 100% right that when the left has attacked me, it's almost as vicious as when
10126080	10132800	the right attacks me. The difference in my experience is it's a smaller contingent on the
10132800	10137760	left that's willing to levy those attacks against me, but I'm on the left. So to some degree,
10137760	10143680	you could say, well, that's to be expected. There is toxicity on the left.
10143680	10148080	But it's intense, isn't it? And that's what I mean. The attacks on people who are on the left,
10149280	10153200	you're not left enough. Yeah, that's no. And it is a small number of people.
10153200	10161600	I can't deny that that is absolutely a real phenomenon. And depending on what sort of
10161600	10168080	topics you take on publicly, you are going to suffer the wrath of that to a greater or lesser
10168080	10173040	degree. But with all of these things, what I always go back to is, I probably would have
10173040	10176960	more disagreements with Rogan today than the last time I was on his show, which was at the beginning
10176960	10183040	of the pandemic. And I've done clips critical of things that he has said, substantive, of course.
10183840	10188960	To me, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, I could sit down with him and do a podcast and it would be
10189040	10193200	zero big deal. And I would tell him, I stand by everything I said about what you said. And I
10193200	10197840	would say it to you right now. There are people who write to me and go, oh, man, things must be
10197840	10203680	really, really tense now. If you were to, Rogan would never have you on because you disagree.
10203680	10207760	He loves you. I'm sure he's just not thinking of me. I'm not the most important thing to Joe
10207760	10213760	Rogan. I think both of us would be able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms.
10213760	10218000	It would not be taken personally. And then we would move on and it would be the next day.
10218000	10222080	You get attacked a lot. How do you not let that break you mentally?
10223760	10232080	I don't know. So let's see. I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space. The news and politics,
10232080	10236560	partisan news and politics, partisan news and politics on the internet with a social media
10236560	10241440	component, just completely and totally toxic. From a personal perspective, when I'm done producing
10241440	10246960	my last show of the week until Monday, I try to completely tune out from news and politics
10246960	10253520	altogether and also make an effort to just not look at feedback and what's going on.
10253520	10261600	I also really limit my visibility. I don't need to read every comment. I don't need to
10261600	10267200	look at every email or every tweet. I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my social
10267200	10273440	media platforms, look at generally what has the reaction been, maybe include that in my assessment
10273440	10277360	of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed a good point or something like that and
10277360	10281120	basically try to move on. When something like we've talked about at the beginning happens,
10281840	10285680	it becomes obsessive. I mean, it's unhealthy, right? Where I'm going, oh my God, who's attacking
10285680	10291840	me now and scrolling? It becomes, you know, I'm sweating. It's horrible. But I think just like
10291840	10297760	limiting exposure to that and remembering that it is impossible to please everybody. And so I'd
10297760	10306080	really rather have fresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are sort of restricted
10306080	10309520	and flattened by what I perceive to be people's preferences.
10311360	10315680	So just can you speak a little more to the full process of creating the David Backman show?
10317760	10319840	You're doing five shows a week?
10319840	10324560	I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days. I shoot Monday to
10324560	10330640	Thursday, but we're doing five episodes. Basically, our guests we schedule in advance.
10331440	10337520	I'm picking six to eight stories each day that are like I said, a blend of stuff I think will be
10337520	10343600	interesting, things I want to talk about, and things where it's being discussed at one layer
10343600	10348640	and I want to go deeper on it and I feel like I'm able to do that. I choose those stories in the
10348640	10353120	morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show out by that afternoon.
10354080	10360320	What's the preparation? What's the how do you take notes? Are you on a sheet of paper?
10361120	10365280	No sheets of paper anymore. I used to do sheets of paper. I found something about it,
10365280	10371360	like at work, the tactile nature of it. It became inconvenient for sharing the notes with my team.
10371360	10377360	But basically, we use a wiki type system. It's called Media Wiki, which is basically like a
10377360	10383120	Wikipedia clone. Old school. Yeah, old school. So we can have pages for every guest, every topic.
10383120	10386960	Oh, that's interesting. I haven't heard that. Yeah. I don't know anyone else who's using it. It
10386960	10393520	works really well. It's so fast and it takes up almost no space. So it just is a really good tool.
10394240	10399920	When my team, when we book a guest and they have notes from the publicist, they'll put it in there
10399920	10405120	and then I can access it. So I'm basically working off of notes rather than a script. I'll pull any
10405120	10414000	audio-visual stuff that I want so that that's available. And it's really a very seamless,
10414000	10417280	you know, we're doing this every day, four days a week. And so we have it down to a well-oiled
10417280	10424800	machine. Where do you get ideas from? Everywhere. I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I
10424800	10430800	think are talking about interesting things. I have a curated list for which I still use Twitter,
10430800	10435680	and it is very good for this. It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are
10435680	10442400	doing interesting work. So I'll see what's there. Look at the sort of standard news reporting,
10442400	10450240	wire services, AP and Reuters. Glance at what? Everything from Drudge to CNN to whoever is
10450240	10457200	covering that day. Look at Google News. How do you try to fact check stuff on your show?
10457280	10462240	So like is there sources or is there a process? I always try to get to a primary source first
10462240	10468720	and foremost for the facts of the story. And then I'll use other tools for background research.
10468720	10476880	Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes, I find to be useful tools. Chat GPT is a good one. You really
10476880	10481920	have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of where to do the fact checking, which I think is
10481920	10485680	fantastic. Sometimes it gives me information that's flat out wrong. And when you ask for the source,
10485680	10490880	it's like, oh, yeah, that actually is not real, which is, hey, it's part of the process.
10492320	10496320	And then when there's like an expertise type of thing, if it's a breaking legal matter,
10496320	10500800	I'll just call like a friend who's a lawyer or call a friend who's a doctor or something like that.
10501440	10506880	If it lends itself to that. Let me ask you about the nature of truth. Do you think it's
10506880	10511760	becoming more and more difficult to know what is true and will become continuously,
10512480	10515280	continue to get more difficult, especially with GPT?
10516000	10523360	I think the big difficulty is in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact
10523360	10529360	and what is a statement of opinion. I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or
10529360	10534880	less agree on how to get to the truth. Or if we can't get to it, at least figure out how we would
10534880	10538720	if the information were available. But the bigger challenge I'm having is
10539680	10544640	someone will call in with an opinion, but say they want to talk about fact.
10545440	10550320	And I have to explain to them, you're talking about an opinion and not a fact. And this goes
10550320	10556240	back to the lack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy. But that's the bigger challenge
10556240	10559440	for me right now. But I mean, I think the big statements are always going to be
10560160	10571520	somewhat opinions. Like was the 2020 election fair? I think any answer to that is an opinion.
10572640	10574960	Disagree. If we define fair.
10577600	10583840	Well, yes. So then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs
10583840	10592000	where each sentence now has facts, right? So what do you mean by fair? Is it who can show up
10592000	10598880	to vote? What was the process of how easy it is to vote? Was there actual cheating going on?
10598880	10602720	And different like what is the evidence of that cheating? You have to actually get to the actual
10602720	10608720	like details of a thing. High level, you know, everything is just going to be an opinion, it
10608720	10616480	feels like. And you can approximate that to be like, it's a well-founded opinion. Well,
10616480	10621440	most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion. So like, I think there's a threshold
10621440	10628240	beyond which an opinion becomes like, this is a pretty reliable thing to assume for now that
10628240	10635440	that's okay. So let me revise. So I think maybe better said, I think that the difficulty,
10636400	10643360	I mean, the process you described is probably the right process and it's exhausting for mundane
10643360	10651360	things and that causes major problems. If we were to say, is it better for the economy to have
10652080	10659840	a tax rate on people making over a million dollars that's 20% or 50%? Okay. What do we mean by better
10659840	10665360	for the economy? It's not an overwhelming task to decide on that. We could say, well, we'll say it's
10665360	10669760	better for the economy by looking at what was the unemployment rate based on the tax rate on
10669760	10675600	million, you know, people earning a million a year and what was GDP and whatever. Okay. We've
10675600	10682880	agreed. This is a statement. We are now in the realm of just determining what is given the parameters
10682880	10689120	that we've established. I think that that's relatively doable. The issue is with the bigger
10689120	10694880	ones like you're talking about where what do we mean by a fair election and fair in whose eyes and
10694880	10701200	but I am with you that it often devolves into a conversation about opinions about what is fair
10702000	10708000	rather than an ascertainment of the facts. Yeah. And it feels like maybe avoiding some
10708000	10713440	of these big, maybe there's some trigger words too, maybe avoiding them allows you to actually
10713440	10719520	talk about the facts and through that educate yourself and learn about like whether the virus
10719520	10725600	leaked from a lab or not. To me was always a super interesting question. I don't know why
10725600	10730720	everybody got super touchy about it. Mostly people I know, colleagues, biologists thought
10732400	10738400	it's pretty good likelihood that it leaked from a lab given everything. They just didn't the evidence
10738400	10743760	is not there for a either one. And so like you should be able to just openly talk about it.
10743760	10748960	Unless you're in the high political office where there could be geopolitical consequences to your
10748960	10752240	statements. But in general, it's an interesting question. You should be able to talk about it.
10752240	10756160	But there's no, first of all, there's not many facts around there, unfortunately.
10757680	10761920	And a lot of very conclusive statements about especially in the early days were just opinions.
10762480	10768000	And so you have to the idea of what is true and not becomes a little
10768880	10771840	even mentioning the word truth in that context. It feels
10771840	10779440	divisive. Yeah, I completely agree with you, which is strange. You think it shouldn't.
10779440	10785120	One of the really good opening questions that I've had work to my advantage when talking with
10785120	10790400	people who I know disagree with me about a contentious topic is how do you think we would
10790400	10798400	figure out X? And it often gets people thinking first collaboratively. And obviously we might
10798400	10802560	have very different opinions. But with something like the COVID lab leak, I think it's an interesting
10802560	10807520	one. Because if you say, okay, maybe it leaked, maybe it didn't. How would we figure that out?
10807520	10812240	Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count? Now we're kind of on the
10812240	10818720	same team. And then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for a capital T truth together
10818720	10823200	or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky. But in some conversations, I've actually had success with
10823760	10829360	that. And then you can kind of realize if there's no amount of evidence that's going to prove
10829360	10834720	a show to you that you're wrong in your current opinion, that that's probably a really bad sign
10834720	10838720	for you. It's a waste. It may be a waste to pursue the conversation further at that point.
10840720	10845760	So, okay, you think Trump was a good president. How do you determine that? And what evidence
10845760	10850160	might exist that would change your mind? There is no evidence. Trump was the best president ever.
10850160	10851680	I think the conversation is probably done.
10851680	10853120	Except Abraham Lincoln.
10855040	10859440	You mentioned Israel-Palestine. Well, what do you think about the situation in Israel-Palestine?
10859440	10863920	Something you've thought about, spoken about for quite a time. Do you think we'll ever see peace
10863920	10868720	in this part of the world? I don't know. I mean, I could say yes.
10868720	10869840	That's an honest answer.
10869840	10877360	I could say yes. One of the problems is, and I'll give, you may not know that
10878320	10883760	there are people on the left of my audience who call me a Netanyahu shill,
10884400	10890000	even though I've never been a supporter of Netanyahu and I'm on the left. I just don't think
10890000	10897920	that some of the kind of black and white characterizations about Israel are even remotely
10897920	10903520	accurate. And I think most people, it's become a sort of litmus test. Are you criticizing Israel
10903520	10906960	enough? Are you showing us that you're actually left-wing? I don't do any of that stuff.
10906960	10909200	I should really look at the situation for what it is.
10909200	10914160	That's become a litmus test in American politics, in the spectrum of American politics.
10914160	10925200	Yes. My view, big picture, is that I don't think we're going to really get anywhere
10926080	10933680	until some pre-negotiated terms are set and the parties to do the negotiating
10934240	10939200	are all good faith parties. For example, I don't think Israel's right-wing party,
10939200	10946240	Likud, is a particularly good faith arbiter of peace because I think Likud benefits from
10946240	10951600	their not being peace and the threat of violence. And there is violence. It's not just the threat
10951600	10957680	of violence. I don't think Hamas is going to be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people
10957680	10962880	either. I think the Palestinian Authority is a question mark. I'm not sure. So I think that
10962960	10968800	there need to be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything from
10968800	10976320	settlements to a lot of this minutia. Big picture, though, if I imagine what the most likely solution
10976320	10980240	looks like, it doesn't mean it's a perfect solution. And obviously, it's a solution many people will
10980240	10986480	say it's not going to happen. I think it's a solution where the borders are similar to what
10986480	10993600	was being discussed in the Clinton era to some degree. As many of the settlements as possible
10993600	10998800	have to go, understanding that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go. And there's going
10998800	11004800	to have to be meaningful land swaps with which Yasser Arafat seemed to be amenable to when he
11004800	11011680	weighed in on it. I believe it was in the 90s. The topic of the Temple Mount and Jerusalem,
11012080	11019360	is a complicated one. But I think that almost certainly East Jerusalem is going to have to be
11019360	11025520	part of an eventual Palestinian state. We can go as far as we want to with a lot of this stuff.
11025520	11030880	What role does U.S. have to play in this coming to the table with good faith parties?
11030880	11036960	I don't know whether I go back and forth between believing that the U.S. should play a big role,
11037520	11044560	to the U.S. should play essentially no role whatsoever. Because, of course, of the funding
11044560	11052480	of Israel that the U.S. provides, it's not that I have a personal problem with American involvement
11052480	11056880	and somebody like Bill Clinton was arguably relatively well positioned to try to make something
11056880	11062880	happen. Will it be seen as credible on the global stage? And that's, I think, the most
11062880	11067920	important thing. Because at the end of whatever negotiation takes place, both sides need to agree
11067920	11073440	that this is where we are renouncing all past claims. And in the future, if there's a disagreement,
11073440	11077680	we can't go back to that thing from the 80s or the 90s. That's just like a critical piece of this.
11077680	11086480	Yeah. It has to be stable and materialized into something stable over years.
11086720	11096240	Yes. Another difficult conflict going on in the world is the war in Ukraine. What do you think
11096240	11102560	about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022? I don't pretend to be an expert on this
11102560	11106960	issue. I think you probably know more about this than I do, just from the brief conversation we
11106960	11113680	had before we started filming. My view as a general observer of geopolitics and the way that
11114640	11120480	this part of the world is related to American presidents over the last several cycles is I
11120480	11126320	don't think it's controversial to say that this was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression,
11126320	11137360	an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin. I do believe that if Trump had been re-elected,
11138320	11143040	Putin may have seen himself as having other tools with which to try to
11144480	11150800	expand influence that may have been different than geographic pursuits, geographic pursuits.
11151680	11159680	But we don't know that for sure. I also have a really hard time imagining what the end of this
11159680	11169840	looks like. That's very scary because sometimes the most benign end seems to be that Putin ends
11169840	11178800	up out of power either through no longer being alive or deposed in some way. It doesn't feel like
11178800	11183520	that latter is super likely. The former, there's reports about his health. I don't know how accurate
11183520	11191280	they are. It's just hard to imagine a face-saving exit that is going to be even remotely...
11192800	11198640	What's the word? It's not even a question of acceptable. It's not satisfying either. Just
11198640	11204320	not tragic, I guess is what I'm looking for. In terms of Putin speaking to the Russian
11204320	11209680	people and being able to figure out what to say, what kind of narrative to say why this word made
11209680	11217440	sense. Yes. The same with the Ukrainian side to figure out how to exit this war. Yes. I mean,
11217440	11224160	to some degree, it requires Russian troops leaving Ukraine and that is somewhat under the
11224160	11231520	control. Of course, it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues. But what I
11231520	11238480	am not thrilled with are some of the reflexive... If Trump had been in power instead of Joe Biden,
11239440	11248000	a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, if you say Ukraine is just acting defensively,
11248000	11251920	you're supporting neo-Nazis or some of these things that have come out of the American
11251920	11257520	Republican Party seem both wacky and like they would be saying completely different things if
11257520	11261840	Trump happened to be in the Oval Office. They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden.
11262640	11267200	Well, that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of political litmus test
11268240	11272560	of how you speak about it. I think because of the huge amount of funding that's going
11273360	11281840	from US to Ukraine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that this
11281840	11286320	topic has become politicized already. 100%. There are people like Marjorie Taylor-Green
11286320	11291440	and others saying, we should be doing nothing for Ukraine. Zelensky is a comedian and we're
11291440	11298240	supporting neo-Nazis. That's it, full stop. And you either subscribe to that or you don't. And it
11298240	11305600	very quickly becomes as partisan as so many other issues. And it's really the most disappointing
11305600	11310800	thing is that some of these issues become incredibly divisive, but they're simple. Like,
11310800	11315040	for example, a conspiracy theory that we know isn't true. It shouldn't be divisive because
11315040	11320800	it's so simple. Other issues become divisive and they are simplified, but in reality,
11320800	11325280	they're extraordinarily complex. And you lose the ability to talk about the complexity
11325280	11329280	because they're becoming partisan. Do you think there will always be war in the world?
11329920	11334400	As a bunch of folks on the subreddit that were interested in your different complex
11334400	11340240	perspectives on foreign policy. So let's talk about war. When you look at the war in Ukraine,
11342000	11346400	you look at what's going on in Israel in the past time. You look at the wars across the world.
11346400	11351440	Do you think there will always be war? As a redditor put it, is it a necessary evil
11351440	11358000	in the game of geopolitics? I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective,
11358000	11367520	which is that if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homo sapiens
11367520	11373920	that all of our differences would immediately be exposed to so insignificant, we would never fight
11373920	11379280	again and we would realize that intelligent life. And then I spoke to people who deal in space
11379280	11384560	exploration and other scientists and they all said, David, that's extraordinarily naive. There
11384560	11390000	would be a period during which this was as momentous as you're imagining and then it would become
11390000	11396640	normal and then we would go back to many of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, etc.
11396640	11405280	I think that in all likelihood, there will always be conflict between factions, whether it's what
11405280	11411280	we currently think of as war, probably not. I mean, it seems as though the tactics will evolve
11411920	11416880	and it will be less about missiles and I don't know where it's going to go. I don't know whether
11416880	11422320	it's going to become more biological or cyber or certainly something we haven't even considered yet,
11422320	11426880	but I think there will always be conflicts we would refer to in that way.
11426880	11432480	Do you agree with Chomsky on his general harsh criticism of U.S. foreign policy in war,
11433120	11438800	that many actions, military actions in the United States are criminal in nature,
11439520	11441440	almost terrorist in nature?
11441440	11449040	I am not, it's been a decade or more since I've read any Chomsky and I don't keep up with everything
11449040	11454320	that he has recently said, so I don't want to mischaracterize any of it.
11454320	11462400	In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading freedom across the world
11462400	11467680	and Chomsky takes a perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the number of civilians you kill
11467680	11471440	while doing it, it's incomparable to any other military actions across the world.
11471440	11477440	Right, so I very much disagree with those who take the view that the U.S. is this
11478400	11484720	wonderful global police force that's spreading democracy and fixing problems very, very much
11484720	11490160	wrong. I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more he frames,
11490160	11496880	he seems to frame the U.S. as a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases, and I think it's
11496880	11504480	more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the U.S. and less about uniquely negative intentions,
11505040	11508800	and so I think that would be my general disagreement with Chomsky based on stuff I
11508800	11513680	read a decade ago. Well, he says that he lives in the United States, he's an American,
11513680	11518240	and so he feels his focus of criticism should be in America, and I think that's one of the great
11518240	11525200	things about being an American and being in America is the freedom to criticize harshly.
11525200	11528320	Sure. While being a university professor, by the way,
11530400	11534000	he's basically the embodiment of why 10 years are a really valuable thing.
11534000	11541040	I agree. Whether you agree with him or not. Question from Reddit. Ask David what he plans
11541040	11546160	for his garden this year. Is this a joke or is this a- It's not a joke. I got into gardening a
11546160	11552880	few years ago. Honestly, I'm with the baby, I can't do a garden this year, and I have a lot
11552880	11558160	of travel coming up, so everything would die, but I did start to try to figure out gardening.
11558160	11563760	If you're stressed by the toxicity of the social media world, gardening is a great hobby. It really
11563760	11568800	is, but it is extraordinarily time-consuming, so I have no garden planned this year.
11569760	11577920	Other books or maybe movies in your life that had a big impact on you, you're thinking about that
11577920	11585920	diet. Has there been stuff you read? Forget about even just books like blogs or writers or
11586640	11593280	just sources of information that molded you into the intellectual,
11593920	11599680	into the political thing that you are. It's so hard. This is sort of like you
11599680	11605280	win an Oscar and you want to make sure you thank all the right people. I read so much and have
11605280	11612640	been reading for so long that it's really hard to say, but I think certainly, for me, narrative
11612640	11622160	nonfiction has been a fantastic genre to learn not only about history, but also about people and
11622160	11628080	psychology. Very often, when people say, I don't really read, what can you recommend to me that
11628080	11635360	might be interesting? Depending on knowing them to some degree, I'll give recommendations there.
11635360	11640160	In terms of just things I picked up recently that I think are interesting,
11641360	11648800	I've been reading a bunch of Neil Postman. I read a Jenny O'Dell has a new book on time and
11648800	11655840	the concept of saving time, spending time, etc. She just published it. Super interesting. I just
11655840	11664480	read Lansing's book about the Shackleton voyage in Antarctica in 1914, 15, and 16. Super interesting.
11664640	11668560	I'm really all over the map. I have that one on audiobook. I've been meaning to listen to it.
11668560	11674400	It's very interesting and it seems inconceivable how these guys survived. It's completely inconceivable
11674400	11682080	and yet they did. It kind of inspires you to think of space exploration and taking on similar
11682080	11687440	kinds of risky and dangerous journeys. In narrative nonfiction, I grew with you very much. I've been
11687440	11694160	reading a lot of 20th century history about Stalin and about Hitler. Rise and Fall of the
11694160	11700480	Third Reich. I've read twice now and I recommend it. What did you get out of reading at the second time?
11704400	11714400	So, the second time I listened to the audiobook as I ran, I get the same thing from it as I get,
11714400	11721920	maybe reading Man's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of day to day in the modern
11721920	11730480	world kind of fade away and dissipate when I'm thinking about the, you know, basically the
11730480	11737920	embodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history. So, it makes me sort of appreciate
11737920	11743040	all the, it fills me with gratitude to have all the freedoms, all the just simple joys of life that
11743040	11751600	we have today. And I think the second time I was, as I was reading it, because William Shire was there,
11751600	11755920	he's the author, he was there through the whole thing, you start to pick up little details as
11755920	11764240	opposed to like big things, you start to pick up the little quirks of how history turns and just
11764240	11770160	like these little events. You notice of the dynamics between people in a room during a meeting
11770240	11774480	with Hitler. You just notice these little things that are mentioned because he was either there
11774480	11780400	directly or heard it the next day. So, you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall, the third rank
11780400	11787840	is interesting is because it's by a guy who's there, who's reporting on it, versus a sort of a
11787840	11794080	more distant, displaced retelling. And I also like biographies, I'm a big fan of biographies.
11794640	11798720	And Walter Isaacson has just written some incredible ones. There's Steve Jobs and
11799680	11804880	Einstein, all that kind of stuff. Victor Frankel's book is one I've read a bunch of times. And it's
11804880	11809360	so short. And you know, reading in general, I know a lot of people who read way more than I do.
11809360	11813280	And I also know a lot of people who don't read at all. I mean, they haven't read a book since
11813280	11819040	college, essentially. To me, it's almost like the amount I get from it, it's almost like a secret
11819120	11824960	weapon, where when I think, you know, in two or three or 400 pages, which I can read in whatever,
11824960	11830480	10 days or however long it takes reading 30 pages a day, the amount of information
11831280	11837040	insights into so many aspects of the human psyche that I can get, it's sort of like,
11837040	11841200	it's not like I'm in a competition for anything in particular with anybody, I just do my show.
11841200	11846160	But it's sort of like, if I'm reading dozens of books a year, and you're reading zero,
11846880	11852880	I'm exposed to so many different things and ideas that are not even in your universe. It just
11852880	11858560	seems like the power of reading just seems overwhelming. I had speaking or getting attacked.
11858560	11866480	I had a fun time getting attacked a few months ago for publishing a reading list. So I'm reading
11866480	11873680	at least a book a week. I read 18 or 19 books from the beginning of the year. You got attacked for
11873680	11879520	the books you chose or for this? I don't know for what, but it became quite viral. Attacked for
11879520	11886640	reading. That's something. So basically what happened is that people, I actually don't,
11887280	11892400	it's not worth folks who know, know, fair, folks who don't, don't even worry about it.
11892400	11899280	It's the, what I really loved about being attacked for it is it shows you can get attacked for anything.
11899280	11904400	Apparently. It's, so it's not like I did something wrong. It was kind of a beautiful thing. It was
11905120	11913600	just the most intensely beautiful display of absurdity of Twitter and the internet,
11913600	11916960	that there would be, there were articles written about me with the book list.
11918640	11925120	There's no bad books on it. The thing I was being mocked for is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff
11925200	11932400	that sounds like a high school reading list. Oh, I see. Or all these kinds of aspects of the
11932400	11939440	reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of legitimate kind of criticism. But the fact that
11939440	11944400	people are just looking for single words or single aspects of a tweet and so on to criticize.
11945360	11951200	It actually forced me to, because I released a video about, you know, summarizing my take
11951200	11955680	away from, from one of the books and I've been meaning to do more and more. But every time I
11955680	11962400	start to like, want to record it, I have this negative feeling. They kind of ruin the fun
11962400	11968000	of sharing with others. I know exactly what you're talking about. My advice on that is don't do it.
11968880	11972720	Just don't record it. Yeah. Because, and, and is that what you basically, yeah.
11972720	11978160	But I, I think time cures it. But for now, I decided not to. Yes. It's just until I'm,
11978960	11984320	until I feel joy when I do it. Yeah. We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do this
11984320	11991200	sort of thing, right? I have taken on projects and then it sort of sounds good or I end up doing it
11991200	11995440	because there's some third party that brings the idea and I feel like I can't really say no or
11995440	11999840	whatever. And then when I get in front of the camera or I have to write something for a while,
11999840	12006800	I did a newspaper column that I hated doing. I realized that I'm ruining the exact thing
12006800	12011200	that I have worked to build, which is that I can just do whatever I want. Why am I doing this?
12011200	12016160	And sometimes it takes me a week to realize it. Sometimes it takes me a year, but just don't do
12016160	12021120	it. That's the, in this case in particular, it's also the, there's a private thing I enjoy, which
12021120	12028080	is reading. Right. And if sharing that private thing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it.
12028800	12035120	That that's, yeah, there's certain things, there's certain private things that should remain private.
12036000	12041440	That's like, which is one of the first things ever. I'm the same person privately as I am publicly,
12041440	12046480	but the books, it's like, man, I don't get to share. I guess through these conversations I can
12047360	12052400	share some of the stuff I'm reading and enjoying it because it sucks. It sucks to get
12052400	12056400	attacked for stuff and it sucks to get attacked for stuff you love.
12056400	12062560	Yeah, especially reading. I mean, it's, you know, that's the bottom of the barrel. I have these ideas
12062640	12068160	where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing, I'll go from politics, which is so toxic,
12068160	12072560	I'll go to travel blogging because I, there's so many travel bloggers I follow and there's
12072560	12078160	so many interesting places. And then I go, wait a second, I like traveling and just hanging out.
12078160	12082000	Now traveling is going to be my job and now I've got to bring two cameras with me and I've got to
12082000	12086000	get shots and I've got to film my food and I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to do what
12086000	12090720	I'm doing, but then I'll travel when I want to take a vacation. And of course, some of it could
12090720	12097840	be fun. I mean, I have to say when I did one video on a book in 1984, I really enjoyed it,
12097840	12105680	the whole process was fun. It was, I don't think I've ever thought as hard about a book when I
12105680	12110880	had to make a video about it because I had to like, you know, I read 1984, I don't know many times,
12110880	12119360	probably five, 10 times. I don't remember. I read Animal Farm way more. But I don't think, I was like,
12119360	12123600	what do I think about? Like what are the key takeaways for me? I didn't really know. Like
12123600	12127360	if you asked me what I think about, even Animal Farm, because I haven't done that one, and I've
12127360	12133040	read that one, I don't know, over 50 times, it's probably my favorite book is like, I would have
12133040	12138640	to struggle and making a video about it, basically a little mini lecture, forced me to actually have
12138640	12144080	an opinion about the details of it and to do enough research to think like, okay, what is the
12144080	12148960	historical context of this book? I mean, it allowed me to say interesting and to think interesting
12148960	12155040	stuff about the book. I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing,
12156000	12160960	one of the best ways to learn is to teach. Yeah, I can't think of one thing I would say
12160960	12165120	about Animal Farm. And I read it again, not that long ago, but I don't know what comment
12165120	12169440	you're gonna have. You kind of have a generic comment about like authoritarianism and so on,
12169440	12175120	whatever. Yeah. But there could be interesting quirks of the book and the characters and how
12175840	12181520	corruption happens. You could say all kinds of stuff that it may be contrasting it. Like,
12181520	12190640	even when 1984 allowed me to contrast with Brave New World and how that 1984 was politicized
12190640	12194000	and how it's used by the Republican Party of today, like you could say a lot of interesting
12194000	12197920	stuff if you like to think about it and write it down or sheet of paper, maybe you don't need to
12197920	12204480	make a video about it. So I found it to be really rewarding in general. So I probably will do more
12204560	12208560	of it. But not always. Not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging. I agree with
12208560	12213360	that. I mean, you get threatened a lot. You get attacked a lot online. Do you think about your
12213360	12218880	mortality? Well, the other day I went to the doctor and he said, you know, next physical,
12218880	12223840	we're going to be talking about a lot of new things. And so I was thinking about it a lot
12223840	12231200	that day. Yeah. No, I mean, it's funny. I recently did a bunch of estate stuff. Yeah.
12231280	12237360	And when you have intellectual property, there's a question of like, okay, I have my assets, but
12237360	12245600	also if I died tomorrow, especially in a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would probably,
12245600	12249760	for a while, generate more money because it would be like, oh my goodness, this person died in a
12249760	12254080	terrible, what happens with a future revenue stream and all these different things? And it
12254080	12259680	got me thinking about legacy and about the fact that people who do this sort of thing, it's kind
12259680	12265840	of a new thing in a sense. And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire
12265840	12272000	and someone else fills in for you, how does my career wind down given like, I don't actually
12272000	12279440	know the answer. I'm not sure. What is it? I just one day stop posting videos, but all my content
12279440	12286320	stays up, getting fewer and fewer views, or do I delete everything? Do I, I don't know. What is
12287040	12290720	I mean, so my trip to Ukraine, because I knew I was going to the front,
12290720	12297120	is the first time I did a recorded video if I die. Oh, and I posted it and I give instructions to
12298480	12304320	folks what to do. So like, there's a closure. Yeah. But it's an interesting process. Like,
12304320	12310720	what happens to your, at which point does GPT take over and continue tweeting for David Packard?
12310720	12315040	Well, the tweeting I care less about right now, unless blue becomes something unbelievable,
12315040	12319680	I'm less worried about Twitter. But some of my audience members have been saying, you know,
12319680	12326000	some of these tools, David, are getting good enough that we could clone your voice and also
12326000	12332320	make it match video. And with scripts, you could just keep pumping out content,
12332320	12336080	even if you were gone. And I said, now that I'm interested in that I want to learn more about.
12337760	12342400	Boy, it's going to be a weird future. What advice do you have to young folks
12343120	12347920	that are facing this future? Almost always, it's some version of
12349120	12354800	start right away. And that applies in so many different ways. So if you're thinking about,
12354800	12360160	oftentimes the context is people want to do what I do. And I always say, do not sit around for a
12360160	12366720	year thinking about lighting. This is how you never do anything. And I dozens of people who I
12366720	12371760	felt obligated to talk to on the phone because of a personal connection, I go through all the advice
12372400	12377760	and I can tell they're not going to do it. They just they're it's already sounding too complicated.
12377760	12381440	And so instead, they'll sort of say, well, I got to get the right lighting and the right room and
12382560	12386560	the best thing you can do no matter what you're doing is just start right away. And that applies
12386560	12390720	in this business. And in whatever else you're doing, if you want to learn a new thing, find a new
12390720	12396640	hobby, the ability to get data right away about what's working, what's not working and whether
12396640	12402320	you even like this approach that you're taking is so valuable. And it will allow you to iterate.
12402320	12406400	And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of direction will also be lower.
12407200	12411280	If there's any I don't do like self help or generic advice type stuff. But the one thing
12411280	12417360	that applies in so many situations is situations is just try it right away and iterate from there.
12418000	12423440	Yeah, start today, and then do it every day. Or decide, hey, you know what I figured out,
12423440	12429840	I don't actually want to do it. Yeah, and iterate. Yeah. Well, usually you'll discover you do.
12432240	12436160	You think we'll make it out of the century? Humanity? Human civilization?
12436160	12439840	Out of the select to 2100. Yeah, how much we got? 80 years?
12440560	12445840	Yeah, 77. I think we're going to make it. You think so? Yeah.
12445840	12448000	What are the biggest threats facing our civilization?
12448960	12458800	If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say. I actually think that if you believe
12459840	12467520	that we are on an inflection point of sorts in changes to society and acceleration of technology,
12467520	12474480	et cetera, I think it's really tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat.
12474480	12481920	So I don't know. It's so cliche to say nuclear and climate change and another pandemic.
12481920	12486720	Technologically, our world might look so different that it's almost unimaginable.
12486720	12493520	What it means to be human is unimaginable. And also, the degree that we make progress out into
12493520	12499040	space is also unimaginable. I think space is super interesting. And there's people on both
12499040	12504240	the left and right who for different reasons are kind of not into the whole space exploration thing.
12504480	12509600	The people I hear from, the ones on the right, think it's just kind of dumb. The ones on the
12509600	12515840	left think it's an excuse not to fix problems here. And also, they say it's the plaything of
12515840	12521760	billionaires, which is another funny kind of concept. Yeah, I mean, someone's got to pay for it.
12523520	12527200	Why not be people who have a lot of money to... It could either be billionaires
12527200	12534160	or governments that are trillionaires. Somebody has to pay for big, ambitious moonshot projects.
12534160	12542080	To me, the most interesting thing is that in getting closer to the next step of space exploration,
12542080	12548320	we may well learn things that can then be used to improve circumstances here. For me, it's not
12548320	12555840	one or the other. And I recently read a long piece about why not Mars, because it's terrible in
12555840	12561840	every way for supporting life. Okay, so that's one perspective. But still, in so exploring,
12562560	12567920	who knows what we might end up learning? So, I'm big on it. I don't share the view of some on
12567920	12572560	the left about it. So, I guess to add to your advice, young people, if a thing seems terrible,
12572560	12577280	you still might want to consider doing it. I would say so. Yeah. How many things have...
12577280	12586000	I mean, listen, there are so many trips where the day before, I say, why am I doing this?
12586000	12592080	The jet lag. I've got to do this and that. And now, if my guest host falls through,
12592080	12598240	I should just stay and work. And I go, hold on. You do this every time. Just go. You never
12598240	12601920	regret it. You learn something. You try something. I never regret the trip.
12604640	12609920	This hopefully applies to the conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you
12609920	12614560	so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to talk earlier.
12615520	12620560	Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective and thoughtful and
12621280	12624480	fearless on the internet. Thank you. Big fan of yours as well. I appreciate it.
12625520	12629760	Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman. To support this podcast,
12629760	12634640	please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from
12634640	12641040	Mahatma Gandhi. What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless,
12641680	12647760	whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of
12647760	12656960	liberty or democracy? Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
