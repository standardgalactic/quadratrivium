The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, his second time in the podcast.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,680
Yosha is one of the most fascinating minds in the world exploring the nature of intelligence,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,600
cognition, computation, and consciousness.

This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Yosha Bach.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,920
Thank you for once again coming on to this particular Russian program and sticking to

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,920
the theme of a Russian program.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,360
Let's start with the darkest of topics.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,560
So this is inspired by one of your tweets.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:56,640
You wrote that, quote, when life feels unbearable, I remind myself that I'm not a person.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,660
I am a piece of software running on the brain for random ape for a few decades.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,760
It's not the worst brain to run on.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,840
Have you experienced low points in your life?

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,880
Have you experienced depression?

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,440
Of course, we all experience low points in our life, and we get appalled by the things,

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,120
by the ugliness of stuff around us.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,840
We might get desperate about our lack of self-regulation, and sometimes life is hard.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,640
And I suspect you don't get to your life nobody does to get to their life without low points

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,960
and without moments where they are despairing.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,560
And I thought that let's capture this state and how to deal with that state.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,000
And I found that very often you realize that when you stop taking things personally, when

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,800
you realize that this notion of a person is a fiction, similar as it is in Westworld where

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,040
the robots realize that their memories and desires are just stuff that keeps them in

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,160
the loop, and they don't have to act on those memories and desires, that our memories and

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,680
expectations is what make us unhappy.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,520
And the present rarely does.

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,160
The day in which we are, for the most part, it's okay, right?

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,240
When we are sitting here, right here, right now, we can choose how we feel.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,920
And the thing that affects us is the expectation that something is going to be different from

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,360
what we wanted to be or the memory that something was different from what we wanted it to be.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,160
And once we basically zoom out from all this, what's left is not a person.

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,800
What's left is this state of being conscious, which is a software state.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
And software doesn't have an identity.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,960
It's a physical law.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,440
And it's a law that acts in all of us, and it's embedded in a suitable substrate.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
And we didn't pick that substrate, right?

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,080
We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,160
And they're all these individuals, and everybody has to be one of them.

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,240
And eventually, you're stuck on one of them and have to deal with that.

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,400
So you're like a leaf floating down the river.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,160
You just have to accept that there's a river, and you just float wherever there are.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,720
The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent is a construct.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,480
What part of that is actually under your control.

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,440
I think that our consciousness is largely a control model for our own attention.

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,680
So we notice where we are looking, and we can influence what we are looking,

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,880
how we are disambiguating things, how we put things together in our mind.

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,920
And the whole system that runs us is this big cybernetic motivational system.

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,840
So we're basically like a little monkey sitting on top of an elephant.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,320
And we can prod this elephant here and there to go this way or that way.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,960
And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant,

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,480
or that we are telling it what to do.

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,400
And sometimes we notice that it walks into a completely different direction.

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
And we didn't set this thing up.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,800
It just is the situation that we find ourselves in.

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,840
How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,360
A lot. But I think that our consciousness cannot create the motive force.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,320
Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?

60
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,880
No, the monkey is the consciousness.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,360
The monkey is the attentional system that is observing things.

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,360
There is a large perceptual system combined with a motivational system

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,680
that is actually providing the interface to everything and our own consciousness,

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,440
I think, is the tool that directs the attention of that system,

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,920
which means it singles out features and performs conditional operations

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,840
for which it needs an index memory.

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,680
But this index memory is what we perceive as our stream of consciousness.

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,880
But the consciousness is not in charge. That's an illusion.

69
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,320
So everything outside of that consciousness is the elephant.

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,480
So it's the physics of the universe, but it's also society that's outside of your...

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,280
I would say the elephant is the agent.

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,320
So there is an environment in which the agent is stomping.

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,440
And you are influencing a little part of that agent.

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,280
So can you, is the agent a single human being?

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,480
What's, which object has agency?

76
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,800
That's an interesting question.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,480
I think a way to think about an agent is that it's a controller with a set point generator.

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,800
The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics and control theory.

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,840
Control system consists out of a system that is regulating some value

80
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,880
and the deviation of that value from a set point.

81
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,280
And it has a sensor that measures the system's deviation from that set point

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,520
and an effector that can be parametrized by the controller.

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,760
And the goal is to reduce the distance between the set point and the current value of the system.

85
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,480
And there's an environment which disturbs the regulated system,

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
which brings it away from that set point.

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,720
So the simplest case is the thermostat.

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,120
And the thermostat is really simple because it doesn't have a model.

89
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,680
The thermostat is only trying to minimize the set point deviation in the next moment.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,800
And if you want to minimize the set point deviation over a longer time span,

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,640
you need to integrate it. You need to model what is going to happen.

92
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,560
So for instance, when you think about that your set point is to be comfortable in life,

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,440
maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first.

94
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,960
Right? So you need to make a model of what's going to happen when.

95
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,520
And this is the task of the controller is to use its sensors to measure the state of the environment

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,120
and the system that is being regulated and figure out what to do.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,640
And if the task is complex enough, the set points are complicated enough,

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,840
and if the controller has enough capacity and enough sensor feedback,

99
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,000
then the task of the controller is to make a model of the entire universe that it's in,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,240
the conditions under which it exists and of itself.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,920
And this is a very complex agent and we are in that category.

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,320
And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.

103
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,480
It's a class of models that we use to interpret aspects of the universe.

104
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,720
And when we notice the environment around us, a lot of things only make sense at the level

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,160
that should be entangled with them, if we interpret them as control systems

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,160
that make models of the world and try to minimize their own set points.

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,400
So the models are the agents?

108
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,520
The agent is a class of model. And we notice that we are an agent ourselves.

109
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,680
We are the agent that is using our own control model to perform actions.

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,320
We notice we would use a change in the model and things in the world change.

111
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,680
And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body,

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,960
that we are a situated environment and that we have a first person perspective.

113
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,120
Still don't understand what's the best way to think of which object has agency with respect

114
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,880
to human beings. Is it the body? Is it the brain? Is it the contents of the brain that has agency?

115
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,120
Like what's the actuators that you're referring to?

116
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,960
What is the controller and where does it reside?

117
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,920
Or is it these impossible things? Because I keep trying to ground it to space time,

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,680
the three-dimensional space, and the one-dimension of time.

119
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,880
What's the agent in that for humans?

120
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,680
There is not just one. It depends on the way in which you're looking at this thing,

121
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,480
in which you're framing it. Imagine that you are, say, Angela Merkel,

122
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,240
and you are acting on behalf of Germany. And you could say that Germany is the agent.

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,480
And in the mind of Angela Merkel, she is Germany to some extent,

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,400
because in the way in which she acts, the destiny of Germany changes.

125
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,480
There are things that she can change that basically affect the behavior of that nation state.

126
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,680
Okay, so it's hierarchies to go to another one of your tweets with, I think, your

127
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,040
playfully mocking Jeff Hawkins with saying his brain's all the way down.

128
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,640
So it's agents all the way down. It's agents made up of agents made up of agents.

129
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Like if Angela Merkel is Germany, and Germany's made up a bunch of people,

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,200
and the people are themselves agents in some kind of context.

131
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,520
And then people are made up of cells, each individual. So is it agents all the way down?

132
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,200
I suspect that has to be like this in a world where things are self-organizing.

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,640
Most of the complexity that we are looking at, everything in life is about self-organization.

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:27,400
So I think up from the level of life, you have agents. And below life, you rarely have agents,

135
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,680
because sometimes you have control systems that emerge randomly in nature and try to achieve

136
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,800
a set point. But they're not that interesting agents that make models. And because to make

137
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,720
an interesting model of the world, you typically need a system that is during complete.

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Can I ask you a personal question? What's the line between life and non-life? It's personal

139
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,360
because you're a life form. So what do you think in this emerging complexity, at which point,

140
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,840
does the things that are being living and have agency?

141
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,560
Personally, I think that the simplest answer there is that life is cells, because...

142
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,640
Life is what? Cells, biological cells. So it's a particular kind of principle

143
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,160
that we have discovered to exist in nature. It's modular stuff that consists out of

144
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,600
basically this DNA tape with a redried head on top of it that is able to perform arbitrary

145
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,800
computations and state transitions within the cell. And it's combined with a membrane that

146
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,000
insulates the cell from its environment. And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,360
that are in disequilibrium. And the cell is running in such a way that this disequilibrium

148
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,880
doesn't disappear. And the cell goes... If the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.

149
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,440
And it requires some things like a neck entropy extractor to maintain this disequilibrium. So

150
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,240
it's able to harvest neck entropy from its environment and keep itself running.

151
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,280
Yeah, so there's information and there's a wall to protect, to maintain this disequilibrium.

152
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,960
But isn't this very earth-centric? Like what you're referring to...

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm not making a normative notion. You could say that there are probably other things in the

154
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,760
universe that are cell-like and lifelike. And you could also call them life. But eventually,

155
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,240
it's just a willingness to find an agreement of how to use the terms. I like cells because

156
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,880
it's completely co-extensional. This is the way that we use the word even before we knew about

157
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,240
cells. So people were pointing at some stuff and saying, this is somehow animate. And this is very

158
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,480
different from the non-animate stuff. And what's the difference between the living and the dead

159
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,480
stuff? And it's mostly whether the cells are working or not. And also this boundary of life,

160
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,640
where we say that, for instance, a virus is basically an information packet that is subverting

161
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,360
the cell and not life by itself. That makes sense to me. And it's somewhat arbitrary. You could,

162
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,720
of course, say that systems that permanently maintain a disequilibrium and can self-replicate

163
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,320
are always life. And maybe that's a useful definition too. But this is eventually just

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,920
how you want to use the word. Is it so useful for conversation? But

165
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,960
is it somehow fundamental to the universe? Do you think there's an actual line to eventually

166
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,560
be drawn between life and non-life? Or is it all kind of continuum? I don't think it's a continuum,

167
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,520
but there's nothing magical that is happening. Living systems are a certain type of machine.

168
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,440
What about non-living systems? Is it also a machine? There are non-living machines. But

169
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,760
the question is at which point is a system able to perform arbitrary state transitions

170
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,360
in to make representations? And living things can do this. And of course, we can also build

171
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,880
non-living things that can do this. But we don't know anything in nature that is not a cell

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,240
and is not created by a stellar life that is able to do that.

173
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Not only do we not know, I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise.

174
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:13,160
I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly. There could be life

175
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,800
of a very different kind right under our noses that we're just not seeing because we're not

176
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,280
either limitations of our cognitive capacity or we're just not open-minded enough.

177
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,000
Either with the tools of science or just the tools of our mind.

178
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Yeah, that's possible. I find this thought very fascinating. And I suspect that many of us ask

179
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,960
ourselves since childhood, what are the things that we are missing? What kind of systems and

180
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:52,520
interconnections exist that are outside of our gaze? But we are looking for it and physics doesn't

181
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:00,280
have much room at the moment for opening up something that would not violate the conservation

182
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:08,280
of information as we know it. Yeah, but I wonder about timescale and spatial scale,

183
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:16,280
whether we just need to open up our idea of how life presents itself. It could be operating in a

184
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,640
much slower timescale, a much faster timescale. And it's almost sad to think that there's all this

185
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,040
life around us that we're not seeing because we're just not thinking in terms of the right

186
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,400
scale, both time and space. What is your definition of life? What do you understand as life?

187
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:45,880
Hmm. Entities of sufficiently high complexity that are full of surprises.

188
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't know. I don't have a free will. So that just came out of my mouth. I'm not sure

189
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,480
that even makes sense. There's certain characteristics. So complexity seems to be a

190
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:11,640
necessary property of life. And I almost want to say it has ability to do something unexpected.

191
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,680
It seems to me that life is the main source of complexity on Earth.

192
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:26,360
Yes. And complexity is basically a bridgehead that order builds into chaos by modeling,

193
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,280
by processing information in such a way that you can perform reactions that would not be possible

194
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,240
for dump systems. And this means that you can harvest like entropy that dump systems cannot

195
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,160
harvest. And this is what complexity is mostly about. In some sense, the purpose of life is to

196
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:52,280
create complexity. Yeah. Increasing complexity. There seems to be some kind of universal drive

197
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,440
towards increasing pockets of complexity. I don't know what that is. That seems to be like a

198
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,960
fundamental, I don't know if it's a property of the universe, or it's just a consequence

199
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,960
of the way the universe works. But there seems to be this small pockets of emergent complexity

200
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,800
that builds on top of each other and starts having like greater and greater complexity by

201
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,600
having like a hierarchy of complexity, like little organisms building up a little society

202
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,640
that then operates almost as an individual organism itself. And all of a sudden, you have

203
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,320
Germany and Merkel. That's not obvious to me. Everything that goes up has to come down at some

204
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:38,520
point. So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere, it's usually the beginning of an S-curve,

205
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,320
where something eventually reaches a saturation. And the S-curve is the beginning of some kind

206
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:52,120
of bump that goes down again. And there is just this thing that when you are inside of an evolution

207
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,880
of life, you are on top of a puddle of negentropy that is being sucked dry by life. And during

208
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,760
that happening, you see an increase in complexity, because life forms are competing with each other

209
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,000
to get more and more and finer and finer corner of that, like entropy extraction.

210
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,760
But that, I feel like that's a gradual, beautiful process, like that's almost,

211
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,200
follows a process akin to evolution. And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.

212
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,800
The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly. So usually there's some kind of catastrophic

213
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:38,040
event. The Roman Empire took a long time. Would that be, would you classify that as a

214
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,240
decrease in complexity, though? Yes. I think that this size of the cities that could be fed has

215
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,600
decreased dramatically. And you could see that the quality of the art decreased, and it did so

216
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,720
gradually. And maybe future generations, when they look at the history of the United States

217
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,120
in the 21st century, will also talk about the gradual decline, not something that suddenly

218
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:09,640
happens. Do you have a sense of where we are? Are we on the exponential rise?

219
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,720
Are we at the peak? Or are we at the down slope of the United States empire?

220
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,640
It's very hard to say from a single human perspective, but it seems to me that we are

221
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,840
probably at the peak. I think that's probably the definition of optimism and cynicism.

222
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,600
So my nature of optimism is, I think we're on the rise.

223
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,080
I think it's just all a matter of perspective that nobody knows. But I do think that

224
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,280
erring on the side of optimism, you need a sufficient number. You need a minimum

225
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,040
number of optimists in order to make that up thing actually work. And so I tend to be on

226
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,840
the side of the optimists. I think that we are basically a species of grasshoppers that have

227
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,480
turned into locusts. And when you are in that locust mode, you see an amazing rise of population

228
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,920
numbers and of the complexity of the interactions between the individuals. But ultimately, the

229
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,320
question is, is it sustainable? See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers that have become

230
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:24,200
domesticated cats to use a different metaphor. And so I'm not exactly sure we're so destructive,

231
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,040
we're just softer and nicer and lazier. But I think we have monkeys and not the cats. And if

232
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,880
you look at the monkeys, they are very busy. The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?

233
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,040
Not just the bonobos. I think that all the monkeys are basically a discontent species that

234
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,720
always needs to meddle. Well, the gorillas seem to have a little bit more of a structure,

235
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:54,120
but it's a different part of the tree. Okay, you mentioned the elephant and the monkey riding

236
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:03,080
the elephant. And consciousness is the monkey. And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.

237
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,720
And sometimes the elephant listens. I heard you got into some content maybe you can correct me,

238
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,000
but I heard you got into some contentious free will discussions. Is this with Sam Harris or

239
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,800
something like that? Not that I know of. Some people in clubhouse told me you made a bunch of

240
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:29,640
big debate points about free will. Well, let me just then ask you where in terms of the monkey

241
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,360
and the elephant, do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will? How much control does

242
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,880
the monkey have? We have to think about what the free will is in the first place. We are not the

243
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,600
machine. We are not the thing that is making the decisions. We are a model of that decision-making

244
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,920
process. And there is a difference between making your own decisions and predicting your

245
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:03,160
own decisions. And that difference is the first person perspective. And what basically makes

246
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,320
decision-making and the conditions of free will distinct from just automatically doing the best

247
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,400
thing is that we often don't know what the best thing is. We make decisions under uncertainty.

248
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,960
We make informed bets using a betting algorithm that we don't yet understand because we haven't

249
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,120
reverse engineered our own minds efficiently. We don't know the expected rewards. We don't

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,200
know the mechanism by which we estimate the rewards and so on. But there is an algorithm.

251
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,720
We observe ourselves performing, where we see that we weight facts and factors and the future.

252
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,360
And then some kind of possibility, some motive gets raised to an intention. And that's informed

253
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,640
bet that the system is making. And that making of the informed bet, the representation of that is

254
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,320
what we call free will. And it seems to be paradoxical because we think that the crucial

255
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,000
thing is that it's somehow indeterministic. And yet, if it was indeterministic, it would be random.

256
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,840
And it cannot be random because if it was random, if just dice were being thrown in the

257
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,640
universe randomly, forces you to do things, it would be meaningless. So the important part

258
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,920
of the decisions is always the deterministic stuff. But it appears to be indeterministic to

259
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,200
you because it's unpredictable. Because if it was predictable, you wouldn't experience it as a free

260
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,360
will decision. You would experience it as just doing the necessary right thing. And you see this

261
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,760
continuum between the free will and the execution of automatic behavior when you're observing other

262
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,560
people. So for instance, when you are observing your own children, if you don't understand them,

263
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:44,360
you will use this agent model where you have an agent with a set point generator. And the agent is

264
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,680
doing the best it can to minimize the difference to the set point. And it might be confused and

265
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,680
sometimes impulsive or whatever, but it's acting on its own free will. And when you understand

266
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,280
what happens in the mind of the child, you see that it's automatic. And you can outmodel the child,

267
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,160
you can build things around the child that will lead the child to making exactly the decision

268
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,640
that you are predicting. And under these circumstances, like when you are a stage

269
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,120
misvision, or somebody who is dealing with people that you sell a car to, and you completely

270
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,520
understand the psychology and the impulses and the space of thoughts that this individual can

271
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,280
have at that moment. Under these circumstances, it makes no sense to attribute free will.

272
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,560
Because it's no longer decision making under uncertainty. You are already certain. For them,

273
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,800
there's uncertainty, but you already know what they're doing.

274
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:40,440
But what about for you? So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata,

275
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,600
where it's deterministic? But when you squint your eyes a little bit,

276
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,440
it starts to look like there's agents making decisions at the higher sort of when you zoom

277
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,440
out and look at the entities that are composed by the individual cells, even though there's

278
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,760
underlying simple rules that make the system evolve in deterministic ways, it looks like

279
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,280
there's organisms making decisions. Is that where the illusion of free will emerges? That jump in scale.

280
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,520
It's a particular type of model, but this jump in scale is crucial. The jump in scale happens

281
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,360
whenever you have too many parts to count, and you cannot make a model at that level,

282
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,640
and you try to find some higher level regularity. And the higher level regularity is a pattern that

283
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,400
you project into the world to make sense of it. And agency is one of these patterns. You have all

284
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,680
these cells that interact with each other, and the cells in our body are set up in such a way

285
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,200
that they benefit if their behavior is coherent, which means that they act as if they were serving

286
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,200
a common goal. And that means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms that act as if

287
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,000
they were serving a common goal. And now you can make sense of all these cells by projecting the

288
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,920
common goal into them. Right. So for you, then, free will is an illusion? No, it's a model,

289
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,880
and it's a construct. It's basically a model that the system is making of its own behavior,

290
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,360
and it's the best model that it can come up with under the circumstances, and it can get replaced

291
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,520
by a different model, which is automatic behavior, when you fully understand the mechanism under

292
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,320
which you are acting. Yeah, but another word for model is what story. So it's the story you're

293
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,400
telling. I mean, do you actually have control? Is there such a thing as a you? And is there such a

294
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:41,880
thing as you having control? So like, are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?

295
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,920
In some sense, the you is the model of the system that is in control. It's a story that the system

296
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,600
tells itself about somebody who is in control. Yeah. And the contents of that model are being

297
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:00,360
used to inform the behavior of the system. Okay. So the system is completely mechanical,

298
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,960
and the system creates that story like a loom. And then it uses the contents of that story

299
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,080
to inform its actions and writes the results of that actions into the story.

300
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:19,000
So how's that non-illusion? The story is written then? Or a rather, we're not the writers of the

301
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,600
story? Yes, but we always knew that. No, we don't know that. When did we know that?

302
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,520
I think that's mostly a confusion about concepts. The conceptual illusion in our culture comes from

303
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,320
the idea that we live in physical reality, and that we experience physical reality,

304
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,040
and that you have ideas about it. And then you have this dualist interpretation where you have

305
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,840
two substances, res extensor, the world that you can touch, and that is made of extended things,

306
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,880
and res cogitans, which is the world of ideas. And in fact, both of them are mental representations.

307
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,240
One is the representations of the world as a game engine that your mind generates to make

308
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,040
sense of the perceptual data. And the other one, yes, that's what we perceive as the physical

309
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,880
world. But we already know that the physical world is nothing like that. Quantum mechanics is

310
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,480
very different from what you and me perceive as the world. The world you and me perceive is a game

311
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,280
engine. And there are no colors and sounds in the physical world that only exist in the game

312
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,680
engine generated by your brain. And then you have ideas that cannot be mapped onto extended regions.

313
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,960
So the objects that have a spatial extension in the game engine, res extensor, and the objects

314
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,800
that don't have a physical extension in the game engine are ideas. And they both interact in our

315
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:44,120
mind to produce models of the world. But when you play video games, I understand that what's

316
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:53,240
actually happening is zeros and ones inside of a computer, inside of a CPU and a GPU, but you're

317
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:01,800
still seeing like the rendering of that. And you're still making decisions whether to shoot,

318
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,520
to turn left or to turn right. If you're playing a shooter or every time you start thinking about

319
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,640
Skyrim and Elder Scrolls and walking around a beautiful nature and swinging a sword. But it

320
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,440
feels like you're making decisions inside that video game. So even though you don't have direct

321
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,640
access in terms of perception to the bits, to the zeros and ones, it still feels like you're

322
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,840
making decisions. And your decisions are actually feels like they're being applied

323
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,280
all the way down to the zeros and ones. So it feels like you have control even though you don't

324
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,720
direct access to reality. So there is basically a special character in the video game that is

325
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,360
being created by the video game engine. And this character is serving the aesthetics of the video

326
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,880
game. And that is you. Yes, but I feel like I have control inside the video game, like all those

327
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,960
like 12 year olds that kick my ass on the internet. So for when you play the video game, it doesn't

328
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,960
really matter that there's zeros and ones, right? You don't care about the vids of the bus, you don't

329
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,360
care about the nature of the CPU that it runs on. What you care about are the properties of the

330
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,640
game that you're playing. And you hope that the CPU is good enough. Yes. And a similar thing happens

331
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,880
when we interact with physics. The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.

332
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,400
The world that you and me are in is a dream world. How close is it to the real world, though?

333
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,480
We know that it's not very close, but we know that the dynamics of the dream world

334
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,920
match the dynamics of the physical world to a certain degree of resolution.

335
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,160
Right. The causal structure of the dream world is different.

336
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,080
So you see, for instance, waves crashing on your feet, right? But there are no waves in the

337
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,880
ocean. There's only water molecules that have tangents between the molecules that are

338
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,960
the result of electrons in the molecules interacting with each other.

339
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Aren't they very consistent where you're seeing a very crude approximation? Isn't our dream world

340
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,200
very consistent to the point of being mapped directly one to one to the actual physical world,

341
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,080
as opposed to us being completely tricked? This is like where you have like Donald Hock.

342
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,560
It's not a trick. That's my point. It's not an illusion. It's a form of data compression.

343
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,640
It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics of too many parts to count at the level at which

344
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,600
we are entangled with the best model that you can find. Yeah. So we can act in that dream world

345
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,200
and our actions have impact in the real world, in the physical world, to which we don't have

346
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,080
access. Yes. But it's basically like accepting the fact that the software that we live in,

347
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,960
the dream that we live in is generated by something outside of this world that you and me are in.

348
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,400
So is the software deterministic and do we not have any control?

349
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:52,520
So free will is having a conscious being. Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.

350
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,560
No. It's slightly different. Basically, in the same way as you are modeling the water molecules

351
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,360
in the ocean that engulf your feet when you are walking on the beach as waves and there are no

352
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,960
waves, but only the atoms on more complicated stuff underneath the atoms and so on. And you

353
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,880
know that, right? You would accept, yes, there is a certain abstraction that happens here. It's a

354
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,160
simplification of what happens and the simplification that is designed in such a way that your brain

355
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,280
can deal with it temporarily and spatially in terms of resources and tuned for the predictive

356
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,240
value. So you can predict with some accuracy whether your feet are going to get wet or not.

357
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,120
But it's a really good, it's a really good interface and approximation. Yes. It's like

358
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,720
e equals mc squared is a good, equations are good approximation for what they're much better

359
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,920
approximation. So to me waves is a really nice approximation of what's all the complexity

360
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,360
that's happening underneath. Basically, it's a machine learning model that is constantly tuned

361
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,920
to minimize surprises. So it basically tries to predict as well as it can what you're going to

362
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,680
perceive next. Are we talking about which is the machine learning our perception system or the dream

363
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:11,080
world? The dream world is the result of the machine learning process of the perception system.

364
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,040
That's doing the compression. Yes. And the model of you as an agent is not a different type of model

365
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:25,160
or it's a different type, but not different as in its model like nature from the model of the ocean,

366
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,680
right? Some things are oceans, some things are agents. And one of these agents is using your

367
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,320
own control model, the output of your model, the things that you perceive yourself as doing.

368
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,720
And that is you. What about the fact that is like when you're standing

369
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:52,040
with the water on your feet and you're looking out into the vast open water of the ocean and

370
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,960
then there's a beautiful sunset and the fact that it's beautiful and then maybe you have friends

371
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,000
or loved one with you and you feel love. What is that as the dream world? What is that? Yes,

372
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,360
it's all happening inside of the dream. Okay. But see the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.

373
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,560
Yeah, of course, it's not real. The physical universe is real, but the physical universe

374
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,120
is incomprehensible and it doesn't have any feeling of realness. The feeling of realness that

375
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,520
you experience gets attached to certain representations where your brain assesses,

376
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,000
this is the best model of reality that I have. So the only thing that's real to you is the

377
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,560
thing that's happening at the very base of reality. Yeah, for something to be real,

378
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:44,440
it needs to be implemented. So the model that you have of reality is real in as far as it is a

379
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,320
model, right? It's an appropriate description of the world to say that there are models that

380
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,200
are being experienced. But the world that you experience is not necessarily implemented.

381
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,560
There is a difference between a reality, a simulation and a simulacrum. The reality that

382
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,520
we're talking about is something that fully emerges over a causally close lowest layer.

383
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,680
And the idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer, that basically our world emerges

384
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,160
over that. Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory, which basically says

385
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,080
that we are in some kind of simulation universe and the real world needs to be an apparent

386
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,440
universe of that, where the actual causal structure is, right? And when you look at the ocean and

387
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,600
your own mind, you are looking at a simulation that explains what you're going to see next.

388
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,080
So we are living in a simulation. Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.

389
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,920
And this simulation is different from the physical reality because the causal structure

390
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,840
that is being produced, what you are seeing is different from the causal structure of physics.

391
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,640
But consistent.

392
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,480
Hopefully, if not, then you are going to end up in some kind of institution where people will

393
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,600
take care of you because your behavior will be inconsistent, right? Your behavior needs to work

394
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,400
in such a way that it's interacting with an accurately predictive model of reality. And

395
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,120
if your brain is unable to make your model of reality predictive, you will need help.

396
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:12,680
So what do you think about Donald Hoffman's argument that it doesn't have to be consistent,

397
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:19,400
the dream world, to what he calls like the interface to the actual physical reality,

398
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,960
where there could be evolution. I think he makes an evolutionary argument, which is like,

399
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,840
it could be an evolutionary advantage to have the dream world drift away from physical reality.

400
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,280
I think that only works if you have tenure. As long as you're still interacting with the

401
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,320
ground tools, your model needs to be somewhat predictive.

402
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,720
Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure in the animal kingdom.

403
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Yeah. At some point, we became too big to fail. So we became postmodernist.

404
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,680
It all makes sense now.

405
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,040
It's a version of reality that we like.

406
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,760
Oh, man. Okay.

407
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,440
Yeah, but basically, you can do magic. You can change your assessment of reality,

408
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,760
but eventually, reality is going to come by to you in the ass if it's not predictive.

409
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:15,480
Do you have a sense of what is that base layer of physical reality? You have these attempts

410
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,880
at the theories of everything, the very, very small of like string theory, or what

411
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,440
Stephen Wolfram talks about with the hypergrass. These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects,

412
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,840
and then there is more like quantum mechanics that's talking about objects that are much larger,

413
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,600
but still very, very, very tiny. Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is that is like

414
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,240
at the lowest level, the turtle at the very bottom? Do you have a sense?

415
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,680
I don't think that you can talk about where it is because space is emergent over the activity

416
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:59,560
of these things. So coordinates only exist in relation to other things. And so you could,

417
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,200
in some sense, abstract it into locations that can hold information and trajectories

418
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,880
that the information can take between the different locations. And this is how we

419
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:14,920
construct our notion of space. And physicists usually have a notion of space that is continuous.

420
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,880
And this is a point where I tend to agree with people like Stephen Wolfram, who are very skeptical

421
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,400
of the geometric notions. I think that geometry is the dynamics of too many parts to count. And

422
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,120
when there are no infinities, if there were two infinities, you would be running into contradictions,

423
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,080
which is in some sense what Gödel and Turing discovered in response to Hilbert's call.

424
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,240
There are no infinities. There are no infinities. There is unboundedness. But if you have a language

425
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,920
that talks about infinity, at some point, the language is going to contradict itself,

426
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,960
which means it's no longer valid. In order to deal with infinities and mathematics,

427
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,480
you have to postulate the existence initially. You cannot construct the infinities. And that's

428
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,680
an issue. You cannot build up an infinity from zero. But in practice, you never do this. When

429
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,360
you perform calculations, you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count. And usually,

430
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,840
these numbers are not that large. They're not Googles or something. The infinities that we are

431
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:24,280
dealing with in our universe are, mathematically speaking, relatively small integers. And still,

432
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:32,120
what we're looking at is dynamics, where a trillion things behave similar to 100 trillion

433
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:39,960
things or something that is very, very large because they're converging. And these converging

434
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,120
dynamics, these operators, this is what we deal with when we are doing the geometry.

435
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,440
The geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it's continuous, because if we subdivide the

436
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,000
space sufficiently, fine-grained, these things approach a certain dynamic. And this approached

437
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,760
dynamic, that is what we mean by it. But I don't think that infinity would work, so to speak,

438
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,720
that you would know the last digit of pi and that you have a physical process that rests on knowing

439
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,040
the last digit of pi. Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk of human cognition that we like

440
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,720
discrete. Discrete makes sense to us. Infinity doesn't. So in terms of our intuitions.

441
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,840
No, the issue is that everything that we think about needs to be expressed in some kind of mental

442
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,040
language, not necessarily natural language, but some kind of mathematical language that your

443
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,880
neurons can speak, that refers to something in the world. And what we have discovered is that

444
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,160
we cannot construct a notion of infinity without running into contradictions, which means that

445
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,920
such a language is no longer valid. And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy when

446
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,000
somebody came up with the notion of irrational numbers before it was time, right? There's this

447
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,160
myth that he had this person killed when he blabbed out the secret that not everything can be

448
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,960
expressed as a ratio between two numbers, but there are numbers between the ratios. The world

449
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,960
was not ready for this. And I think he was right that has confused mathematicians very seriously

450
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,480
because these numbers are not values, they are functions. And so you can calculate these functions

451
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,120
to a certain degree of approximation, but you cannot pretend that pi has actually a value.

452
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Pi is a function that would approach this value to some degree,

453
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,560
but nothing in the world rests on knowing pi.

454
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,880
How important is this distinction between discrete and continuous

455
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,560
for you to get to the bottom? Because there's a, I mean,

456
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,360
in discussion of your favorite flavor of the theory of everything, there's a few on the table.

457
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,120
So there's string theory, there's a particular, there's a loop quantum gravity,

458
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:56,280
which focuses on one particular unification. There's just a bunch of favorite flavors of

459
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:03,880
different people trying to propose a theory of everything. Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people

460
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,840
throughout history. And then of course, Stephen Wolfram, who I think is one of the only people

461
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,800
doing a discrete. No, no, there's a bunch of physicists who do this right now. And

462
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:23,800
Topoli and Tomasello and the digital physics is something that is, I think, growing in popularity.

463
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:34,520
But the main reason why this is interesting is because it is important sometimes to settle

464
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,840
disagreements. I don't think that you need infinities at all and you never needed them.

465
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,320
You can always deal with very large numbers and you can deal with limits, right? You are

466
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,640
fine with doing that. You don't need any kind of affinity. You can build your computer algebra

467
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,000
systems just as well without believing in infinity in the first place.

468
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,120
So you're okay with limits?

469
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,920
Yeah. So basically a limit means that something is behaving pretty much the same if you make the

470
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,720
number larger, right? Because it's converging to a certain value and at some point the difference

471
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,760
becomes negligible and you can no longer measure it. And in this sense, you have things that

472
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,600
if you have an n-gon which has enough corners, then it's going to behave like a circle at some

473
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,800
point, right? And it's only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing that cannot exist in a

474
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,000
physical universe that you would be talking about this perfect circle. And now it turns out that

475
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,160
it also wouldn't work in mathematics because you cannot construct mathematics that has infinite

476
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,160
resolution without running into contradictions. So that is itself not that important because

477
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,720
we never did that, right? It's just a thing that some people thought we could. And this leads to

478
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,400
confusion. So for instance, Roger Penrose uses this as an argument to say that there are certain

479
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,280
things that mathematicians can do dealing with infinities and by extension our mind can do

480
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,080
that computers cannot do.

481
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:02,200
Yeah, he talks about that the human mind can do certain mathematical things that the computer

482
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,840
has defined by the universal Turing machine cannot. So that it has to do with infinity.

483
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,280
Yes, it's one of the things. So he is basically pointing at the fact that there are things that

484
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:24,120
are possible in the mathematical mind and in pure mathematics that are not possible in machines that

485
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,800
can be constructed in the physical universe. And because he is an honest guy, he thinks this

486
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,760
means that present physics cannot explain operations that happen in our mind.

487
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,680
Do you think he's right? So let's leave his discussion of consciousness aside for the moment.

488
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,280
Do you think he's right about just what he's basically referring to as intelligence? So

489
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,880
is the human mind fundamentally more capable as a thinking machine than a universal Turing machine?

490
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:01,240
No. So he's suggesting that, right? So our mind is actually less than a Turing machine. There can

491
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,840
be no Turing machine because it's defined as having an infinite tape and we always only have a finite

492
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,960
tape. But he's saying it's better. Or minds can only perform finitely many operations. He can do

493
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,960
the kind of computation that the Turing machine cannot. And that's because he thinks that our

494
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:22,440
minds can do operations that have infinite resolution in some sense. And I don't think

495
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,920
that's the case. Our minds are just able to discover these limit operators over too many

496
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:37,400
parts to count. What about his idea that consciousness is more than a computation?

497
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,720
So it's more than something that a Turing machine can do. So again, saying that there's

498
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,560
something special about our mind, they cannot be replicated in the machine.

499
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:55,240
The issue is that I don't even know how to construct a language to express this statement

500
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:08,120
correctly. Well, the basic statement is there's a human experience that includes intelligence,

501
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,960
that includes self-awareness, that includes the hard problem of consciousness. And the question is,

502
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,840
can that be fully simulated in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer,

503
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:30,600
as we understand it today? Roger Prenos says no. So the universal Turing machine cannot

504
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,440
simulate the universe. So the interesting question is, and you have to ask him this, is why not?

505
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,200
What is this specific thing that cannot be modeled? And when I looked at his writings,

506
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,040
and I haven't read all of it, but when I read, for instance, the section that he writes in the

507
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,760
introduction and wrote to infinity, the thing that he specifically refers to is the way in which

508
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:01,800
human minds deal with infinities. And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed.

509
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,480
A lot of people feel that our experience cannot be explained in a mechanical way.

510
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,600
And therefore, it needs to be different. And I concur, our experience is not mechanical. Our

511
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,480
experience is simulated. It exists only in assimilation. The only assimilation can be

512
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,960
conscious. Physical systems cannot be conscious because they're only mechanical. Cells cannot

513
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,040
be conscious. Neurons cannot be conscious. Brains cannot be conscious. People cannot be

514
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,880
conscious as far as you, if you understand them as physical systems. What can be conscious is

515
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,600
the story of the system in the world where you write all these things into the story.

516
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,480
You have experiences for the same reason that a character and novel have experiences because

517
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:49,240
it's written into the story. And now the system is acting on that story. And it's not a story that

518
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,560
is written in a natural language. It's written in a perceptual language, in this multimedia

519
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,240
language of the game engine. And in there, you write in what kind of experience you have,

520
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,840
and what this means for the behavior of the system, for your behavior tendencies,

521
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,920
for your focus, for your attention, for your experience of valence and so on. And

522
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,480
this is being used to inform the behavior of the system in the next step. And then the

523
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,640
story updates with the reactions of the system and the changes in the world and so on.

524
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,240
And you live inside of that model. You don't live inside of the physical reality.

525
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:30,680
And I mean, just to linger on it, like, you see, okay, it's in the perceptual language,

526
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:36,840
the multimodal perceptual language, that's the experience. That's what consciousness is within

527
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:45,160
that, within that model, within that story. But do you have agency? When you play a video game,

528
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:51,000
you can turn left and you can turn right in that story. So in that dream world,

529
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,200
how much control do you have? Is there such a thing as you in that story?

530
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,680
Like, is it right to say the main character, you know, everybody's NPCs, and then there's the main

531
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:08,600
character, and you're controlling the main character? Or is that an illusion? Is there a main

532
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,320
character that you're controlling? I'm getting to the point of like, the free will point.

533
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:19,160
Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer. And you've been to MIT computer science,

534
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:25,080
you basically know how to do that. Right. And so you would say the robot is an agent that solves

535
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,680
the control problem. How to get the ball into the goal. And it needs to perceive the world and

536
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,000
the world is disturbing him in trying to do this. Right. So he has to control many variables to make

537
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,040
that happen and to project itself and the ball into the future and understand its position on

538
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:46,040
the field relative to the ball and so on in the position of its limbs or in the space around it

539
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,280
and so on. So it needs to have an adequate model that abstracting reality in a useful way.

540
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,320
And you could say that this robot does have agency over what it's doing in some sense.

541
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,320
And the model is going to be a control model. And inside of that control model, you can

542
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,320
possibly get to a point where this thing is sufficiently abstract to discover its own agency.

543
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,000
Our current robots don't do that. They don't have a unified model of the universe.

544
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But there's not a reason why we shouldn't be getting there at some point in the

545
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,400
not too distant future. And once that happens, you will notice that the robot tells a story about

546
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:30,600
the robot playing soccer. So the robot will experience itself playing soccer in a simulation

547
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:37,320
of the world that it uses to construct a model of the locations of its legs and limbs in space on

548
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,400
the field with relationship to the ball. And it's not going to be at the level of the molecules.

549
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:47,320
It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level that is most suitable for past planning

550
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,280
of the movements of the robot. It's going to be a high level abstraction, but a very useful one

551
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,400
that is as predictive as we can make it. And in that side of that story, there is a model of

552
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:04,680
the agency of that system. So this model can accurately predict that the contents of the model

553
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,760
are going to be driving the behavior of the robot in the immediate future.

554
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:16,120
But there's the hard problem of consciousness, which I would also, there's a subjective experience

555
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:22,520
of free will as well, that I'm not sure where the robot gets that where that little leap is.

556
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,080
Because for me right now, everything I imagine with that robot, as it gets more and more and

557
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:35,000
more sophisticated, the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still of what was programmed

558
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,200
in. You would probably do an end to end learning system. You maybe need to give it a few priors,

559
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,200
so you nudge the architecture in the right direction that it converges more quickly.

560
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,320
But ultimately, discovering the suitable hyperparameters of the architecture is also only a

561
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:55,240
search process, right? And as the search process was evolution, it has informed our brain architecture

562
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,200
so we can converge in a single lifetime on useful interaction with the world and the formation of

563
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:06,280
the problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly, so it's not just the parameters that

564
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,680
control this end to end learning system, but the entirety of the design of the robot.

565
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,240
You have to remove the human completely from the picture and then in order to build the robot,

566
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,520
you have to create an entire universe because you have to go, you can't just shortcut evolution,

567
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,760
you have to go from the very beginning in order for it to have, because I feel like there's always

568
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:34,280
a human pulling the strings and that makes it seem like the robot is cheating, it's getting a

569
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,520
shortcut to consciousness. And you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots, it doesn't

570
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,760
look as if there is somebody pulling the strings, it doesn't look like cheating anymore. Okay, so

571
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,000
let's go there because I got to talk to you about this. So obviously with the case of Boston Dynamics,

572
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:54,440
as you may or may not know, it's always either hard coded or remote controlled. There's no

573
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,000
intelligence. So I don't know how the current generation of Boston Dynamics robots works,

574
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,440
but what I've been told about the previous ones was that it's basically all cybernetic control,

575
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:11,000
which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on, but it's not deep learning for the most

576
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,840
part as it's currently done. It's for the most part just identifying a control hierarchy

577
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,480
that is congruent to the limbs that exist and the parameters that need to be optimized for

578
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,560
the movement of these limbs. And then there is a convergence progress. So it's basically just

579
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,560
regression that you would need to control this. But again, I don't know whether that's true. That's

580
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,360
just what I've been told about how that works. We have to separate several levels of discussions

581
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,840
here. So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control with no machine learning

582
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:48,040
in order to maintain balance or to write itself. It's a control problem in terms of

583
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,560
using the actuators to when it's pushed or when it steps on a thing that's uneven,

584
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,040
how to always maintain balance. And there's a tricky heuristics around that, but

585
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,600
that's the only goal. Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing in terms of that to us humans

586
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:11,800
is compelling, which is any kind of higher order movement like turning, wiggling its butt,

587
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:21,640
like jumping back and it's two feet dancing. Dancing is even worse because dancing is hard

588
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:29,080
coded in. It's choreographed by humans. There's choreography software. So there is no, of all

589
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,800
that high level movement, there's no anything that you can call, certainly can't call AI.

590
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:44,360
There's no even like basic heuristics. It's all hard coded in. And yet we humans immediately

591
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:52,520
project agency onto them, which is fascinating. So the gap here is it doesn't necessarily have

592
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,320
agency. What it has is cybernetic control. And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy

593
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:02,600
of feedback loops that keep the behavior in certain boundaries so the robot doesn't fall over and it's

594
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,800
able to perform the movements. And the choreography cannot really happen with motion capture,

595
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,400
because the robot would fall over because the physics of the robot, the weight distribution

596
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,480
and so on is different from the weight distribution in the human body. So if you were using the

597
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,960
directly motion captured movements of a human body to project it into this robot, it wouldn't

598
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,960
work. You can do this with a computer animation that will look a little bit off, but who cares.

599
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,200
But if you want to correct for the physics, you need to basically tell the robot where it should

600
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:38,200
move, its limbs. And then the control algorithm is going to approximate a solution that makes

601
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,960
it possible within the physics of the robot. And you have to find the basic solution for

602
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,000
making that happen. And there's probably going to be some regression necessary to get the control

603
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,280
architecture to make these movements. But those two layers are separate. So the thing,

604
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,640
the higher level instruction of how you should move and where you should move is the higher

605
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,200
level. I expect that the control level of these robots at some level is dumb. This is just the

606
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,720
physical control movement, the motor architecture. But it's a relatively smart motor

607
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,640
architecture. It's just that there is no high level deliberation about what decisions to make

608
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,400
necessarily. But it doesn't feel like free will or consciousness. No, that was not where I was

609
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:26,200
trying to get to. I think that in our own body, we have that too. So we have a certain thing that

610
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,520
is basically just a cybernetic control architecture that is moving our limbs.

611
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,280
And deep learning can help in discovering such an architecture if you don't have it in the first

612
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,400
place. If you already know your hardware, you can maybe handcraft it. But if you don't know your

613
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,920
hardware, you can search for such an architecture. And this work already existed in the 80s and 90s,

614
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,160
people were starting to search for control architectures by motor babbling and so on and

615
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:57,480
just use reinforcement learning architectures to discover such a thing. And now imagine that you

616
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,640
have the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you. And you extend this a little bit.

617
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:10,760
So you are seeking output, for instance, or rest or and so on. And you get to have a baby at some

618
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:17,160
point. And now you add more and more control layers to this. And the system is reverse

619
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:23,000
engineering its own control architecture and builds a high level model to synchronize the

620
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,120
pursuit of very different conflicting goals. And this is how I think you get to purposes.

621
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,760
Purposes are models of your goals. The goals may be intrinsic as the result of the different

622
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:38,120
set point violations that you have, hunger and thirst for very different things and rest and

623
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:43,080
pain avoidance and so on. And you put all these things together and eventually you need to come

624
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:49,240
up with a strategy to synchronize them all. And you don't need just to do this alone by yourself

625
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,040
because we are state building organisms. We cannot function as an isolation the way that

626
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,800
Homo sapiens is set up. So our own behavior only makes sense when you zoom out very far

627
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:06,440
into a society or even into ecosystemic intelligence on the planet and our place in it.

628
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,760
So the individual behavior only makes sense in these larger contexts. And we have a number of

629
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,040
priors built into us. So we are behaving as if we are acting on these high level goals pretty

630
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,480
much right from the start. And eventually in the course of our life, we can reverse engineer the

631
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,840
goals that we are acting on what actually are our higher level purposes. And the more we understand

632
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,360
that the more our behavior makes sense. But this is all at this point, complex stories within stories

633
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:39,160
that are driving our behavior. Yeah, I just don't know how big of a leap it is to start

634
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,600
creating a system that's able to tell stories within stories.

635
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,560
Like how big of a leap that is from where currently Boston Dynamics is

636
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:57,000
or any robot that's operating in the physical space. And that leap might be big if it requires

637
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,840
to solve the hard problem of consciousness, which is telling a hell of a good story.

638
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,200
I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple. What's hard is perception

639
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,320
and the interface between perception and reasoning.

640
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:16,440
There's, for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior that would be built into such a system by

641
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:24,920
Yoshua Bengio. And what he describes, and I think that's accurate, is that our own

642
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,200
model of the world can be described through something like an energy function. The energy

643
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,080
function is modeling the contradictions that exist within the model at any given point. And you try

644
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,360
to minimize these contradictions, the tangents in the model. And to do this, you need to sometimes

645
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,560
test things. You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground. You need to distinguish

646
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,400
whether this is true or that is true. And so on. Eventually, you get to an interpretation,

647
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,520
but you will need to manually depress a few points in your model to let it snap into a state that

648
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,680
makes sense. And this function that tries to get the biggest dip in the energy function in your

649
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,480
model, according to Yoshua Bengio, is related to consciousness. It's a low dimensional

650
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,040
discrete function that tries to maximize this dip in the energy function.

651
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:15,480
Yeah, I think I would need to get into details because I think the way he uses the word consciousness

652
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:21,560
is more akin to self-awareness, like modeling yourself within the world, as opposed to the

653
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:27,160
subjective experience, the hard problem. No, it's not even the self within the world. The self is

654
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,560
the agent and you don't need to be aware of yourself in order to be conscious. The self is

655
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:37,080
just a particular content that you can have, but you don't have to have. But you can be conscious

656
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,200
in, for instance, a dream at night or during a meditation state where you don't have a self,

657
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,800
where you're just aware of the fact that you are aware. And what we mean by consciousness

658
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:54,920
and colloquial sense is largely this reflexive self-awareness, that we become aware of the

659
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,160
fact that we are paying attention, that we are the thing that pays attention.

660
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:06,600
We are the thing that pays attention. I don't see the awareness that we're aware.

661
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,960
The hard problem doesn't feel like it's solved. It's called a hard problem for a reason,

662
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,360
because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.

663
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,360
Yeah, I think the major leap is to understand how it is possible that a machine can dream,

664
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,920
that a physical system is able to create a representation, that a physical system is acting

665
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,600
on and that is spun force and so on. But once you accept the fact that you are not in physics,

666
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,560
but that you exist inside of the story, I think the mystery disappears. Everything is possible

667
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,720
in a story. You exist inside the story. Your consciousness is being written into the story.

668
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,720
The fact that you experience things is written to the story. You ask yourself,

669
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,240
is this real what I'm seeing? And your brain writes into the story, yes, it's real.

670
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:01,640
So what about the perception of consciousness? So to me, you look conscious. So the illusion

671
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:07,640
of consciousness, the demonstration of consciousness, I ask for the legged robot,

672
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:13,560
how do we make this legged robot conscious? So there's two things that maybe you can tell me

673
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:20,440
if they're neighboring ideas. One is actually making conscious and the other is make it appear

674
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:28,600
conscious to others. Are those related? Let's ask from the other direction, what would it take to

675
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:36,120
make you not conscious? So when you are thinking about how you perceive the world, can you decide

676
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:43,800
to switch from looking at qualia to looking at representational states? And it turns out you

677
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:49,480
can. There is a particular way in which you can look at the world and recognize its machine

678
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,760
nature, including your own. And in that state, you don't have that conscious experience in this way

679
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:03,000
anymore. It becomes apparent as a representation. Everything becomes opaque. And I think this

680
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,440
thing that you recognize everything as a representation, this is typically what we

681
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:13,240
mean with enlightenment states. And you can have a motivational level, but you can also do this on

682
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:18,280
the experiential level and the perceptual level. See, but then I can come back to a conscious state.

683
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:29,240
Okay, I particularly, I'm referring to the social aspect that the demonstration of consciousness

684
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:37,240
is a really nice thing at a party when you're trying to meet a new person. It's a nice thing to

685
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:43,320
know that they're conscious and they can, I don't know how fundamental consciousness is in human

686
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:50,200
interaction, but it seems like to be at least an important part. And I asked that in the same kind

687
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:58,440
of way for robots, you know, in order to create a rich, compelling human robot interaction, it

688
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,720
feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness within that interaction.

689
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:08,680
My cat is obviously conscious. And so my cat can do this party trick. She also knows that I am

690
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:13,640
conscious. We are able to have feedback about the fact that we are both acting on models of our

691
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:21,400
own awareness. The question is, how hard is it for the robot artificially created robot to achieve

692
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:29,000
cat level in party tricks? Yes. So the issue for me is currently not so much on how to build a system

693
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,760
that creates a story about a robot that lives in the world, but to make an adequate representation

694
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:42,440
of the world. And the model that you and me have is a unified one. It's one where you basically

695
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,000
make sense of everything that you can perceive every feature in the world that enters your

696
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,080
perception can be relationally mapped to a unified model of everything. And we don't have an AI that

697
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:58,760
is able to construct such a unified model yet. So you need that unified model to do the party trick?

698
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,200
Yes, I think that it doesn't make sense if this thing is conscious, but not in the same universe

699
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,640
because you could not relate to each other. So what's the process, would you say, of engineering

700
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:17,800
consciousness in a machine? What are the ideas here? So you probably want to have some kind of

701
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,320
perceptual system. This perceptual system is a processing agent that is able to track sensory

702
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:29,400
data and predict the next frame and the sensory data from the previous frames of the sensory

703
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,600
data in the current state of the system. So the current state of the system is in perception

704
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,720
instrumental to predicting what happens next. And this means you build lots and lots of functions

705
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,840
that take all the blips that you feel on your skin and that you see on your retina or that you hear

706
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:51,080
and puts them into a set of relationships that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data,

707
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,960
what kind of sensor of blips, your vector of blips, you're going to perceive in the next frame.

708
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:00,920
This is tuned and it's constantly tuned until it gets as accurate as it can.

709
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:08,440
You build a very accurate prediction mechanism that is step one of the perceptions. At first,

710
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,640
you predict, then you perceive and see the error in your prediction.

711
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,880
And you have to do two things to make that happen. One is you have to build a network of

712
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:22,200
relationships that are constraints, that take all the variants in the world, put each of the

713
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:27,880
variances into a variable that is connected with relationships to other variables.

714
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,720
And these relationships are computable functions that constrain each other. So when you see a

715
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,120
nose that points in a certain direction in space, you have a constraint that says there

716
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,280
should be a phase nearby that has the same direction. And if that is not the case,

717
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,560
you have some kind of contradiction that you need to resolve because it's probably not a

718
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:48,600
nose what you're looking at. It just looks like one. So you have to reinterpret the data and

719
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,720
until you get to a point where your model converges.

720
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:57,400
And this process of making the sensory data fit into your model structure is what

721
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,960
Piaget calls the assimilation. And echomodation is the change of the models

722
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,000
where you change your model such a way that you can assimilate everything.

723
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,280
So you're talking about building a hell of an awesome perception system

724
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,960
that's able to do prediction and perception correct and improving.

725
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:22,040
Wait, there's more. Yes, there's more. So the first thing that we wanted to do is we want to

726
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,920
minimize the contradictions in the model. And of course, it's very easy to make a model in which

727
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,320
you minimize the contradictions just by allowing that it can be in many, many possible states.

728
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:36,360
Right? So if you increase degrees of freedom, you will have fewer contradictions. But you also

729
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,600
want to reduce the degrees of freedom because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty. You want

730
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:46,600
your model to reduce uncertainty as much as possible. But reducing uncertainty is expensive.

731
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:52,440
So you have to have a trade-off between minimizing contradictions and reducing uncertainty.

732
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,640
And you have only a finite amount of compute and experimental time and effort available to

733
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:03,160
reduce uncertainty in the world. So you need to assign value to what you observe. So you need

734
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,200
some kind of motivational system that is estimating what you should be looking at and what you

735
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,960
should be thinking about it, how you should be applying your resources to model what that is.

736
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,760
Right? So you need to have something like convergence links that tell you how to get

737
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,680
from the present state of the model to the next one. You need to have these compatibility links

738
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:27,320
that tell you which constraints exist and which constraint violations exist. And you need to have

739
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,720
some kind of motivational system that tells you what to pay attention to. So now we have a second

740
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,280
agent next to the perceptual agent. We have a motivational agent. This is a cybernetic system

741
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,160
that is modeling what the system needs, what's important for the system, and that interacts

742
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:46,120
with the perceptual system to maximize the expected reward. And you're saying the motivational system

743
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:52,840
is some kind of, like, what is it, a high-level narrative over some lower level? No, it's just

744
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,320
your brainstem stuff, the limbic system stuff that tells you, okay, now you should get something

745
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,920
to eat because I've just measured your geo blood sugar. So you mean the motivational system,

746
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,400
like the lower level stuff, like Hungary? Yes. But there's basically a physiological

747
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,840
needs and some cognitive needs and some social needs, and they all interact. And they're all

748
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,920
implemented at different parts in your nervous system as the motivational system. But they're

749
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,520
basically cybernetic feedback loops. It's not that complicated. It's just a lot of code. And

750
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,520
so you now have a motivational agent that makes your robot go for the ball or that makes your warm

751
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:30,040
go to eat food and so on. And you have the perceptual system that lets it predicts the

752
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:34,760
environment so it's able to solve that control problem to some degree. And now what we learned

753
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,520
is that it's very hard to build a machine learning system that looks at all the data

754
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,800
simultaneously to see what kind of relationships could exist between them. So you need to

755
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,280
selectively model the world. You need to figure out, where can I make the biggest difference

756
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,000
if I would put the following things together? Sometimes you find a gradient for that, right?

757
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
When you have a gradient, you don't need to remember where you came from. You just follow

758
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,320
the gradient until it doesn't get any better. But if you have a world where the problems are

759
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:07,240
discontinuous and the search spaces are discontinuous, you need to retain memory of what you explored.

760
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:13,000
You need to construct a plan of what to explore next. And this thing that means that you have

761
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,840
next to this perceptual construction system and the motivational cybernetics,

762
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:23,320
an agent that is paying attention to what it should select at any given moment to maximize

763
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:29,000
reward. And this scanning system, this attention agent is required for consciousness. And

764
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,440
consciousness is its control model. So it's the index memories that this thing retains when it

765
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:43,080
manipulates the perceptual representations to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts and

766
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:47,960
it to increase coherence. So the purpose of consciousness is to create coherence in your

767
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:53,320
perceptual representations, remove conflicts, predict the future, construct counterfactual

768
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:58,680
representations so you can coordinate your actions and so on. And in order to do this,

769
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:03,240
it needs to form memories. These memories are partial binding states of the working memory

770
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:08,920
contents that are being revisited later on to backtrack, to undo certain states to look for

771
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:14,200
alternatives. And these index memories that you can recall, that is what you perceive as your

772
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:19,320
stream of consciousness. And being able to recall these memories, this is what makes you conscious.

773
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,440
If you could not remember what you paid attention to, you wouldn't be conscious.

774
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,480
So consciousness is the index in the memory database. Okay.

775
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:38,040
But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness a little further. So we usually

776
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,040
relate suffering to consciousness. So the capacity to suffer.

777
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,640
I think to me, that's a really strong sign of consciousness, is a thing that can suffer.

778
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:58,440
How is that useful? Suffering. And like in your model, what you just described,

779
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:03,480
which is indexing of memories, and what is the coherence with the perception,

780
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:10,040
with this predictive thing that's going on in the perception, how does suffering relate to any of

781
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,760
that, the higher level of suffering that humans do?

782
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:23,320
Basically, pain is a reinforcement signal. Pain is a signal that one part of your brain

783
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:28,200
sends to another part of your brain, or an abstract sense, part of your mind sends to

784
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,520
another part of the mind to regulate its behavior, to tell it the behavior that you're

785
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:38,920
currently exhibiting should be improved. And this is a signal that I tell you to move away

786
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,920
from what you're currently doing and push into a different direction. So pain gives you a part

787
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:50,760
of you an impulse to do something differently. But sometimes this doesn't work, because the

788
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,800
training part of your brain is talking to the wrong region. Or because it has the wrong model

789
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,400
of the relationships in the world, maybe you're mismodeling yourself or you're mismodeling the

790
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,800
relationship of yourself to the world or you're mismodeling the dynamics of the world. So you're

791
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,520
trying to improve something that cannot be improved by generating more pain. But the system

792
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,880
doesn't have any alternative. So it doesn't get better. What do you do if something doesn't get

793
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,600
better and you want it to get better? You increase the strengths of the signal. And when the signal

794
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,320
becomes chronic, when it becomes permanent, without a change inside, this is what we call suffering.

795
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,640
And the purpose of consciousness is to deal with contradictions, with things that cannot be resolved.

796
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:35,640
The purpose of consciousness, I think, is similar to a conductor in an orchestra. When everything

797
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,680
works well, the orchestra doesn't need much of a conductor as long as it's coherent. But when

798
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:46,120
there is a lack of coherence or something is consistently producing disharmony and mismatches,

799
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:51,080
then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it. So suffering attracts the activity

800
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:56,600
of our consciousness. And the purpose of that is ideally that we bring new layers online,

801
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:03,400
new layers of modeling that are able to create a model of the dysregulation so we can deal with it.

802
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:09,240
And this means that we typically get higher level consciousness, so to speak. We get some

803
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,640
consciousness above our pay grade, maybe, if we have some suffering early in our life. Most of the

804
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,880
interesting people had trauma early on in their childhood. And trauma means that you are suffering

805
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:25,320
an injury for which the system is not prepared, which it cannot deal with, which it cannot insulate

806
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,760
itself from. So something breaks. And this means that the behavior of the system is permanently

807
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:38,600
disturbed in a way that some mismatch exists now in a regulation that just by following your

808
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,920
impulse, by following the pain in the direction where it hurts, your situation doesn't improve

809
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:49,480
but get worse. And so what needs to happen is that you grow up. And that part that is grown up

810
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,160
is able to deal with the part that is stuck in this earlier phase.

811
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:57,720
Yeah, so it leads to growth, adding extra layers to your cognition.

812
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:03,560
Let me ask you then, because I gotta stick on suffering, the ethics of the whole thing.

813
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:12,360
So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others. You've tweeted, one of my biggest fears

814
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,680
is that insects could be conscious. The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable.

815
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:30,520
So when we think of other conscious beings, is suffering a property of consciousness that we're

816
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:42,680
most concerned about? So I'm still thinking about robots, how to make sense of other non-human things

817
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:52,760
that appear to have the depth of experience that humans have. And to me, that means consciousness

818
01:14:52,760 --> 01:15:00,680
and the darkest side of that, which is suffering, the capacity to suffer. And so I started thinking,

819
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:06,920
how much responsibility do we have for those other conscious beings? That's where the

820
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:14,600
the definition of consciousness becomes most urgent. Like having to come up with the definition of

821
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:21,160
consciousness becomes most urgent, is who should we and should we not be torturing?

822
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,960
There's no general answer to this. Was Chinggis Khan doing anything wrong?

823
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,080
It depends on how you look at it. Well, he drew a line somewhere

824
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:44,680
where this is us and that's them. It's the circle of empathy. You don't have to use the word consciousness,

825
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:51,240
but these are the things that matter to me if they suffer or not, and these are the things that

826
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:56,680
don't matter to me. Yeah, but when one of his commanders failed him, he broke his spine and

827
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:03,080
let him die in a horrible way. And so in some sense, I think he was indifferent to suffering.

828
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:09,240
Or he was not indifferent in the sense that he didn't see it as useful if he inflicted suffering.

829
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:15,320
But he did not see it as something that had to be avoided. That was not the goal.

830
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:21,160
The question was, how can I use suffering and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals

831
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:28,200
from his perspective? I see. So like different societies throughout history put different value

832
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:34,520
on the different individuals, different psychies, but also even the objective of avoiding suffering.

833
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:42,600
Some societies probably, I mean, this is where religious belief really helps that after life,

834
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,720
that doesn't matter that you suffer or die. What matters is you suffer honorably,

835
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:54,280
right? So that you enter the afterlife. It seems to be superstitious to me. Basically,

836
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:02,120
beliefs that assert things for which no evidence exists are incompatible with sound epistemology.

837
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,040
And I don't think that religion has to be superstitious. Otherwise, it should be condemned

838
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,200
in all cases. You're somebody who's saying, we live in a dream world, we have zero evidence for

839
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:16,760
anything. It's not the case. They are limits to what languages can be constructed. Mathematics

840
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:23,160
breaks solid evidence for its own structure. And once we have some idea of what languages exist

841
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:28,200
and how a system can learn and what learning itself is in the first place, and so on, we can

842
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:35,080
begin to realize that our intuitions, that we are able to learn about the regularities of the world

843
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,600
and minimize surprise and understand the nature of our own agency to some degree of abstraction,

844
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:47,000
that's not an illusion. So useful approximation. Just because we live in a dream world doesn't

845
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,840
mean mathematics can't give us a consistent glimpse of physical, of objective reality.

846
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,640
We can basically distinguish useful encodings from useless encodings. And when we apply our

847
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:06,680
truths seeking to the world, we know we usually cannot find out whether a certain thing is true.

848
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,240
What we typically do is we take the state vector of the universe, separate it into

849
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,800
separate objects that interact with each other, so interfaces. And this distinction that we are

850
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,960
making is not completely arbitrary. It's done to optimize the compression that we can apply

851
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:27,160
to our models of the universe. So we can predict what's happening with our limited resources.

852
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:32,360
In this sense, it's not arbitrary. But the separation of the world into objects that are

853
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:37,400
somehow discrete and interacting with each other is not the true reality. The boundaries

854
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:42,040
between the objects are projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected, but still,

855
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,080
it's only an approximation of what's actually the case.

856
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,200
And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions when we try to understand

857
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:55,880
high-level things like economic aspects of the world and so on, or political aspects or

858
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:00,200
psychological aspects where we make simplifications. And the objects that we are using to separate

859
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:06,120
the world are just one of many possible projections of what's going on. And so it's not in this

860
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,200
postmodernist sense completely arbitrary, and you're free to pick what you want or dismiss

861
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:15,320
what you don't like because it's all stories. No, that's not true. You have to show for every model

862
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,320
of how well it predicts the world. So the confidence that you should have in the

863
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,080
entities of your models should correspond to the evidence that you have.

864
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:33,320
Can I ask you in a small tangent to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people,

865
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:44,440
which is postmodernism? What is postmodernism? How would you define it? And why, to you,

866
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:51,560
is it not a useful framework of thought? Postmodernism is something that I'm really

867
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:59,000
not an expert on. And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas that is difficult to lump

868
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:06,280
together, that is characterized by some useful thinkers, some of them poststructuralists and so

869
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:11,720
on. And I'm mostly not interested in it because I think that it's not leading me anywhere that I

870
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:17,880
find particularly useful. It's mostly, I think, born out of the insight that the ontologies

871
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:23,000
that we impose on the world are not literally true, and that we can often get to a different

872
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,400
interpretation by the world by using a different ontology that is different separation of the

873
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:34,280
world into interacting objects. But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories that are

874
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:40,600
arbitrary, I think, is wrong. And the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy

875
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:45,480
are working in an area that I largely don't find productive. There is nothing useful coming out of

876
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:51,080
this. So this idea that truth is relative is not something that has in some sense informed physics

877
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:57,000
or theory of relativity. And there is no feedback between those. There is no meaningful influence

878
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,920
of this type of philosophy on the sciences or on engineering or on politics. But there is a very

879
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:11,240
strong information of this on ideology, because it basically has become an ideology that is

880
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:18,120
justifying itself by the notion that truth is a relative concept. And it's not being used in such

881
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:24,600
a way that the philosophers or sociologists that take up these ideas say, oh, I should doubt my

882
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,760
own ideas, because maybe my separation of the world into objects is not completely valid. And I

883
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:35,320
should maybe use a different one and be open to a pluralism of ideas. But it mostly exists to dismiss

884
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:42,040
the ideas of other people. It becomes a political weapon of sorts to achieve power.

885
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:50,520
Basically, there's nothing wrong, I think, with developing a philosophy around this. But to develop

886
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:56,520
norms around the idea that truth is something that is completely negotiable is incompatible

887
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:03,720
with the scientific project. And I think if the academia has no defense against the ideological

888
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:11,400
parts of the postmodernist movement, it's doomed. Right. You have to acknowledge the ideological

889
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:17,160
part of any movement, actually, including postmodernism. Well, the question is what an ideology

890
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:23,960
is. And to me, an ideology is basically a viral memeplex that is changing your mind in such a way

891
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,760
that reality gets warped. It gets warped in such a way that you're being cut off from the rest of

892
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,960
human thought space. And you cannot consider things outside of the range of ideas of your own

893
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,520
ideology as possibly true. Right. So, I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology that

894
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:46,440
make it harmful. One of them is that dogmatism of just certainty, dogged certainty in that you're

895
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,600
you have the truth and nobody else does. Yeah. But what is creating this certainty? It's very

896
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,800
interesting to look at the type of model that is being produced. Is it basically just a strong

897
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,760
prior? And you tell people, oh, this idea that you consider to be very true, the evidence for this

898
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:05,320
is actually just much weaker than you thought and look here at some studies. No, this is not how it

899
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:12,760
works. It's usually normative, which means some thoughts are unthinkable because they would change

900
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:19,320
your identity into something that is no longer acceptable. And this cuts you off from considering

901
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:25,000
an alternative. And many de facto religions use this trick to lock people into a certain mode of

902
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,720
thought. This removes agency over your own thoughts. And it's very ugly to me. It's basically

903
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:36,200
not just a process of domestication, but it's actually an intellectual castration that happens.

904
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,600
It's an inability to think creatively and to bring forth new thoughts.

905
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:49,960
Can I ask you about substances, chemical substances that affect the video game,

906
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:58,760
the dream world? So psychedelics that increasing have been getting a lot of research done on them.

907
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:05,160
So in general psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA, but also a really interesting one, the big one,

908
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:11,000
which is DMT. What and where are the places that these substances take

909
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:18,120
the mind that is operating in the dream world? Do you have an interesting sense how this

910
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:25,000
throws a wrinkle into the prediction model? Is it just some weird little quirk? Or is there

911
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,680
some fundamental expansion of the mind going on?

912
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:37,240
I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics is that they induce particular types of lucid dreaming

913
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:44,520
states. So it's a state in which certain connections are being severed in your mind and no longer

914
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,880
active. Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction because some inhibition,

915
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:55,240
some particular inhibition doesn't work anymore. And as a result, you might stop having yourself

916
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:03,800
or you might stop perceiving the world as three-dimensional. And you can explore that state.

917
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,840
And I suppose that for every state that can be induced with psychedelics, there are people that

918
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:14,200
are naturally in that state. So sometimes psychedelics that shift you through a range of

919
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:19,000
possible mental states. And they can also shift you out of the range of permissible mental states

920
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
that is where you can make predictive models of reality. And what I observe in people that

921
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,080
use psychedelics a lot is that they tend to be overfitting. Overfitting means that you are

922
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:39,560
using more bits for modeling the dynamics of a function than you should. And so you can fit

923
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:44,360
your curve to extremely detailed things in the past, but this model is no longer predictive

924
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:51,000
for the future. What is it about psychedelics that forces that? I thought it would be the opposite.

925
01:25:51,320 --> 01:26:02,200
I thought it's a good mechanism for generalization, for regularization. So it feels like psychedelics

926
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:09,480
expansion of the mind, like forcing your model to be non-predictive is a good thing.

927
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:17,640
Meaning like it's almost like, okay, what I would say is psychedelics I akin to is traveling to a

928
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:22,760
totally different environment. Like going if you've never been to like India or something like that

929
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:27,720
from the United States. Very different set of people, different culture, different food, different

930
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:34,440
roads and values and all those kinds of things. So psychedelics can for instance teleport people

931
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:41,240
into a universe that is hyperbolic, which means that if you imagine a room that you are in,

932
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,240
you can turn around 360 degrees and you didn't go full circle. You need to go

933
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:50,760
20 degrees to go full circle. Exactly. So the things that people learn in that state

934
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,640
cannot be easily transferred in this universe that we are in. It could be that if they're able

935
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:01,000
to abstract and understand what happened to them, that they understand that some part of their spatial

936
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,200
cognition has been desynchronized and has found a different synchronization. And this different

937
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:10,280
synchronization happens to be a hyperbolic one, right? So you learn something interesting about

938
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,520
your brain. It's difficult to understand what exactly happened, but we get a pretty good idea

939
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,400
once we understand how the brain is representing geometry. Yeah, but doesn't give you a fresh

940
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:29,880
perspective on the physical reality? Who's making that sound? Is it inside my head or is it external?

941
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:37,560
Well, there is no sound outside of your mind, but it's making sense. Phenomenal physics.

942
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:46,200
Yeah, in the physical reality, there's sound waves traveling through air. Okay.

943
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,360
That's our model of what happened. That's our model of what happened. Right.

944
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,520
Don't second-hand, let's give you a fresh perspective on this physical reality.

945
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,600
Like, not this physical reality, but this more...

946
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,800
What do you call the dream world that's mapped directly to it?

947
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,240
The purpose of dreaming at night, I think, is data augmentation.

948
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,400
Exactly. So that's very different. That's very similar to second-hand.

949
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:24,040
Exchange parameters about the things that you have learned. And for instance, when you are young,

950
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,600
you have seen things from certain perspectives, but not from others. So your brain is generating

951
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:33,720
new perspectives of objects that you already know, which means they can learn to recognize them

952
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:38,280
later from different perspectives. And I suspect that's the reason why many of us remember to have

953
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:41,880
flying dreams as children, because it's just different perspectives of the world that you

954
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:48,440
already know, and that it starts to generate these different perspective changes, and then it

955
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,920
fluidly turns this into a flying dream to make sense of what's happening. So you fill in the

956
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:58,200
gaps, and suddenly you see yourself flying. And similar things can happen with semantic

957
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,400
relationships. So it's not just spatial relationships, but it can also be the

958
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:07,320
relationships between ideas that are being changed. And it seems that the mechanisms that make that

959
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:16,360
happen during dreaming are interacting with these same receptors that are being simulated by psychedelics.

960
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:23,160
So I suspect that there is a thing that I haven't read really about, the way in which dreams are

961
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:28,680
induced in the brain. It's not just that the activity of the brain gets tuned down because

962
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:34,200
you are somehow, your eyes are closed and you no longer get enough data from your eyes. But there

963
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:40,040
is a particular type of neurotransmitter that is saturating your brain during these phases,

964
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:45,880
during the RM phases, and you produce controlled hallucinations. And psychedelics

965
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:52,760
are linking into these mechanisms, I suspect. So isn't that another trickier form of data

966
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:59,720
augmentation? Yes. But it's also data augmentation that can happen outside of the specification

967
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,320
that your brain is tuned to. So basically, people are overclocking their brains,

968
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:08,440
and that produces states that are subjectively extremely interesting.

969
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:12,840
Yeah, I just... But from the outset, very suspicious.

970
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:18,200
So I think I'm over-applying the metaphor of a neural network in my own mind, which

971
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:26,040
I just think that doesn't lead to overfitting, right? But you were just sort of anecdotally

972
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,360
saying my experiences with people that have no psychedelics are that kind of quality.

973
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:34,360
I think it typically happens. So if you look at people like Timothy Leary,

974
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:40,120
and he has written beautiful manifestos about the effect of LSD on people,

975
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,880
he genuinely believed, he writes on these manifestos, that in the future,

976
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:48,120
science and art will only be done on psychedelics because it's so much more efficient and so much

977
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:54,440
better. And he gave LSD to children in this community of a few thousand people that he

978
01:30:54,440 --> 01:31:01,000
had near San Francisco. And basically, he was losing touch with reality. He did not

979
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,520
understand the effects that the things that he was doing would have on the reception of psychedelics

980
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:11,000
by society because he was unable to think critically about what happened. What happened

981
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,520
was that he got in a euphoric state. That euphoric state happened because he was overfitting.

982
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:22,520
He was taking this sense of euphoria and translating it into a model of actual success

983
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:28,760
in the world. He was feeling better. Limitations had disappeared that he experienced to be

984
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,360
existing, but he didn't get superpowers. I understand what you mean by overfitting now.

985
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,400
There's a lot of interpretation to the term overfitting in this case,

986
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:44,280
but I got you. So he was getting positive rewards from a lot of actions that he shouldn't have.

987
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:49,480
But not just this. So if you take, for instance, John Lilly, who was studying dolphin languages

988
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:54,680
and aliens and so on, a lot of people that used psychedelics became very loopy.

989
01:31:54,680 --> 01:32:00,840
And the typical thing that you notice when people are on psychedelics is that they are in a state

990
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:05,800
where they feel that everything can be explained now. Everything is clear. Everything is obvious.

991
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:12,520
And sometimes they have indeed discovered a useful connection, but not always. Very often

992
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:19,400
these connections are over interpretations. I wonder, there's a question of correlation

993
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:25,480
versus causation. And also, I wonder if it's the psychedelics or if it's more the social,

994
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:32,280
like being the outsider and having a strong community of outside and having a leadership

995
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:38,120
position in an outsider cult-like community, that could have a much stronger effect of overfitting

996
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,320
than do psychedelics themselves, the actual substances, because it's a counterculture thing.

997
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:48,680
So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance. If you're a boring person who wears

998
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:54,600
a suit and tie and works at a bank and takes psychedelics, that could be a very different

999
01:32:54,600 --> 01:33:00,760
effect of psychedelics on your mind. I'm just sort of raising the point that the people you

1000
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:06,200
referenced are already weirdos. I'm not sure exactly. No, not necessarily. A lot of the people that

1001
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:13,960
tell me that they use psychedelics in a useful way started out as squares and were liberating

1002
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,360
themselves because they were stuck. They were basically stuck in local optimum of their own

1003
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:23,240
self-model, of their relationship to the world, and suddenly they had data augmentation. They

1004
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:28,440
basically saw an experience, a space of possibilities. They experienced what it would be like to be

1005
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,560
another person. And they took important lessons from that experience back home.

1006
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:44,040
Yeah. I mean, I love the metaphor of data augmentation because that's been the primary

1007
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:50,680
driver of self-supervised learning in the computer vision domain is data augmentation. So it's funny

1008
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:58,280
to think of data augmentation, like chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.

1009
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:05,800
There's also a very interesting effect that I noticed. I know several people who

1010
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:14,440
sphere to me that LSD has cured their migraines. So severe cluster headaches or migraines that

1011
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,800
didn't respond to standard medication that disappeared after a single dose. And I don't

1012
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:25,640
recommend anybody doing this, especially not in the US where it's illegal. And there are no studies

1013
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:31,000
on this for that reason. But it seems that anecdotally that it basically

1014
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:37,960
can reset the serotonergic system. So it's basically pushing them outside of their normal

1015
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,680
boundaries. And as a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium and then some people that

1016
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:47,720
equilibrium is better. But it also follows that in other people, it might be worse. So

1017
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:54,040
if you have a brain that is already teetering on the boundary to psychosis, it can be permanently

1018
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:57,720
pushed over that boundary. Well, that's why you have to do good science, which they're starting

1019
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,480
to do on all these different substances of how it actually works for the different conditions

1020
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:09,400
like MDMA seems to help with PTSD. Same with psilocybin. You need to do good science, meaning

1021
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:15,240
large studies of large N. Yeah. So based on the existing studies with MDMA, it seems that

1022
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,360
if you look at Rick Doblin's work and what he has published about this and talks about

1023
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:26,200
MDMA seems to be a psychologically relatively safe drug, but it's physiologically not very

1024
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:32,280
safe. That is, there is neurotoxicity if you would use a too large dose. And if you

1025
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,960
combine this with alcohol, which a lot of kids do in party settings during raves and so on,

1026
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:44,280
it's very hepatotoxic. So basically, you can kill your liver. And this means that it's probably

1027
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:49,320
something that is best and most productively used in clinical setting by people who really know

1028
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:53,880
what they're doing. And I suspect that's also true for the other psychedelics. That is,

1029
01:35:54,680 --> 01:36:01,080
while the other psychedelics are probably not as toxic as say alcohol, the effects on Nisaki

1030
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:07,000
can be much more profound and lasting. Yeah. Well, as far as I know psilocybin, so mushrooms,

1031
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,560
magic mushrooms, as far as I know in terms of the studies they're running, I think have no over,

1032
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:18,920
like they're allowed to do what they're calling heroic doses. So that one does not have a toxicity.

1033
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:23,480
So they can do like huge doses in a clinical setting when they're doing study on psilocybin,

1034
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:29,160
which is kind of fun. Yeah, it seems that most of the psychedelics work in extremely small doses,

1035
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:35,560
which means that the effect on the rest of the body is relatively low. And MDMA is probably the

1036
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:40,440
exception. Maybe ketamine can be dangerous and larger doses because it can depress breathing and

1037
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:47,160
so on. But the LSD and psilocybin work in very, very small doses, at least the active part of them

1038
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:54,280
of psilocybin LSD is only the active part. And the, but the effect that it can have on

1039
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:59,320
your mental wiring can be very dangerous, I think. Let's talk about AI a little bit.

1040
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:07,080
What are your thoughts about GPT-3 and language models trained with self-supervised learning?

1041
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,400
It came out quite a bit ago, but I wanted to get your thoughts on it. Yeah.

1042
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:20,520
In the 90s, I was in New Zealand and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten,

1043
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:27,640
who realized I was bored in class and put me in his lab. And he gave me the task to discover

1044
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:33,720
grammatical structure in an unknown language. And the unknown language that I picked was English

1045
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:39,640
because it was the easiest one to find a corpus four construct one. And he gave me the largest

1046
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:44,600
computer at the whole university. It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing. And I wrote

1047
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:51,000
everything in C with some in-memory compression to do statistics over the language. And I first

1048
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,920
would create a dictionary of all the words, which basically tokenizes everything and compresses

1049
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:02,920
things so that I don't need to store the whole word, but just a code for every word. And then I

1050
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:09,480
was taking this all apart in sentences. And I was trying to find all the relationships between

1051
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:15,080
all the words in the sentences and do statistics over them. And that proved to be impossible,

1052
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:20,360
because the complexity is just too large. So if you want to discover the relationship

1053
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:24,360
between an article and a noun, and there are three adjectives in between, you cannot do

1054
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:29,240
n-gram statistics and look at all the possibilities that can exist, at least not with the resources

1055
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:34,120
that we had back then. So I realized I need to make some statistics over what I need to make

1056
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:41,080
statistics over. So I wrote something that was pretty much a hack that did this for at least

1057
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:45,400
first-order relationships. And I came up with some kind of mutual information graph that was

1058
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:50,440
indeed discovering something that looks exactly like the grammatical structure of the sentence,

1059
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:54,840
just by trying to encode the sentence in such a way that the words would be written in the

1060
01:38:54,840 --> 01:39:02,520
optimal order inside of the model. And what I also found is that if we would be able to increase

1061
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:08,840
the resolution of that and not just use this model to reproduce grammatically correct sentences,

1062
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,480
we would also be able to correct stylistically correct sentences by just having more bits in

1063
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:17,720
these relationships. And if we wanted to have meaning, we would have to go much higher order.

1064
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:23,320
And I didn't know how to make higher order models back then without spending way more years in

1065
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:29,800
research on how to make the statistics over what we need to make statistics over. And this thing

1066
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:34,040
that we cannot look at the relationships between all the bits in your input is being solved in

1067
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:40,440
different domains in different ways. So in computer graphics, the computer vision standard method

1068
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,680
for many years now is convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks are

1069
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,880
hierarchies of filters that exploit the fact that neighboring pixels in images are usually

1070
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,520
semantically related and distance pixels in images are usually not semantically related.

1071
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,000
So you can just by grouping the pixels that are next to each other,

1072
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,680
hierarchically together reconstruct the shape of objects. And this is an important prior that

1073
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:09,880
we built into these models so they can converge quickly. But this doesn't work in language for

1074
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:15,480
the reason that adjacent words are often but not always related and distant words are sometimes

1075
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:21,720
related while the words in between are not. So how can you learn the topology of language?

1076
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:28,840
And I think for this reason that this difficulty existed, the transformer was invented in

1077
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:35,800
natural language processing not in vision. And what the transformer is doing, it's a hierarchy

1078
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:41,480
of layers where every layer learns what to pay attention to in the given context in the previous

1079
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:50,760
layer. So what to make the statistics over. And the context is significantly larger than the adjacent

1080
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:58,440
word. Yes. So the context that GP3 has been using, the transformer itself is from 2017,

1081
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:04,920
and it wasn't using that large of a context. OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea

1082
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:12,760
as far as they could at the time. And the context is about 2048 symbols, tokens in the language.

1083
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:18,120
These symbols are not characters, but they take the words and project them into a vector space.

1084
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:23,880
Words that are statistically co-occurring a lot are neighbors already. So it's already a

1085
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:29,160
simplification of the problem a little bit. And so every word is basically a set of coordinates

1086
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:34,760
in a high dimensional space. And then they use some kind of trick to also encode the order

1087
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:41,240
of the words in a sentence or in the not just sentence, but 2048 tokens is about couple pages

1088
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:46,760
of text or two and a half pages of text. And so they managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics

1089
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:51,880
over the potential relationships between two pages of text, which is tremendous, right? I was

1090
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:58,840
just using a single sentence back then. And I was only looking for first order relationships. And

1091
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,200
they were really looking for much, much higher level relationships. And what they discover

1092
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,920
after they've fed this with an enormous amount of trim linear pretty much the written internet

1093
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:14,520
or the subset of it that had some quality, but substantial portion of the common flaw

1094
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:20,360
that they're not only able to reproduce style, but they're also able to reproduce some

1095
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:25,400
pretty detailed semantics, like being able to add three digit numbers and multiply two

1096
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,480
digit numbers or to translate between pro and languages and things like that.

1097
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:34,120
So the results that GBT3 got, I think were amazing.

1098
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:39,560
By the way, I actually didn't check carefully. It's funny you just mentioned

1099
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:46,040
how you coupled semantics to the multiplication. Is it able to do some basic math and two digit

1100
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:52,440
numbers? Yes. Okay, interesting. I thought, I thought there's a lot of failure cases.

1101
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,720
Yeah, it basically fails if you take larger digit numbers. So four digit numbers and so on

1102
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:03,320
makes carrying mistakes and so on. And if you take large, larger numbers, you don't get useful

1103
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:11,560
results at all. And this could be an issue of the training set, but not many examples of success

1104
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:18,040
for long form addition and standard human written text. And humans aren't very good at doing three

1105
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:23,720
digit numbers either. Yeah, they're not, you're not writing a lot about it. And the other thing

1106
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:27,960
is that the loss function that is being used is only minimizing surprises. So it's predicting what

1107
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:32,920
comes next in a typical text. It's not trying to go for causal closure first as we do.

1108
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:42,680
Yeah. But the fact that that kind of prediction works to generate text that's semantically rich

1109
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:47,320
and consistent is interesting. Yeah. So yeah, so it's amazing that it's able to

1110
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,000
generate semantically consistent text. It's not consistent. So the problem is that it loses

1111
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:59,640
coherence at some point. But it's also, I think not correct to say that GPT-3 is unable to deal

1112
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:04,840
with semantics at all, because you ask it to perform certain transformations in text and it

1113
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:10,040
performs these transformations in text. And the kind of additions that it's able to perform are

1114
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:16,280
transformations in text, right? And there are proper semantics involved. You can also do more.

1115
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:23,240
There was a paper that was generating lots and lots of mathematically correct text

1116
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:29,960
and was feeding this into a transformer. And as a result, it was able to learn how to do

1117
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,920
differentiation integration in race that according to the authors, matematica could not.

1118
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,320
To which some of the people in matematica responded that they were not using the

1119
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,840
matematica in the right way and so on. I have not really followed the

1120
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:50,040
resolution of this conflict. This part, as a small tangent, I really don't like

1121
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:58,200
in machine learning papers, which they often do anecdotal evidence. They'll find like one example

1122
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:03,080
in some kind of specific use of matematica and demonstrate, look, here's, they'll show successes

1123
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:09,000
and failures, but they won't have a very clear representation of how many cases this actually

1124
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,600
represents. Yes, but I think as a first paper, this is a pretty good start. And so the take-home

1125
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:21,480
message, I think, is that the authors could get better results from this in their experiments

1126
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:25,800
than they could get from the vein, which they were using computer algebra systems,

1127
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:33,720
which means that was not nothing. And it's able to perform substantially better than GPTS-V can,

1128
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:38,920
based on a much larger amount of training data, using the same underlying algorithm.

1129
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:48,280
Let me ask, again, so I'm using your tweets as if this is like Play-Doh, as if this is

1130
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:55,480
well thought out novels that you've written. You tweeted, GPT-4 is listening to us now.

1131
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:05,320
This is one way of asking, what are the limitations of GPT-3 when it scales? So what do you think

1132
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:11,720
will be the capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-5, and so on? What are the limits of this approach?

1133
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:16,680
So obviously, when we are writing things right now, everything that we are writing now is going

1134
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:21,080
to be training data for the next generation of machine learning models. So yes, of course,

1135
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:26,760
GPT-4 is listening to us. And I think the tweet is already a little bit older. And we now have

1136
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:33,400
Vudao and we have a number of other systems that basically are placeholders for GPT-4.

1137
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,880
I don't know what open AIS plans are in this regard.

1138
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:42,200
I read that tweet in several ways. So one is obviously everything you put on the

1139
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:50,280
internet has used this training data. But in a second way, I read it is in a, we talked about

1140
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:57,320
agency. I read it is almost like GPT-4 is intelligent enough to be choosing to listen.

1141
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:03,560
So not only like did a programmer tell it to collect this data and use it for training,

1142
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:09,000
I almost saw the humorous angle, which is like it has achieved AGI kind of thing.

1143
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,920
Well, the thing is, could VB already be living in GPT-5?

1144
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:20,680
So GPT-4 is listening and GPT-5 actually constructed the entirety of the reality?

1145
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:25,800
Of course, in some sense, what everybody is trying to do right now in AI is to extend the

1146
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:32,280
transformer to be able to deal with video. And there are very promising extensions, right?

1147
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:39,640
There's a work by Google that is called Perceiver and that is overcoming some of the limitations

1148
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:44,280
of the transformer by letting it learn the topology of the different modalities separately

1149
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:51,960
and by training it to find better input features. So the basically feature abstractions that are

1150
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:59,800
being used by this successor to GPT-3 are chosen such a way that it's able to deal with video input.

1151
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:07,720
And there is more to be done. So one of the limitations of GPT-3 is that it's amnesiac.

1152
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:12,280
So it forgets everything beyond the two pages that it currently reads also during generation,

1153
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:18,520
not just during learning. Do you think that's fixable within the space of deep learning?

1154
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,240
Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?

1155
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:26,680
No, I don't think that our own working memory is infinitely large. It's probably also just a few

1156
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:32,920
thousand bits. But what you can do is you can structure this working memory. So instead of just

1157
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:38,280
force feeding this thing, a certain thing that it has to focus on and it's not allowed to focus

1158
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:44,520
on anything else because it's network, you allow it to construct its own working memory as we do,

1159
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,400
right? When we are reading a book, it's not that we are focusing our attention in such a way that

1160
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:55,880
we can only remember the current page. We will also try to remember other pages and try to undo

1161
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,280
what we learn from them or modify what we learned from them. We might get up and take another book

1162
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:05,960
from the shelf. We might go out and ask somebody that we can edit our working memory in any way

1163
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:11,240
that is useful to put a context together that allows us to draw the right inferences and to

1164
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:18,600
learn the right things. This ability to perform experiments on the world based on an attempt

1165
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:23,880
to become fully coherent and to achieve causal closure, to achieve a certain aesthetic of your

1166
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:30,120
modeling, that is something that eventually needs to be done. At the moment, we are skirting this

1167
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:35,000
in some sense by building systems that are larger and faster so they can use dramatically larger

1168
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,360
resources and human beings can do much more training data to get to models that in some sense

1169
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:47,880
are already very superhuman and in other ways are laughingly incoherent. Do you think making

1170
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:59,800
the systems multi-resolutional, some of the language models are focused on two pages,

1171
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:07,480
some are focused on two books, some are focused on two years of reading, some are focused on a

1172
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:14,600
lifetime like stacks of GPT-3s all the way down? You want to have gaps in between them. It's not

1173
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:20,840
necessarily two years, there's no gaps. It stinks out of two years or out of 20 years or 2000 years

1174
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:26,680
or two billion years where you are just selecting those bits that are predicted to be the most useful

1175
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:32,440
ones to understand what you're currently doing. This prediction itself requires a very complicated

1176
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:36,440
model. That's the actual model that you need to be making. It's not just that you are trying to

1177
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:41,000
understand the relationships between things but what you need to make relationships or discover

1178
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:47,720
relationships over. I wonder what that thing looks like, what the architecture for the thing

1179
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:53,080
that's able to have that kind of model. I think it needs more degrees of freedom than the current

1180
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:58,840
models have. It starts out with the fact that you possibly don't just want to have a feed-forward

1181
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:05,240
model but you want it to be fully recurrent. To make it fully recurrent, you probably need to

1182
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:11,160
loop it back into itself and allow it to skip connections. Once you do this, you're predicting

1183
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:17,480
the next frame and your internal next frame in every moment and you are able to skip connection,

1184
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:24,280
it means that signals can travel from the output of the network into the middle of the network

1185
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:29,400
faster than the inputs do. Do you think it can still be differentiable? Do you think it still

1186
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:35,000
can be in your network? Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot. It can still be in your

1187
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,760
network but not the fully differentiable one. When you want to deal with non-differentiable ones,

1188
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:45,480
you need to have an attention system that is discreet and no-dimensional and can perform

1189
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:50,120
grammatical operations. You need to be able to perform program synthesis. You need to be able

1190
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:55,240
to backtrack in these operations that you perform on this thing. This thing needs a model of what

1191
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:59,640
it's currently doing. I think this is exactly the purpose of our own consciousness.

1192
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:07,560
Yeah, the program things are tricking along with your networks. Let me ask you, it's not

1193
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:12,680
quite program synthesis but the application of these language models to generation

1194
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:18,360
to program synthesis but generation of programs. If you look at GitHub OpenPilot,

1195
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:23,080
which is based on OpenAI's codecs, I don't know if you've got a chance to look at it, but it's

1196
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:29,160
the system that's able to generate code once you prompt it with what is it,

1197
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:34,600
like the header of a function with some comments. It seems to do an incredibly good job

1198
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:41,880
or not a perfect job but it's very important but an incredibly good job of generating functions.

1199
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:49,320
What do you make of that? Is this exciting or is this just a party trick, a demo? Or is this

1200
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:56,360
revolutionary? I haven't worked with it yet so it's difficult for me to judge it but I would not

1201
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:01,720
be surprised if it turns out to be revolutionary. That's because the majority of programming tasks

1202
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:07,240
that are being done in the industry right now are not creative. People are writing code that other

1203
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:11,560
people have written or they're putting things together from code fragments that others have had

1204
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:17,400
and a lot of the work that programmers do in practice is to figure out how to overcome the

1205
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:22,200
gaps in the current knowledge and the things that people have already done. How to copy and paste

1206
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:28,440
from Stack Overflow, that's right. And so of course we can automate that. Yeah, to make it

1207
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:32,760
much faster to copy and paste from Stack Overflow. Yes, but it's not just copying and pasting,

1208
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:38,360
it's also basically learning which parts you need to modify to make them fit together. Yeah,

1209
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,600
like literally sometimes as simple as just changing the variable names

1210
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:47,400
so it fits into the rest of your code. Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics

1211
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:52,040
of what you're doing to some degree. Yeah, and you can automate some of those things. The thing

1212
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:59,320
that makes people nervous of course is that a little bit wrong in a program can have a dramatic

1213
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:06,360
effect on the actual final operation of that program. So that's one little error which in the

1214
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:12,360
space of language doesn't really matter but in the space of programs can matter a lot. Yes,

1215
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:18,840
but this is already what is happening when humans program code. Yeah, so we have a technology to

1216
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:25,240
deal with this. Somehow it becomes scarier when you know that a program generated code that's

1217
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:33,960
running a nuclear power plant. You know humans have errors too. Exactly. But it's scarier when

1218
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:48,120
a program is doing it because why? There's a fear that a program may not be as good as humans to

1219
01:54:48,120 --> 01:55:00,120
know when stuff is important to not mess up. There's a misalignment of priorities, of values,

1220
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:05,720
that's potential, that maybe that's the source of the worry. I mean, okay, if I give you code

1221
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:15,960
generated by GitHub OpenPilot and code generated by a human and say, here, use one of these,

1222
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:21,720
which how do you select today and in the next 10 years, which code do you use?

1223
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,560
Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human?

1224
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:31,880
At the moment when you go to Stanford to get an MRI, they will write a bill to the insurance

1225
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:39,320
over $20,000 and of this maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance and the quarter gets paid

1226
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:47,080
by you and the MRI cost them $600 to make, maybe probably less. And what are the values of the

1227
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:53,480
person that writes the software and deploys this process? It's very difficult for me to say

1228
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,840
whether I trust people. I think that what happens there is a mixture of

1229
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:04,120
proper Anglo-Saxon Protestant values where somebody is trying to serve an abstract

1230
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:14,200
greater whole and organize crime. Well, that's a very harsh, I think that's a harsh view of

1231
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:20,520
humanity. There's a lot of bad people, whether incompetent or just malevolent in this world,

1232
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:27,880
yes. But it feels like the more malevolent, so the more damage you do to the world,

1233
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:34,440
the more resistance you have in your own human heart.

1234
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:39,080
But not explain with malevolence or stupidity what can be explained by just people acting on

1235
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:46,600
their incentives. So what happens in Stanford is not that somebody is evil, it's just that they do

1236
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:53,960
what they're being paid for. No, it's not evil. I see that as malevolence. I see,

1237
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:05,000
even like being a good German, as I told you offline, it's not absolute malevolence,

1238
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,280
but it's a small amount. It's cowardice. I mean, when you see there's something wrong with the world,

1239
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:17,240
it's either incompetence that you're not able to see it, or it's cowardice that you're not able to

1240
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:25,160
stand up, not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way. So I do think that is in a bit of

1241
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,800
malevolence. I'm not sure the example you're describing is a good example.

1242
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:34,200
So the question is, what is it that you are aiming for? And if you don't believe in the future,

1243
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:38,760
if you, for instance, think that the dollar is going to crash by what you try to save dollars,

1244
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:43,960
if you don't think that humanity will be around in 100 years from now, because

1245
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:49,160
global warming will wipe out civilization, why would you need to act as if it were?

1246
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:56,040
So the question is, is there an overarching aesthetics that is projecting you and the world

1247
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:00,440
into the future, which I think is the basic idea of religion, that you understand the

1248
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:04,920
interactions that we have with each other as some kind of civilization level agent that is

1249
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:12,040
projecting itself into the future. If you don't have that shared purpose, what is there to be

1250
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:18,760
ethical for? So I think when we talk about ethics and AI, we need to go beyond the insane bias

1251
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:24,600
discussions and so on, where people are just measuring the distance between a statistic to their

1252
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:31,080
preferred current world model. But the optimism, I was a little confused by the previous thing,

1253
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:42,840
just to clarify, there is a kind of underlying morality to having an optimism that human

1254
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:48,680
civilization will persist for longer than 100 years. I think a lot of people believe

1255
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:54,280
that it's a good thing for us to keep living. Yeah, of course. And thriving.

1256
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:59,560
This morality itself is not an end to itself. It's instrumental to people living in 100 years

1257
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:07,240
from now, or 500 years from now. So it's only justifiable if you actually think that it will

1258
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:12,440
lead to people or increase the probability of people being arrived in that time frame.

1259
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,880
And a lot of people don't actually believe that, at least not actively.

1260
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:22,280
But I believe what exactly? Most people don't believe that they can afford to act on such a

1261
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:27,560
model. Basically, what happens in the US is I think that the healthcare system is for a lot of

1262
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:31,480
people no longer sustainable, which means that if they need the help of the healthcare system,

1263
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:36,840
they're often not able to afford it. And when they cannot help it, they are often going bankrupt.

1264
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:41,560
It's I think the leading course of personal bankruptcy in the US is the healthcare system.

1265
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:47,720
And that would not be necessary. It's not because people are consuming more and more

1266
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:52,520
medical services and are achieving a much, much longer life as a result. That's not actually the

1267
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:56,840
story that is happening, because you can compare it to other countries. And life expectancy in

1268
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:01,000
the US is currently not increasing. And it's not as high as in all the other industrialized

1269
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,560
countries. So some industrialized countries are doing better with a much cheaper healthcare system.

1270
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:12,760
And what you can see is, for instance, administrative bloat, the healthcare system has

1271
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:19,400
maybe to some degree deliberately set up as a job placement program to allow people to continue

1272
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:26,600
living in middle class existence, despite not having a useful use case in productivity.

1273
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:31,880
So they are being paid to push paper around. And the number of administrators in the healthcare

1274
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:36,360
system has been increasing much faster than the number of practitioners. And this is something

1275
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:41,640
that you have to pay for, right? And also the revenues that are being generated in the healthcare

1276
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:46,280
system are relatively large, and somebody has to pay for them. And the result why they are so

1277
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:52,120
large is because market mechanisms are not working. The FDA is largely not protecting

1278
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:58,760
people from malpractice of healthcare providers. The FDA is protecting healthcare providers from

1279
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:04,680
competition. So this is a thing that it has to do with values. And this is not because people

1280
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:10,680
are malicious on all levels. It's because they are not incentivized to act on a greater whole on

1281
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:15,320
this idea that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient like you would treat a family

1282
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:20,440
member. Yeah, but we're trying. I mean, you're highlighting a lot of the flaws of the different

1283
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:25,080
institutions, the systems we're operating under. But I think there's a continued throughout history

1284
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:31,720
mechanism design of trying to design incentives in such a way that these systems behave better and

1285
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:37,320
better and better. I mean, it's a very difficult thing to operate a society of hundreds of millions

1286
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:44,920
of people effectively with. Yes. Do we live in a society that is ever-correcting? Do we observe

1287
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:50,280
that our models of what we are doing are predictive of the future? And when they are not,

1288
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:55,880
we improve them. Our laws are adjudicated with clauses that you put into every law,

1289
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:59,960
what is meant to be achieved by that law, and the law will be automatically repealed

1290
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:04,200
if it's not achieving that. If you are optimizing your own laws, if you're writing your own source

1291
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:09,320
code, you probably make an estimate of what is this thing that's currently wrong in my life?

1292
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:14,200
What is it that I should change about my own policies? What is the expected outcome? And

1293
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:19,240
if that outcome doesn't manifest, I will change the policy back, right? Or I would change it to

1294
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:23,880
do something different. Are we doing this on a societal level? I think so. I think it's easy

1295
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:30,360
to sort of highlight the... I think we're doing it in the way that I operate my current life. I

1296
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:36,120
didn't sleep much last night. You would say that Lex, the way you need to operate your life is you

1297
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:41,320
need to always get sleep. The fact that you didn't sleep last night is totally the wrong way to

1298
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:47,640
operate in your life. Like, you should have gotten all your shit done in time and gotten to sleep

1299
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:52,520
because sleep is very important for health. And you're highlighting, look, this person is not sleeping.

1300
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:59,560
Look, the medical, the healthcare system is operating... But the point is we just... It seems

1301
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:04,520
like this is the way, especially in the capitalist society, we operate... We keep running into trouble

1302
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:10,120
and last minute, we try to get our way out through innovation. And it seems to work.

1303
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,880
You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying to build a better world and get

1304
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:23,400
urgency about them when it's... The problem becomes more and more imminent. And that's

1305
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:30,360
the way this operates. But if you look at the history, the long arc of history, it seems like

1306
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:36,920
that operating on deadlines produces progress and builds better and better systems.

1307
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:43,960
You probably agree with me that the US should have engaged in mass production in January 2020

1308
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:50,920
and that we should have shut down the airports early on and that we should have made it mandatory

1309
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:57,880
that the people that work in nursery homes are living on campus rather than living at home

1310
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:03,240
and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes that had no immune response to COVID.

1311
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:09,400
And that is something that was, I think, visible back then. The correct decisions haven't been

1312
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:14,520
made. We would have the same situation again. How do we know that these wrong decisions are not

1313
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:19,240
being made again? Have the people that made the decisions to not protect the nursing homes been

1314
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:25,720
punished? Have the people that made the wrong decisions with respect to testing that prevented

1315
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:30,840
the development of testing by startup companies and the importing of tests from countries that

1316
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:35,160
already had them? Have these people been held responsible? Yeah, but first of all, so what do

1317
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:41,160
you want to put before the firing squad? I think they are. No, just make sure that this doesn't

1318
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:47,480
happen again. No, but it's not that, yes, they're being held responsible by many voices by people

1319
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:53,480
being frustrated. There's new leaders being born now. They're going to see rise to the top in 10

1320
02:04:53,480 --> 02:05:01,160
years. This moves slower than there's obviously a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy

1321
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:08,840
in these systems move slowly. They move like science one depth at a time. So yes, I think

1322
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:15,480
the pain has been felt in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world.

1323
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:20,120
Maybe I'm getting old. I suspect that every generation in the U.S. after the war has lost

1324
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:24,600
the plot even more. I don't see this development. The war of World War II?

1325
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:30,360
Yes, so basically there was a time when we were modernist and in this modernist time,

1326
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:36,760
the U.S. felt actively threatened by the things that happened in the world. The U.S. was worried

1327
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:45,320
about possibility of failure and this imminence of possible failure led to decisions. There was

1328
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:51,160
a time when the government would listen to physicists about how to do things. The physicists

1329
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,240
were actually concerned about what the government should be doing. They would be writing letters

1330
02:05:55,240 --> 02:06:00,120
to the government. For instance, the decision for the Manhattan Project was something that was

1331
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:05,400
driven in a conversation between physicists and the government. I don't think such a discussion

1332
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:11,240
would take place today. I disagree. I think if the virus was much deadlier, we would see a very

1333
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:16,360
different response. I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly. Instead, because it wasn't

1334
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:23,720
very deadly, what happened is the current system started to politicize it. This is what I realized

1335
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:30,760
with masks early on. They were not very quickly became not as a solution, but they became a thing

1336
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:36,280
that politicians used to divide the country. The same things happened with vaccines,

1337
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:42,040
so people weren't talking about solutions to this problem because I don't think the problem

1338
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:49,240
was bad enough. When you talk about the war, I think our lives are too comfortable. I think

1339
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:56,520
in the developed world, things are too good and we have not faced severe dangers. The

1340
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:02,200
severe dangers existential threats are faced. That's when we step up on a small scale and a large

1341
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:12,360
scale. That's my argument here, but I did think the virus, I was hoping that it was actually

1342
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:19,800
sufficiently dangerous for us to step up because especially in the early days, it was unclear. It

1343
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:31,560
still is unclear because of mutations, how bad it might be. I thought we would step up. The mask's

1344
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:39,400
point is a tricky one because to me, the manufacture of masks isn't even the problem. I'm still to

1345
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:44,680
this day and I was involved with a bunch of this work, have not seen good signs done on whether

1346
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:51,160
masks work or not. There still has not been a large-scale study. To me, there should be large

1347
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:56,360
scale studies on every possible solution, aggressive. In the same way that the vaccine

1348
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:01,480
development was aggressive, there should be masks which test what kind of tests work really well.

1349
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:08,840
Even the question of how the virus spreads, there should be aggressive studies on that.

1350
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:14,120
To understand, I'm still, as far as I know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about that.

1351
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:21,400
Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem that needs to be solved. That I was surprised

1352
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:26,280
about. I find that our views are largely convergent but not completely. I agree with

1353
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:31,880
the thing that because our society in some sense perceives itself as too big to fail.

1354
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:37,720
The virus did not alert people to the fact that we are facing possible failure

1355
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:43,240
that basically put us into the post-modernist mode. I don't mean in a philosophical sense,

1356
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:49,240
but in a societal sense. The difference between a post-modern society and the modern society is

1357
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:53,560
that the modernist society has to deal with the ground tools and the post-modernist society has

1358
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:59,240
to deal with appearances. Politics becomes a performance. The performance is done for an

1359
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:05,480
audience and the organized audience is the media. The media evaluates itself via other media.

1360
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:10,360
We have an audience of critics that evaluate themselves. I don't think it's so much the

1361
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:15,640
failure of the politicians because to get in power and to stay in power, you need to be able

1362
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:21,000
to deal with the published opinion. I think it goes in cycles because what's going to happen

1363
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:27,320
is all of the small business owners, all the people who truly are suffering and will suffer

1364
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:33,640
more because the effects of the closure of the economy and the lack of solutions to the virus,

1365
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:40,760
they're going to a prize. Hopefully, this is where charismatic leaders can get the

1366
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:49,880
world in trouble. Hopefully, we'll elect great leaders that will break through this

1367
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:57,240
post-modernist idea of the media and the perception and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of

1368
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:03,880
stuff. You know this can go either way. When the Weimar Republic was unable to deal with the

1369
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:11,000
economic crisis that Germany was facing, there was an option to go back. There were people

1370
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:16,760
which thought, let's get back to a constitutional monarchy and let's get this to work because

1371
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:23,240
democracy doesn't work. Eventually, there was no way back. People decided there was no way back.

1372
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:28,840
They needed to go forward. The only options for going forward was to become Stalinist

1373
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:36,520
communists, basically an option to completely expropriate the factories and so on and nationalize

1374
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:44,120
them and to reorganize Germany in communist terms and ally itself with Stalin and fascism.

1375
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:51,320
Both options were obviously very bad. The one that the Germans picked led to a catastrophe

1376
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:58,520
that devastated Europe. I'm not sure if the US has an immune response against that. I think that

1377
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:02,760
the far-right is currently very weak in the US, but this can easily change.

1378
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:11,400
Do you think from a historical perspective Hitler could have been stopped from within

1379
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:19,480
Germany or from outside? It depends on who you want to focus, whether you want to focus on Stalin

1380
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:24,200
or Hitler, but it feels like Hitler was the one as a political movement that could have been stopped.

1381
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:31,480
I think that the point was that a lot of people wanted Hitler, so he got support from a lot of

1382
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:36,280
quarters. There were a number of industrialists who supported him because they thought that the

1383
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:42,040
democracy is obviously not working in unstable and you need a strongman. He was willing to play

1384
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:48,680
that part. There were also people in the US who thought that Hitler would stop Stalin and would

1385
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:55,560
act as a bulwark against Bolshevism, which he probably would have done at which cost.

1386
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:03,480
Many of the things that he was going to do, like the Holocaust, was something where people

1387
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:08,520
thought this is rhetoric. He's not actually going to do this, especially many of the Jews

1388
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:13,080
themselves, which were humanists. For them, this was outside of the scope that was thinkable.

1389
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:22,920
I wonder if Hitler is uniquely, I want to carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.

1390
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:32,040
Hitler was never born if somebody else would come in this place. Just thinking about the

1391
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:39,400
progress of history, how important are those singular figures that lead to mass destruction

1392
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:49,480
and cruelty? Because my sense is, Hitler was unique. It wasn't just about the environment and

1393
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:56,680
the context that gave him. Another person would not come in his place to do as destructive of

1394
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:04,440
the things that he did. There was a combination of charisma, of madness, of psychopathy,

1395
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:10,840
of just ego, all those things, which are very unlikely to come together in one person in the

1396
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:16,760
right time. It also depends on the context of the country that you're operating in. If you

1397
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:24,680
tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny in this romantic country, the effect is

1398
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:32,440
probably different than it is in other countries. Stalin has killed a few more people than

1399
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:40,600
Hitler did. If you look at the probability that you're survived under Stalin, Hitler killed people

1400
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:48,760
if he thought they were not worth living, or if they were harmful to his racist project.

1401
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:55,080
Basically, he felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan and would not be willing to participate

1402
02:13:55,080 --> 02:14:01,240
in the racist redefinition of society and the value of society and an ethno-state in this way,

1403
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:08,040
as he wanted it to have it. He saw them as a harmful danger, especially since they played

1404
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:17,880
such an important role in the economy and culture of Germany. Basically, he had some radical,

1405
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:25,320
but rational reason to murder them. Stalin just killed everyone. The Stalinist purges were such

1406
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:33,320
a random thing where he said that there is a certain possibility that this particular part

1407
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:37,320
of the population has a number of German collaborators or something, and we just killed

1408
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:43,800
them all. Or if you look at what Mao did, the number of people that were killed in absolute

1409
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:50,360
numbers were much higher than the Mao that they were under Stalin. It's super hard to say. The

1410
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:57,400
other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on, how many people he killed. You see

1411
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:02,040
there are a number of things that happen in human history that actually put a substantial

1412
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:09,480
dent in the existing population, or Napoleon. It's very difficult to eventually measure it,

1413
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:17,320
because what's happening is basically evolution on a human scale where one monkey figures out a

1414
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:24,520
way to become viral and is using this viral technology to change the patterns of society

1415
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:31,240
at a very large scale. What we find so abhorrent about these changes is the complexity that is

1416
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:35,800
being destroyed by this. It's basically like a big fire that burns out a lot of the existing

1417
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:41,640
culture and structure that existed before. Yeah, and it all just starts with one monkey,

1418
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:47,400
one charismatic ape, and there's a bunch of them throughout history. Yeah, but it's in a given

1419
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:52,280
environment. It's basically similar to wildfires in California. The temperature is rising,

1420
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:58,360
there is less rain falling, and then suddenly a single spark can have an effect that in other

1421
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:06,600
times would be contained. Okay, speaking of which, I love how we went to Hitler and Stalin from

1422
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:15,400
20, 30 minutes ago, GPT-3 generating, doing programs that this is. The argument was about

1423
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:26,920
morality of AI versus human. Specifically in the context of writing programs, specifically in the

1424
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:32,680
context of programs that can be destructive. So running nuclear power plants or autonomous

1425
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:40,600
weapons systems, for example. And I think your inclination was to say that it's not so obvious

1426
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:47,880
that AI would be less moral than humans or less effective at making a world that would make humans

1427
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:55,720
happy. So I'm not talking about self-directed systems that are making their own goals at

1428
02:16:55,720 --> 02:17:01,080
the global scale. If you just talk about the deployment of technological systems that are able

1429
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:07,480
to see order and patterns and use this as control models to act on the goals that we give them,

1430
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:13,080
then if we have the correct incentives to set the correct incentives for these systems,

1431
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:18,760
I'm quite optimistic. So humans versus AI, let me give you an example.

1432
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:27,480
Autonomous Weapon Systems. Let's say there's a city somewhere in the Middle East that has

1433
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:34,920
a number of terrorists. And the question is, what's currently done with drone technologies,

1434
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:40,040
you have information about the location of a particular terrorist, and you have a targeted

1435
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:45,960
attack, you have a bombing of that particular building. And that's all directed by humans at

1436
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:53,160
the high level strategy and also the deployment of individual bombs and missiles. Everything is

1437
02:17:53,160 --> 02:18:01,240
done by human except the final targeting and the spot, similar thing, like control the flight.

1438
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:11,480
What if you give AI control and saying, write a program that says, here's the best information

1439
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:17,080
available about the location of these five terrorists, here's the city, make sure all the

1440
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:22,680
bombing you do is constrained to the city, make sure it's precision based, but you take care of

1441
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:28,440
it. So you do one level of abstraction out and saying, take care of the terrorists in the city.

1442
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:36,120
Which are you more comfortable with? The humans or the JavaScript GPT-3 generated code that's doing

1443
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:46,440
the deployment. This is the kind of question I'm asking, is the kind of bugs that we see in human

1444
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:52,440
nature, are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI? They're different bugs.

1445
02:18:52,440 --> 02:19:00,760
There is an issue that if people are creating an imperfect automation of a process that normally

1446
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:07,480
requires a moral judgment, and this moral judgment is the reason why it cannot be automated often,

1447
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:14,840
it's not because the computation is too expensive, but because the model that you give the AI is not

1448
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:19,720
an adequate model of the dynamics of the world, because the AI does not understand the context

1449
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:24,680
that it's operating in the right way. And this is something that already happens with Excel,

1450
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:30,280
where you don't need to have an AI system to do this. If you have an automated process in place,

1451
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:35,960
where humans decide using automated criteria whom to kill when, and whom to target when,

1452
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:41,480
which already happens. And you have no way to get off the kill list once that happens,

1453
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:45,720
once you have been targeted according to some automatic criterion by people, right,

1454
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:51,560
in a bureaucracy. That is the issue. The issue is not the AI, it's the automation.

1455
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:57,960
So there's something about, right, it's automation, but there's something about the,

1456
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:03,640
there's a certain level of abstraction where you give control to AI to do the automation.

1457
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:10,760
There's a scale that could be achieved that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake

1458
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:17,960
and scale of destruction that could be achieved of the kind that humans cannot achieve. So AI is

1459
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:23,560
much more able to destroy an entire country accidentally, versus humans. It feels like

1460
02:20:23,560 --> 02:20:30,360
the more civilians die as a react or suffer as a consequence of your decisions,

1461
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,240
the more weight there is on the human mind to make that decision.

1462
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:42,680
And so like it becomes more and more unlikely to make that decision for humans. For AI, it feels

1463
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:49,640
like it's harder to encode that kind of weight. In a way, the AI that we're currently building

1464
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:55,160
is automating statistics, right? Intelligence is the ability to make models so you can act on them

1465
02:20:55,160 --> 02:21:01,560
and AI is a tool to make better models. So in principle, if you're using AI wisely,

1466
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:07,880
you're able to prevent more harm. And I think that the main issue is not on the side of the AI,

1467
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:12,280
it's on the side of the human command hierarchy that is using technology irresponsibly.

1468
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:19,000
So the question is how hard is it to encode, to properly encode the right incentives into the AI?

1469
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:24,440
So for instance, there's this idea of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown

1470
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:29,800
with AI systems and the neural network is a black box and so on. And it turns out our neural

1471
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:35,640
networks are actually not black boxes anymore. There are function approximators losing linear

1472
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:41,800
algebra, and there are performing things that we can understand. But we can also, instead of

1473
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:46,040
letting the neural network fly the airplane, use the neural network to generate approval,

1474
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:51,080
be correct program with a degree of accuracy of the proof that a human could not achieve.

1475
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:56,920
And so we can use our AI by combining different technologies to build systems that are much

1476
02:21:56,920 --> 02:22:03,480
more reliable than the systems that a human being could create. And so in this sense, I would say

1477
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:11,320
that if you use an early stage of technology to save labor and don't employ competent people,

1478
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:15,720
but just to hack something together because you can, that is very dangerous. And if people

1479
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:20,600
are acting under these incentives that they get evasive, delivering shoddy work more

1480
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:25,080
cheaply using AI is less human oversight than before. That's very dangerous.

1481
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:30,280
The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable, perhaps less so than humans,

1482
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:37,480
but it'll be unreliable in novel ways. And yeah, but this is an empirical question. And it's

1483
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:43,080
something that we can figure out and work with. So the issue is, do we trust the systems,

1484
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:47,960
the social systems that we have in place and the social systems that we can build and maintain,

1485
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:53,960
that they're able to use AI responsibly? If they can, then AI is good news. If they cannot,

1486
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:56,040
then it's going to make the existing problems worse.

1487
02:22:57,080 --> 02:23:01,160
Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it, who makes money from it,

1488
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:06,920
because it's ultimately humans. And then you start talking about how much you trust the humans.

1489
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:11,080
So the question is, what does who mean? I don't think that we have identity per se.

1490
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:17,240
I think that the story of a human being is somewhat random. What happens is more or less that

1491
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:21,960
everybody is acting on their local incentives, what they perceive to be their incentives.

1492
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:27,960
And the question is, what are the incentives that the one that is pressing the button is operating

1493
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:35,480
under? Yeah, it's nice for those incentives to be transparent. So for example, I'll give you

1494
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:38,920
there seems to be a significant distrust of

1495
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:46,920
tech, like entrepreneurs in the tech space, or people that run, for example, social media

1496
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:53,320
companies like Mark Zuckerberg. There's not a complete transparency of incentives under

1497
02:23:54,120 --> 02:24:00,600
which that particular human being operates. We can listen to the words he says,

1498
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:06,200
or what the marketing team says for a company, but we don't know. And that's becomes a problem

1499
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:13,560
when that the algorithms and the systems created by him and other people in that company

1500
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:20,680
start having more and more impact on society. And that it starts, you know, if the incentives

1501
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:29,080
were somehow the definition and the explainability of the incentives was decentralized such that

1502
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:36,680
nobody can manipulate it. No propaganda type manipulation of like how these systems actually

1503
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:45,560
operate could be done. Then yes, if you know, I think, I think AI could achieve much fair, much

1504
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:54,680
more effective sort of like solutions to difficult ethical problems. But when there's like humans

1505
02:24:54,680 --> 02:25:01,560
in the loop, manipulating the dissemination, the communication of how the system actually

1506
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:07,000
works, that feels like you can run to a lot of trouble. And that's why there's currently a lot

1507
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,360
of distrust for people at the heads of companies that have increasingly powerful AI systems.

1508
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:19,320
I suspect what happened traditionally in the US was that since our decision making is much more

1509
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:25,080
decentralized than in an authoritarian state, people are making decisions autonomously at many,

1510
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:31,400
many levels in the society. What happened that was we created coherence and cohesion in society

1511
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:37,160
by controlling what people thought and what information they had. The media synchronized

1512
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:43,160
public opinion. And social media have disrupted this. It's not, I think, so much Russian influence

1513
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:48,680
or something. It's everybody's influence. It's that a random person can come up with a conspiracy

1514
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:55,720
theory and disrupt what people think. And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling or more

1515
02:25:55,720 --> 02:26:01,080
attractive than the standardized public conspiracy theory that we give people as a default,

1516
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:05,880
then it might get more traction, right? You suddenly have the situation that a single individual

1517
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:12,920
somewhere on a farm in Texas has more listeners than CNN. Which particular farmer you're referring

1518
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:22,280
to in Texas? Probably no. Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times. Okay. Right. It's an

1519
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:27,160
interesting situation because you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN if you don't go through a

1520
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:33,640
complicated gatekeeping process. And suddenly you have random people without that gatekeeping

1521
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:39,560
process just optimizing for attention. Not necessarily with a lot of responsibility for

1522
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:46,120
the long-term effects of projecting these theories into the public. And now there is a push of making

1523
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:51,400
social media more like traditional media, which means that the opinion that is being projected in

1524
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:57,560
social media is more limited to an acceptable range with the goal of getting society into

1525
02:26:57,560 --> 02:27:01,960
safe waters and increase the stability and cohesion of society again, which I think is

1526
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:07,480
a laudable goal. But of course, it also is an opportunity to cease the means of indoctrination.

1527
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:13,320
And the incentives that people are under when they do this are in such a way that

1528
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:20,520
the AI ethics that we would need becomes very often something like AI politics,

1529
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:26,040
which is basically partisan and ideological. And this means that whatever one side says,

1530
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:31,080
another side is going to be disagreeing with, right? In the same way as when you turn masks or

1531
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:36,600
the vaccine into a political issue, if you say that it is politically virtuous to get vaccinated,

1532
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:41,560
it will mean that the people that don't like you will not want to get vaccinated. And as soon

1533
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:47,000
as you have this partisan discourse, it's going to be very hard to make the right decisions,

1534
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,400
because the incentives get to be the wrong ones. AI ethics needs to be super boring. It needs to

1535
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:58,120
be done by people who do statistics all the time and have extremely boring, long-winded discussions

1536
02:27:58,120 --> 02:28:02,360
that most people cannot follow because they are too complicated, but that are dead serious.

1537
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:06,920
These people need to be able to be better at statistics than the leading machine learning

1538
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:13,080
researchers. And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one where you don't have any barrier

1539
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:18,680
to entry, right? Everybody who has a strong opinion and is able to signal that opinion in the right

1540
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:24,280
way can enter it. Strong words to judge it back. And to me, that is a very frustrating thing,

1541
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:28,440
because the field is so crucially important to our future. It's so crucially important, but

1542
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:33,960
the only qualification you currently need is to be outraged by the injustice in the world.

1543
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:37,640
It's more complicated, right? Everybody seems to be outraged.

1544
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:42,520
So let's just say that the incentives are not always the right ones. So basically,

1545
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:49,000
I suspect that a lot of people that enter this debate don't have a vision for what society

1546
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:54,200
should be looking like in a way that is nonviolent, where we preserve liberal democracy, where we

1547
02:28:54,200 --> 02:29:01,240
make sure that we all get along and we are around in a few hundred years from now, preferably

1548
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,960
with the comfortable technological civilization around us.

1549
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:12,440
I generally have a very foggy view of that world, but I tend to try to follow and I think

1550
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:18,040
society should in some degree follow the gradient of love, increasing the amount of love in the

1551
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:23,880
world. And whenever I see different policies or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so,

1552
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:27,240
obviously, that's the ones that kind of resist.

1553
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:34,520
So the thing that terrifies me about this notion is I think that German fascism was driven by love.

1554
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:39,000
It was just a very selective love. It was a love that basically-

1555
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:44,760
Well, now you're just manipulating. I mean, that's, you have to be very careful.

1556
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:50,520
You're talking to the wrong person in this way about love.

1557
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:55,960
So let's talk about what love is. And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.

1558
02:29:55,960 --> 02:30:01,880
It's the recognition of the sacred and the other. And this enables non-transactual interactions.

1559
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:08,920
But the size of the other that you include needs to be maximized.

1560
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:16,280
So it's basically appreciation, like deep appreciation of

1561
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:25,800
the world around you fully, including the people that are very different than you,

1562
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:30,200
the people that disagree with you completely, including people, including living creatures

1563
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:36,680
outside of just people, including ideas and appreciation of the full mess of it.

1564
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:43,320
And also it has to do with empathy, which is coupled with a lack of confidence,

1565
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:51,000
uncertainty about your own rightness. It's like a radical open-mindedness to the way forward.

1566
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,440
I agree with every part of what you said. And now, if you scale it up, what you recognize is that

1567
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:02,840
love is, in some sense, the service to a next level agency, to the highest level agency that

1568
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:09,640
you can recognize. It could be, for instance, life on earth or beyond that, where you could say

1569
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:13,400
intelligent complexity in the universe that you try to maximize in a certain way.

1570
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:20,280
But when you think it through, it basically means a certain aesthetic. And there is not one possible

1571
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:25,320
aesthetic. There are many possible aesthetics. And once you project an aesthetic into the future,

1572
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:30,440
you can see that there are some which defect from it, which are in conflict with it,

1573
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:36,280
that are corrupt, that are evil. You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil,

1574
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,480
because the aesthetic of the world that he wanted is in conflict with the aesthetic of

1575
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:49,400
the world that you and me have in mind. And so the thing that he destroyed, we want to keep them

1576
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:58,040
in the world. There's ways to deal. I mean, Hitler's an easier case, but perhaps he wasn't so easy

1577
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:01,720
in the 30s, to understand who's Hitler and who's not.

1578
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:07,400
No, it's just that there was no consensus that the aesthetics that he had in mind were unacceptable.

1579
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:17,720
Yeah. I mean, it's difficult. Love is complicated, because you can't just be so open-minded that

1580
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:27,800
you let evil walk into the door. But you can't be so self-assured that you can always identify

1581
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:34,040
evil perfectly, because that's what leads to Nazi Germany, having a certainty of what is and

1582
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:43,320
wasn't evil, like always drawing lines of good versus evil. There has to be a dance between

1583
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:54,680
like hard stances extending up against what is wrong. And at the same time, empathy and open

1584
02:32:54,680 --> 02:33:00,760
mind towards not knowing what is right and wrong. And like a dance between those.

1585
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:06,040
I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies that there is nobody who captures my spirituality

1586
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:12,280
as well as he does. It's very interesting and just vicious. There is something going on in

1587
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:18,520
his movies that is very interesting. So, for instance, Mononoka is discussing not only an answer

1588
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:25,320
to Disney's simplistic notion of Mowgli, the jungle boy who was raised by wolves. And as soon

1589
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:33,240
as he sees people, realizes that he's one of them. And the way in which the moral life and nature

1590
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:38,440
is simplified and romanticized and turned into kitsch is disgusting in the Disney movie. And he

1591
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:43,880
answers to this. You see, he's replaced by Mononoka, this wolf girl who was raised by wolves and who

1592
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:49,640
was fierce and dangerous and who cannot be socialized because he cannot be tamed. He cannot

1593
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:53,560
be part of human society. And you see human society, it's something that is very, very

1594
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:59,640
complicated. You see people extracting resources and destroying nature. But the purpose is not

1595
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:06,440
to be evil, but to be able to have a life that is free from, for instance, oppression and violence

1596
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:14,520
and to curb death and disease. And you basically see this conflict which cannot be resolved in a

1597
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:19,640
certain way. You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden and it loses most of what

1598
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:25,560
it actually is when humans no longer submitting to life and death and nature. And to these questions,

1599
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:30,440
there is no easy answer. So, he just turns it into something that is being observed as a journey

1600
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:36,280
that happens and that happens with a certain degree of inevitability. And the nice thing about

1601
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:40,360
all his movies is there is a certain main character and it's the same in all movies.

1602
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:48,520
It's this little girl that is basically Heidi and I suspect that happened because when he did

1603
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:55,080
field work for working on the Heidi movies back then, the Heidi animations, before he did his

1604
02:34:55,080 --> 02:35:02,040
own movies, he traveled to Switzerland and south-eastern Europe and the Adriatic and so on

1605
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:06,440
and got an idea about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life that informed his

1606
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:12,600
future thinking. And Heidi has a very interesting relationship to herself and to the world.

1607
02:35:13,160 --> 02:35:18,680
There's nothing that she takes for herself. She is in a way fearless because she is committed

1608
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:23,960
to a service to a greater whole. Basically, she is completely committed to serving God.

1609
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:28,680
And it's not an institutionalized God. It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church or

1610
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:33,880
something like this. But in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment of the spirit of European

1611
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:40,680
Protestantism. It's this idea of a being that is completely perfect and pure. And it's not a

1612
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:50,520
feminist vision because she is not a girl boss or something like this. She is the justification

1613
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:55,080
for the men in the audience to protect her, to build the civilization around her that makes

1614
02:35:55,080 --> 02:36:00,920
her possible. So she is not just the sacrifice of Jesus who is innocent and therefore,

1615
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:06,840
nailed to the cross. She is not being sacrificed. She is being protected by everybody around her

1616
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:13,000
who recognizes that she is sacred and there are enough around her to see that. So that's a very

1617
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:17,880
interesting perspective. There's a certain notion of innocence. And this notion of innocence is not

1618
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:24,280
universal. It's not in all cultures. Hitler wasn't innocent. His idea of Germany was not

1619
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:28,680
that there is innocence that is being protected. There was a predator that was going to triumph.

1620
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:33,000
And it's also something that is not at the core of every religion. There are many religions

1621
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,800
which don't care about innocence. They might care about increasing the status of something.

1622
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:47,560
And that's a very interesting notion that is quite unique and not claiming it's the optimal one.

1623
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:53,480
It's just a particular kind of aesthetic which I think makes Miyazaki into the most relevant

1624
02:36:53,480 --> 02:37:00,840
Protestant philosopher today. And you're saying in terms of all the ways that society can operate

1625
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:08,840
perhaps the preservation of innocence might be one of the best? No, it's just my aesthetic.

1626
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:15,320
Your aesthetic. It's a particular way in which I feel that I relate to the world that is natural

1627
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:20,920
to my own civilization and maybe it's not an accident that I have cultural roots in Europe

1628
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:28,040
in a particular world. And so maybe it's a natural convergence point and it's not something that you

1629
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:35,720
will find in all other times in history. So I'd like to ask you both Solzhenitsyn and our individual

1630
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:42,440
role as ants in this very large society. So he says that some version of the line between good

1631
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:47,240
and evil runs to the heart of every man. Do you think all of us are capable of good and evil?

1632
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:57,320
Like what's our role in this play in this game while playing? Is all of us capable to play any

1633
02:37:57,320 --> 02:38:04,840
role? Like is there an ultimate responsibility to you mentioned maintaining innocence or whatever

1634
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:11,400
the whatever the highest ideal for society you want are all of us capable of living up to that?

1635
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:16,520
And that's our responsibility or are there significant limitations to what we're able to

1636
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:24,040
do in terms of good and evil? So there is a certain way if you are not parable,

1637
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:31,080
if you are committed to some kind of civilizational agency, a next level agent that you are serving,

1638
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:36,200
some kind of transcendent principle. In the eyes of that transcendental principle,

1639
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:39,800
you are able to discern good from evil, otherwise you cannot, otherwise you have just

1640
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:46,200
individual aesthetics. The cat that is torturing a mouse is not evil because the cat does not envision

1641
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:52,760
or not part of the cat is envisioning a world where there is no violence and nobody is suffering.

1642
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:58,840
If you have an aesthetic where you want to protect innocence, then torturing somebody

1643
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:05,640
needlessly is evil, but only then. No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic,

1644
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:14,680
like within your sense of what is good and evil, it seems like we're still able to

1645
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:21,160
commit evil. Yes. So basically, if you are committing to this next level agent, you are not

1646
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:26,040
necessarily are this next level agent, right? You are part of it. You have a relationship to it,

1647
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:31,320
like it sailed us to its organism, its hyperorganism, and it only exists to the degree

1648
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:37,800
that it's being implemented by you and others. And that means that you're not completely fully

1649
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:42,520
serving it. You have freedom in what you decide, whether you are acting on your impulses and local

1650
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:47,160
incentives and your verbal impulses, so to speak, or whether you're committing to it.

1651
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:53,640
And what you perceive then is a tension between what you would be doing with respect to the thing

1652
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:59,800
that you recognize as the sacred, if you do, and what you're actually doing. And this is the line

1653
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:05,640
between good and evil, right? Where you see, oh, I'm here acting on my local incentives or impulses,

1654
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:09,720
and here I'm acting on what I consider to be sacred. And there's a tension between those.

1655
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:15,080
And this is the line between good and evil that might run through your heart. And if you don't

1656
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:19,320
have that, if you don't have this relationship to a transcendental agent, you could call this

1657
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:24,280
relationship to the next level agent soul, right? It's not a thing. It's not an immortal thing that

1658
02:40:24,280 --> 02:40:28,760
is intrinsically valuable. It's a certain kind of relationship that you project to understand

1659
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:32,440
what's happening. Somebody is serving this transcendental sacredness or they're not.

1660
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:39,080
If you don't have a soul, you cannot be evil. You're just a complex natural phenomenon.

1661
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:44,920
So if you look at life, like starting today, or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today,

1662
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:49,720
there's a bunch of trajectories that you can take through life,

1663
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:59,800
maybe countless. Do you think some of these trajectories in your own conception of yourself,

1664
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:08,520
some of those trajectories are the ideal life, a life that if you were to be the hero of your life

1665
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:13,720
story, you would want to be? Like is there some Joshua Bach that you're striving to be?

1666
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:20,360
Like this is the question I ask myself as an individual trying to make a better world in the

1667
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:26,440
best way that I could conceive of. What is my responsibility there? And how much am I responsible

1668
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:34,840
for the failure to do so? Because I'm lazy and incompetent too often in my own perception.

1669
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:41,720
In my own world view, I'm not very important. So I don't have place for me as a hero in my

1670
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:50,360
own world. I'm trying to do the best that I can, which is often not very good. And so it's not

1671
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:57,080
important for me to have status or to be seen in a particular way. It's helpful if others can see

1672
02:41:57,080 --> 02:41:59,640
me, or a few people can see me, that can be my friends.

1673
02:41:59,720 --> 02:42:05,480
No, sorry, I want to clarify. The hero didn't mean status or perception or

1674
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:12,920
some kind of marketing thing, but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind.

1675
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:19,800
Is there the kind of man you want to be and would consider it a failure if you don't become that?

1676
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:21,880
That's what I meant by hero.

1677
02:42:21,880 --> 02:42:25,960
Yeah, not really. I don't perceive myself as having such an identity.

1678
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:38,520
And it's also sometimes frustrating. But it's basically a lack of having this notion of

1679
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:40,360
father that I need to be emulating.

1680
02:42:43,960 --> 02:42:49,720
It's interesting. I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river. I worry that...

1681
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:53,320
Sometimes it's more like being the river.

1682
02:42:56,680 --> 02:43:06,360
I'm just a fat frog sitting on a leaf on a dirty muddy lake.

1683
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:15,800
Waiting for a princess to kiss me. Or the other way. I forgot which way it goes.

1684
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:17,000
Somebody kisses somebody.

1685
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,880
Can I ask you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malis is, but

1686
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:28,760
in terms of constructing systems of incentives, it's interesting to ask.

1687
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:35,560
I don't think I've talked to you about this before. Malis espouses anarchism.

1688
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:43,080
So he sees all government as fundamentally getting in the way or even being destructive to

1689
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:50,360
collaborations between human beings thriving. What do you think?

1690
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:58,920
What's the role of government in a society that thrives? Is anarchism at all compelling to you

1691
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:04,040
as a system? Not just small government, but no government at all?

1692
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:07,320
Yeah, I don't see how this would work.

1693
02:44:09,720 --> 02:44:15,080
The government is an agent that imposes an offset on your reward function, on your payout

1694
02:44:15,080 --> 02:44:19,320
metrics, so your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.

1695
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:27,640
So the argument there is that you can have collectives, like governing organizations,

1696
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:33,560
but not government, like where you're born in a particular set of land, and therefore you must

1697
02:44:33,560 --> 02:44:43,960
follow this rule or else. You're forced by what they call violence, because there's an implied

1698
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:53,240
violence here. So the key aspect of government is it protects you from the rest of the world

1699
02:44:53,240 --> 02:45:01,560
with an army and with police. It has a monopoly on violence. It's the only one that's able to do

1700
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:06,760
violence. There are many forms of government. Not all governments do that, but we find that

1701
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:15,160
in successful countries, the government has a monopoly on violence. That means that you cannot

1702
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:19,320
get ahead by starting your own army, because the government will come down on you and destroy you

1703
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:24,360
if you try to do that. In countries where you can build your own army and get a way visit,

1704
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:29,000
some people will do it. These countries is what we call failed countries in a way.

1705
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:36,440
If you don't want to have violence, the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions of people,

1706
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:41,720
because some people will use strategies if they get ahead with them that feel a particular kind

1707
02:45:41,720 --> 02:45:48,120
of ecological niche. So you need to destroy that ecological niche. And if an effective government

1708
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:53,400
has a monopoly on violence, it can create a world where nobody is able to use violence

1709
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:58,600
and get ahead. So you want to use that monopoly on violence not to exert violence,

1710
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:04,440
but to make violence impossible, to raise the cost of violence. So people need to get ahead with

1711
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:10,280
nonviolent means. So the idea is that you might be able to achieve that in an anarchist state

1712
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:17,560
with companies. So with the forces of capitalism is create security companies

1713
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:23,320
where the one that's most ethically sound rises to the top. Basically, it would be a much better

1714
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:32,360
representative of the people, because there is less sort of stickiness to the big military force

1715
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:36,280
sticking around, even though it's long, overlived, outlived.

1716
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:41,640
So you have groups of militants that are hopefully officially organized, because otherwise they're

1717
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:46,760
going to lose against the other groups of militants, and they are coordinating themselves with the

1718
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:52,760
rest of society until they are having a monopoly on violence. How is that different from a government?

1719
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:56,120
So it's basically converging to the same thing.

1720
02:46:56,120 --> 02:47:01,080
So I think it always, in my, as I was trying to argue with Malice, I feel like it always converges

1721
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:06,360
towards government at scale. But I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives that are,

1722
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:14,120
you basically never let anything scale too big. So one of the problems with governments is it

1723
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:21,240
gets too big in terms of the size of the group over which it has control.

1724
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:30,600
My sense is that would happen anyway. So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook,

1725
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:37,800
it starts forming a monopoly over the entire populations, not over just hundreds of millions,

1726
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:45,000
but billions of people. So I don't know. But there is something about the abuses of power

1727
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:51,640
the government can have when it has a monopoly on violence. And so that's attention there.

1728
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:57,080
So the question is, how can you set the incentives for government correctly? And this

1729
02:47:57,080 --> 02:48:02,200
mostly applies at the highest levels of government. And we, because we haven't found a way to set

1730
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:07,080
them correctly, we made the highest levels of government relatively weak. And this is,

1731
02:48:07,080 --> 02:48:11,320
I think, part of the reason why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic response.

1732
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:17,720
And China didn't have that much difficulty. And there is, of course, a much higher risk of the

1733
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:24,200
abuse of power that exists in China, because the power is largely unchecked. And that's

1734
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:28,440
basically what happens in the next generation, for instance, imagine that we would agree that

1735
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:32,920
the current government of China is largely correct and by never limit. And maybe we don't agree on

1736
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:39,080
this. But if we did, how can we make sure that this stays like this? And if you don't have checks

1737
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:44,520
and balances and division of power, it's hard to achieve. You don't have a solution for that problem.

1738
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:49,720
But the abolishment of government basically would remove the control structure from a

1739
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:55,720
cybernetic perspective. There is an optimal point in the system that the regulation should be

1740
02:48:55,720 --> 02:49:00,840
happening, right? Where you can measure the current incentives and the regulator would

1741
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:06,120
properly incentivize to make the right decisions and change the payout metrics of everything below

1742
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:10,840
it in such a way that the local prisoners' dilemmas get resolved. You cannot resolve the

1743
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:17,080
prisoners' dilemma without some kind of eternal control that emulates an infinite game in a way.

1744
02:49:17,800 --> 02:49:25,800
Yeah. I mean, there's a sense in which it seems like the reason government, the parts of government

1745
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:35,240
that don't work well currently is because there's not good mechanisms through which to interact

1746
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:40,520
for the citizenry to interact with government is basically it hasn't caught up in terms of

1747
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:47,000
technology. And I think once you integrate some of the digital revolution of being able to

1748
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:53,080
have a lot of access to data, be able to vote on different ideas at a local level, at all levels,

1749
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:59,480
at the optimal level, like you're saying, that can resolve the prisoner dilemmas and to integrate

1750
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:08,600
AI to help you out, automate things that don't require the human ingenuity. I feel like that's

1751
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:14,520
where government could operate that well and can also break apart the inefficient bureaucracies,

1752
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:20,520
if needed. There'll be a strong incentive to be efficient and successful.

1753
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:25,800
So out human history, we see an evolutionary competition of modes of government and of

1754
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:30,520
individual governments as in these modes. And every nation state in some sense is some kind

1755
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:36,280
of organism that has found different solutions for the problem of government. And you could look at

1756
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:41,560
all these different models and the different scales at which it exists as empirical attempts to

1757
02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:49,080
validate the idea of how to build a better government. And I suspect that the idea of anarchism,

1758
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:56,200
similar to the idea of communism, is the result of being disenchanted with the ugliness of the real

1759
02:50:56,200 --> 02:51:03,000
existing solutions and the attempt to get to an utopia. And I suspect that communism originally

1760
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:08,520
was not a utopia. I think that in the same way as original Christianity, it had a particular kind

1761
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:15,240
of vision. And this vision is a society, a mode of organization within the society,

1762
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:22,920
in which humans can coexist at scale without coercion. The same way as we do in a healthy

1763
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:29,480
family. In a good family, you don't terrorize each other into compliance, but you understand what

1764
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:33,960
everybody needs and what everybody can is able to contribute and what the intended future of the

1765
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:39,480
whole thing is. And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way and informs each other

1766
02:51:39,480 --> 02:51:44,360
about how to do this and all the interactions that happen are instrumental to making that happen.

1767
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:50,680
Could this happen at scale? And I think this is the idea of communism. Communism is opposed to the

1768
02:51:50,680 --> 02:51:56,280
idea that we need economic terror or other forms of terror to make that happen. But in practice,

1769
02:51:56,280 --> 02:52:02,120
what happened is that the proto-communist countries, the real existing socialism, replaced a part of

1770
02:52:02,120 --> 02:52:07,480
the economic terror with moral terror. So we were told to do the right thing for moral reasons.

1771
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:12,200
And of course, it didn't really work and the economy eventually collapsed. And the moral

1772
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:17,640
terror had actual real cost. People were imprisoned because they were morally non-compliant.

1773
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:25,960
The other thing is that the idea of communism became a utopia. So it basically was projected

1774
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:32,040
into the afterlife. We were told in my childhood that communism was a hypothetical society

1775
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:36,280
to which we were in a permanent revolution that justified everything that was presently wrong

1776
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:41,880
with society morally. But it was something that our grandchildren probably would not ever see

1777
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:46,040
because it was too ideal and too far in the future to make it happen right now. And

1778
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:51,720
people were just not there yet morally. And the same thing happened with Christianity. This notion

1779
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:57,000
of heaven was mythologized and projected into an afterlife. And I think this was just the idea of

1780
02:52:57,080 --> 02:53:01,880
God's kingdom, of this world in which we instantiate the next level transcendental agent in the

1781
02:53:01,880 --> 02:53:07,240
perfect form. So everything goes smoothly and without violence and without conflict and without

1782
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:13,160
this human messiness on this economic messiness and the terror and coercion that existed in the

1783
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:18,840
present societies. And the idea of whether humans can exist at scale in a harmonious way

1784
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:24,440
non-coercively is untested. A lot of people tested it but didn't get it to work so far.

1785
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:29,560
And the utopia is a world in where you get all the good things without any of the bad things.

1786
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:35,560
And you are, I think, very susceptible to believe in utopias when you are very young and don't

1787
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:40,840
understand that everything has to happen in causal patterns, that there is always feedback loops that

1788
02:53:40,840 --> 02:53:45,800
ultimately are closed. There's nothing that just happens because it's good or bad. Good or bad

1789
02:53:45,800 --> 02:53:49,800
don't exist in isolation. They only exist with respect to larger systems.

1790
02:53:50,600 --> 02:54:00,360
So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems? So like having a utopia that's out there beyond

1791
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:08,040
the horizon, is it because then, it's not only because it's impossible to achieve utopias,

1792
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:14,920
but it's because what certain humans, certain small number of humans start to

1793
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:24,360
sort of greedily attain power and money and control and influence

1794
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:34,280
as they become, as they see the power in using this idea of a utopia.

1795
02:54:34,520 --> 02:54:38,760
It's a little like saying, why is my garden not perfect? It's because some evil weeds are

1796
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:44,760
overgrowing it and they always do. But this is not how it works. A good garden is a system that

1797
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:51,880
is in balance and requires minimal interactions by the gardener. And so you need to create a system

1798
02:54:51,880 --> 02:54:56,840
that is designed to self-stabilize. And the design of social systems requires not just the

1799
02:54:56,840 --> 02:55:01,800
implementation of the desired functionality but the next level design, also in biological systems.

1800
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:05,320
You need to create a system that wants to converge to the intended function.

1801
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:10,920
And so instead of just creating an institution like the FDA that is performing a particular kind

1802
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:17,160
of role in society, you need to make sure that the FDA is actually driven by a system that wants to

1803
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:22,680
do this optimally, that is incentivized to do it optimally and then makes the performance that is

1804
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:28,600
actually enacted in every generation instrumental to that thing, that actual goal. And that is much

1805
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:34,360
harder to design and to achieve. So you have to design a system where, and listen, communism also

1806
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:43,960
was quote unquote incentivized to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia. It just,

1807
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:47,960
it wasn't working given human nature. The incentives were not correct given human nature.

1808
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:53,240
So how do you incentivize people when they are getting coal off the ground to work as hard as

1809
02:55:53,240 --> 02:55:59,240
possible? Because it's a terrible job and it's very bad for your health. And right, how do you do

1810
02:55:59,240 --> 02:56:05,320
this? And you can give them prices and metals and status to some degree, right? There's only so much

1811
02:56:05,320 --> 02:56:10,120
status to give for that. And most people will not fall for this, right? Or you can pay them.

1812
02:56:11,240 --> 02:56:15,800
And you probably have to pay them in an asymmetric way because if you pay everybody the same and

1813
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:21,800
you nationalize the coal mines, eventually people will figure out that they can game the system.

1814
02:56:21,880 --> 02:56:29,080
Yes. So you're describing capitalism. Capitalism is the present solution to the system. And

1815
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:34,280
what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct in saying that capitalism is prone to

1816
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:40,680
crisis, that capitalism is a system that in its dynamics is not convergent but divergent.

1817
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:48,280
It's not a stable system. And that eventually it produces an enormous potential for productivity.

1818
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:53,960
But it also is systematically misallocating resources. So a lot of people cannot participate

1819
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:59,480
in the production and consumption anymore. And this is what we observe. We observe that

1820
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:05,480
the middle class in the US is tiny. A lot of people think that they're middle class,

1821
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:08,280
but if you are still flying economy, you're not middle class.

1822
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:14,600
Right. Every class is a menu to a smaller than the previous class.

1823
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:23,080
The thing about classes is really like airline classes.

1824
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:29,240
It's the no-play class. A lot of people are economy class. Business class and very few

1825
02:57:29,240 --> 02:57:35,000
are first class and summer budget. I mean, I understand. I think there is, yeah,

1826
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:39,640
maybe some people, probably I would push back against that definition of the middle class.

1827
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:44,200
It does feel like the middle class is pretty large, but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth.

1828
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:51,720
So think about the terms of the productivity that our society could have. There is no reason

1829
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:57,000
for anybody to fly economy. We would be able to let everybody travel in style.

1830
02:57:57,880 --> 02:58:03,160
Well, but also some people like to be frugal even when they're billionaires. So let's take

1831
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:08,440
that into account. Yes, but I mean, we probably don't need to be a traveling lavish, but you also

1832
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:13,400
don't need to be tortured, right? There is a difference between frugal and subjecting yourself

1833
02:58:13,400 --> 02:58:17,880
to torture. Listen, I love economy. I don't understand why you're comparing a flying economy

1834
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:25,480
to torture. Although the flight here, there's two crying babies next to me. But that has

1835
02:58:25,480 --> 02:58:32,200
nothing to do with crime babies. They're very cute though. I have two kids and sometimes I have

1836
02:58:32,200 --> 02:58:41,160
to go back to visit the grandparents and back means going from the west coast to Germany.

1837
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:47,480
And that's a long flight. Is it true that when you're a father, you grow immune to the crying

1838
02:58:47,480 --> 02:58:54,120
and all that kind of stuff? Because like me just not having kids, other people's kids can be quite

1839
02:58:54,120 --> 02:58:58,520
annoying when they're crying and screaming and all that kind of stuff. When you have children

1840
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:03,400
and you're wired up in a default natural way, you're lucky in this regard, you fall in love with

1841
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:09,640
them. And this falling in love with them means that you basically start to see the world through

1842
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:13,720
their eyes and you understand that in a given situation, they cannot do anything but

1843
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:21,000
being expressing despair. And so it becomes more differentiated. I noticed that, for instance,

1844
02:59:21,080 --> 02:59:29,480
my son is typically acting on a pure experience of what things are like right now. And he has

1845
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:34,920
to do this right now. And you have this small child that is, when he was a baby and so on,

1846
02:59:34,920 --> 02:59:39,080
where he was just immediately expressing what he felt. And if you cannot regulate this from the

1847
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:44,360
outside, there's no point to be upset about it. It's like dealing with weather or something like

1848
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:50,440
this. You all have to get through it. And it's not easy for him either. But if you also have

1849
02:59:51,160 --> 02:59:54,760
a daughter, maybe she is planning for that. Maybe she understands that

1850
02:59:56,520 --> 03:00:00,040
she's sitting in the car behind you and she's screaming at the top of her lungs and you're

1851
03:00:00,040 --> 03:00:04,920
almost doing an accident. And you really don't know what to do. What should I have done to

1852
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:07,720
make you stop screaming? You could have given me candy.

1853
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:14,600
I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion. I love it. Because you said the

1854
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:21,080
like a fundamental aspect of that is love that makes it all worth it.

1855
03:00:22,200 --> 03:00:29,480
What in this monkey riding an elephant in a dream world, what role does love play

1856
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:35,960
in the human condition? I think that love is the facilitator of non-transactual interaction.

1857
03:00:37,880 --> 03:00:43,480
When you are observing your own purposes, some of these purposes go beyond your ego. They go

1858
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:47,400
beyond the particular organism that you are and your local interests.

1859
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:49,240
That's what you mean by non-transactual.

1860
03:00:49,240 --> 03:00:52,760
Yes. So basically, when you are acting in a transactional way, it means that you are

1861
03:00:52,760 --> 03:00:57,400
respecting something in return for you from the one that you're interacting with.

1862
03:00:58,520 --> 03:01:02,360
You are interacting with a random stranger. You buy something from them on eBay. You expect

1863
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:07,000
a fair value for the money that you send them and vice versa because you don't know that person.

1864
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:11,080
You don't have any kind of relationship to them. But when you know this person a little bit better

1865
03:01:11,080 --> 03:01:15,320
and you know the situation that they're in, you understand what they try to achieve in their life

1866
03:01:15,320 --> 03:01:20,360
and you approve because you realize that they're in some sense serving the same

1867
03:01:20,360 --> 03:01:25,880
human sacredness as you are. They need to think that you have. Maybe you give it to them as a present.

1868
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:33,880
The feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit, is a kind of transaction.

1869
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:39,800
Yes, but the joy is not the point. The joy is the signal that you get. It's the reinforcement

1870
03:01:39,800 --> 03:01:44,920
signal that your brain sends to you because you are acting on the incentives of the agent that

1871
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:50,920
you're part of. We are meant to be part of something larger. That is the way in which we out-competed

1872
03:01:50,920 --> 03:02:00,920
other hominids. Take that, Neanderthals. Yes, and also other humans. There was a population

1873
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:07,960
bottleneck for human society that leads to an extreme lack of genetic diversity among humans.

1874
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:13,960
If you look at Bushmen in the Kalahari that basically tribes that are not that far

1875
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:19,080
distant to each other have more genetic diversity than exist between Europeans and Chinese.

1876
03:02:20,120 --> 03:02:25,480
That's because basically the out-of-Africa population at some point had a bottleneck

1877
03:02:25,480 --> 03:02:31,960
of just a few thousand individuals. What probably happened is not that at any time the number of

1878
03:02:31,960 --> 03:02:37,800
people shrunk below a few hundred thousand. What probably happened is that there was a small group

1879
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:42,360
that had a decisive mutation that produced an advantage. This group multiplied and killed

1880
03:02:42,360 --> 03:02:50,920
everybody else. We are descendants of that group. I wonder what the peculiar characteristics of

1881
03:02:50,920 --> 03:03:01,560
that group. We can only just listen to the echoes and the ripples that are still within us.

1882
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:08,600
I suspect what eventually made a big difference was the ability to organize at scale, to program

1883
03:03:08,600 --> 03:03:15,000
each other with ideas. That we became programmable, that we were willing to work on lockstep, that we

1884
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:21,240
went above the tribal level, that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals and

1885
03:03:21,240 --> 03:03:27,320
acted on direct reputation systems transactionally, but that we basically evolved an adaptation

1886
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:35,640
to become state building. To form collectives outside of the direct collectives.

1887
03:03:35,640 --> 03:03:41,000
Yes, and that's basically a part of us became committed to serving something outside of what

1888
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:46,120
we know. Then that's kind of what love is. It's terrifying because it meant that we

1889
03:03:46,120 --> 03:03:52,840
eradicated the others. It's a force. It's an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution,

1890
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:55,160
which means we displace something else that doesn't have that.

1891
03:03:56,680 --> 03:04:01,480
Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people that warned about love. Love led to destruction.

1892
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:07,320
They didn't have the same strong love as we did. That's why I mentioned this thing with fascism.

1893
03:04:07,320 --> 03:04:15,080
When you see these speeches, do you want total war? Everybody says yes. This is this big,

1894
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:20,040
oh my God, be a part of something that is more important than me that gives meaning to my existence.

1895
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:32,440
Fair enough. Do you have advice for young people today in high school, in college,

1896
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:39,800
that are thinking about what to do with their career, with their life, so that at the end of

1897
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:46,440
the whole thing, they could be proud of what they did? Don't cheat. Have integrity.

1898
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:51,800
Integrity. So what does integrity look like when you're at the river, or at the leaf,

1899
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:59,320
or the fat frog in a lake? It basically means that you try to figure out what the thing is that

1900
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:05,880
is the most right. This doesn't mean that you have to look for what other people tell you

1901
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:12,120
what's right, but you have to aim for moral autonomy. Things need to be right independently

1902
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:20,840
of what other people say. I always felt that when people told me to listen to what others say,

1903
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:26,520
like read the room, build your ideas of what's true based on the high status people of your

1904
03:05:26,520 --> 03:05:31,880
in-group, that does not protect me from fascism. The only way to protect yourself from fascism

1905
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:36,680
is to decide it's the world that is being built here, the world that I want to be in.

1906
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:43,480
Yeah. So in some sense, try to make your behavior sustainable. Act in such a way that you

1907
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:47,880
would feel comfortable on all sides of the transaction. Realize that everybody is you

1908
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:52,440
in a different timeline, but is seeing things differently and has reasons to do so.

1909
03:05:53,880 --> 03:06:00,600
Yeah. I've come to realize this recently. There is an inner voice that tells you what's right

1910
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:08,360
and wrong. And speaking of reading the room, there's times what integrity looks like is there's

1911
03:06:08,360 --> 03:06:14,280
times when a lot of people are doing something wrong and what integrity looks like is not going

1912
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:20,440
on Twitter and tweeting about it, but not participating quietly, not doing. So it's

1913
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:27,000
not like signaling or not all this kind of stuff, but actually living your what you think is right,

1914
03:06:27,880 --> 03:06:33,320
like living it. That's also sometimes this expectation that others are like us. So imagine

1915
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:37,880
the possibility that some of the people around you are space aliens that only look human.

1916
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:43,400
Right. So they don't have the same prayers as you do. They don't have the same

1917
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:48,920
impulses that what's right and wrong. There's a large diversity in these basic impulses that

1918
03:06:48,920 --> 03:06:53,640
people can have in a given situation. And now realize that you are a space alien.

1919
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:58,760
Right. You are not actually human. You think that you're human, but you don't know what it means,

1920
03:06:58,760 --> 03:07:03,160
like what it's like to be human. You just make it up as you go along like everybody else.

1921
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:10,280
And you have to figure that out what it means that you are a full human being, what it means to be

1922
03:07:10,280 --> 03:07:16,200
human in the world and how to connect with others on that. And there is also something, don't be

1923
03:07:16,200 --> 03:07:22,360
afraid in the sense that if you do this, you're not good enough. Because if you are acting on these

1924
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:27,320
incentives of integrity, you become trustworthy. That's the way in which you can recognize each

1925
03:07:27,320 --> 03:07:32,360
other. There is a particular place where you can meet and you can figure out what that place is,

1926
03:07:32,920 --> 03:07:38,360
where you will give support to people because you realize that they act with integrity,

1927
03:07:38,360 --> 03:07:42,360
and they will also do that. So in some sense, you are safe if you do that.

1928
03:07:43,720 --> 03:07:47,800
You're not always protected. There are people which will abuse you and that might,

1929
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:52,120
that are bad actors in a way that it's hard to imagine before you meet them.

1930
03:07:52,680 --> 03:07:56,840
But there is also people which will try to protect you.

1931
03:07:57,720 --> 03:08:02,600
Yeah, that's such a, thank you for saying that. There's such a hopeful message

1932
03:08:03,800 --> 03:08:09,880
that no matter what happens to you, there'll be a place, there's people you'll meet

1933
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:19,160
that also have what you have. And you will find happiness there and safety there.

1934
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:25,640
Yeah, but it doesn't need to end well. It can also all go wrong. So there's no guarantee in this life.

1935
03:08:25,640 --> 03:08:31,880
So you can do everything right and you still can fail. And horrible things happen to you that

1936
03:08:31,880 --> 03:08:36,680
traumatize you and mutilate you. And you have to be grateful if it doesn't happen.

1937
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:45,240
And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens, because even just being alive is pretty damn nice.

1938
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:53,400
Yeah, even that, you know. The gratefulness in some sense is also just generated by your brain

1939
03:08:53,400 --> 03:09:01,560
to keep you going. It's all the trick. Speaking of which, Camus said,

1940
03:09:02,760 --> 03:09:09,000
I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others

1941
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:14,040
paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living.

1942
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:18,200
What is called the reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.

1943
03:09:19,240 --> 03:09:23,800
I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.

1944
03:09:24,600 --> 03:09:33,640
So I have to ask what Josh Abok is the meaning of life. It is an urgent question according to Camus.

1945
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:41,240
I don't think that there's a single answer to this. Nothing makes sense unless a mind makes it so.

1946
03:09:41,240 --> 03:09:48,120
So you basically have to project a purpose. And if you zoom out far enough, there's the heat test

1947
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:52,280
of the universe and everything is meaningless. Everything is just a blip in between. And the

1948
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:58,680
question is, do you find meaning in this blip in between? Do you find meaning in observing squirrels?

1949
03:09:59,640 --> 03:10:04,600
Do you find meaning in raising children and projecting a multi-generational organism into

1950
03:10:04,600 --> 03:10:10,600
the future? Do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic of the world that you like to the future

1951
03:10:10,600 --> 03:10:16,280
and trying to serve that aesthetic? And if you do, then life has that meaning. And if you don't,

1952
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:25,560
then it doesn't. I enjoy the idea that you just create the most vibrant, the most weird,

1953
03:10:25,560 --> 03:10:31,880
the most unique kind of blip you can, given your environment, given your set of skills.

1954
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:43,560
Just be the most weird set of local pocket of complexity you can be. So that when people study

1955
03:10:43,560 --> 03:10:50,760
the universe, they'll pause and be like, that's weird. It looks like a useful strategy, but of

1956
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:57,640
course it's still motivated reasoning. You're obviously acting on your incentives here.

1957
03:10:57,640 --> 03:11:03,800
It's still a story we tell ourselves within a dream that's hardly in touch with the reality.

1958
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:05,880
It's definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.

1959
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:12,760
And a human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am.

1960
03:11:12,760 --> 03:11:15,000
Yeah, there's a mutual relationship somehow.

1961
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:22,600
Josh, you're one of the most incredible people I know. I really love talking to you. I love

1962
03:11:22,600 --> 03:11:27,320
talking to you again. And it's really an honor that you spend your valuable time with me. I hope

1963
03:11:27,320 --> 03:11:32,600
we get to talk many times throughout our short and meaningless lives.

1964
03:11:33,400 --> 03:11:34,520
More meaningful.

1965
03:11:34,520 --> 03:11:35,800
More meaningful.

1966
03:11:35,800 --> 03:11:37,800
Thank you, Alex. I enjoyed this conversation very much.

1967
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:42,760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yosha Bach. And thank you to

1968
03:11:42,760 --> 03:11:49,880
Coinbase, Codecademy, Linode, Netsuite, and ExpressVPN. Check them out in the description

1969
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:54,680
to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

1970
03:11:55,720 --> 03:12:01,000
People will do anything, no matter how absurd in order to avoid facing their own souls.

1971
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:07,160
One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness

1972
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:12,600
conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
