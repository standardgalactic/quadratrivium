00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
The following is a conversation with Sam Harris, his second time in the podcast. As I said two

00:05.360 --> 00:10.960
years ago, when I first met and spoke with Sam, he's one of the most influential pioneering thinkers

00:10.960 --> 00:17.120
of our time. As the host of the Making Sense podcast, creator of the Waking Up app, and the

00:17.120 --> 00:23.200
author of many seminal books on human nature and the human mind, including The End of Faith,

00:23.200 --> 00:30.640
The More Landscape, Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up. In this conversation, besides our mutual

00:30.640 --> 00:37.200
fascination with AGI and Free Will, we do also go deep into controversial, challenging topics

00:37.200 --> 00:44.160
of Donald Trump, Hunter Biden, January 6th, Vaccines, Lab Leak, Kanye West, and several

00:44.160 --> 00:50.640
key figures at the Center of Public Discourse, including Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, both of whom

00:50.640 --> 00:57.280
have been friends of Sam and have become friends of mine. Somehow, an amazing life trajectory

00:57.280 --> 01:03.280
that I do not deserve in any way and, in fact, believe is probably a figment of my imagination.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.640
And if it's alright, please allow me to say a few words about this personal aspect of the

01:08.640 --> 01:15.520
conversation of discussing Joe, Elon, and others. What's been weighing heavy on my heart since

01:15.520 --> 01:20.640
the beginning of the pandemic, now three years ago, is that many people I look to for wisdom

01:20.640 --> 01:26.400
in public discourse stop talking to each other as often, with respect, humility, and love,

01:26.400 --> 01:33.040
when the world needed those kinds of conversations the most. My hope is that they start talking again,

01:33.040 --> 01:37.280
they start being friends again, they start noticing the humanity that connects them,

01:37.280 --> 01:43.360
that is much deeper than the disagreements that divide them. So let me take this moment to say,

01:43.360 --> 01:49.520
with humility and honesty, why I look up to and am inspired by Joe, Elon, and Sam.

01:50.560 --> 01:56.320
I think Joe Rogan is important to the world, as a voice of compassion and curiosity, and open

01:56.320 --> 02:01.600
mindedness to ideas both radical and mainstream, sometimes with humor, sometimes with brutal

02:01.600 --> 02:08.640
honesty, always pushing for more kindness in the world. I think Elon Musk is important to the world

02:08.640 --> 02:13.520
as an engineer, leader, entrepreneur, and human being who takes on the hardest problems that

02:13.520 --> 02:19.040
face humanity and refuses to accept the constraints of conventional thinking that made the solutions

02:19.040 --> 02:26.000
to these problems seem impossible. I think Sam Harris is important to the world as a fearless

02:26.000 --> 02:32.960
voice who fights for the pursuit of truth against growing forces of echo chambers and audience capture,

02:32.960 --> 02:40.320
taking unpopular perspectives and defending them with rigor and resilience. I both celebrate

02:40.320 --> 02:45.600
and criticize all three privately, and they criticize me, usually more effectively,

02:45.600 --> 02:50.640
from which I always learn a lot and always appreciate. Most importantly, there is respect

02:50.640 --> 02:55.920
and love for each other as human beings, the very thing that I think the world needs most now,

02:55.920 --> 03:02.640
in a time of division and chaos. I will continue to try to mend divisions, to try to understand,

03:02.640 --> 03:09.840
not to ride, to turn the other cheek if needed, to return hate with love. Sometimes people criticize

03:09.840 --> 03:18.480
me for being naive, cheesy, simplistic, all of that. I know, I agree, but I really am speaking

03:18.480 --> 03:25.360
from the heart, and I'm trying. This world is too fucking beautiful not to try, in whatever way I know

03:25.440 --> 03:32.080
how. I love you all. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our

03:32.080 --> 03:37.520
sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sam Harris.

03:55.680 --> 04:01.680
I would argue, even a species of reason, it's just understanding another person's point of view.

04:01.680 --> 04:08.160
You understand why they're suffering or why they're happy, or you have a theory of mind

04:08.960 --> 04:16.800
about another human being that is accurate, and so you can navigate in relationship to them

04:16.800 --> 04:22.480
more effectively. And then there's another layer entirely, not incompatible with that,

04:22.480 --> 04:30.160
but just distinct, which is what people often mean by empathy, which is more a kind of emotional

04:30.160 --> 04:38.400
contagion. You feel depressed, and I begin to feel depressed along with you because it's just

04:38.400 --> 04:43.520
it's contagious. We're so close, and I'm so concerned about you, and your problems become

04:43.520 --> 04:51.600
my problems, and it bleeds through right now. I think both of those capacities are very important,

04:51.680 --> 05:01.600
but the emotional contagion piece, and this is not really my thesis, this is something I have

05:01.600 --> 05:09.120
more or less learned from Paul Bloom, the psychologist who wrote a book on this topic titled

05:09.120 --> 05:18.480
Against Empathy. The emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide, rather often for ethical

05:18.480 --> 05:24.880
behavior and ethical intuitions. So I'll give you the clear example of this, which is

05:27.520 --> 05:37.040
we find stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly empathize with

05:37.920 --> 05:45.280
far more compelling than data. So if I tell you, this is the classic case of the little girl who

05:45.280 --> 05:52.000
falls down a well, right? This is somebody's daughter, you see the parents distraught on

05:52.000 --> 05:57.440
television, you hear her cries from the bottom of the well, the whole country stops. I mean,

05:57.440 --> 06:02.720
this was an example of this 20, 25 years ago, I think, where it was just wall-to-wall on CNN.

06:02.720 --> 06:08.480
This is just the perfect use of CNN. It was 72 hours or whatever it was of continuous coverage

06:09.040 --> 06:14.400
just extracting this girl from a well. So we effortlessly pay attention to that,

06:14.400 --> 06:19.440
we care about it, we will donate money toward it. I mean, it's just, it marshals 100% of our

06:19.440 --> 06:26.320
compassion and altruistic impulse. Whereas if you hear that there's a genocide raging in some

06:26.320 --> 06:31.040
country you've never been to and never attended to go to, and the numbers don't make a dent,

06:31.040 --> 06:37.440
and we find the story boring, right? And we'll change the channel in the face of a genocide,

06:37.440 --> 06:43.520
right? It doesn't matter. And it literally, perversely, it could be 500,000 little girls

06:43.520 --> 06:49.200
have fallen down wells in that country, and we still don't care, right? So it's,

06:50.320 --> 06:53.840
you know, many of us have come to believe that this is a bug rather than a feature of our

06:53.840 --> 06:59.680
moral psychology. And so empathy plays an unhelpful role there. So ultimately, I think

07:00.720 --> 07:06.240
when we're making big decisions about what we should do and how to mitigate human suffering and

07:06.240 --> 07:13.760
what's worth valuing and how we should protect those values, I think reason is the better tool.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.280
But it's not that I would want to dispense with any part of empathy either.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.520
Well, there's a lot of danger to go on there. But briefly to mention, you've recently talked about

07:22.240 --> 07:28.960
effective altruism on your podcast. I think you mentioned some interesting statement. I'm going

07:28.960 --> 07:35.360
to horribly misquote you, but that you'd rather live in a world like it doesn't really make sense,

07:35.360 --> 07:39.360
but you'd rather live in a world where you care about maybe your daughter and son

07:40.000 --> 07:45.840
more than 100 people that live across the world, something like this. Where the calculus is not

07:45.840 --> 07:51.200
always perfect, but somehow it makes sense to live in a world where it's irrational in this way.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.640
And yet empathetic in the way you've been discussing.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.120
Right. I'm not sure what the right answer is there, or even whether there is one right answer.

07:59.120 --> 08:05.280
There could be multiple peaks on this part of the moral landscape. But so the opposition is

08:06.080 --> 08:12.080
between an ethic that's articulated by someone like the Dalai Lama or really any exponent of

08:14.000 --> 08:21.520
classic Buddhism would say that the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect

08:21.520 --> 08:29.360
to friends and strangers. The mind of the Buddha would be truly dispassionate. You would love

08:29.440 --> 08:37.120
and care about all people equally. And by that light, it seems some kind of ethical failing,

08:37.120 --> 08:44.400
or at least a failure to fully actualize compassion in the limit, or enlightened wisdom in the limit,

08:45.600 --> 08:52.880
to care more or even much more about your kids than the kids of other people, and to prioritize

08:52.880 --> 08:57.840
your energy in that way. So you spend all this time trying to figure out how to keep your kids

08:57.840 --> 09:03.280
healthy and happy, and you'll attend to their minutest concerns and however superficial.

09:05.200 --> 09:12.160
Again, there's a genocide raging in Sudan or wherever, and it takes up less than 1% of your

09:12.160 --> 09:18.320
bandwidth. I'm not sure it would be a better world if everyone was running the Dalai Lama program

09:18.320 --> 09:27.280
there. I think some prioritization of one's nearest and dearest ethically might be optimal

09:28.000 --> 09:33.920
because we'll all be doing that, and we'll all be doing that in a circumstance where

09:34.800 --> 09:43.520
we have certain norms and laws and other structures that force us to be dispassionate

09:43.520 --> 09:50.240
where that matters. When my daughter gets sick, and I have to take her to a hospital,

09:51.680 --> 09:56.160
I really want her to get attention, and I'm worried about her more than I'm worried about

09:56.160 --> 10:01.200
everyone else in the lobby. But the truth is, I actually don't want a totally corrupt hospital.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.920
I don't want a hospital that treats my daughter better than anyone else in the lobby because

10:05.920 --> 10:11.360
she's my daughter, and I've bribed the guy at the door, or the guy's a fan of my podcast,

10:11.360 --> 10:16.880
or whatever the thing is. You don't want starkly corrupt, unfair situations,

10:18.320 --> 10:25.680
and when you get pressed down the hierarchy of Maslow's needs individually and

10:25.680 --> 10:31.520
societally, a bunch of those variables change, and they change for the worse,

10:31.520 --> 10:37.280
understandably. But yeah, when everyone's corrupt and you're in a state of

10:38.960 --> 10:43.520
collective emergency, you've got a lifeboat problem, you're scrambling to get into the

10:43.520 --> 10:52.720
lifeboat, yeah, then fairness and norms and the other vestiges of civilization

10:53.680 --> 11:00.800
begin to get stripped off. We can't reason from those emergencies to normal life. I mean,

11:00.800 --> 11:06.640
in normal life, we want justice, we want fairness, we're all better off for it, even when

11:07.440 --> 11:12.720
the spotlight of our concern is focused on the people we know, the people who are friends,

11:12.720 --> 11:18.320
the people who are family, people we have good reason to care about. We still, by default,

11:18.320 --> 11:23.920
want a system that protects the interests of strangers too, and we know that generally speaking,

11:23.920 --> 11:28.560
and just in game theoretic terms, we're all going to tend to be better off in a fair system

11:29.120 --> 11:37.920
than a corrupt one. One of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data,

11:38.720 --> 11:45.680
just a good story will get us to not think clearly. But what about empathy in the context of just

11:45.680 --> 11:50.160
discussing ideas with other people? And then there's a large number of people like in this country,

11:51.280 --> 11:56.960
you know, red and blue, half the population believes certain things on immigration or on

11:57.920 --> 12:03.120
the response to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue, even if the election was

12:03.120 --> 12:11.440
fairly executed. Having an empathy for their worldview, trying to understand where they're

12:11.520 --> 12:16.880
coming from, not just in the explicit statement of their idea, but the entirety of the roots

12:16.880 --> 12:22.240
from which their ideas stems, that kind of empathy while you're discussing ideas, what is

12:22.960 --> 12:29.200
in your pursuit of truth, having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other people

12:31.040 --> 12:37.840
versus raw mathematical reason. I think it's important, but it only takes you so far. It

12:37.840 --> 12:47.200
doesn't get you to truth, right? Truth is not decided by democratic principles. And

12:49.040 --> 12:53.280
certain people believe things for understandable reasons, but those reasons are nonetheless

12:53.280 --> 12:57.520
bad reasons, right? They don't scale, they don't generalize. They're not reasons anyone

12:57.520 --> 13:06.000
should adopt for themselves or respect epistemologically. And yet their circumstance

13:06.000 --> 13:13.040
is understandable and it's something you can care about, right? I think there's many examples

13:13.040 --> 13:19.360
of this you might be thinking of, but one that comes to mind is I've been super critical of

13:19.360 --> 13:27.600
Trump, obviously, and I've been super critical of certain people for endorsing him or not

13:27.600 --> 13:34.400
criticizing him when he really made it patently obvious who he was, you know, if there had been

13:34.400 --> 13:41.840
any doubt initially, there was no doubt when we have a sitting president who's not agreeing

13:41.840 --> 13:51.200
to a peaceful transfer of power, right? So I'm critical of all of that, and yet the fact that

13:52.640 --> 13:59.600
many millions of Americans didn't see what was wrong with Trump or bought into the,

14:00.320 --> 14:04.400
didn't see through his con, right? I mean, they bought into the idea that he was a brilliant

14:04.400 --> 14:08.960
businessman who might just be able to change things because he's so unconventional and so,

14:09.600 --> 14:12.960
you know, his heart is in the right place, you know, he's really a man of the people,

14:12.960 --> 14:19.360
even though he's a, you know, gold-plated everything in his life. They bought the myth

14:19.360 --> 14:27.200
somehow of, you know, largely because they had seen him on television for almost a decade and a

14:27.200 --> 14:34.480
half pretending to be this genius businessman who could get things done. It's understandable to

14:34.480 --> 14:40.720
me that many very frustrated people who have not had their hopes and dreams actualized,

14:41.840 --> 14:49.280
who have been the victims of globalism and many other, you know, current trends,

14:50.000 --> 15:00.080
it's understandable that they would be confused and not see the liability of electing a grossly

15:00.080 --> 15:08.960
incompetent, morbidly narcissistic person into the presidency. So I don't, so which is to say

15:08.960 --> 15:14.080
that I don't blame, there are many, many millions of people who I don't necessarily blame for the

15:14.080 --> 15:20.880
Trump phenomenon, but I can nonetheless bemoan the phenomenon as indicative of, you know, very bad

15:22.320 --> 15:26.400
state of affairs in our society, right? So it's two levels to it. I mean, one is,

15:26.400 --> 15:31.280
I think you have to call a spade a spade when you're talking about how things actually work and what

15:31.280 --> 15:38.880
things are likely to happen or not, but then you can recognize that people have very different life

15:38.880 --> 15:44.560
experiences. And yeah, I mean, I think empathy and, you know, probably the better word for what I

15:45.360 --> 15:49.520
would hope to embody there is compassion, right? Like really, you know,

15:51.760 --> 15:56.480
to really wish people well, you know, and to really wish, you know, strangers well,

15:56.480 --> 16:00.560
effortlessly wish them well. I mean, to realize that there is no opposition between,

16:01.120 --> 16:05.840
at bottom, there's no real opposition between selfishness and selflessness because

16:06.720 --> 16:12.880
wise selfishness really takes into account other people's happiness. I mean, you know,

16:12.880 --> 16:18.320
which do you want to live in a society where you have everything, but most other people have nothing?

16:19.440 --> 16:24.000
Or do you want to live in a society where you're surrounded by happy, creative,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.080
self-actualized people who are having their hopes and dreams realized? I think it's

16:28.080 --> 16:34.720
obvious that the second society is much better, however much you can guard your good luck.

16:36.240 --> 16:42.240
But what about having empathy for certain principles that people believe? For example,

16:43.520 --> 16:48.400
the pushback, the other perspective on this, because you said bought the myth of Trump as

16:48.400 --> 16:53.520
the great businessman. There could be a lot of people that are supporters of Trump who could say

16:54.560 --> 17:00.880
that Sam Harris bought the myth that we have this government of the people by the people that

17:00.960 --> 17:06.800
actually represents the people as opposed to a bunch of elites who are running a giant bureaucracy

17:06.800 --> 17:11.760
that is corrupt, that is feeding themselves, and they're actually not representing the people.

17:11.760 --> 17:17.680
And then here's this chaos agent, Trump, who speaks off the top of his head. Yeah, he's flawed in

17:17.680 --> 17:24.320
all this number of ways. He's a more comedian than he is a presidential type of figure. And

17:24.960 --> 17:28.720
he's actually creating the kind of chaos that's going to shake up this bureaucracy,

17:29.440 --> 17:34.480
shake up the elites that are so uncomfortable because they don't want the world to know about

17:34.480 --> 17:40.080
the game that got running on everybody else. So that's the kind of perspective that they would

17:40.080 --> 17:45.600
take and say, yeah, there's these flaws that Trump has, but this is necessary.

17:45.600 --> 17:54.640
I agree with the first part. So I haven't bought the myth that it's a truly representative democracy

17:54.720 --> 18:02.320
in the way that we might idealize. On some level, I mean, this is a different conversation,

18:02.320 --> 18:06.560
but on some level, I'm not even sure how much I think it should be. I'm not sure

18:08.720 --> 18:16.640
we want, in the end, everyone's opinion given equal weight about just what we should do about

18:16.640 --> 18:19.600
anything. And I include myself in that. I mean, there are many topics around which

18:20.400 --> 18:25.680
I don't deserve to have a strong opinion because I don't know what I'm talking about or what I

18:25.680 --> 18:32.080
would be talking about if I had a strong opinion. And I think we'll probably get to that,

18:33.680 --> 18:37.360
to some of those topics because I've declined to have certain conversations on my podcast just

18:37.360 --> 18:43.360
because I think I'm the wrong person to have that conversation. And I think it's important to see

18:43.360 --> 18:51.280
those bright lines in one's life and in the moment politically and ethically. So yeah, I think

18:53.280 --> 19:01.680
so leave aside the viability of democracy, I'm under no illusions that all of our institutions

19:02.560 --> 19:08.400
are worth preserving precisely as they have been up until the moment. This great orange

19:08.400 --> 19:15.920
wrecking ball came swinging through our lives. But it was a very bad bet to elect someone who is

19:16.720 --> 19:27.040
grossly incompetent. And worse than incompetent, genuinely malevolent in his selfishness.

19:27.840 --> 19:33.760
And this is something we know based on literally decades of him being in the public eye. He's

19:33.840 --> 19:43.280
not a public servant in any normal sense of that term. And he couldn't possibly give an honest

19:43.280 --> 19:50.080
or sane answer to the question you asked me about empathy and reason and what should guide us.

19:52.320 --> 20:01.040
I genuinely think he is missing some necessary moral and psychological tools. I can feel

20:01.040 --> 20:06.240
compassion for him as a human being because I think having those things is incredibly important.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.640
And genuinely loving other people is incredibly important. And knowing what all that's about

20:10.640 --> 20:19.360
is really the good stuff in life. And I think he's missing a lot of that. But I think we don't

20:19.360 --> 20:26.880
want to promote people to the highest positions of power in our society who are far outliers in

20:26.880 --> 20:36.080
pathological terms. We want them to be far outliers in the best case, in wisdom and compassion

20:36.080 --> 20:41.280
and some of the topics you've brought up. I mean, we want someone to be deeply informed. We want

20:41.280 --> 20:50.320
someone to be unusually curious, unusually alert to how they may be wrong or getting things wrong

20:50.320 --> 20:56.400
consequentially. He's none of those things. And so far as we're going to get normal mediocrities

20:56.400 --> 21:02.080
in that role, which I think is often the best we could expect, let's get normal mediocrities

21:02.080 --> 21:12.240
in that role, not once in a generation narcissists and frauds. I mean, it's like

21:13.280 --> 21:17.920
we just take honesty as a single variable. I think you want, yes, it's possible that

21:18.640 --> 21:23.600
most politicians lie at least some of the time. I don't think that's a good thing.

21:24.640 --> 21:32.480
I think people should be generally honest, even to a fault. Yes, there are certain circumstances

21:32.480 --> 21:37.520
where lying I think is necessary. It's kind of on a continuum of self-defense and violence.

21:38.080 --> 21:43.280
So it's like if Nazis come to your door and ask you if you've got Anne Frank in the attic,

21:43.280 --> 21:54.080
I think it's okay to lie to them. But I arguably there's never been a person that anyone could

21:54.080 --> 22:01.600
name in human history who's lied with that kind of velocity. I mean, it's just, it was just a

22:01.600 --> 22:15.440
blizzard of lies, great and small, pointless and effective. But it says something

22:18.560 --> 22:25.200
fairly alarming about our society that a person of that character got promoted. And so, yes,

22:25.200 --> 22:29.440
I have compassion and concern for half of the society who didn't see it that way,

22:29.440 --> 22:36.160
and that's going to sound elitist and smug or something for anyone who's on that side

22:36.160 --> 22:43.280
listening to me. But it's genuine. I understand that I barely have the, I'm one of the luckiest

22:43.280 --> 22:47.600
people in the world, and I barely have the bandwidth to pay attention to half the things

22:47.600 --> 22:51.040
I should pay attention to in order to have an opinion about half the things we're going to

22:51.040 --> 22:57.680
talk about. So how much less bandwidth does somebody who's working two jobs or a single mom

22:57.680 --> 23:07.200
who's raising multiple kids, even a single kid, it's just unimaginable to me that people have

23:07.200 --> 23:13.200
the bandwidth to really track this stuff. And so then they jump on social media and they see,

23:13.200 --> 23:17.840
they get inundated by misinformation and they see what their favorite influencer just said.

23:19.360 --> 23:26.320
And now they're worried about vaccines and it's just, we're living in an environment where the

23:26.320 --> 23:33.120
information space becomes so corrupted and we've built machines to further corrupt it.

23:33.120 --> 23:41.200
We've built a business model for the internet that further corrupts it. So it's chaos in

23:41.200 --> 23:50.400
informational terms, and I don't fault people for being confused and impatient at their wit's end.

23:51.040 --> 24:00.160
And yes, Trump was an enormous fuck you to the establishment. And that was understandable

24:00.160 --> 24:05.840
for many reasons. To me, Sam Harris, the great Sam Harris, is somebody I've looked up to for a

24:05.840 --> 24:12.640
long time as a beacon of voice of reason. And there's this meme on the internet, and I would

24:12.640 --> 24:17.680
love you to steal me on the case for it and against that Trump broke Sam Harris' brain.

24:18.640 --> 24:24.560
That there is something is disproportionately to the actual impact that Trump had on our society.

24:24.560 --> 24:35.760
He had an impact on the ability of balanced, calm, rational minds to see the world clearly,

24:35.760 --> 24:42.560
to think clearly. You being one of the beacons of that. Is there a degree to which he broke your

24:42.640 --> 24:49.840
brain? Otherwise known as Trump derangement syndrome, medical condition.

24:49.840 --> 24:55.040
Yeah, I think Trump derangement syndrome is a very clever meme because it just

24:56.240 --> 25:01.760
throws the problem back on the person who's criticizing Trump. But in truth, the true

25:03.040 --> 25:09.600
Trump derangement syndrome was not to have seen how dangerous and divisive it would be to promote

25:09.600 --> 25:19.920
someone like Trump to that position of power. And in the final moment, not to see how untenable it

25:19.920 --> 25:26.880
was to still support someone sitting president who was not committing to a peaceful transfer

25:26.880 --> 25:32.480
of power. If that wasn't a bright line for you, you have been deranged by something.

25:33.040 --> 25:40.080
Because that was one minute to midnight for our democracy as far as I'm concerned. And I think

25:40.720 --> 25:51.120
it really was but for the integrity of a few people that we didn't suffer some real constitutional

25:51.120 --> 25:57.840
crisis and real emergency after January 6th. I mean, if Mike Pence had caved in

25:58.480 --> 26:04.000
and decided to not certify the election, literally you can count on two hands,

26:04.000 --> 26:10.560
a number of people who held things together at that moment. And so it wasn't for want of

26:10.560 --> 26:21.440
trying on Trump's part that we didn't succumb to some truly uncharted catastrophe with our

26:21.440 --> 26:28.320
democracy. So the fact that that didn't happen is not a sign that those of us who were worried that

26:28.320 --> 26:33.840
it was so close to happening were exaggerating the problem. I mean, it's like you almost got

26:33.840 --> 26:40.000
run over by a car, but you didn't. And so the fact that you're adrenalized and you're thinking,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
oh boy, that was dangerous, I probably shouldn't wander in the middle of the street

26:44.800 --> 26:49.440
with my eyes closed, you weren't wrong to feel that you really had a problem.

26:52.080 --> 26:57.680
And came very close to something truly terrible. So I think that's where we were,

26:57.680 --> 27:02.000
and I think we shouldn't do that again. So the fact that he's still, he's coming back around

27:02.000 --> 27:06.320
as potentially a viable candidate, I'm not spending much time thinking about it, frankly,

27:06.320 --> 27:14.560
because I'm waiting for the moment where it requires some thought. I mean, it took up,

27:14.560 --> 27:24.400
I don't know how many podcasts I devoted to the topic. It wasn't that many in the end against

27:24.400 --> 27:31.120
the number of podcasts I devoted to other topics, but there are people who look at Trump and just

27:31.120 --> 27:40.160
find him funny, entertaining, not especially threatening. It's just good fun to see somebody

27:40.720 --> 27:47.600
who's just not taking anything seriously, and it's just putting a stick in the wheel of business

27:47.600 --> 27:55.680
as usual again and again and again and again. And they don't really see anything much at stake.

27:56.720 --> 28:01.520
It doesn't really matter if we don't support NATO. It doesn't really matter if he says he trusts

28:01.520 --> 28:08.160
Putin more than our intelligence services. It doesn't matter if he's on the one hand

28:08.160 --> 28:16.320
saying that he loves the leader of North Korea and on the other, threatening to bomb them back

28:16.320 --> 28:22.800
to the Stone Age on Twitter. It all can be taken in the spirit of reality television. This is

28:22.800 --> 28:29.600
the part of the movie that's just fun to watch. And I understand that. I can even inhabit that

28:29.600 --> 28:36.720
space for a few minutes at a time, but there's a deeper concern that we're in the process of

28:36.800 --> 28:42.400
entertaining ourselves to death, that we're just not taking things seriously. And this is a problem

28:42.400 --> 28:49.760
I've had with several other people we might name who just appear to me to be goofing around at scale,

28:50.560 --> 28:55.360
and they lack a kind of moral seriousness. I mean, they're touching big problems

28:55.360 --> 29:01.200
where lives hang in the balance, but they're just fucking around. And I think there are really

29:01.200 --> 29:07.920
important problems that we have to get our heads straight around. And it's not to say that

29:07.920 --> 29:14.240
institutions don't become corrupt. I think they do. And I'm quite worried that both about the

29:14.240 --> 29:21.040
loss of trust in our institutions and the fact that trust has eroded for good reason,

29:21.040 --> 29:27.120
right? That they have become less trustworthy. They've become infected by political ideologies

29:27.120 --> 29:34.480
that are not truth tracking. I mean, I worry about all of that. But I just think we need

29:34.480 --> 29:40.960
institutions. We need to rebuild them. We need experts who are real experts. We need to value

29:40.960 --> 29:49.280
expertise over amateurish speculation and conspiracy thinking and bullshit.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.240
The kind of amateur speculation we're doing on this very podcast?

29:53.040 --> 30:00.080
I'm usually alert to the moments where I'm just guessing or where I actually

30:00.080 --> 30:05.440
feel like I'm talking from within my wheelhouse. And I try to telegraph that a fair amount with

30:05.440 --> 30:16.640
people. But it's different. I mean, you can invite someone onto your podcast who's an expert

30:16.720 --> 30:24.400
about something that you're not an expert about. And then you, in the process of getting

30:24.400 --> 30:29.120
more informed yourself, your audience is getting more informed. So you're asking smart questions,

30:29.120 --> 30:34.240
and you might be pushing back at the margins. But you know that when push comes to shove,

30:34.240 --> 30:41.840
on that topic, you really don't have a basis to have a strong opinion. And if you were going to

30:41.840 --> 30:46.800
form a strong opinion that was this counter to the expert you have in front of you,

30:46.800 --> 30:51.040
it's going to be by deference to some other expert who you've brought in or who you've

30:51.040 --> 30:55.440
heard about or whose work you've read or whatever. But there's a paradox to

30:56.400 --> 31:01.440
how we value authority in science that most people don't understand. And I think we should,

31:02.160 --> 31:07.920
at some point, unravel that because it's the basis for a lot of public confusion. And frankly,

31:07.920 --> 31:12.880
it's the basis for a lot of criticism I've received on these topics where people think that

31:15.680 --> 31:23.280
I'm against free speech or I'm an establishment shill or it's like I'm a credentialist,

31:23.280 --> 31:27.760
I just think people with PhDs from Ivy League universities should run everything.

31:28.560 --> 31:34.480
It's not true, but there's a lot to cut through to get to daylight there because people are

31:34.720 --> 31:41.920
very confused about how we value authority in the service of rationality generally.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.760
You've talked about it, but it's just interesting the intensity of feeling you have.

31:45.760 --> 31:52.880
You've had this famous phrase about Hunter Biden and children in the basement.

31:52.880 --> 32:00.160
Can you just revisit this case? So let me give another perspective on the situation of January

32:00.160 --> 32:08.320
6th and Trump in general. It's possible that January 6th and things of that nature revealed

32:08.320 --> 32:14.800
that our democracy is actually pretty fragile. And then Trump is not a malevolent and ultra

32:14.800 --> 32:23.040
competent malevolent figure, but is simply a jokester. And he just by creating the chaos revealed

32:23.040 --> 32:27.440
that it's all pretty fragile because you're a student in history and there's a lot of people

32:27.440 --> 32:35.760
like Vladimir Lenin, Hitler, who are exceptionally competent at controlling power, at being executives

32:35.760 --> 32:41.360
and taking that power, controlling the generals, controlling all the figures involved and certainly

32:41.360 --> 32:48.560
not tweeting but working in the shadows behind the scenes to gain power. And they did so extremely

32:48.560 --> 32:53.520
competently and that is how they were able to gain power. The pushback with Trump is he was doing

32:53.520 --> 33:02.400
none of that. He's very good at creating drama, sometimes for humor's sake, sometimes for drama's

33:02.400 --> 33:10.400
sake and simply revealed that our democracy is fragile. And so he's not this once in a generation

33:10.400 --> 33:22.480
horrible figure. Once in a generation narcissist. I don't think he's a truly scary sinister Putin-like

33:22.480 --> 33:27.120
or much less Hitler-like figure, not at all. I mean, he's not ideological. He doesn't care

33:27.120 --> 33:36.480
about anything beyond himself. So it's not... No, no, he's much less scary than any really scary

33:37.520 --> 33:42.720
totalitarian. And he's... He's more brave in your world than 1984.

33:42.720 --> 33:50.080
This is what Eric Weinstein never stops badgering me about, but he's still wrong, Eric.

33:50.480 --> 33:56.960
My analogy for Trump was that he's an evil Chauncey Gardner. I don't know if you remember

33:56.960 --> 34:05.360
the book or the film Being There with Peter Sellers. But Peter Sellers is this Gardner who

34:05.360 --> 34:11.360
really doesn't know anything, but he gets recognized as this wise man and he gets promoted to immense

34:11.360 --> 34:19.040
power in Washington because he's speaking in a semblance of wisdom. He's got these very simple

34:19.040 --> 34:24.080
aphorisms or it would seem to be aphorisms. All he cares about is gardening. He's just talking

34:24.080 --> 34:29.040
about his garden all the time. But he'll say something, but in the spring, the new shoots

34:29.040 --> 34:35.520
will bloom and people read into that some kind of genius insight politically. And so he gets

34:35.520 --> 34:40.800
promoted and says that's the joke of the film. For me, Trump has always been someone like an

34:40.800 --> 34:47.280
evil Chauncey Gardner. It's not to say he's totally... Yes, he has a certain kind of genius.

34:47.280 --> 34:53.680
He's got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself. He's got a genius for getting the eye of

34:53.680 --> 35:04.160
the media always coming back to him. But it's a kind of self-promotion that only works if you

35:04.160 --> 35:10.800
actually are truly shameless and don't care about having a reputation for anything that I or you

35:10.800 --> 35:16.880
would want to have a reputation for. It's like the pure pornography of attention. And he just

35:16.880 --> 35:24.800
wants more of it. I think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a

35:24.800 --> 35:33.280
country that at least half of the country, given how broken our society is in many ways,

35:33.840 --> 35:41.200
we have a country that didn't see anything wrong with that, bringing someone who obviously

35:41.200 --> 35:47.600
doesn't know what he should know to be president and who's obviously not a good person, who obviously

35:47.600 --> 35:53.040
doesn't care about people, can't even pretend to care about people really, in a credible way.

35:55.120 --> 36:01.760
And so if there's a silver lining to this, it's along the lines you just sketched,

36:01.760 --> 36:10.560
it shows us how vulnerable our system is to a truly brilliant and sinister figure. I think

36:10.560 --> 36:21.760
we really dodged a bullet. Someone far more competent and conniving and ideological could have

36:21.760 --> 36:31.200
exploited our system in a way that Trump didn't. So if we plug those holes eventually,

36:32.480 --> 36:35.200
that would be a good thing and he would have done a good thing for our society.

36:36.080 --> 36:41.120
One of the things we realized, and I think nobody knew, I certainly didn't know it and I

36:41.120 --> 36:48.640
didn't hear anyone talk about it, is how much our system relies on norms rather than laws.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.080
Yeah, civility almost.

36:50.080 --> 36:58.800
Yeah, it's quite possible that he never did anything illegal, truly illegal. I think he

36:58.800 --> 37:03.920
probably did a few illegal things, but illegal such that he really should be thrown in jail for it.

37:06.080 --> 37:13.840
At least that remains to be seen. So all of the chaos, all of the

37:14.960 --> 37:19.920
diminishment of our stature in the world, all of the just the opportunity costs of

37:19.920 --> 37:29.120
spending years focused on nonsense, all of that was just norm violations. All that was just all

37:29.120 --> 37:34.320
a matter of not saying the thing you should say, but that doesn't mean they're insignificant, right?

37:34.320 --> 37:38.720
It's not that it's like, it's not illegal for a sitting president to say,

37:40.080 --> 37:44.560
no, I'm not going to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, right? We'll wait and see

37:44.560 --> 37:52.960
whether I win. If I win, the election was valid. If I lose, it was fraudulent, right?

37:52.960 --> 37:59.760
But aren't those humorous perturbations to our system of civility such that we know where the

37:59.760 --> 38:03.840
limits are and now we start to think that and have these kinds of discussions?

38:04.160 --> 38:10.480
That wasn't a humorous perturbation because he did everything he could, granted he wasn't very

38:10.480 --> 38:17.120
competent, but he did everything he could to try to steal the election. I mean, the irony is he

38:17.120 --> 38:22.400
claimed to have an election stolen from him all the while doing everything he could to steal it,

38:22.400 --> 38:28.800
declaring it fraudulent in advance, trying to get the votes to not be counted as the evening

38:28.800 --> 38:33.200
war on, knowing that they were going to be disproportionately Democrat votes

38:34.400 --> 38:40.320
because of the position he took on mail-in ballots. I mean, all of it was fairly calculated,

38:41.360 --> 38:50.720
the whole circus of the clown car that crashed into four seasons landscaping, right? And you got

38:50.720 --> 38:56.000
Rudy Giuliani with his hair dye, and you got Sidney Powell and all these grossly incompetent

38:56.000 --> 39:02.480
people lying as freely as they could breathe about election fraud, right? And all of these

39:02.480 --> 39:08.000
things are getting thrown out by largely Republican election officials and Republican judges.

39:09.520 --> 39:15.040
It wasn't for want of trying that he didn't maintain his power in this country. He really

39:15.040 --> 39:20.000
tried to steal the presidency. He just was not competent, and the people around him weren't

39:20.000 --> 39:25.360
competent. So that's a good thing, and it's worth not letting that happen again.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.760
But he wasn't competent so he didn't do everything he could.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.840
Well, no, he did everything he could. He didn't do everything that could have been

39:31.840 --> 39:37.760
done by someone more competent. Right. But the tools you have as a president,

39:37.760 --> 39:41.040
you could do a lot of things. You can declare emergencies, especially during COVID,

39:41.040 --> 39:45.840
you could postpone the election, you can create military conflict that, you know,

39:45.840 --> 39:48.480
any kind of reason to postpone the election, there's a lot of...

39:48.480 --> 39:52.880
Well, he tried to do things, and he would have to have done those things through other people,

39:52.880 --> 39:56.800
and there are people who refuse to do those things. There are people who said they would

39:56.800 --> 40:03.120
quit. They would quit publicly. Again, there are multiple books written about

40:04.640 --> 40:11.920
the last hours of this presidency, and the details are shocking in what he tried to do

40:11.920 --> 40:17.680
and tried to get others to do, and it's awful, right? I mean, it's just awful that we were that

40:17.680 --> 40:27.680
close to something, to a true unraveling of our political process. I mean, it's the only time

40:27.680 --> 40:34.160
in our lifetime that anything like this has happened, and it's deeply embarrassing, right?

40:35.200 --> 40:39.120
On the world stage, it's just like we looked like a banana republic there for a while,

40:39.760 --> 40:49.120
and we're the lone superpower. It's not good, and so we shouldn't... There's no...

40:50.320 --> 40:54.880
The people who thought, well, we just need to shake things up, and this is a great way to

40:54.880 --> 41:00.160
shake things up, and having people storm our capital and smear shit on the walls,

41:00.160 --> 41:04.000
that's just more shaking things up, right? It's all just for the lulls.

41:04.640 --> 41:10.960
There's a nihilism and cynicism to all of that, which, again, in certain people, it's

41:10.960 --> 41:17.200
understandable. Frankly, it's not understandable if you've got a billion dollars and you have a

41:17.200 --> 41:21.520
compound in Menlo Park or wherever. There are people who are cheerleading this stuff,

41:21.520 --> 41:24.800
who shouldn't be cheerleading this stuff, and who know that they can get on their

41:25.360 --> 41:30.000
Gulf Stream and fly to their compound in New Zealand if everything goes to shit, right?

41:30.960 --> 41:34.960
There's a cynicism to all of that that I think we should be deeply critical of.

41:34.960 --> 41:42.000
What I'm trying to understand is not the behavior of this particular human being,

41:42.000 --> 41:50.320
but the effect it had in part on the division between people. To me, the degree, the meme

41:51.200 --> 41:54.160
of Sam Harris's brain being broken by Trump represents...

41:54.640 --> 41:59.440
You're like the person I would look to to bridge the division.

41:59.440 --> 42:08.320
Well, I don't think there is something profitably to be said to someone who's truly

42:09.280 --> 42:14.880
captivated by the personality cult of Trumpism, right? There's nothing that I'm going to say to...

42:15.760 --> 42:19.280
There's no conversation I'm going to have with Candace Owens, say, about Trump

42:19.280 --> 42:21.840
that's going to converge on something reasonable, right?

42:21.840 --> 42:22.800
You don't think so?

42:22.800 --> 42:26.160
No. I haven't tried with Candace, but I've tried with many people who

42:27.360 --> 42:31.840
are in that particular orbit. I mean, I've had conversations with people who

42:33.360 --> 42:37.600
won't admit that there's anything wrong with Trump, anything.

42:37.600 --> 42:41.360
So I'd like to push for the empathy versus reason, because when you operate in the

42:41.360 --> 42:48.640
space of reason, yes. But I think there's a lot of power in you showing, in you, Sam Harris,

42:48.640 --> 42:53.760
showing that you're willing to see the good qualities of Trump, publicly showing that.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.480
I think that's the way to win over the Candace Owens.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.600
But he has so few of them. He has fewer good qualities than virtually anyone I can name,

43:01.600 --> 43:08.000
right? So he's funny. I'll grant you that he's funny. He's a good entertainer.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.360
Does others look at just policies and actual impacts he had?

43:11.360 --> 43:16.080
I've admitted that. No, no. So I've admitted that many of his policies I agree with,

43:16.960 --> 43:23.120
many, many of his policies. So probably more often than not, at least on balance, I agree.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.120
I agreed with his policy that we should take China seriously as an adversary, right?

43:29.680 --> 43:36.160
And I think, I mean, again, there's a lot of fine print to a lot of this, because

43:36.880 --> 43:42.000
the way he talks about these things and many of his motives that are obvious are things that I

43:42.720 --> 43:49.120
don't support, but we take immigration. I think it's obvious that we should have control of our

43:49.120 --> 43:55.440
borders. I don't see the argument for not having control of our borders. We should let in who we

43:55.440 --> 43:59.680
want to let in, and we should keep out who we want to keep out, and we should have a sane

43:59.680 --> 44:05.120
immigration policy. So I didn't necessarily think it was a priority to build the wall,

44:05.120 --> 44:11.360
but I never criticized the impulse to build the wall, because if tens of thousands, hundreds

44:11.360 --> 44:15.040
of thousands of people are coming across that border and we are not in a position to know who's

44:15.040 --> 44:22.000
coming, that seems untenable to me. And I can recognize that many people in our society

44:23.200 --> 44:30.160
are on balance the victims of immigration. And there is, in many cases, a zero-sum contest

44:30.160 --> 44:35.440
between the interests of actual citizens and the interests of immigrants, right? So I think we

44:35.440 --> 44:40.560
should have control of our borders. We should have a sane and compassionate immigration policy.

44:41.040 --> 44:51.600
We should let in refugees, right? So Trump on refugees was terrible. But I would say 80% of

44:51.600 --> 45:04.320
the policy concerns people celebrated in him are concerns that I either share entirely or

45:04.320 --> 45:09.840
certainly sympathize with, right? So that's not the issue. The issue is...

45:10.640 --> 45:12.880
A threat to democracy in some fundamental way.

45:12.880 --> 45:18.320
The issue is largely what you said it was. It's not so much the person, it's the effect on

45:18.320 --> 45:26.480
everything he touches, right? He has this superpower of deranging and destabilizing

45:28.400 --> 45:33.120
almost everything he touches and sullying and compromising the integrity of almost anyone who

45:33.120 --> 45:38.400
comes into his orbit. I mean, so you looked at these people who served as chief of staff or in

45:38.400 --> 45:45.680
various cabinet positions, people who had real reputations for probity and level-headedness,

45:46.560 --> 45:53.680
whether you shared their politics or not. I mean, these were real people. Some of them were goofballs.

45:54.480 --> 46:06.720
But many people who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by him

46:06.720 --> 46:14.800
when they finally parted company with him, yeah. I mean, it's just people bent over backwards to

46:14.800 --> 46:23.200
accommodate his norm violations and it was bad for them and it was bad for our system.

46:24.080 --> 46:34.640
But none of that discounts the fact that we have a system that really needs a proper house

46:34.640 --> 46:42.160
cleaning. Yes, there are bad incentives and entrenched interests and I'm not a fan of the

46:42.160 --> 46:49.280
concept of the deep state because it's been so propagandized. But yes, there's something like

46:49.280 --> 47:00.160
that that is not flexible enough to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment.

47:00.720 --> 47:04.080
There's a lot of rethinking of government and of institutions in general that I think

47:06.080 --> 47:13.200
we should do, but we need smart, well-informed, well-intentioned people to do that job. The

47:13.200 --> 47:25.760
well-intentioned part is hugely important. Just give me someone who is not the most selfish person

47:25.760 --> 47:32.480
anyone has ever heard about in their lifetime. What we got with Trump was literally the one

47:32.480 --> 47:38.640
most selfish person I think anyone could name. Again, there's so much known about this, man.

47:38.640 --> 47:46.560
That's the thing. It predates his presidency. We knew this guy 30 years ago and this is what

47:46.560 --> 47:52.160
to come back to those inflammatory comments about Hunter Biden's laptop. The reason why I can say

47:52.160 --> 48:00.000
with confidence that I don't care what was on his laptop is that includes any evidence of

48:00.000 --> 48:05.200
corruption on the part of his father. Now, there's been precious little of that that's actually

48:05.200 --> 48:11.360
emerged. As far as I can tell, there's not a big story associated with that laptop as much as

48:11.360 --> 48:20.560
people bang on about a few emails. Even if there were just obvious corruption, Joe Biden was at

48:20.560 --> 48:29.280
this meeting and he took this amount of money from this shady guy for bad reasons. Given how

48:29.280 --> 48:34.400
visible the lives of these two men have been, given how much we know about Joe Biden and how

48:34.400 --> 48:38.640
much we know about Donald Trump and how they have lived in public for almost as long as I've

48:38.640 --> 48:47.040
been alive, both of them, the scale of corruption can't possibly balance out between the two of

48:47.040 --> 48:53.680
them. If you show me that Joe Biden has this secret life where he's driving a Bugatti and he's

48:53.680 --> 48:59.920
living like Andrew Tate and he's doing all these things I didn't know about, then I'm going to

49:00.000 --> 49:05.360
start getting a sense that, all right, maybe this guy is way more corrupt than I realized. Maybe

49:05.360 --> 49:10.800
there is some deal in Ukraine or with China that is just like this guy is not who he seems. He's

49:10.800 --> 49:15.840
not the public servant. He's been pretending to be. He's been on the take for decades and decades,

49:15.840 --> 49:22.160
and he's just, he's as dirty as can be. He's all mobbed up and it's a nightmare and he can't be

49:22.160 --> 49:28.560
trusted. That's possible if you show me that his life is not at all what it seems. But on the

49:28.560 --> 49:35.920
assumption that having looked at this guy for literally decades and knowing that every journalist

49:35.920 --> 49:42.640
has looked at him for decades, just how many affairs is he having? Just how many drugs is he

49:42.640 --> 49:50.800
doing? How many houses does he have? What are the obvious conflicts of interest? You hold that

49:50.800 --> 49:58.000
against what we know about Trump, right? And I mean, the litany of indiscretions you can put

49:58.000 --> 50:03.840
on Trump's side that testify to his personal corruption, to testify to the fact that he has

50:03.840 --> 50:09.600
no ethical compass, there's simply no comparison. So that's why I don't care about what's on the

50:09.600 --> 50:16.400
laptop. Now, if you tell me Trump is no longer running for president in 2024 and we can put

50:16.400 --> 50:22.320
Trumpism behind us, and now you're saying, listen, there's a lot of stuff on that laptop that makes

50:22.960 --> 50:29.760
Joe Biden look like a total asshole. Okay, I'm all ears, right? I mean, in 2020, it was a force

50:29.760 --> 50:35.680
choice between a sitting president who wouldn't commit to a peaceful transfer of power and a guy

50:35.680 --> 50:45.520
who's obviously too old to be president, who has a crack addicted son who lost his laptop,

50:46.240 --> 50:52.720
and I just knew that I was going to take Biden in spite of whatever litany of horrors was going

50:52.720 --> 50:57.200
to come tumbling out of that laptop. And that might involve sort of, so the actual quote is,

50:57.200 --> 51:03.120
Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in the basement. There's a dark humor

51:03.120 --> 51:07.520
to it, right? Which is, I think you speak to, I would not have cared. There's nothing, it's Hunter

51:07.520 --> 51:12.240
Biden, it's not Joe Biden. Whatever the scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, it is infinitesimally

51:12.240 --> 51:17.200
compared to the corruption. We know Trump was involved in, it's like a firefly to the sun,

51:17.200 --> 51:23.120
is what you're speaking to. But let me make the case that you're really focused on the surface

51:23.120 --> 51:30.000
stuff, that it's possible to have corruption that masquerades in the thing we mentioned,

51:30.000 --> 51:35.360
which is civility. You can spend hundreds of billions of dollars or trillion towards the war

51:37.120 --> 51:41.360
in the Middle East, for example, something that you've changed your mind on in terms of

51:41.360 --> 51:46.480
the negative impact that it has on the world. And that, the military industrial complex,

51:47.760 --> 51:52.560
everybody's very nice, everybody's very civil, just very upfront. Here's how we're spending the

51:52.560 --> 51:58.400
money. Yeah, sometimes somehow disappears in different places, but that's the way war is

51:58.400 --> 52:03.760
complicated. And it's everyone is very polite. There's no Coke and strippers or whatever is on

52:03.760 --> 52:09.360
the laptop. It's very nice and polite. And then meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of civilians

52:09.360 --> 52:17.360
die of hate. Just an incredible amount of hate is created because people lose their family members,

52:17.360 --> 52:20.320
all that kind of stuff, but there's no strippers and Coke on a laptop.

52:21.920 --> 52:30.960
But it's not just superficial. It is when someone only wants wealth and power and fame,

52:32.320 --> 52:39.040
that is their objective function. They're like a robot that is calibrated just to those variables.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.480
And they don't care about the risks we run on any other front. They don't care about

52:48.400 --> 52:54.640
environmental risk, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation risk, none of it. They're just

52:54.640 --> 53:03.120
tracking fame and money and whatever can personally redound to their self-interest

53:03.120 --> 53:07.360
along those lines. And they're not informed about the other risks we're running really.

53:07.920 --> 53:13.600
In Trump, you had a president who was repeatedly asking his generals, why couldn't we use our

53:13.600 --> 53:18.240
nuclear weapons? Why can't we have more of them? Why do I have fewer nuclear weapons than JFK?

53:19.040 --> 53:27.680
As though that were a sign of anything other than progress. And this is the guy who's got

53:28.880 --> 53:34.880
the button. Somebody's following him around with a bag waiting to take his order to launch.

53:37.360 --> 53:46.320
That is a risk we should never run. One thing Trump has going for him, I think, is that he

53:47.120 --> 53:54.000
doesn't drink or do drugs. People allege that he does speed, but let's take him in his word.

53:54.560 --> 54:02.160
He's not deranging himself with pharmaceuticals, at least, apart from Diet Coke.

54:02.480 --> 54:08.240
There's nothing wrong, just for the record, when you push back on that, there's nothing wrong

54:08.240 --> 54:12.000
with Diet Coke. We could see a very large amount. I occasionally have some myself.

54:12.000 --> 54:17.440
There's no scientific evidence that I observed the negatives of all those studies about

54:17.440 --> 54:26.400
aspartame and all that. I hope you're right. Everything you said about the military industrial

54:26.400 --> 54:32.000
complex is true. We've been worrying about that on both sides of the aisle for

54:32.480 --> 54:47.040
a very long time. That phrase came from Eisenhower. So much of what ails us is a story of bad

54:47.040 --> 54:56.400
incentives. Bad incentives are so powerful that they corrupt even good people. How much more do

54:56.400 --> 55:04.640
they corrupt bad people? At minimum, you want reasonably good people, at least non-pathological

55:04.640 --> 55:13.360
people in the system trying to navigate against the grain of bad incentives. Better still,

55:14.320 --> 55:21.360
all of us can get together and try to diagnose those incentives and change them. We will really

55:21.360 --> 55:30.080
succeed when we have a system of incentives where the good incentives are so strong that even

55:30.080 --> 55:35.520
bad people are effortlessly behaving as though they're good people because they're so successfully

55:35.520 --> 55:42.800
incentivized to behave that way. So it's almost the inversion of our current situation. So yes,

55:43.680 --> 55:51.040
and you say I changed my mind about the war, not quite. I was never a supporter of the

55:51.040 --> 55:56.640
war in Iraq. I was always worried that it was a distraction from the war in Afghanistan. I was a

55:56.640 --> 56:04.320
supporter of the war in Afghanistan, and I will admit in hindsight, that looks like at best a

56:04.320 --> 56:12.480
highly ambiguous and painful exercise, more likely a fool's errand. It did not turn out well.

56:13.200 --> 56:20.800
It wasn't for want of trying. I have not done a deep dive on all of the failures there,

56:21.360 --> 56:26.240
and maybe all of these failures are failures in principle. Maybe that's not the kind of thing

56:26.240 --> 56:33.440
that can be done well by anybody, whatever our intentions. But yeah, the move to Iraq always

56:33.440 --> 56:41.520
seemed questionable to me, and when we knew the immediate problem at that moment, Al-Qaeda,

56:43.040 --> 56:53.120
was in Afghanistan, and then bouncing to Pakistan. Anyway, so yes, but my

56:54.400 --> 57:03.360
sense of the possibility of nation building, my sense of, insofar as the neocon

57:03.920 --> 57:13.360
spirit of responsibility and idealism, that America was the kind of nation that should

57:13.920 --> 57:17.440
be functioning in this way as the world's cop, and we have to get in there and

57:18.480 --> 57:25.760
untangle some of these knots by force rather often, because if we don't do it over there,

57:25.760 --> 57:31.200
we're going to have to do it over here kind of thing. Yeah, some of that has definitely changed

57:31.200 --> 57:36.480
for me in my thinking. There are obviously cultural reasons why it failed in Afghanistan,

57:36.480 --> 57:44.560
and if you can't change the culture, you're not going to force a change at gunpoint

57:45.120 --> 57:49.600
in the culture, or it certainly seems that that's not going to happen, and it took us

57:50.800 --> 57:54.880
over 20 years to apparently to realize that. That's one of the things you realize with the

57:54.880 --> 58:00.160
wars. There's not going to be a strong signal that things are not working. If you just keep

58:00.160 --> 58:04.640
pouring money into a thing, a military effort. Well, also, there are signs of it working too.

58:04.640 --> 58:09.840
You have all the stories of girls now going to school, right? The girls are getting battery

58:09.840 --> 58:14.640
acid thrown in their faces by religious maniacs, and then we come in there and we stop that,

58:15.200 --> 58:20.160
and now girls are getting educated, and that's all good, and our intentions are good there,

58:20.160 --> 58:25.440
and we're on the right side of history there. Girls should be going to school. Malala Yosef

58:26.400 --> 58:31.280
should have the Nobel Prize, and she shouldn't have been shot in the face by the Taliban, right?

58:34.160 --> 58:39.040
We know what the right answers are there. The question is, what do you do when there are enough,

58:39.040 --> 58:44.560
in this particular case, religious maniacs, who are willing to die and let their children die in

58:44.560 --> 58:52.640
defense of crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the 7th century? It's a problem we

58:52.640 --> 58:58.320
couldn't solve, and we couldn't solve it even though we spent trillions of dollars to solve it.

58:58.320 --> 59:05.440
This reminded me of the thing that you and Jack Dorsey jokingly had for a while,

59:06.000 --> 59:11.920
the discussion about banning Donald Trump from Twitter, but does any of it bother you

59:11.920 --> 59:20.240
and all the Twitter files came out? It has to do with the Hunter Biden laptop story.

59:20.960 --> 59:26.000
Does it bother you that there could be a collection of people that make decisions about

59:26.000 --> 59:33.680
who to ban or not, and that that could be susceptible to bias and to ideological influence?

59:34.240 --> 59:41.760
Well, I think it always will be, or in the absence of perfect AI, it always will be.

59:41.760 --> 59:46.800
And this becomes relevant with AI as well, because there's some censorship on AI happening,

59:46.800 --> 59:48.480
and it's an interesting question there as well.

59:48.480 --> 59:53.760
I don't think Twitter is as important as people think it is. And I used to think it was more

59:53.760 --> 01:00:03.280
important when I was on it, and now that I'm off of it, I think it's just an unambiguously good

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.800
thing in my experience to leach your Twitter account. Even the good parts of Twitter that I

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:18.880
miss were bad in the aggregate, the degree to which it was fragmenting my attention,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:26.720
the degree to which my life was getting doled out to me in periods between those moments where I

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:34.560
checked Twitter and had my attention diverted. And I was not a crazy Twitter addict. I was

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.680
probably a pretty normal user. I was not someone who was tweeting multiple times a day or even

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:47.920
every day. I think I probably averaged something like one tweet a day, I think I averaged. But

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.560
in reality, it would be like four tweets one day, and then I wouldn't tweet for the better part of

01:00:52.560 --> 01:01:00.640
a week. But I was looking a lot because it was my newsfeed. I was just following 200 very smart

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.400
people, and I just wanted to see what they were paying attention to, and they would recommend

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.960
articles, and I would read those articles. And then when I would read an article, then I would

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.080
thought, I should signal boost, I would tweet. And so all of that seemed good, and that's all

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:19.680
separable from all of the odious bullshit that came back at me in response to this, largely in

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:30.560
response to this Hunter Biden thing. But even the good stuff has a downside, and it comes at

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:40.960
this point of your phone is this perpetual stimulus which is intrinsically fragmenting

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.640
of time and attention. And now my phone is much less of a presence in my life. And it's not that

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:56.720
I don't check Slack or check email. I use it to work. But my sense of just what the world is,

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.720
and my sense of my place in the world, the sense of where I exist as a person,

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.120
has changed a lot by deleting my Twitter account. And the things that I think,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.400
I mean, we all know this phenomenon. We say if someone, that person is too online. What does it

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:22.480
mean to be too online? And where do you draw that boundary? How do you know what constitutes being

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:29.520
too online? Well, in some sense, just being, I think being on social media at all is to be too

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:39.680
online. I mean, given what it does to, given the kinds of information, it signal boosts. And

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:50.480
the impulse it kindles in each of us to reach out to our audience in specific

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.160
moments and in specific ways. There are lots of moments now where I have an opinion about

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.000
something, but there's nothing for me to do with that opinion. There's no Twitter. So there are

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.080
lots of things that I would have tweeted in the last months that are not the kind of thing I'm

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.800
going to do a podcast about. I'm not going to roll out 10 minutes on that topic on my podcast.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.560
I'm not going to take the time to really think about it. But had I been on Twitter,

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.120
I would have reacted to this thing in the news or this thing that somebody did, right?

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.480
What do you do with that thought now? I just let go of it.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.040
Like chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.640
Yeah. It's usually not that sort of thing, but it's just, but then you look at the kinds of

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.920
problems people create for themselves. You look at the life deranging and reputation

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:45.040
destroying things that people do. And I look at the things that have, the analogous things that

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.200
have happened to me. I mean, the things that have really bent my life around professionally

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:56.240
over the past decade. So much of it is Twitter. I mean, honestly, in my case,

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.760
almost 100% of it was Twitter. The controversies I would get into,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.400
the things I would think I would have to respond to in a pod, like I would release a podcast on

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:11.360
a certain topic, I would see some blowback on Twitter. It would give me the sense that there

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.720
was some signal that I really had to respond to. Now that I'm off Twitter, I recognize that most

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.080
of that was just, it was totally specious, right? It was not something I had to respond to.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.640
But yet I would then do a cycle of podcasts responding to that thing that like taking my

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.120
foot out of my mouth or taking someone else's foot out of my mouth. And it became this self-perpetuating

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:46.720
cycle, which, I mean, if you're having fun, great. I mean, if it's generative of useful

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:57.120
information and engagement professionally and psychologically, great. And there was some of

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:03.520
that on Twitter. I mean, there were people who I connected with because I just, one of us DMed

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.120
the other on Twitter and it was hard to see how that was going to happen otherwise. But

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:15.920
it was largely just a machine for manufacturing unnecessary controversy.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.720
Do you think it's possible to avoid the drug of that? So now that you've achieved this zen state,

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:26.080
is it possible for somebody like you to use it in a way that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool?

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.720
And so anytime there's a tax, you just, I mean, that's how I tried to use it.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:37.520
Yeah, but it's not the way I wanted to use it. It's not the way it promises itself as a...

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.560
You wanted to have debate.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.600
I wanted to actually communicate with people. I wanted to hear from the person because,

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:51.920
again, it's like being in Afghanistan. There are the potted cases where it's obviously good.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.080
In Afghanistan, the girl who's getting an education, that is just here. That's why we're here. That's

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.160
obviously good. I've had those moments on Twitter where it's like, okay, I'm hearing from a smart

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:08.720
person who's detected an error I made in my podcast or in a book or they've just got some

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.000
great idea about something that I should spend time on. And I would never have heard from this

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.400
person in any other format. And now I'm actually in dialogue with them. And it's fantastic.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.760
That's the promise of it, to actually talk to people. And so I kept getting lured back into that.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:34.000
No, the same or sanity-preserving way of using it is just as a marketing channel. You just

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000
put your stuff out there and you don't look at what's coming back at you. And I'm on other

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.840
social media platforms that I don't even touch. I mean, my team posts stuff on Facebook and on

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.080
Instagram. I never even see what's on there.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.480
So you don't think it's possible to see something and not let it affect your mind?

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.000
No, that's definitely possible. But the question is, and I did that for vast

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.560
stretches of time. But then the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:17.440
If I know for whatever reason, I'm going to see 99 to 1 awful feedback, bad faith feedback,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.400
malicious feedback. Some of it's probably even bots and I'm not even aware of who's a person

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:29.520
who's a bot. But I'm just going to stare into this funhouse mirror of acrimony and dishonesty.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:39.520
The reason why I got off is not because I couldn't recalibrate and find equanimity again

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.560
with all the nastiness that was coming back at me and not that I couldn't ignore it for

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:52.160
vast stretches of time. But I could see that I kept coming back to it, hoping that it would

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.320
be something that I could use, a real tool for communication. And I was noticing that it was

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:04.560
insidiously changing the way I felt about people, both people I know and people I don't know.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.200
Mutual friends of ours who are behaving in certain ways on Twitter, which just seemed insane to me.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.120
That became a signal I felt like I had to take into account somehow. You're seeing people at

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:25.440
their worst, both friends and strangers. And I felt that as much as I could try to recalibrate for it,

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.960
I felt that I was losing touch with what was real information because people are performing,

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.440
people are faking, people are not themselves or you're seeing people at their worst.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:46.000
And so I felt like, all right, was being advertised to me here on a not just a daily basis,

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:53.280
an hourly basis or an increment sometimes of multiple times an hour. I probably checked Twitter

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.880
at minimum 10 times a day and maybe I was checking it 100 times a day on some days,

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.680
right, where things were really active and I was really engaged with something.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:14.400
What was being delivered into my brain there was subtly false information

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:24.880
about how dishonest and just generally unethical,

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:34.000
totally normal people are capable of being. It is a funhouse mirror. I was seeing the most

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.400
grotesque versions of people who I know. People who I know I could sit down at dinner with and

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.440
they would never behave this way. And yet they were coming at me on Twitter. It was essentially

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:56.960
turning ordinary people into sociopaths. People are just, and there are analogies that many of

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.920
us have made. It's like one analogy is road rage. People behave in the confines of a car

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.600
in ways that they never would if they didn't have this metal box around them moving at speed.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:15.120
All of that becomes quite hilarious and obviously dysfunctional when they actually

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.160
have to stop at the light next to the person they just flipped off. They didn't understand

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.640
that the person coming out of that car next to them with cauliflower ear is someone who they

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.280
never would have rolled their eyes at in public because they would have taken one look at this

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.640
person and realized this is the last person you want to fight with.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.280
That's one of the heartbreaking things is to see people who I know, who I admire,

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:49.200
who I know are friends, be everything from snarky to downright mean derisive towards each other.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.880
It doesn't make any sense. This is the only place where I've seen people I really admire

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.960
who have had a calm head about most things really be shitty to other people. It's probably the only

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.960
place I've seen that. I choose to maybe believe that that's not really them. There's something

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:14.480
about the system. If you go paintballing, if you, Jordan Peterson, and you're going to shoot your

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.680
friends. Yeah, you're going to shoot your friends, but you kind of accept that that's kind of what

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.640
you're doing in this little game that you're playing, but it's sometimes hard to remind yourself of

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.800
that. I think I was guilty of that definitely.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.280
I don't think I ever did anything that I really feel bad about, but yeah, it was always pushing

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:49.920
me to the edge of snideness somehow. It's just not healthy. The reason why I deleted my Twitter

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:57.920
account in the end was that it was obviously making me a worse person. Is there some way to be on

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.040
there where he's not making you a worse person? I'm sure there is, but given the nature of the

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:09.440
platform and given what was coming back at me on it, the way to do that is just to basically

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.640
use it as a one-way channel of communication, just marketing. I was like, here's what I'm paying

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:21.920
attention to, look at it if you want to, and you just push it out, and then you don't look at what's

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.480
coming back at you. I put out a call for questions on Twitter, and then actually quite surprising,

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.200
there's a lot of good, I mean, they're like, even if they're critical, they're like being thoughtful,

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.920
which is nice. I used it that way too, and that was what kept me hooked. But then there's also

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:46.880
TouchBalls69 wrote a question. I can't imagine. This is part of it. One way to solve this is,

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.800
we've got to get rid of anonymity for this. Let me ask the question. Ask Sam why he sucks was the

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:59.680
question. That's good. Well, one reason why I sucked was Twitter, and I've since solved that

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:08.160
problem. TouchBalls69 should be happy that I suck a little bit less now that I'm off Twitter,

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.520
and don't have to hear from TouchBalls69 on the regular.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.480
The fact that you have to see that, it probably can have a negative effect,

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:26.160
even a moderation, just to see that there is, for me, the negative effect is slightly losing faith

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.880
in the underlying kindness of humanity. You can also just reason your way out of it,

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.360
saying that this is anonymity, and this is kind of fun, and this is kind of just the

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.520
shit show of Twitter, it's okay, but it does mentally affect you a little bit.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:53.600
I don't read too much into that kind of comment. It's just that's just trolling. I understand

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.680
the fun the person is having on the other side of that. It's like- Do you though?

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.880
Well, I do. I don't behave that way, but I do, and for all I know, that person could be 16 years

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:13.520
old. It could be also an altar con for Elon, I don't know. I'm pretty sure Elon would just

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.040
tweet that under his own name at this point. Oh, and you love each other.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.640
Okay, so do you think, so speaking of which, now that Elon has taken over Twitter,

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.680
is there something that he could do to make this platform better?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.520
This Twitter and just social media in general, but because of the aggressive nature of his

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:41.920
innovation that he's pushing, is there any way to make Twitter a pleasant place for Sam Harris?

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:49.920
Maybe. I don't know. I think I'm agnostic as to whether or not he or anyone could

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.040
make a social media platform that really was healthy.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:57.520
So you were just observing yourself week by week, seeing the effect that's on your mind,

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.000
and on how much you're actually learning and growing as a person, and it was negative?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.440
Yeah, and I also seen the negativity in other people's lives. I mean, it's obviously-

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.680
he's not going to admit it, but I think it's obviously negative for Elon, right? It's just

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.160
it's- that was one of the things that- when I was looking into the Funhouse Mirror,

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.120
I was also seeing the Funhouse Mirror on his side of Twitter, and it was just even more

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.080
exaggerated. It's like, when I was asking myself, why is he spending his time this way,

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:35.200
I then reflected on why was I spending my time this way to a lesser degree,

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:43.440
and at lesser scale, and at lesser risk, frankly, right? And so- and it was just so-

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.560
it's not just Twitter. I mean, it's- this is in part an internet phenomenon. It's like the

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:58.560
whole Hunter Biden mess that you- you explored. That was based on- I mean, I was on somebody's

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.480
podcast, but that was based on a clip taken from that podcast, which was highly misleading as to

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:11.440
the general shape of my remarks on that podcast. Even, you know, I had to then do my own podcast

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.920
untangling all of that and admitting that even in the full context, I was not speaking especially

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.360
well and didn't say exactly what I thought in a way that was- would have been recognizable to

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:30.960
anyone, you know, even someone with not functioning by a- a spirit of charity, but- but the clip was

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.160
quite distinct from the podcast itself. The reality is, is that we're living in an environment now

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:44.080
where people are so lazy and their- their- their attention is so fragmented that they- they only

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:51.760
have time for clips, but 99% of people will see a clip and will assume there's no relevant context

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:57.520
I need to understand what happened in that clip, right? And obviously, the people who make those

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.360
clips know that, right? And they're doing that- doing it quite maliciously. And in this case,

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.040
the person who made that clip and subsequent clips of other podcasts was quite maliciously trying to

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:18.400
engineer, you know, some reputational emulation for me. And being signal boosted by Elon and other

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.960
prominent people who can't take the time to watch anything other than a clip, even when it's their

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:30.400
friend or someone who's ostensibly their friend in that clip, right? So it's a total failure- an

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:36.560
understandable failure of ethics that everyone is so short on time and they're so fucking lazy

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.960
that the ch- and- and- and that we now have these contexts in which we react so quickly to things,

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:53.200
right? Like Twitter is inviting an- an instantaneous reaction to this clip that it's- it's just too

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.200
tempting to just say something and not know what you're even commenting on. And most- most of the

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:06.240
people who saw that clip don't understand what I- what I actually think about any of these issues.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:12.000
And the irony is people are going to find clips from this conversation that are just as misleading

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.200
and they're going to export those and then people are going to be dunking on those clips.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:21.680
And, you know, we're all living and dying by clips now and it's- it's dysfunctional.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.600
See, I- I think it's possible to create a platform- I- I think we will keep living on clips,

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.720
but, you know, when I saw that clip of you talking about children and so on,

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.840
just knowing that you have a sense of humor, you- we just went to a dark place in terms of humor.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.240
Right.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:42.400
So, like, I didn't even bother and then I knew that the way clips work is that people will use it for

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.640
virality's sake, but the giving- giving a person benefit of the doubt- that's not even the right

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:56.560
term. It's not like I was- it's really, like, interpreting it in the context of the past.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:02.560
The truth is- the truth is you even need- like, I even give Trump the benefit of the doubt when I

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.120
see a clip of Trump. I mean, so- because there are famous clips of Trump that are very misleading

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.600
as to what he was saying in context. And I've been honest about that. Like, the whole, you know,

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.280
there were good people on both sides scanned all around the- his remarks after Charlottesville

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:25.760
that the clip that got exported and got promoted by everyone, you know, left of center, from Biden

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:33.280
on down, you know, the New York Times, CNN, there's nobody that I'm aware of who has honestly,

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.240
you know, apologized for what they did with that clip. That- he did not say what he seemed to be

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:45.680
saying in that clip about the Nazis at Charlottesville, right? And I have always been very clear about

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:55.600
that. So it's just, you know, I- even people who I think should be marginalized and people who-

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.840
who should be defenestrated because they really are terrible people who are doing dangerous

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:11.280
things and for bad reasons, I think we should be honest about what they actually meant in context,

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:17.520
right? And this goes to anyone else we might talk about, you know, who's more- where the case

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:25.840
is much more confusing. But yeah, so everyone's- it's just so- and then I'm sure we're going to get

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:33.040
to AI, but, you know, the prospect of being able to manufacture clips with AI and deep fakes

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
and that where it's going to be hard for most people most of the time to even figure out that

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:44.080
whether they're in the presence of something real, you know, forget about being divorced from

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:51.840
context. There was no context. I mean, that is- that's a misinformation apocalypse that is- we

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.040
are right on the cusp of and, you know, it's terrifying. Well, it could be just a new world

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.240
like where Alice going to Wonderland or humor is the only thing we have and it will save us.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:08.240
Maybe in the end, Trump's approach to social media was the right one after all. Nothing is

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:13.760
true and everything's absurd. But we can't live that way. People function on the basis of what

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:18.000
they assume is true, right? They think, you know- People have functioned.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.920
To do anything. It's like, I mean, you have to know what you think is going to happen

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:29.280
or you have to at least give a probabilistic waiting over the future. Otherwise, you're-

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.920
you're going to be incapacitated by- you're not gonna- like people want certain things and they

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.200
have to have a rational plan to get those desires gratified. And they don't want to die. They don't

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.920
want their kids to die. You tell them that there's a comet hurtling toward earth and they should get

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:49.040
outside and look up, right? They're going to do it. And if it turns out it's misinformation, you

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:56.480
know, it's- it's going to matter because it comes down to like, what medicines do you give your

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.000
children, right? Like, we're going to be manufacturing fake journal articles. I mean,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:09.520
this is- I'm sure someone's using chat gpt for- for this reader as we speak. And if it's not

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:15.680
credible- if it's not persuasive now to most people, I mean, honestly, I don't think we're

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:24.000
going to- I'll be amazed if it's a year before we can actually create journal articles that would

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.600
take, you know, a PhD to debunk that are completely fake. And there are people who are celebrating

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:41.920
this kind of, you know, coming cataclysm. But I just- it's just- there are the people who

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.200
don't have anything to lose who are celebrating it or just are so confused that they just don't

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.520
even know what's at stake. And then there are the people who have met- the few people who

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.680
we could count on a few hands who have managed to insulate themselves or at least imagine they've

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:01.280
insulate- insulated themselves from the downside here enough that they're not implicated in the

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.200
great unraveling we are witnessing or could- could witness.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.320
The shaking up of what is true. So actually that returns us to experts. Do you think experts can

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:15.360
save us? Is there such thing as expertise and experts in something? How do you know if you've

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.640
achieved it? I think it's- it's important to acknowledge upfront that this- there's something

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:27.760
paradoxical about how we relate to- to authority, especially within science.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.960
And I don't think that paradox is going away. And it's just- it doesn't have to be confusing.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.800
It's just- and it's not- it's not truly a paradox. It's just like there are different moments in

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:47.840
time. So it is true to say that within science or within any- within rationality, generally,

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.240
I mean just whenever you're making- having a fact-based discussion about anything,

01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.320
it is true to say that the truth or falsity of a statement does not even slightly depend

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:07.120
on the credentials of the person making the statement, right? So it doesn't matter if you're

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.680
a Nobel laureate, you can be wrong, right? The thing you could- the last sentence you spoke could

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.520
be total bullshit, right? And it's also possible for someone who's deeply uninformed

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.160
to be right about something or to be right for the wrong reasons, right? Or someone just gets

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.320
lucky or someone- or- or- and there- there are middling cases where you have like a- a backyard

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.000
astronomer who's got no credentials, but he just loves astronomy and he's got a telescope and it's-

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.920
he spends a lot of time looking at the night sky and he discovers a comet that no one else has seen,

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:46.720
you know, not even the professional expert astronomers. I mean, I gotta think that happens

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.000
less and less now, but- but some version of that keeps happening and it may always keep happening

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:04.320
in every area of expertise, right? So it's true that truth is orthogonal to the reputational

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:11.520
concerns we have among apes who are talking about the truth. But it is also true that most of the

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:21.120
time real experts are much more reliable than frauds or people who are not experts, right?

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.880
So- and expertise really is a thing, right? And when it's- you know, when you're flying an airplane

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:32.800
in a- in a storm, you don't want just randos come into the cockpit saying, listen, I've got a new

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.520
idea about how to- you know, how we should tweak these controls, right? You want someone who's a

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.160
trained pilot and- and that training gave them something, right? It gave them a set of

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:48.080
competences and intuitions and they- they know what all those dials and switches do, right?

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:54.720
And I don't, right? I shouldn't be flying that plane. So when things really matter,

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:04.080
you know, and put in this at 30,000 feet in a storm sharpens this up, we want real experts

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:11.680
to be in charge, right? And we are at 30,000 feet a lot of the time on a lot of issues, right?

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.880
And whether they're public health issues, whether it's issue- whether it's a geopolitical emergency

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:23.520
like Ukraine, I mean, the climate change, I mean, just pick your- pick your topic.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:32.160
There are real problems and the clock is rather often ticking and their solutions are

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:39.840
non-obvious, right? And so expertise is a thing and deferring to experts much of the time

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:49.600
makes a lot of sense. It's- at minimum, it- it prevents- it has spectacular errors of incompetence

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:58.000
and- and just, you know, foolhardiness. But even in- in the case of some- where you're talking

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.520
about someone- I mean, people like ourselves who are like, we're well-educated, we- we're not the

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.880
worst possible candidates for, you know, the- the Dunning-Kruger effect. When we're going into a new

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.240
area where we're not experts, we're fairly alert to the possibility that we don't- you know, it's

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.520
not as simple as things seem at first and we don't- you know, we don't know how our tools translate

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.720
to this new area. We can be fairly circumspect, but we're also- because we're well-educated,

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:31.440
we- we can work- and we're pretty quick studies, we can learn a lot of things pretty fast and we

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:41.840
can begin to play a language game that sounds fairly expert, right? And in that case, the- the

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:49.760
invitation to do your own research, right, is in- when- when times are good, I view as an invitation

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:56.560
to waste your time pointlessly, right? When times are good. Now, the truth is, times are not all

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:04.320
that good, right? And we have the- the ongoing public display of failures of expertise. We have

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.920
experts who are obviously corrupted by bad incentives. We've got experts who, you know,

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.560
perversely won't admit they were wrong when they, in fact, you know, are demonstrated to be wrong.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:20.160
We've got institutions that have been captured by political ideology that's not truth tracking,

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:27.920
and this- this whole woke encroachment into really every place, you know, whether it's

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.040
universities or science journals or government or- I mean, it's just like that is- that has

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:40.320
been genuinely deranging. So there's a lot going on that- where- where experts- and- and the very

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.960
concept of expertise has seemed to discredit itself, but the reality is that there is a

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.960
massive difference. When anything matters, when there's anything to know about anything,

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.400
there is a massive difference most of the time between someone who has really done the work

01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:02.400
to understand that domain and someone who hasn't. And if I get sick or someone close to me gets sick,

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.600
you know, I- I have a PhD in neuroscience, right? So I can read a medical journal article

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.480
and understand a lot of it, right? And I- you know, so I'm- I'm just fairly conversant with,

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.160
you know, medical terminology. And I understand its methods and I- I'm alert to the difference

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.240
because I've- you know, because in neuroscience, I've spent hours and hours in journal clubs,

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.680
you know, diagnosing, you know, analyzing the difference between good and bad studies,

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.640
I'm- I'm alert to the difference between good and bad studies in- in medical journals,

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.960
right? And I understand that bad studies can get published and, you know, et cetera,

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:45.440
and- and experiments can be poorly designed. I'm alert to all of those things, but when I get sick

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:50.720
or when someone close to me gets sick, I don't pretend to be a doctor, right? I- I've got no

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:56.640
clinical experience. I don't go down the rabbit hole on Google for days at a stretch trying to

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:02.880
become a doctor, much less a specialist in the domain of problem that has been visited upon me

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.400
or my family, right? So if someone close to me gets cancer, I don't pretend to be an oncologist.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.280
I don't go out and start- I don't start reading, you know, in journals of oncology

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.560
and try to really get up to speed as an oncologist because it's- it's not- it's-

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:32.320
one is a bad and potent- and very likely misleading use of my time, right? And it's

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:39.120
if I decide- if I had- if I had a lot of runway, if I decided, okay, it's really important for me

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.680
to know everything I can. At this point, I want to- I know someone's going to get cancer. I may

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.080
not go back to school and become an oncologist, but what I want to do is I want to know everything

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.960
I can know about cancer, right? So I'm going to take the next four years and spend most of my

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.840
time on cancer. Okay, I could do that, right? I still think that's a waste of my time.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:03.520
Uh, I still think at the end of- even at the end of those four years, I'm not going to be the best

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:09.120
person to- to form intuitions about what to do in the face of the next cancer that- that I have to

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:16.720
confront. Um, I'm still going to want a better oncologist than I've become to tell me what he

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.800
or she would do if they were in my shoes or in the shoes of, you know, my family member.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.760
I'm going to- you know, I'm- what I'm- what I'm not advocating- I'm not advocating a-

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:33.200
a blind trust and authority. Like, if you get cancer and you're talking to one oncologist and

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.120
they're recommending some course of treatment, by all means get a second opinion, get a third

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:42.640
opinion, right? But it matters that those opinions are coming from real experts and not from,

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:49.840
you know, Robert Kennedy Jr., you know, who's telling you that, you know, you got it because

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.120
you got a- you know, a vaccine, right? It's like, it's just it- it- it- there's- we're swimming in

01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:01.280
a sea of misinformation where you've got people who are moving the opinions of millions of others

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:10.560
who- who should not have an opinion on these topics. Like, there's no- there is no scenario

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.400
in which you should be getting your opinion about vaccine safety or- or climate change or

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.680
uh, the war in Ukraine or anything else that we might want to talk about from

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.720
Candace Owens, right? It's just like it- like she- she's not a relevant expert on any of those

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:34.240
topics and what's more, she doesn't seem to care, right? And- and- and she's living in a culture

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:41.760
that has- that has amplified that not caring into a business model, an effective business model,

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.680
right? So it's just- it's um- and there's something very Trumpian about all that,

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.880
or like that's- that's the pro- the problem is- is the culture, it's not these- these specific

01:32:50.880 --> 01:33:00.560
individuals. Um, so- so the paradox here is that expertise is a real thing and we defer to it a lot

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:08.480
as a- as a labor-saving device and it's just as- and just based on the- the reality that

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.400
it's very hard to be a polymath, right? And specialization is a thing, right? And so the

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.560
people who specialize in a very narrow topic, they know more about that topic than the next guy,

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:23.920
no matter how smart that- that guy or gal is, uh, and- and that- those differences matter,

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:34.080
but it's also true that when you're talking about facts, sometimes the- the- the best experts are

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:39.840
wrong. The scientific consensus is wrong. You get a- a- a sea change in the thinking of a whole

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:46.720
field because one person who's an outlier for whatever reason decides, okay, I'm- uh, you know,

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:53.280
I'm gonna prove this point and they prove it, right? So somebody like, uh, the doctor who, uh,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.320
believed that- that stomach ulcers were not due to stress, but were due to- to, um,

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.520
H. pylori infections, right? So he just drank a vial of H. pylori bacteria and- and proved

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:09.200
that- and quickly got an ul- ulcer and convinced the field that- that at minimum H. pylori was

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:17.840
involved in- in that process. Okay, so yes, everyone was wrong. That doesn't disprove the reality of

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.240
expertise. It doesn't disprove the utility of relying on experts most of the time, especially

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.960
in an emergency, especially when the clock is ticking, especially when you're- you know, you're-

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:34.720
you're in this particular cockpit and you only have one chance to land this plane, right? You

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:42.880
want the real pilot, uh, at the controls. But there's just a few things to say. Go. So one,

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.120
you mentioned this example with cancer and doing your own research. There- there's several things

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:53.280
that are different about our particular time in history. One, doing your own research has become

01:34:53.280 --> 01:35:00.000
more and more effective because you can read- the internet made information a lot more accessible,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.280
so you can read a lot of different meta-analyses. You can read blog posts that describe to you

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.720
exactly the flaws in the different papers they make up the meta- meta-analyses. They- and- and

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.240
you can read a lot of those blog posts that are conflicting with each other, and you can take

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:23.760
that information in- in a short amount of time. You can start to make, um, good faith

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.880
interpretations. For example, I don't know, I don't want to overstate things, but, um, if you

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.960
suffer from depression, for example, then there- you could go to an expert and a doctor that

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.240
prescribes you some medication, but you could also challenge some of those ideas and seeing, like,

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.280
what are the different medications? What are the different side effects? What are the different

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.080
solutions to depression? All that kind of stuff. And I think depression is just a really difficult

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:55.040
problem that's very, um, I don't want to, again, state incorrect things, but I think it's- there's

01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:01.040
a lot of variability of what depression really means, so it- being introspective about the type

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.240
of depression you have and the different possible solutions you have, just doing your own research

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:12.080
as a first step before approaching a doctor or as you have multiple opinions could be very beneficial

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.960
in that case. Now, that's depression. That's something that's been studied for a very long time

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:25.120
with a new pandemic that's affecting everybody. It's, uh, you know, with the airplane equated

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:32.400
to, like, 9-11 or something. Like, the new emergency just happened and everybody, every

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:38.560
expert in the world is publishing on it and talking about it. So doing your own research there could

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:45.280
be exceptionally effective in asking questions. And then there's a difference between experts,

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:51.920
virologists, and it's actually a good question. Who is exactly the expert in a pandemic? Yeah. But

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:58.560
there's the actual experts doing the research and publishing stuff, and then there's the

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:07.680
communicators of that expertise. And the question is, uh, if the communicators are flawed to- to a

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.120
degree where doing your own research is actually the more effective way to figure out policies and

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.840
solutions, because you're not competing with experts. You're competing with the communicators

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:24.080
of expertise. That could be WHO, CDC, in the case of the pandemic, or politicians, or political

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:31.760
type of science figures like Anthony Fauci. There's a question there of the effectiveness of doing

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:40.080
your research- your own research in that context. And the competing forces there, incentives that

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.840
you've mentioned, is you can become quite popular by being contrarian, by saying everybody's lying

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.000
to you, all the authorities are lying to you, all the institutions are lying to you. So those are the

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.520
waters you're swimming in. But I think doing your own research in that kind of context could be

01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:02.400
quite effective. Let me be clear. I'm not saying you shouldn't do any research, right? I'm not

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.080
saying that you shouldn't be informed about an issue. I'm not saying you shouldn't read

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.600
articles on- on whatever the topic is. And yes, if I got cancer or someone close to me got cancer,

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.040
I- I- I- I probably would read more about cancer than I've read thus far about cancer. And I've read

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:26.720
some. So I'm not- I'm not making a virtue of ignorance and a blind obedience to authority.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.960
And I- and again, I recognize that- that authorities can discredit themselves or they can

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.920
be wrong. They can be wrong even when they- when there's no discredit. There's just- there's a

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:44.640
lot we don't understand about the- the nature of the world. But still this- this vast gulf

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:55.040
between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists. It always exists. And- and conspiracy thinking is

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:03.120
rather often, you know, most of the time, the species of bullshit, but it's not always wrong,

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:08.480
right? There are real conspiracies and there- there really are just awful

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:15.520
corruptions of, you know, but born of bad incentives within our, you know, our scientific

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.720
processes within institutions. And again, we've mentioned a lot of these things in passing,

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:27.600
but what- what woke political ideology did to scientific communication during the pandemic

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:32.880
was awful and was really corrosive of public trust, especially on the- on the right.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.320
Right? For understandable reasons. It was just- it was crazy, some of the things that were being

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.840
said and still is. And these cases are all different. You take depression. We just don't

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.200
know enough about depression for, you know, anyone to be that confident about anything,

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.160
right? And there are many different modalities in which to interact with it as a problem,

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.080
right? So there's- you have pharmaceuticals, have whatever promise they have, but there's-

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:02.880
there's certainly a reason to be concerned that they don't work well for everybody and- and

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.120
I mean, that's- it's obvious they don't work well for everybody, but they do work for some people.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.560
But again, depression is a multifactorial problem and there- there are different levels

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.080
at which to- to influence it. And there are, you know, there are things like meditation,

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.240
there are things like- you just- life changes and- and, you know, one of the perverse things

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:32.560
about depression is that when you're depressed, all of the things that would be good for you to do

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.240
are precisely the things you don't want to do. You don't have any energy to socialize, you don't

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.760
want to get things done, you don't want to exercise, you don't- and all of those things,

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.680
if you got those up and running, they do make you feel better in- you know, in the aggregate.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:51.760
But the reality is that there- you know, there are clinical level depressions that are so bad

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.680
that it's just- we just don't have good tools for them. And it's not enough to tell- there's no

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:03.120
life change someone's gonna- gonna embrace that it's going to be an obvious remedy for that.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:12.000
The pan- I mean, pandemics are- are obviously a complicated problem, but I- I would consider it

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.520
much simpler than depression in terms of, you know, what's on the menu to be chosen among, you

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:23.600
know, the various choices. Just less multifactorial. The logic by which you would make those choices,

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:30.320
yeah. So it's like, we have a virus, we have a new virus, it's some version of bad, you know,

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.800
it's human transmissible, we're still catching up- we're catching up to every aspect of it.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.720
We don't know how it spreads. We don't know how- how effective masks are.

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.560
Well, to a certain point, we knew it was respiratory, but we- but how- but yeah,

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.320
but whether it's- we had spread by fomites, like all that, we were confused about a lot of things,

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.560
and we're still confused. It's been a moving target this whole time, and it's been changing

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:57.680
this whole time. And our responses to it have been, you know, we- we ramped up the vaccines as

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:03.440
quickly as we- as we could, but, you know, too quick for some, not as- not quick enough for others.

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.160
We could have done human challenge trials and got them out more quickly with- with- with better

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.560
data. And I think that's something we should probably look at in the future, because, you know,

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.560
that- you know, to my eye, that would make ethical sense to do- to do challenge trials.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.480
But- and so much of my concern about COVID- I mean, many people are confused about my

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.960
concern about COVID. My- my concern about COVID has for much of the time not been narrowly focused

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:39.440
on COVID itself and how dangerous I perceive COVID to be as a- as a illness. It has been,

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:47.840
for the longest time, even more a concern about our ability to respond to a truly scary pathogen

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:55.440
next time. Like, I- I- for, you know, outside those initial months, you know, give me the- the

01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:01.200
first six months to be quite worried about COVID and- and the unraveling of society, but-

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.640
And the supply of toilet paper.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.680
You want to secure a steady supply of toilet paper. But beyond that initial period,

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.040
when we had a sense of what we were dealing with, and we had every hope that the vaccines are

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.160
actually going to work, and we're getting- and we knew we were getting those vaccines in short

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:22.320
order, right? Beyond that, and we had- and we knew just how dangerous the illness was and how

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:30.400
dangerous it wasn't. For years now, I've just been worrying about this as a failed dress rehearsal

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.360
for something much worse, right? I think what we proved to ourselves at this moment in history is

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:42.000
that we have built informational tools that we do not know how to use, to- and we have made

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.680
ourselves- we've basically enrolled all of human society into a psychological experiment

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:55.920
that is deranging us and making it virtually impossible to solve

01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.400
coordination problems that we absolutely have to solve next time when things are worse.

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:08.960
Do you understand who's at fault for the way this unraveled? The way we didn't seem to have

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.240
the distrust in institutions and the institution of science that grew,

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.840
like seemingly exponentially, or got revealed through this process. Who is at fault here?

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:26.400
And what's the fix? So much blame to go around, but so much of it is not a matter of

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:36.560
bad people conspiring to do bad things. It's a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:44.480
and just ordinary plain vanilla dysfunction. But my problem was that people like you,

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:50.800
people like Brett Weinstein, people like that I look to for reasonable, difficult conversations

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:57.040
on difficult topics, have a little bit lost their mind, became emotional and dogmatic in style of

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:04.160
conversation, perhaps not in the depth of actual ideas, but they're a tweet something of that nature,

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:10.960
and not about you, but just it feels like the pandemic made people really more emotional than

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:16.880
before. And then Kimball Musk responded, I think something I think you probably would agree with,

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.680
maybe not. I think it was the combo of Trump and the pandemic. Trump triggered the far left to

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:26.880
be way more active than they could have been without him. And then the pandemic handed big

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.840
government nanny state left these a huge platform on a silver platter. I want to punch and here we

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:36.160
are. I would agree with some of that. I'm not sure how much to read into the nanny state

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:45.680
concept. But yet basically got people on the far left really activated and then gave control to,

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:53.040
I don't know if you say nanny state, but just control to government that when executed poorly

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.000
has created a complete distrust in government. My fear is that there was going to be that complete

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.280
distrust anyway, given the nature of the information space, given the level of conspiracy

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:11.680
thinking, given the gaming of these tools by an anti-vax cult. I mean, there really is an

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:17.280
anti-vax cult that just ramped up its energy during this moment.

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.440
But it's a small one.

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.800
It's not to say that everything, every concern about vaccines is a species of,

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.600
it was born of misinformation or born of this cult, but there is a cult that is just,

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:39.040
and the core of Trumpism is a cult. I mean, the QAnon is a cult. And so there's a lot of lying

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:48.480
and there's a lot of confusion. It's almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.800
people are and how fully their lives are organized around that confusion. I mean,

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.840
there are people who think that the world's being run by pedophile cannibals and that Tom

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:02.080
Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama are among those cannibals. I mean, they're

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.560
adjacent to the pure crazy, there's the semi-crazy, and adjacent to the semi-crazy,

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:20.240
there's the grifting opportunist asshole. And the layers of bad faith are hard to fully

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:28.640
diagnose, but the problem is all of this is getting signal boosted by an outrage machine

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.720
that is preferentially spreading misinformation. It has a business model

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.880
that is guaranteed that is preferentially sharing misinformation.

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:42.400
Can I actually just on a small tangent, how do you defend yourself against the claim that you're

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.600
a pedophile cannibal? It's difficult.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.040
Here's the case I would make, because I don't think you can use reason.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:57.280
I think you have to use empathy. I find it very difficult to believe that anyone

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:03.840
believes these things. I'm sure there's some number of people who are just pretending to

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:09.040
believe these things because it's just, again, this is sort of like the four-chanification

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.440
of everything. It's just Pepe the Frog. None of this is what it seems. They're not signaling

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.920
an alliance with white supremacy or neo-Nazism, but they're not doing it. They just don't fucking

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:30.160
care. It's just cynicism overflowing its banks. It's just fun to wind up the normies. Look at

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.840
all the normies that don't understand that a green frog is just a green frog, even when it

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:40.240
isn't just a green frog. It's just gumming up everyone's cognitive bandwidth with bullshit.

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.720
I get that that's fun if you're a teenager and you just want to vandalize our

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:53.840
new sphere, but at a certain point, we have to recognize that real questions of human

01:48:53.840 --> 01:49:01.120
welfare are in play. There's wars getting fought or not fought, and there's a pandemic

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:07.040
raging, and there's medicine to take or not take. To come back to this issue of COVID,

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:14.720
I don't think I got so out of balance around COVID. I think people are quite confused about

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:22.400
what I was concerned about. Yes, there was a period where I was crazy because anyone who

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.880
was taking it seriously was crazy because they had no idea what was going on. Yes, I was wiping

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:34.960
down packages with alcohol wipes because people thought it was transmissible by touch.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:42.240
When we realized that was no longer the case, I stopped doing that. Again, it was a moving

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.920
target, and a lot of things we did in hindsight around masking and school closures

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:54.720
looked fairly dysfunctional, unnecessary. I think the criticism that people would

01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:02.400
say about you're talking about COVID, and maybe you can correct me, but you were

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.960
skeptical or you were against skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:19.040
People who get nervous about the vaccine but don't fall into the usual anti-vax camp,

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:24.160
which I think there was a significant enough number. They were getting nervous.

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:31.840
I mean, especially after the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, I too was nervous about anything

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:39.520
where a lot of money could be made. You just see how the people who are greedy,

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.920
they come to the surface all of a sudden, and a lot of them that run institutions,

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.200
actually really good human beings. I know a lot of them, but it's hard to know

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.000
how those two combine together when there's hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.680
to be made. I guess the sense was that you weren't open enough to the skepticism.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.920
I understand that people have that sense. I'll tell you how I thought about it and think about it.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.560
One, again, it was a moving target. There was a point in the timeline where

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:20.320
it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were both working, but both they were

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:29.040
reasonably safe and that COVID was reasonably dangerous. The trade-off for basically everyone

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:34.160
was it was rational to get vaccinated given the level of testing and how many people had

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:40.400
been vaccinated before you, given what we were seeing with COVID, that that was a forced choice.

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.680
You're eventually going to get COVID and the question is, do you want to be vaccinated when

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:50.320
you do? There was a period where that forced choice, it was just obviously reasonable to

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:57.120
get vaccinated, especially because there was every reason to expect that while it wasn't a

01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:03.760
perfectly sterilizing vaccine, it was going to knock down transmission a lot and that matters.

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:10.000
It wasn't just a personal choice. You were actually being a good citizen when you decided to run

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.680
whatever risk you were going to run to get vaccinated because there are people in our

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:19.520
society who actually can't get vaccinated. I know people who can't take any vaccines,

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:26.560
they're so allergic to it. They in their own person seem to justify all of the fears of the

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.960
anti-vax cult. They're the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr. can point to and say,

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:38.640
vaccines will fucking kill you because of the experience. I know people who have

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:46.960
kids who fit that description. We should all feel a civic responsibility to be vaccinated against

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:54.080
egregiously awful and transmissible diseases for which we have relatively safe vaccines

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.560
to keep those sorts of people safe. There was a period of time when it was thought that the

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:05.680
vaccine could stop transmission. Yes. All of this has begun to shift. I don't think it has

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:12.480
shifted as much as Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted, but yes, there are safety concerns around

01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:22.240
the mRNA vaccines, especially for young men. As far as I know, that's the purview of actual

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:30.800
heightened concern, but also there's now a lot of natural immunity out there. Basically,

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:35.840
everyone who was going to get vaccinated has gotten vaccinated. The virus has evolved to the

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:47.600
point in this context where it seems less dangerous. Again, I'm going more on the seemings than on

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:52.400
research that I've done at this point, but I'm certainly less worried about getting COVID. I've

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:58.720
had it once. I've been vaccinated. You ask me now, how do I feel about getting the next booster?

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.440
I don't know that I'm going to get the next booster. I was somebody who was waiting in line

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:12.000
at four in the morning, hoping to get some overflow vaccine when it was first available.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:20.640
And at that point, given what I thought I knew based on the best sources I could consult and

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:28.240
based on anecdotes that were too vivid to ignore, both data and personal experience,

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.560
it was totally rational for me to want to get that vaccine as soon as I could.

01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:41.520
And now, I think it's totally rational for me to do a different kind of cost-benefit analysis

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:48.320
and wonder, listen, do I really need to get a booster? How many of these boosters am I going

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:55.520
to get for the rest of my life? Really? And how safe is the mRNA vaccine for a man of my age?

01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:01.600
And do I need to be worried about myocarditis? All of that is completely rational to talk about

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:12.320
now. My concern is that at every point along the way, I was the wrong person and Brett Weinstein

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.320
was the wrong person, and there's many other people I could add to this list, to have strong

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:23.440
opinions about any of this stuff. I just disagree with that. I think, yes, in theory, I agree 100%,

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:28.320
but I feel like experts failed at communicating, not at doing...

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:28.640
They did.

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.960
And I just feel like you and Brett Weinstein actually have the tools with the internet,

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:41.520
given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time, deeply about the

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.600
problems that face our world, that you actually have the tools to do pretty good thinking here.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.200
The problem I have with experts...

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.120
But there would be deference to experts and pseudo-experts behind all of that.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.240
Well, the papers, you would stand on the shoulders of giants, but you can surf those

01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.920
shoulders better than the giants themselves.

01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.720
Yeah, but I knew we were going to disagree about that. I saw his podcast where he brought on these

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:09.600
experts who had, many of them, had the right credentials, but for a variety of reasons,

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.600
they didn't pass the smell test for me. One larger problem, and this goes back to the problem of

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:22.160
how we rely on authority in science, is that you can always find a PhD or an MD

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:30.400
to champion any crackpot idea. It is amazing, but you could find PhDs and MDs who would sit

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.600
up there in front of Congress and say that they thought smoking was not addictive, or that it

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.720
was not harmful to... There was no direct link between smoking and lung cancer.

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:47.440
You could always find those people. Some of the people Brett found were people who had

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:53.040
obvious tells to my point of view, to my eye. I saw them on some of the same people

01:56:53.040 --> 01:57:02.400
who were on Rogan's podcast. It's hard because if a person does have the right credentials,

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:09.200
and they're not saying something floridly mistaken, and we're talking about something

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:15.360
where they're genuine unknowns, like how much do we know about the safety of these vaccines?

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:21.760
It's at that point not a whole hell of a lot. We have no long-term data on mRNA vaccines,

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:27.680
but to confidently say that millions of people are going to die because of these vaccines,

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:33.280
and to confidently say that ivermectin is a panacea, ivermectin is the thing that prevents

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:40.800
COVID, there was no good reason to say either of those things at that moment. Given that that's

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:47.200
where Brett was, I felt like there was nothing to debate. We're both the wrong people to be

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:54.240
getting into the weeds on this. We're both going to defer to our chosen experts. His experts look

01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:01.840
like crackpots to me, or at least the ones who are most vociferous on those edgiest points,

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:06.800
that seem most... Your experts seem like, what is the term, mask hysteria? I forgot the term.

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:14.720
No, but it's like with climate science. This old, it's received as a canard in

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:20.400
half of our society now, but the claim that 97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused

01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:27.920
climate change is a thing. Do you go with the 97% most of the time, or do you go with the 3% most

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:33.680
of the time? It's obvious you go with the 97% most of the time for anything that matters.

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:39.920
It's not to say that the 3% are always wrong. Again, things get overturned, and yes,

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.720
as you say, I've spent much more time worrying about this on my podcast than I've spent worrying

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:56.080
about COVID, our institutions have lost trust for good reason. It's an open question whether

01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:05.200
we can actually get things done with this level of transparency and pseudo-transparency,

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:11.360
given our information ecosystems. Can we fight a war, really fight a war that we may have to

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:17.920
fight, like the next Nazis? Can we fight that war when everyone with an iPhone is showing just how

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:25.040
awful it is that little girls get blown up when we drop our bombs? Could we as a society

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:33.120
do what we might have to do to actually get necessary things done when we're living in this

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:38.880
panopticon of just everyone's a journalist, everyone's a scientist, everyone's an expert,

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:45.920
everyone's got direct contact with the facts or some or semblance of the facts? I don't know.

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:50.240
I think yes, and I think voices like yours are exceptionally important, and I think there's

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:56.000
certain signals you send in your ability to steal me on the other side, in your empathy,

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:02.160
essentially. That's the fight, that's the mechanism by which you resist

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:12.560
the dogmatism of this binary thinking, and then if you become a trusted person that's able to

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:18.320
consider the other side, then people will listen to you as the aggregators, the communicator of

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:23.760
expertise, because the virologists haven't been able to be good communicators. I still to this day

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:32.960
don't really know, what am I supposed to think about the safety and efficacy of the

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:37.200
vaccines today? As it stands today, what are we supposed to think? What are we supposed to think

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:41.680
about testing? What are we supposed to think about the effectiveness of masks or lockdowns?

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:48.480
Where's the great communicator on this topic that considered all the other conspiracy theories,

02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:54.000
all the other, all the communication that's out there, and actually aggregating it together and

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.680
being able to say this is actually what's most likely the truth? And also some of that has to do

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:06.480
with humility, epistemic humility, knowing that you can't really know for sure, just like with

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:12.000
depression, you can't really know for sure. I'm not seeing those communications being

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.080
effectively done, even still today. Well, the jury is still out on some of it, and again,

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:22.880
it's a moving target. And some of it, it's complicated, some of it's a self-fulfilling

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:33.680
dynamic where, so like lockdowns, in theory, a lockdown would work if we could only do it,

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.200
but we can't really do it. And there's a lot of people who won't do it because they're convinced

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:44.480
that this is the totalitarian boot on finally on the neck of the good people who

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.200
are always having their interests traduced by the elites. So like this is, if you have enough

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.000
people who think the lockdown, for any reason in the face of any conceivable illness,

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:05.200
right, is just code for the New World Order coming to fuck you over and take your guns, right?

02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.960
Okay, you have a society that is now immune to reason, right? Because there are absolutely

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:19.680
certain pathogens that we should lock down for next time, right? And it was completely rational

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:25.920
in the beginning of this thing to attempt to lock down. We never really locked down

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:31.520
to attempt some semblance of a lockdown, just to quote, bend the curve, to spare our

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:36.560
healthcare system, given what we were seeing happening in Italy, right? Like that moment

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:43.040
was not hard to navigate, at least in my view. It was obvious at the time, in retrospect, my

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:50.240
views on that haven't changed, except for the fact that I recognize maybe it's just impossible

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:56.800
given the nature of people's response to that kind of demand, right? We live in a society that's

02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:01.840
just not going to lock down. Unless the pandemic is much more deadly. Right. So that's a point I

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:06.560
made, which was maliciously clipped out from some other podcast where someone's trying to

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.680
make it look like I want to see children die. There's a pity more children didn't die from COVID,

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:20.160
right? This is actually the same person who, and that's the other thing that got so poisoned here.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.520
That person, this psychopath or effective psychopath who's creating these clips of me on

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:32.000
podcasts, the second clip of me seeming to say that I wish more children died during COVID,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.560
but it was so clear in context what I was saying, that even the clip betrayed the context so it

02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:43.440
didn't actually work. This psycho, and again, I don't know whether he actually is a psychopath,

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.840
but he's behaving like one because of the incentives of Twitter, this is somebody who

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:56.560
Brett Signal Boosted as a very reliable source of information, right? He kept retweeting this

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:03.200
guy at me, against me, right? And this guy, at one glance, I knew how unreliable this guy was,

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:11.600
right? But I think I'm not at all sad. One thing I think I did wrong, one thing that I do regret,

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:21.120
one thing I have not sorted out for myself is how to navigate the professional and personal

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:30.000
pressure that gets applied at this moment where you have a friend or an acquaintance or someone you

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:38.960
know who's behaving badly in public or behaving in a way that you think is bad in public.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.920
And they have a public platform where they're influencing a lot of people,

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:50.000
and you have your own public platform where you're constantly getting asked to comment on what this

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:58.000
friend or acquaintance or colleague is doing. I haven't known what I think is ethically right

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:05.120
about the choices that seem forced on us at moments like this. So I've criticized you in public

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:11.360
about your interview with Kanye. Now, in that case, I reached out to you in private first and

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:15.520
told you exactly what I thought. And then when I was going to get asked in public or when I was

02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:20.080
touching that topic on my podcast, I more or less said the same thing that I said to you in

02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:26.640
private, right? Now, that was how I navigated that moment. I did the same thing with Elon,

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:38.880
at least at the beginning. We have maintained good vibes, which is not what I want to say about

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:45.920
Elon. I disagree with you because good vibes in the moment, there's a deep core of good vibes

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.720
that persists through time between you and Elon. And I would argue probably between some of the

02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:55.600
other folks you mentioned. I think with Brett, I failed to reach out in private

02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:04.800
to the degree that I should have. We had tried to set up a conversation in private that never

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:12.080
happened, but there was some communication. But it would have been much better for me to have made

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:17.440
more of an effort in private than I did before it spilled out into public. And I would say that's

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:22.160
true with other people as well. What kind of interaction in private do you think you should

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:29.120
have with Brett? Because my case would be beforehand and now still. The case I would like in this

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:36.000
part of the criticism you sent my way, maybe it's useful to go to that direction. Actually,

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.280
let's go to that direction because I think I disagree with your criticism as you stated publicly.

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:46.000
You're talking about your interview with Kanye? Yeah. The thing you criticized me for is actually

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.360
the right thing to do with Brett. Okay. You said Lex could have spoken with Kanye in such a way as

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:57.440
to have produced a useful document. He didn't do that because he has a fairly naive philosophy

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:03.520
about the power of love. Let's see if you can maintain that philosophy in the present.

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:10.800
Let's go. He's beautiful. He seemed to think that if he just got through the minefield

02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:16.080
to the end of the conversation where the two of them still were feeling good about one another

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:22.880
and they can hug it out, that would be by definition a success. So let me make the case

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:28.640
for this power of love philosophy. And first of all, I love you, Sam. You're still an inspiration

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:35.360
and somebody I deeply admire. Okay. Back at you. To me, in the case of Kanye,

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:43.280
it's not only that you get through the conversation and have hugs, it's that the

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:48.640
display that you're willing to do that has power. So even if it doesn't end in hugging,

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:55.920
the actual, the turning the other cheek, the act of turning the other cheek itself communicates

02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:03.360
both to Kanye later and to the rest of the world that we should have empathy and compassion

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:09.200
towards each other. There is power to that. Maybe that is naive, but I believe in the

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:13.360
power of that. So it's not that I'm trying to convince Kanye that some of his ideas are wrong,

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:19.280
but I'm trying to illustrate that just the act of listening and truly trying to understand the

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:27.760
human being, that is opens people's minds to actually questioning their own beliefs more.

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:33.280
It takes them out of the dogmatism, de-escalates the kind of dogmatism that I've been seeing.

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:40.880
So in that sense, I would say the power of love is the philosophy you might apply to Brett,

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:46.560
because the right conversation you have in private is not about, hey, listen, you're,

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.760
you know, the experts you're talking to, they seem credentialed, but they're not actually

02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:57.120
as credentials as they illustrating, they're not grounding their findings in actual meta-analyses

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.280
and papers and so on, like making a strong case like, what are you doing? This is going to get a

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.360
lot of people in trouble, but instead just saying, like being a friend in the dumbest of ways, being

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:15.200
respectful, sending love their way, and just having a conversation outside of all of this.

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:25.600
Like basically showing that, like removing the emotional attachment to this debate,

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.680
even though you are very emotionally attached, because in the case of COVID specifically,

02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:36.000
there is a very large number of lies at stake, but removing all of that and remembering that you

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.720
have a friendship. Yeah, well, so I think these are highly non-analogous cases, right? So your

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:48.560
conversation with Kanye misfired from my point of view for a very different reason. It was,

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:55.360
and it was, it has to do with Kanye. I mean, so Kanye, I don't know, I've never met Kanye,

02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:04.080
so obviously I don't know him, but I think he's either obviously in the midst of a mental health

02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:10.640
crisis, or he's a colossal asshole, or both. I mean, actually those aren't mutually exclusive.

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.960
So one of three possibilities, he's either mentally ill, he's an asshole, or he's mentally ill

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.880
and an asshole. I think all three of those possibilities are possible for the both of us

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:25.520
as well at the moment. No, I would argue none of those are likely for either of us.

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:32.720
But not to say we don't have our moments. So the reason not to talk to Kanye,

02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:37.600
so I think you should have had the conversation you had with him in private. That's great,

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:44.320
and I've got no criticism of what you said had it been in private. In public, I just thought

02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:51.200
you're not doing him a favor. If he's mentally ill, he's in the middle of a

02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:58.800
manic episode, or I'm not a clinician, but I've heard it said of him that he is bipolar,

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.920
you're not doing him a favor sticking a mic in front of him and letting him

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:11.040
go off on the Jews or anything else. We know what he thought about the Jews. We know that

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:15.040
there's not much illumination that's going to come from him on that topic.

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:20.160
If it is a symptom of his mental illness that he thinks these things,

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:27.360
you're not doing him a favor making that even more public. If he's just an asshole and he's

02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:34.160
just an anti-semite, an ordinary garden variety anti-semite, well then there's also not much to

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:40.880
say unless you're really going to dig in and kick the shit out of him in public. I'm saying you can

02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:47.440
do that with love. That's the other thing here is that I don't agree that compassion and love always

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:58.960
have this patient embracing acquiescent face. They don't always feel good to the recipient.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:05.280
There is a sort of wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments like that where

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:10.080
someone's full of shit and you just make it absolutely clear to them and to your audience

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.560
that they're full of shit. There's no hatred being communicated. In fact, you could just

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:19.920
like, listen, I'm going to do everyone a favor right now and just take your foot out of your

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:27.440
mouth. The truth is, I just wouldn't have aired the conversation. I just don't think it was a

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:33.920
document that had to get out there. This is not a signal you're likely to get from your

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.320
audience. I get that many people in your audience thought, oh my god, that's awesome. You're talking

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.960
to Kanye and you're doing it in Lex style where it's just love and you're not treating him like

02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:49.120
a pariah and you're holding this tension between he's this creative genius who is work we love

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:55.760
and yet he's having this moment that's so painful and what a tight rope walk. I get that maybe 90%

02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:02.080
of your audience saw it that way. They're still wrong and I still think that was unbalanced,

02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:05.360
not a good thing to put out into the world. You don't think it opens up the mind and heart

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:10.880
of people that listen to that just have it? If it's opening it up in the wrong

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:18.320
direction where just gale force nonsense is coming in. I think we should have an open mind

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:24.160
and an open heart, but there's some clear things here that we have to keep in view.

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.800
The mental illness component is its own thing. I don't pretend to understand what's going on

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:35.040
with him, but insofar as that's the reason he's saying what he's saying, do not put this guy on

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:39.840
camera and let no one see it. Sorry, in that point real quick, I had a bunch of conversations with

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.760
him offline and I didn't get a sense of mental illness. That's why I chose to sit down and I

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:52.320
didn't get it. I mean, mental illness is such a... But when it shows up in a gimp put on Alex

02:13:52.320 --> 02:14:00.960
Jones' podcast, is it either that's more genius performance in his world or he's unraveling further?

02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:06.720
I wouldn't put that under mental illness. We have to... I think there's another conversation to be had

02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:19.200
about how we treat artists because they're weirdos. They're very... I mean, taking words

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:25.520
from Akanya as if he's at Christopher Hitchens or something like that, very eloquent, researched,

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:33.680
written many books on history, on politics, on geopolitics, on psychology. Akanya didn't

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:39.280
do any of that. He's an artist just spouting off. And so it's a different style of conversation

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:43.440
and a different way to treat the words that are coming out of his mouth.

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:46.880
Let's leave the mental illness aside. If we're going to say that there's no reason to think

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:50.800
he's mentally ill and this is just him being creative and brilliant and opinionated,

02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:56.560
well, then that falls into the asshole bucket for me. Then he's someone... And honestly,

02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.560
the most offensive thing about him in that interview from my point of view is not the

02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.520
anti-Semitism, which we can talk about because I think there are problems just letting him

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:13.360
spread those memes as well. But the most offensive thing is just how delusionally

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:20.160
egocentric he is or was coming off in that interview and in others. He has an estimation

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:29.280
of himself as this omnibus genius to not only rival Shakespeare, to exceed Shakespeare. He's

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.320
the greatest mind that has ever walked among us. And he's more or less explicit on that point.

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:39.040
And yet he manages to talk for hours without saying anything actually interesting or insightful

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:46.800
or factually illuminating. So it's complete delusion of a very Trumpian sort. It's like

02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:51.040
when Trump says he's a genius who understands everything, but nobody takes him seriously,

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:57.680
it one wonders whether Trump takes himself seriously. Kanye seems to believe his own

02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:07.600
press. He actually thinks he's just a colossus. And he may be a great musician. I'm not...

02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:12.400
Certainly not my wheelhouse to compare him to any other musicians, but

02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:20.880
one thing that's patently obvious from your conversation is he's not who he thinks he is

02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:26.080
intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way. And so when you

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:32.640
couple that to the anti-Semitism he was spreading, which was genuinely noxious and

02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:39.520
ill-considered and has potential knock-on effects in the black community. I mean,

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:43.680
there's an ambient level of anti-Semitism in the black community that is worth

02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:48.240
worrying about and talking about anyway. There's a bunch of guys playing the knockout game in

02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:54.960
Brooklyn just punching Orthodox Jews in the face. And I think letting Kanye air his anti-Semitism,

02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.080
that publicly only raises the likelihood of that rather than diminishes it.

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:04.480
I don't know. So let me say just a couple of things. So one, my belief at the time

02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:08.400
was it doesn't. It decreases it. Showing empathy while pushing back

02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:14.800
decreases the likelihood of that. It might on the surface look like it's increasing it,

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:19.680
but that's simply because the anti-Semitism or the hatred in general is brought to the surface.

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:25.040
And then people talk about it. But I should also say that you're one of the only people

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:31.840
that wrote to me privately criticizing me. And out of the people I really respect and admire.

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.480
And that was really valuable that I had to, it's painful because I had to think through it for a

02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:44.240
while. And it still haunts me because the other kind of criticism I got a lot of, people basically

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:52.640
said things towards me based on who I am that they hate me. You mean anti-Semitic things?

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:57.360
Yeah, anti-Semitic things. I just hate the word anti-Semitic. It's like racist.

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:04.160
But here's the reality. So I'm Jewish, although obviously not religious.

02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:13.520
I've been a student of the Holocaust, obviously. I know a lot about that. And there's reason to

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:21.520
be a student of the Holocaust. But in my lifetime and in my experience, I have never

02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:26.480
taken anti-Semitism very seriously. I have not worried about it. I have not

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.160
made a thing of it. I've done exactly one podcast on it. I had Barry Weiss on my podcast

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:44.800
when her book came out. But it really is a thing. And it's something we have to keep an eye on

02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:54.960
societally because it's a unique kind of hatred. It's unique in that it's knit together with,

02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:59.520
it's not just ordinary racism. It's knit together with lots of conspiracy theories that never seem

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:07.120
to die out. It can by turns equally animate the left and the right politically. I mean,

02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.080
it was so perverse about anti-Semitism, look in the American context. With the far right,

02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.840
with white supremacists, Jews aren't considered white. So they hate us in the same spirit in

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:23.280
which they hate black people or brown people or anyone who's not white. But on the left,

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:28.480
Jews are considered extra white. We're the extra beneficiaries of white privilege.

02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:36.240
In the black community, that is often the case. We're a minority that has thrived. And it seems

02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:42.880
to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems that other minorities suffer,

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:49.120
in particular African-Americans in the American context. Asians are now getting a little bit

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:57.680
of this, like the model minority issue. But Jews have had this going on for centuries and millennia.

02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:03.520
And it never seems to go away. And again, this is something that I've never focused on. But

02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:12.320
this has been at a slow boil for as long as we've been alive. And there's no guarantee it

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:18.080
can't suddenly become much, much uglier than we have any reason to expect it to become,

02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:24.240
even in our society. And so there's kind of a special concern at moments like that where you

02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:32.080
have an immensely influential person in a community who already has a checkered history with respect

02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:38.160
to their own beliefs about the Jews and the conspiracies and all the rest. And he's just

02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:46.000
messaging, not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who's given him the microphone at

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.200
that moment to the world. And so that made my spidey sense tingle.

02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:59.520
Yeah, it's complicated. The stakes are very high. And I, somebody who's been obviously family and

02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:03.760
also reading a lot about World War II, and just this whole period, it was a very difficult

02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:12.560
conversation. But I believe in the power, especially given who I am of not always,

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:18.720
but sometimes often turning the other cheek. Oh yeah. And again, things change

02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:29.200
when they're for public consumption. The cut for me that has just the use case,

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:34.400
I keep stumbling upon is the kinds of things that I will say on a podcast like this, or

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:41.200
if I'm giving a public lecture, versus the kinds of things I will say at dinner with strangers or

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:46.000
with friends. Like if you're in an elevator, like if I'm in an elevator with strangers, I do not

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.920
feel, and I hear someone say something stupid, I don't feel an intellectual responsibility to

02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:58.400
turn around in the confines of that space with them and say, listen, that thing you just said

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:05.040
about X, Y, or Z is completely false and here's why. But if somebody says it in front of me on

02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:10.880
some public dais where I'm actually talking about ideas, that's when there's a different

02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:14.960
responsibility that comes online. The question is how you say it? How you say it?

02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.440
Or even whether you say anything in those, I mean, there are moments, there are definitely

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:24.240
moments to privilege civility or just to pick your battles. I mean, sometimes it's just not

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:28.560
worth it to get into it with somebody out in real life.

02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:36.480
I just believe in the power of empathy both in the elevator and when a bunch of people are listening,

02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:44.080
that when they see you willing to consider another human being's perspective,

02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:49.520
it just gives more power to your words after.

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:59.760
Well, yeah, but until it doesn't, because you can extend charity too far. It can be absolutely

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:06.080
obvious what someone's motives really are and they're dissembling about that. And so then you're

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:11.440
taking at face value, their representations begins to look like you're just being duped

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:16.480
and you're not actually doing the work of putting pressure on a bad actor.

02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:21.920
So again, the mental illness component here makes it very difficult to think about

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.720
what you should or shouldn't have said to Kanye.

02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:29.440
So I think the topic of platforming is pretty interesting. What's your view on

02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:36.160
platforming controversial people? Let's start with the old, would you interview Hitler

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:43.040
on your podcast? And how would you talk to him? Oh, and follow question. Would you interview him

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:51.200
in 1935, 41, and then like 45?

02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:56.640
Well, I think we have an uncanny valley problem with respect to this issue of

02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:02.880
whether or not to speak to bad people. So if a person's sufficiently bad,

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:08.080
right, if they're all the way out of the valley, then you can talk to them and it's just totally

02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:13.680
unproblematic to talk to them because you don't have to spend any time signaling to your audience

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:16.560
that you don't agree with them. And if you're interviewing Hitler, you don't have to say,

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:21.040
listen, I just got to say before we start, I don't agree with the whole genocide thing.

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:28.160
And I just think you're killing mental patients and vans and all that. That was all bad as a

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:36.080
bad look. It can go without saying that you don't agree with this person and you're not

02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:43.680
platforming them to signal boost their views. You're just trying to... If they're sufficiently evil,

02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:50.400
you can go into it very much as an anthropologist would... You just want to understand

02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:54.400
the nature of evil. You just want to understand this phenomenon, like how is this person

02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:02.080
who they are? And that strikes me as a intellectually interesting and

02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:08.480
morally necessary thing to do, right? So, yes, I think you always interview Hitler.

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.160
Well, once he's... But when do you know it?

02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:18.400
Once he's legitimately... But when do you know it? Is the genocide really happening?

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:25.440
42, 43? No, if you're on the cusp of it where it's just he's someone who's gaining power and you

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:32.000
don't want to help facilitate that, then there's a question of whether you can undermine him

02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:36.560
while pushing back against him in that interview. So, there are people I wouldn't talk to

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:41.840
just because I don't want to give them oxygen and I don't think that in the context of my

02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:47.280
interviewing them, I'm going to be able to take the wind out of their sails at all, right?

02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.200
For whatever... Either because an asymmetric advantage because I just know that they can

02:25:54.160 --> 02:26:00.480
do something within the span of an hour that I can't correct for.

02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:04.960
It's like they can light many small fires and it just takes too much time to put them out.

02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:08.480
That's more like on the topic of vaccines, for example, having a debate on the efficacy of

02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.440
vaccines. Yeah. It's not that I don't think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant,

02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:21.840
I think it is. Even these asymmetries aside, I mean, it is true that a person can always make

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:26.320
a mess faster than you can clean it up, right? But still, there are debates worth having even

02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:31.440
given that limitation and they're the right people to have those specific debates. There's

02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:38.160
certain topics where I'll debate someone just because I'm the right person for the job and

02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.600
it doesn't matter how messy they're going to be. It's just worth it because I can make my points

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:49.280
land at least to the right part of the audience. So, some of it is just your own skill and

02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:54.160
competence and also interest in preparing correctly? Well, yeah. In the nature of the

02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:59.440
subject matter, but there are other people who just by default, I would say, well,

02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:04.800
there's no reason to give this guy a platform. And there are also people who are so confabulatory

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:13.680
that they're making such a mess with every sentence that insofar as you're even trying

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:20.400
to interact with what they're saying, you're by definition going to fail and you're going to seem

02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:27.360
to fail to an sufficiently large uninformed audience where it's going to be a net negative

02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:34.960
for the cause of truth, no matter how good you are. So, for instance, I think talking to Alex

02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:41.840
Jones on any topic for any reason is probably a bad idea because I just think he's just

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:48.320
neurologically wired under a string of sentences. He'll get 20 sentences out,

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:59.360
each of which contains more lies than the last. And there's not time enough in the world

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:02.880
to run down and certainly not time enough in the span of a conversation

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:08.880
to run down each of those leads to bedrock so as to falsify it. I mean, he'll just make

02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:18.080
shit up or make shit up and then weave it in with half-truths and micro-truths

02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:23.760
that give some semblance of credibility to somebody out there. I mean, apparently millions

02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:30.080
of people out there. And there's just no way to untangle that in real time with him.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:36.480
I have noticed that you have an allergic reaction to confabularitization.

02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:38.560
Yeah, confabulation.

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:44.800
Confabulation, that if somebody says something a little micro-untruth,

02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:48.000
it really stops your brain.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.520
Here, I'm not talking about micro-untruths, I'm just talking about making up things out of

02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:57.600
whole cloth. Just like, if someone says something, well, what about, and then the thing they put

02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:05.680
at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo-facts, right, that you can't possibly

02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:11.840
authenticate or not in the span of that conversation. Whether it's about UFOs or anything else,

02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:19.440
right, they will seem to make you look like an agonormous when, in fact, everything they're

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:24.240
saying is specious, whether they know it or not. I mean, there's some people who are just

02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:28.800
crazy, there's some people who are just bullshitting and they're not even tracking

02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:32.880
whether it's true, it just feels good, and then some people are consciously lying about things.

02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.880
Don't you think there's just a kind of jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should be able to

02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:45.280
just wave off by saying, well, none of that is backed up by any evidence and just almost

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:51.680
take it to the humor place? Well, the thing is, the place I'm familiar with doing this and not

02:29:51.680 --> 02:30:02.640
doing this is on specific conspiracies like 9-11 truth. Because of what 9-11 did to my

02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:09.840
intellectual life, and they really just, you know, it sent me down a path for the better part

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:15.520
of a decade. Like, I became a critic of religion. I don't know if I was ever going to be a critic

02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:19.920
of religion, right? But it happened to be in my wheelhouse because I spent so much time

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:28.800
studying religion on my own. And I was also very interested in the underlying spiritual

02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:39.200
concerns of every religion. And so I was, you know, I devoted more than a full decade of my life

02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:44.880
to just, you know, what is real here? What is possible? What is the nature of subjective

02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:50.160
reality? And how does it relate to reality at large? And is there anything to, you know, who was

02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:57.600
someone like Jesus or Buddha? And are these people frauds? Are these just myths? Or is there really

02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:04.000
a continuum of insight to be had here that is interesting? So I spent a lot of time on that

02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:08.000
question through my 20, the full decade of my 20s.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.400
And that was launched in part by 9-11 truth or?

02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:15.840
No, but then when 9-11 happened, I had spent all this time reading religious books,

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:22.000
understanding, empathically understanding the motivations of religious people, right? Knowing

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:27.040
just how fully certain people believe what they say they believe, right? So I took religious

02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:31.600
convictions very seriously. And then people started flying planes into our buildings. And I,

02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:34.880
so I knew that there was something to be said about that.

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:35.440
Allegedly.

02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:42.400
The core doctrine to Islam, exactly. So I went down, so that became my wheelhouse for a time,

02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:51.120
you know, terrorism and jihadism and related topics. And so the 9-11 truth conspiracy thing

02:31:51.840 --> 02:32:00.400
kept getting aimed at me. And the question was, well, do I want to debate these people?

02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:02.240
Yeah. Alex Jones, perhaps.

02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:05.760
Yeah. So Alex Jones, I think, was an early purveyor of it, although I don't think I knew

02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:13.840
who he was at that point. And so, and privately, I had some very long debates with people who,

02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:17.600
you know, one person in my family went way down that rabbit hole. And I just, you know,

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:22.800
every six months or so, I'd literally write the two-hour email, you know, that would try to

02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:30.240
deprogram them, you know, however ineffectually. And so I went back and forth for years on that

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:35.600
topic in private with people. But I could see the structure of the conspiracy. I could see the

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:47.440
nature of how impossible it was to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well so as to convince

02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:55.680
anyone of anything who was not seeing the problematic structure of that way of thinking.

02:32:55.680 --> 02:33:01.840
I mean, it's not actually a thesis. It's a proliferation of anomalies that don't,

02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:05.840
you can't actually connect all the dots that are being pointed to. They don't connect in a

02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:11.520
coherent way. They're incompatible, and their incompatibility is not being acknowledged.

02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:19.360
But they're running this algorithm of things are never what they seem. There's always

02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:25.920
malicious conspirators doing things perfectly. We see evidence of human incompetence everywhere

02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:32.640
else. No one can tie their shoes, you know, expertly anywhere else. But over here,

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:38.640
people are perfectly competent. They're perfectly concealing things. Like thousands

02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:44.560
of people are collaborating inexplicably. I mean, incentivized by what, who knows,

02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:49.040
they're collaborating to murder thousands of their neighbors, and no one is breathing a

02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:54.720
peep about it. No one's getting caught on camera. No one's breathe the word of it to a

02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:06.400
journalist. And so I've dealt with that style of thinking, and I know what it's like to be

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:12.400
in the weeds of a conversation like that. And the person will say, okay, well, but what do you

02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:20.400
make of the fact that all those F-16s were flown 800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9-11,

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:25.200
doing an exercise that hadn't even been scheduled for that day. But it was, and now all of these,

02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:30.880
I dimly recall some thesis of that kind, but I'm just making these things up now, right? So

02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:34.560
like that detail hadn't even been scheduled for that day. It was inexplicably run that day.

02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:41.840
So how long would it take to track that down, right? The idea that this is anomalous, like there

02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:51.280
was an F-16 exercise run on it, and it wasn't even supposed to be run that day, right? Someone

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:59.440
like Alex Jones, their speech pattern is to pack as much of that stuff in as possible at the highest

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:05.680
velocity that a person can speak. And unless you're knocking down each one of those things,

02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:10.480
to that audience, you appear to just be uninformed. You appear to just not be,

02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:16.640
you know, William, he didn't know about the F-16s. He doesn't know about Project Mockingbird. You

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:19.600
haven't heard about Project Mockingbird? I just made up Project Mockingbird. I don't know what

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:26.160
it is, but that's the kind of thing that comes tumbling out in a conversation like that. That's

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:31.760
the kind of thing, frankly, I was worried about in the COVID conversation, because not that someone

02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:38.720
like Brett would do it consciously, but someone like Brett is swimming in a sea of misinformation

02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:44.720
on social, living on Twitter, getting people sending the blog post and the study from

02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:50.880
the Philippines that showed that in this cohort, Ivermectin did X, right? And

02:35:51.840 --> 02:36:01.840
to actually run anything to ground, you have to actually do the work journalistically and

02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:08.320
scientifically and run it to ground, right? So for some of these questions, you actually have

02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:16.720
to be a statistician to say, okay, they used the wrong statistics in this experiment, right? Now,

02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:22.960
yes, we could take all the time to do that, or we could at every stage along the way,

02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:31.760
in a context where we have experts we can trust, go with what 97% of the experts are saying about

02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:36.880
X, about the safety of mRNA, about the transmissibility of COVID, about whether to wear

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:41.520
masks or not wear masks. And I completely agree that that broke down

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:54.160
unacceptably over the last few years. But I think that's largely a social media and blogs

02:36:54.160 --> 02:37:02.640
and the efforts of podcasters and sub-stack writers were not just a response to that.

02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:09.840
I think it was a symptom of that and a cause of that, right? And I think we're living in an

02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:20.240
environment where we've basically trained ourselves not to be able to agree about facts

02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:29.920
on any topic, no matter how urgent, right? What's flying in our sky? What's happening in Ukraine?

02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:37.200
Is Putin just denazifying Ukraine? I mean, there are people who we respect,

02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:45.280
who are spending time down that particular rabbit hole. Maybe there are a lot of Nazis

02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:52.960
in Ukraine and that's the real problem, right? Maybe Putin's not the bad actor here, right?

02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:58.320
How much time do I have to spend empathizing with Putin to the point of thinking, well,

02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:04.560
maybe Putin's got a point and it's like, what about the polonium and the nerve agents and the

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:12.000
killing of journalists and the Navalny? I'm not paying so much attention to that because

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.240
I'm following all these interesting people on Twitter and they're giving me some pro-Putin

02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:22.320
material here. And there are some Nazis in Ukraine. It's not like there are no Nazis in

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:27.760
Ukraine. How am I going to wait these things? I think people are being driven crazy by Twitter.

02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:33.360
Yeah. But you're kind of speaking to conspiracy theories that pollute everything.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:39.440
And then every example you gave is kind of a bad faith style of conversation.

02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:46.400
But it's not necessarily knowingly bad faith by the people who are worried about Ukrainian

02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:51.680
Nazis. I mean, they're some of the same people. They're the same people who are worried about

02:38:52.640 --> 02:39:00.320
Ivermectin got suppressed. Ivermectin is really a panacea, but it got suppressed because no one

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:09.040
could make billions on it. It's literally, in many cases, the same people and the same

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:14.960
efforts to unearth those. And you're saying it's very difficult to have conversations with those

02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:20.880
kinds of people. What about a conversation with Trump himself? Would you do a podcast with Trump?

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:27.920
No. I don't think so. I don't think I'd be learning anything about him. It's like with

02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:31.840
Hitler, and I'm not comparing Trump to Hitler, but-

02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:34.880
Clip's guy, here's your chance. You got this one.

02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:41.600
With certain world historical figures, I would just feel like, okay, this is an opportunity

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:47.760
to learn something that I'm not going to learn. I think Trump is among the most superficial people

02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:56.400
we have ever laid eyes on. He is in public view. And I'm sure there's some distance between who he

02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:00.800
is in private and who he is in public, but it's not going to be the kind of distance that's going

02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:12.800
to blow my mind. And I think the liability, for instance, I think Joe Rogan was very wise not

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:19.280
to have Trump on his podcast. I think all he would have put himself in a situation where he

02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:24.400
couldn't adequately contain the damage Trump was doing, and he was just going to make Trump seem

02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:34.720
cool to a potentially new cohort of his massive audience. They would have had a lot of laughs.

02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:46.640
Trump's funny. The entertainment value of things is so influential. It was that one debate where

02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:56.160
Trump got a massive laugh on his line, only Rosie O'Donnell. The truth is, we're living

02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:02.560
in a political system where if you can get a big laugh during a political debate, you win.

02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:08.480
It doesn't matter who you are. That's the level of, it doesn't matter how uninformed you are,

02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:12.160
it doesn't matter that half the debate was about what the hell we should do about

02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:20.560
a threat of nuclear war or anything else. We're monkeys, right? And we like to laugh.

02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:27.520
Well, because he brought up Joe, he's somebody like you I look up to. I've learned a lot from

02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:34.720
him because I think who he is privately as a human being. Also, he's kind of the voice of

02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:42.480
curiosity to me. He inspired me that so unending, open-minded curiosity, much like you are the

02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:48.400
voice of reason. They recently had a podcast, Joe had recently a podcast with Jordan Peterson,

02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:57.200
and I brought you up saying they still have a hope for you. Any chance you talk to Joe again,

02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:04.160
reinvigorate your friendship? I reached out to him privately when I saw that.

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:08.400
Did you use the power of love? Joe knows I love him and consider him a friend,

02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:14.080
right? So there's no issue there. He also knows I'll be happy to do his podcast

02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:21.280
when we get that together. So there's no, I have got no policy of not talking to Joe or not doing

02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:29.200
his podcast. I think we got a little sideways along these same lines where we've talked about

02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:36.080
Brett and Elon and other people. It was never to that degree with Joe because

02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:43.520
Joe's in a very different lane, right? He's unconsciously so. I mean, Joe is a

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:51.120
stand-up comic who interviews, who just is interested in everything, interviews the

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:57.440
widest conceivable variety of people and just lets his interests collide with their expertise or

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:04.240
lack of expertise. Again, it's a super wide variety of people. He'll talk about anything

02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:10.640
and he can always pull the ripcord saying, I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm a comic.

02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:18.160
I'm stoned. We just drank too much, right? It's very entertaining. To my eye, it's all in good

02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:23.040
faith. I think Joe is an extraordinarily ethical, good person. Also doesn't use Twitter. Doesn't

02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:33.920
really use Twitter. The crucial difference though is it because he is an entertainer first. I'm not

02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:38.720
saying he's not smart and he doesn't understand things. What's potentially confusing is he's

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:45.760
very smart and he's also very informed. His full-time job is taught when he's not doing stand-up

02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:53.840
or doing color commentary for the UFC. His full-time job is talking to lots of very smart people

02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:59.680
at great lengths. He's created the Joe Rogan University for himself and he's gotten a lot of

02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:06.560
information crammed into his head. It's not that he's uninformed, but he can always,

02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.240
when he feels that he's uninformed or when it turns out he was wrong about something,

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:15.840
he can always pull the ripcord and say, I'm just a comic. We were stoned. It was fun.

02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:20.160
Don't take medical advice from me. I don't play a doctor on the internet.

02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:28.960
I can't quite do that. You can't quite do that. We're in different lanes. I'm not saying you and

02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:33.600
I are in exactly the same lane, but for much of Joe's audience, I'm just this establishment

02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:40.320
shill, just banging on about the universities and medical journals. It's not true,

02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:44.960
but that would be the perception. As a counterpoint to a lot of what's being said on Joe's podcast

02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:51.600
or certainly Brett's podcast on these topics, I can see how they would form that opinion.

02:44:53.280 --> 02:45:00.320
In reality, if you listen to me long enough, you hear that I've said as much against the woke

02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:07.200
nonsense as anyone, even any lunatic on the right who can only keep that bright shining object in

02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:12.800
view. There's nothing that Candace Owens has said about wokeness that I haven't said about

02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:21.680
wokeness in so far as she's speaking rationally about wokeness, but we have to be able to keep

02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:27.040
multiple things in view. If you could only look at the problem of wokeness and you couldn't

02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:33.680
acknowledge the problem of Trump and Trumpism and QAnon and the explosion of irrationality

02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:39.680
that was happening on the right and bigotry that was happening on the right, you were just

02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:48.080
disregarding half of the landscape. Many people took half of the problem in recent years. The last

02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:53.440
five years is a story of many people taking half of the problem and monetizing that half of the

02:45:53.440 --> 02:46:01.120
problem and getting captured by an audience that only wanted that half of the problem talked about

02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:11.520
in that way. This is the larger issue of audience capture, which I'm sure it's an

02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.320
ancient problem, but it's a very helpful phrase that I think comes to us courtesy of our mutual

02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:24.480
friend Eric Weinstein. Audience capture is a thing, and I believe I've witnessed many

02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:30.720
casualties of it. If there's anything I've been unguard against in my life professionally,

02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:37.680
it's been that. When I noticed that I had a lot of people in my audience who didn't like my

02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:43.840
criticizing Trump, I really leaned into it. When I noticed that a lot of the other cohort of my

02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:50.080
audience didn't like me criticizing the far left and wokeness. I thought I was exaggerating that

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:55.920
problem. I leaned into it because I thought those parts of my audience were absolutely wrong,

02:46:56.480 --> 02:47:02.880
and I didn't care about whether I was going to lose those parts of my audience. There are people

02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:08.400
who have created, knowingly or not, there are people who've created different incentives for

02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:13.600
themselves because of how they've monetized their podcasts and because of the kind of signal

02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:21.120
they've responded to in their audience. Brett would consider this a totally invidious

02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:29.440
ad hominem thing to say, but I really do worry that that's happened to Brett. I cannot explain

02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:36.480
how you do 100 with all the things in the universe to be interested in, and of all the things he's

02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:41.920
competent to speak intelligently about, I don't know how you do 100 podcasts in a row on COVID.

02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:48.160
It makes no sense. You think in part audience capture can explain that?

02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:56.880
I absolutely think it can. For example, do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake

02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:02.720
on COVID or made a mistake on Trump? I'm not saying you feel that way, but do you feel this

02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:09.440
pressure? You've attacked audience capture within the way you do stuff, so you don't feel

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.960
as much pressure from the audience, but within your own ego.

02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:18.800
I mean, again, the people who think I'm wrong about any of these topics are going to think,

02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:28.160
okay, you're just not admitting that you're wrong, but now we're having a dispute about specific facts.

02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:38.480
There are things that I believed about COVID or worried might be true about COVID two years ago

02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:44.640
that I no longer believe or I'm not so worried about now, and vice versa. I mean,

02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:46.880
things have flipped, certain things have flipped upside down.

02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:55.520
The question is, was I wrong? Here's a cartoon version of it, but this is something I said

02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:00.640
probably 18 months ago, and it's still true. When I saw what Brett was doing on COVID,

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:12.320
let's call it two years ago, I said, even if he's right, even if he turns out that Ivermectin

02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:21.040
is a panacea and the mRNA vaccines kill millions of people, he's still wrong right now. His reasoning

02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:30.720
is still flawed right now. His facts still suck right now, and his confidence is unjustified now.

02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:40.320
That was true then, that will always be true then, and not much has changed for me to revisit

02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:47.520
any of my time points along the way. Again, I will totally concede that if I had teenage boys

02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:53.120
and their schools were demanding that they be vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine,

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:02.240
I would be powerfully annoyed. I wouldn't know what I was going to do, and I would be doing more

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:10.480
research about myocarditis, and I'd be badgering our doctors, and I would be worried that we have

02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:16.080
a medical system and a pharmaceutical system and a healthcare system and a public health system

02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:21.440
that's not incentivized to look at any of this in a fine-grained way, and they just want one

02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:27.680
blanket admonition to the entire population, just take the shot, you idiots.

02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:36.080
I view that largely as a result, a panicked response to the misinformation explosion that

02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:42.080
happened and the populist resistance animated by misinformation that just made it impossible to

02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:47.600
get anyone to cooperate. Part of it is, again, a pendulum swing in the wrong direction,

02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:52.800
somewhat analogous to the woke response to Trump and the Trumpist response to woke.

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:58.560
A lot of people have just gotten pushed around for bad reasons, but understandable reasons,

02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:09.440
but yes, there are caveats. Things have changed about my view of COVID, but the question is,

02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:19.920
if you roll back the clock 18 months, was I wrong to want to platform Eric Topol, a very

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:28.480
well-respected cardiologist on this topic, or Nicholas Christakis to talk about the network

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:35.440
effects of whether we should close schools. He's written a book on COVID, his network

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:43.920
effects, or his wheelhouse, both as an MD and as a sociologist. There was a lot that we believed

02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:53.360
we knew about the efficacy of closing schools during the Spanish flu pandemic and others,

02:51:54.480 --> 02:52:02.640
but there's a lot we didn't know about COVID. We didn't know how negligible the effects would be

02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:08.880
on kids compared to older people. I really enjoyed your conversation with Eric Topol,

02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:15.440
but also didn't. He's one of the great communicators in many ways on Twitter,

02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:24.080
like distillation of the current data. I hope I'm not overstating it, but there is a bit of an

02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:32.160
arrogance from him that I think could be explained by him being exhausted, by being constantly attacked

02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:37.840
by conspiracy theories, like anti-vaxxers. To me, the same thing happens with people that

02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:46.160
start drifting to being right-wing is to get attacked so much by the left, they become almost

02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:52.560
irrational and arrogant in their beliefs. I felt your conversation with Eric Topol did not

02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:58.640
sufficiently empathize with people that have skepticism, but also did not sufficiently

02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:04.640
communicate uncertainty we have. Many of the decisions you made, many of the things you were

02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:09.520
talking about, we're saying there's a lot of uncertainty, but this is the best thing we could

02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:14.080
do now. Well, it was a forced choice. You're going to get COVID. Do you want to be vaccinated when

02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:23.040
you get it? That was always, in my view, an easy choice. Up until you start breaking apart the

02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:28.960
cohorts and you start saying, okay, wait a minute, there is this myocarditis issue in young men.

02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:36.320
Let's talk about that. Before that story emerged, it was just clear that

02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:45.840
this is, if it's not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped, it is still mitigating

02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:58.400
severe illness and death. I still believe that it is the current view of most people competent to

02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:04.160
analyze the data, that we lost something like 300,000 people unnecessarily in the US

02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:11.360
vaccine hesitancy. I think there's a way to communicate with humility about the uncertainty

02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:18.000
of things that would increase the vaccination rate. I do believe that it is rational and

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:27.760
sometimes effective to signal impatience with certain bad ideas and certain conspiracy theories

02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:34.160
and certain forms of misinformation. I just think it makes you look like a douchebag most times.

02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:43.120
Certain people are persuadable, certain people are not persuadable, but it's the opportunity

02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:49.120
cost. Not everything can be given a patient hearing. You can't have a physics conference

02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:56.400
and then let people in to just trumpet their pet theories about the grand unified vision of physics

02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:07.280
when they're obviously crazy or when they're obviously half crazy. You begin to get a sense for

02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:13.840
this when it is your wheelhouse, but there are people who declare their

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:21.200
irrelevance to the conversation fairly quickly without knowing that they have done it.

02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:33.520
The truth is, I think I'm one of those people on the topic of COVID. It's never that I felt,

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:41.760
I know exactly what's going on here. I know these mRNA vaccines are safe. I know exactly how to run

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:50.080
a lockdown. This is a situation where you want the actual pilots to fly the plane. We needed

02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:57.440
experts who we could trust. Insofar as our experts got captured by all manner of things,

02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:01.520
some of them got captured by Trump. Some of them were made to look ridiculous just standing next

02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:08.400
to Trump while he was bloviating about whatever. It's just going to go away. There's just 15 people

02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:12.400
in a cruise ship and it's just going to go away. There's going to be no problem.

02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:18.400
Many of these doctors think, I understand this better than them. They're just amazed at how I

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:25.040
understand this. You've got doctors, real doctors, the heads of the CDC and NIH standing

02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:33.360
around just ashen-faced while he's talking. All of this was deeply corrupting of the public

02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:39.520
communication of science. Again, I've banged on about the depredations of wokeness. The

02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:50.560
woke thing was a disaster. It still is a disaster. The thing is, there's a big difference between

02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:55.600
me and Brett in this case. I didn't do 100 podcasts on COVID. I did two podcasts on COVID.

02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:00.880
The measure of my concern about COVID can be measured in how many podcasts I did on it.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:07.360
Once we had a sense of how to live with COVID, I was just living with COVID, like,

02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:12.640
okay, if you get vaxed or don't get vaxed, wear a mask or don't wear a mask. Travel or don't travel.

02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:19.280
You've got a few things to decide, but my kids were stuck at home on iPads for too long. I

02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:25.520
didn't agree with that. It was obviously not functional. I criticized that on the margins,

02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:31.120
but there was not much to do about it. The thing I didn't do is make this my life and just

02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:39.200
browbeat people with one message or another. We need a public health regime where we can trust

02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:48.320
what the competent people are saying to us about what medicines are safe to take. Even in the

02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:52.320
presence of that craziness is going to proliferate given the tools we've built, but in the absence

02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:58.800
of that, it's going to proliferate for understandable reasons. It's not going to be good

02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:08.080
next time when something orders of magnitude more dangerous hits us. In so far as I think about

02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:15.760
this issue, I think much more about next time than this time. Before this COVID thing, you and

02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:21.200
Brad had some good conversations. I would say we're friends. What do you admire most about

02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:25.040
Brad outside of all the criticism we've had about this COVID topic?

02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:33.840
I think Brad is very smart and he's a very ethical person who wants good things for the

02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:42.800
world. I have no reason to doubt that. The fact that we're cross-wise on this issue does not mean

02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:49.200
that I think he's a bad person. The thing that worried me about what he was doing,

02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:53.840
and this was true of Joe, and this was true of Elon, this is true of many other people,

02:58:53.840 --> 02:59:01.360
is that once you're messaging at scale to a vast audience, you incur a certain kind of

02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:10.480
responsibility not to get people killed. I did worry that people were making decisions on the

02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:16.080
basis of the information that was getting shared there. That's why I was, I think,

02:59:16.160 --> 02:59:23.280
fairly circumspect. I just said, okay, give me the center of the fairway expert opinion

02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:29.280
at this time point, and at this time point, and at this time point, and then I'm out. I don't

02:59:29.280 --> 02:59:34.080
have any more to say about this. I'm not an expert on COVID. I'm not an expert on the safety of mRNA

02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:41.840
vaccines. If something changes so as to become newsworthy, then maybe I'll do a podcast. I just

02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:50.400
did a podcast on the lab leak. I was never skeptical of the lab leak hypothesis. Brett

02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:58.160
was very early on saying, this is a lab leak at a point where my only position was, who cares

02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:03.520
if it's a lab leak? The thing we have to get straight is, what do we do given the nature

03:00:03.520 --> 03:00:08.480
of this pandemic? But also, we should say that you've actually stated that it is a possibility.

03:00:08.960 --> 03:00:14.480
You just said it doesn't quite matter. The time to figure that out, now, I've actually,

03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:21.520
I have had my podcast guest on this topic changed my view of this because one of the guests,

03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:29.040
Alina Chan, made the point that actually the best time to figure out the origin of this is

03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:32.880
immediately, because in the event you lose touch with the evidence, and I hadn't really

03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:39.280
been thinking about that. If you come back after a year, there are certain facts you might not be

03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:48.160
able to get in hand. But I've always felt that it didn't matter for two reasons. One is we had the

03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:53.360
genome of the virus and we could design, we're very quickly designed, immediately designing

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:57.040
vaccines against that genome, and that's what we had to do. And then we had to figure out how to

03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:02.880
vaccinate and to mitigate and to develop treatments and all of that.

03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:13.360
So the origin story didn't matter. Generically speaking, either origin story was politically

03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:18.720
inflammatory and made the Chinese look bad. And the Chinese response to this looked bad,

03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:24.160
whatever the origin story, right? They're not cooperating. They're stopping their domestic

03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:30.000
flights but letting their international flights go. They were bad actors and they should be treated

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:37.760
as such regardless of the origin. And I would argue that the wet market origin is even more

03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:45.840
politically invidious than the lab leak origin. Because to my eye, the lab leak could happen

03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:52.320
to anyone. All these advanced countries are running these dangerous labs. That's a practice

03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:59.120
that we should be worried about in general. We know lab leaks are a problem. There have been

03:01:59.120 --> 03:02:03.760
multiple lab leaks of even worse things that haven't gotten out of hand in this way but

03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:14.640
worse pathogens. We're wise to be worried about this and on some level, it could happen to anyone.

03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:21.280
The wet market makes them look like barbarians within another century. You've got to clean

03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:26.160
up those wet markets. What are you doing putting a bat on top of a pangolin, on top of a duck?

03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:33.760
Get your shit together. If anything, the wet market makes them look worse in my view. Now,

03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:39.760
I'm sure that what they actually did to conceal a lab leak, if it was a lab leak,

03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:44.400
all of that's going to look odious. Do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of that?

03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:53.920
One of the big negative, I would say failures of Anthony Fauci and so on is to be transparent and

03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:57.600
clear and it's just a good communicator about gain and function research, the dangers of that.

03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:07.440
Why it's a useful way of research but it's also dangerous just being transparent about that as

03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:12.880
opposed to just coming off really shady. Of course, the conspiracy theorists and the politicians are

03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:21.440
not helping but this just created a giant mess. I would agree that that exchange with Fauci and

03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:31.600
Rand Paul that went viral, I would agree that Fauci looked like he was taking refuge in very

03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:38.960
lawyered language and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why we do it.

03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:44.880
So, yeah, I think it looked shady, it played shady and it probably was shady. I don't know

03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:51.760
how personally entangled he is with any of this but the gain of function research is something that

03:03:53.120 --> 03:04:00.640
I think we're wise to be worried about and so far as I judge myself adequate to have an opinion on

03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:10.320
this, I think it should be banned. Probably a podcast I'll do if you or somebody else doesn't

03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:21.680
do it in the meantime, I would like a virologist to defend it against a virologist who would

03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:26.240
criticize it. Forget about just the gain of function research. I don't even understand

03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:31.520
virus hunting at this point. It's like, I don't even know why you need to go into a cave to find

03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:37.680
this next virus that could be circulating among bats that may jump zoonotically to us.

03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:45.600
Why do that when we can sequence in a day and make vaccines in a weekend?

03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:48.560
What kind of head start do you think you're getting?

03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:51.280
That's a surprising new thing, how quickly you can develop a vaccine.

03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:57.280
Exactly. Yeah, that's really interesting but the shagginess around lab leak.

03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:03.760
I think the point I didn't make about Brett's style of engaging this issue is people are using

03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:09.920
the fact that he was early on lab leak to suggest that he was right about ivermectin and about mRNA

03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:20.800
vaccines and all the rest. None of that connects and it was possible to be falsely confident.

03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:24.400
You shouldn't have been confident about lab. No one should have been confident about lab leak

03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:29.840
early even if it turns out to be lab leak. It was always plausible. It was never definite.

03:05:29.840 --> 03:05:36.880
It still isn't definite. Zoonotic is also quite plausible. It certainly was super plausible then.

03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:46.400
Both are politically uncomfortable. Both at the time were inflammatory to be banging on about

03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:49.360
when we were trying to secure some kind of cooperation from the Chinese.

03:05:50.240 --> 03:05:55.200
There's a time for these things and it's possible to be right by accident.

03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:09.120
The style of reasoning matters whether you're right or not because your style of reasoning

03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:12.160
is dictating what you're going to do on the next topic.

03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:21.280
Sure, but this is a this multi-various situation here. It's really difficult to

03:06:21.280 --> 03:06:26.880
know what's right on COVID given all the uncertainty, all the chaos, especially when you step outside

03:06:26.880 --> 03:06:33.680
the pure biology, virology of it and you start to get into policy. It's really, yeah, it's just

03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:43.360
trade-offs. Like transmissibility of the virus. Just knowing if 65% of the population gets

03:06:43.360 --> 03:06:48.880
vaccinated, what effect would that have? Just even knowing those things, just modeling all those

03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:55.120
things. Given all the other incentives, I mean Pfizer, I don't know what to think.

03:06:55.120 --> 03:07:00.160
You hadn't had the CEO of Pfizer on your podcast. Did you leave that conversation feeling like

03:07:01.040 --> 03:07:03.360
this is a person who is consciously

03:07:08.080 --> 03:07:17.600
reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk?

03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:22.800
Or did you think this person was making a good faith attempt to save lives

03:07:23.520 --> 03:07:31.920
and had no taint of bad incentives or something between them?

03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:38.320
The thing I sensed and I felt in part, it was a failure on my part,

03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:46.080
but I sensed that I was talking to a politician. So it's not thinking of there was malevolence

03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:53.200
there or benevolence. He just had a job. He put on a suit and I was talking to a suit,

03:07:53.200 --> 03:07:58.480
not a human being. Now he said that his son was a big fan of the podcast, which is why he

03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:04.480
wanted to do it. So I thought I would be talking to a human being. And I asked challenging questions

03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:11.040
where I thought the internet thinks otherwise. Every single question in that interview was a

03:08:11.040 --> 03:08:16.240
challenging one, but it wasn't grilling, which is what people seem to want to

03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:21.120
do with pharmaceutical companies. There's a deep distress of pharmaceutical companies.

03:08:21.120 --> 03:08:28.160
What's the alternative? I totally get that windfall profits at a time of public health

03:08:28.160 --> 03:08:39.760
emergency looks bad. It is a bad look, but how do we reward and return capital to risk takers

03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:46.960
who will spend a billion dollars to design a new drug for a disease that maybe only

03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:52.080
harms a single digit percentage of the population? What do we want to encourage?

03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:58.400
Who do we want to get rich? The person who cures cancer, do we want that person to get rich or

03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:04.320
not? We want the person who gave us the iPhone to get rich, but we don't want the person who

03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:07.360
cures cancer to get rich. What are we trying to do?

03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:11.920
I think it's a very gray area. So what we want is the person who declares that they have a cure

03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:19.440
for cancer to have authenticity and transparency. I think we're good now as a population smelling

03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:24.880
bullshit. And there is something about the Pfizer CEO, for example, just CEO of the pharmaceutical

03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:31.840
companies in general, just because they're so lured up, so much marketing PR people,

03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:39.280
that you just smell bullshit. You're not talking a real human. It just feels like

03:09:39.920 --> 03:09:47.600
none of it is transparent to us as a public. So this whole talking point that Pfizer's only

03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:53.120
interested in helping people just doesn't ring true, even though it very well could be true.

03:09:53.120 --> 03:09:58.960
It's the same thing with Bill Gates, who seems to be at scale helping a huge amount of people in

03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:04.000
the world. And yet there's something about the way he delivers that message, where people like,

03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:09.600
this seems suspicious. What's happening underneath this? There's certain kinds of

03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:16.480
communication styles that seem to be more serve as better catalysts for conspiracy theories.

03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:20.800
And I'm not sure what that is, because I don't think there's an alternative

03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:28.320
for capitalism in delivering drugs that help people. But also at the same time,

03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:32.960
there seems to need to be a more transparency. And plus regulation, that actually makes sense,

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.720
it seems like pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to corruption.

03:10:40.560 --> 03:10:47.360
Yeah, I worry about all that. But I also do think that most of the people go into those

03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:51.680
fields and most of the people going into government are doing it for good. And they're

03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:57.680
non-psycopaths trying to get good things done and trying to solve hard problems. And they're

03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:06.080
not trying to get rich. I mean, many of the people are, it's like, bad incentives or something.

03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:14.640
Again, I've uttered that phrase 30 times on this podcast, but it's just almost everywhere it explains

03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:21.120
normal people creating terrible harm. It's not that there are that many bad people.

03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:30.080
Yes, it makes the truly bad people that much more remarkable and worth paying attention to. But

03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:42.080
the bad incentives and the power of bad ideas do much more harm. Because that's what gets

03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:50.800
good people running in the wrong direction or doing things that are clearly creating unnecessary

03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:58.240
suffering. You've had and I hope still have a friendship with Elon Musk, especially over the

03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:03.120
topic of AI. You have a lot of interesting ideas that you both share, concerns that you both share.

03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:08.320
Well, let me first ask, what do you admire most about Elon?

03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:17.200
Well, I had a lot of fun with Elon. I like Elon a lot. I mean, Elon, I knew as a friend,

03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:29.200
I like a lot. It's not going to surprise anyone. He's done and he's continuing to do amazing

03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:39.360
things. I think many of his aspirations are realized, the world will be a much better place.

03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:44.720
I think it's just amazing to see what he's built and what he's attempted to build and what he may

03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:52.320
yet build. Tesla with SpaceX? Yeah, I'm a fan of almost all of that. I mean, there are wrinkles

03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:58.160
to a lot of that or some of that. All humans are full of wrinkles.

03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:02.240
There's something very Trumpian about how he's acting on Twitter. I mean, Twitter,

03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:06.800
I think Twitter, he thinks Twitter is great. He bought the place because he thinks it's so great.

03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:11.680
I think Twitter is driving him crazy. I think he's needlessly complicating his life and

03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:17.360
harming his reputation and creating a lot of noise and harming a lot of other people.

03:13:18.560 --> 03:13:24.320
The thing that I objected to with him on Twitter is not that he bought it and made changes to it.

03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:30.160
Again, I remain agnostic as to whether or not he can improve the platform.

03:13:31.280 --> 03:13:35.920
It was how he was personally behaving on Twitter, not just toward me, but toward the world.

03:13:36.480 --> 03:13:45.280
I think when you forward an article about Nancy Pelosi's husband being attacked, not as he was

03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:53.120
by some lunatic, but that it's just some gay, trist gone awry. That's not what it seems. You

03:13:53.120 --> 03:14:01.040
link to a website that previously claimed that Hillary Clinton was dead and that a body double

03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:07.280
was campaigning in her place. That thing was exploding in Trumpistan as a conspiracy theory.

03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:12.880
It was having its effect. It matters that he was signal boosting it in front of 130 million

03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:21.440
people. It is with saying that your former employee, Yoel Roth, is a pedophile. It's like,

03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:27.600
that has real consequences. It appeared to be complete bullshit and now this guy's getting

03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:34.720
inundated with death threats. Elon, that's all that's totally predictable. He's behaving quite

03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:41.760
recklessly. There's a long list of things like that that he's done on Twitter. It's not ethical.

03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:50.080
It's not good for him. It's not good for the world. It's not serious. It's a very adolescent

03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:57.520
relationship to real problems in our society. My problem with how he's behaved is that he's

03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:04.080
purported to touch real issues by turns like, okay, do I give the satellites to Ukraine or not?

03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:11.440
Do I minimize their use of them or not? Should I publicly worry about World War III or not?

03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:20.160
He's doing this shit on Twitter. At the same moment, he's doing these other very

03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:27.120
impulsive, ill-considered things and he's not showing any willingness to really clean up the

03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:34.240
mess he makes. He brings Kanye on knowing he's an anti-Semite who's got mental health problems

03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:38.480
and then kicks him off for a swastika, which I probably wouldn't have kicked him off for

03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:47.840
a swastika. Can you really kick people off for swastikas? Are you a free speech absolutist if

03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:52.960
you can't let a swastika show up? I'm not even sure that's enforceable in terms of service.

03:15:54.080 --> 03:15:58.960
There are moments to use swastikas that are not conveying hate and not raising the risk of violence.

03:15:58.960 --> 03:15:59.440
Clip that.

03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:06.240
But so much of what he's doing, given that he's, again, scale matters. He's doing this in front

03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:09.840
of 130 million people. That's very different than a million people and that's very different

03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:16.400
than 100,000 people. When I went off the tracks with Elon, he was doing this about COVID.

03:16:18.320 --> 03:16:24.400
Again, this was a situation where I tried to privately mitigate a friend's behavior

03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:32.000
and it didn't work out very well. Did you try to correct him highlighting things he might be wrong

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:38.480
on or did you use the Lex Power Love method? I should write like a pamphlet for Sam Harris.

03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:42.960
Well, no, but it was totally coming from a place of love because I was concerned about

03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:46.800
his reputation. I was concerned about what he, I mean, there was a two-fold concern.

03:16:46.800 --> 03:16:51.360
I could see what was happening with the tweet. I mean, he had this original tweet that was,

03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:57.920
I think it was panic over COVID is dumb or something like that. This is, boy, this is in March,

03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:02.240
this is early March, 2020. Oh, super early days.

03:17:02.240 --> 03:17:07.120
Super early. When nobody knew anything, but we knew we saw what was happening in Italy,

03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:12.400
right? It was totally kicking off. God, that was a wild time. That's when the toilet paper.

03:17:12.400 --> 03:17:18.080
It was totally wild, but that became the most influential tweet on Twitter for that week.

03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:22.320
I mean, it had more engagement than any other tweet, more than any crazy thing Trump was tweeting.

03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:33.280
It went off, again, it was just a nuclear bomb of information. I could see that people were

03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:39.040
responding to it like, wait a minute, okay, here's this genius technologist who must have

03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:43.760
inside information about everything, right? Surely he knows something that is not on the

03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:51.040
surface about this pandemic. They were reading into it a lot of information that I knew wasn't

03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:56.320
there, right? At the time, I didn't even, I didn't think he had any reason to be

03:17:56.320 --> 03:17:58.880
suggesting that. I think he was just firing off a tweet, right?

03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:03.760
So I reached out to him in private, and I mean, because it was a private

03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:11.440
text conversation, I won't talk about the details, but I'm just saying that's a case,

03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:16.720
you know, among the many cases of friends who have public platforms and who did something that

03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:22.240
I thought was dangerous and ill-considered. This was a case where I reached out in private

03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:32.800
and tried to help, genuinely help, because it was just, I thought it was harmful and in every

03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:37.520
sense, because it was being misinterpreted, and it was like, okay, you can say that panic over

03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:44.080
anything is dumb, fine, but this was not how this was landing. This was like non-issue, conspiracy,

03:18:45.040 --> 03:18:48.800
there's going to be no COVID in the US. It's going to peter out. It's just going to become

03:18:48.800 --> 03:18:53.520
a cold. I mean, that's how this was getting received. Whereas at that moment, it was absolutely

03:18:53.520 --> 03:18:58.160
obvious how big a deal this was going to be, or that it was going to, at minimum, going to be a

03:18:58.160 --> 03:19:03.360
big deal. I don't know if it was obvious, but it was obvious that it was a significant probability

03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:08.640
that it could be a big deal. I remember in March, it wasn't unclear, like, how big, because there

03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:13.200
were still stories of it, like it's probably going to like the big concern, the hospitals might

03:19:13.280 --> 03:19:15.680
overfill, but it's going to stay out in like two months or something.

03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:19.680
Yeah, we didn't know, but there was no way we weren't going to have

03:19:21.120 --> 03:19:29.280
tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum at that point. It was totally rational to be worried

03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:33.920
about hundreds of thousands. And when Nicholas Christakis came on my podcast very early,

03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:39.200
he predicted quite confidently that we would have about a million people dead in the US.

03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:46.640
And that didn't seem, I think, appropriately hedged, but I mean, it was still just like,

03:19:46.640 --> 03:19:51.200
okay, it's just going to, you just look at the, we're just kind of riding this exponential and

03:19:53.840 --> 03:19:59.200
it's going to be, it'd be very surprising not to have that order of magnitude and not something

03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:08.320
much less. And so anyway, I mean, again, to close the story on Elon,

03:20:10.880 --> 03:20:18.720
I could see how this was being received and I tried to get him to walk that back. And then we

03:20:20.400 --> 03:20:28.720
had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue. And that, so that intervention

03:20:28.800 --> 03:20:35.600
didn't work. And it was not done, I was not an asshole, I was not, I was just concerned

03:20:36.400 --> 03:20:44.640
for him, for the world, and then there are other relationships where

03:20:46.480 --> 03:20:50.240
I didn't take the, but again, that's an example where taking the time didn't work,

03:20:50.240 --> 03:20:53.200
right, privately. There are other relationships where I thought, okay,

03:20:53.200 --> 03:20:56.960
this is just going to be more trouble than it's worth. And I said, I just ignored it. And

03:20:57.680 --> 03:21:04.320
there's a lot of that. And frankly, again, I'm not comfortable with how this is all netted out,

03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:11.440
because I don't know if, frankly, I'm not comfortable with how much time in this conversation

03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:18.720
we've spent talking about these specific people. Like what good is it for me to talk about Elon

03:21:18.720 --> 03:21:23.600
or bread or anything? I think there's a lot of good because those friendships, listen, as a fan,

03:21:24.240 --> 03:21:32.960
these are the conversations I loved, love as a fan. And it feels like COVID has robbed the

03:21:32.960 --> 03:21:38.320
world of these conversations. Because you are exchanging back and forth on Twitter. But that's

03:21:38.320 --> 03:21:42.960
not what I mean by conversations, like long form discussions, like a debate about COVID,

03:21:43.680 --> 03:21:49.440
like a normal debate. But there's no, there is no, Elon and I shouldn't be debating COVID.

03:21:49.440 --> 03:21:54.000
You should be. Here's the thing with humility, like basically saying, we don't really know,

03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:59.440
like the Rogan method, we don't, we're just a bunch of idiots. Like one is an engineer,

03:21:59.440 --> 03:22:04.720
you're a neuroscientist, but like, it just kind of, okay, here's the evidence and be like normal

03:22:04.720 --> 03:22:09.360
people. That's what everybody was doing. The whole world was like trying to figure out what the hell,

03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:14.800
what? Yeah, but the issue was that at that, so at the moment I had this collision with Elon,

03:22:15.760 --> 03:22:21.680
certain things were not debatable, right? It was just, it was absolutely clear where this was going.

03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:26.240
It wasn't clear how far it was going to go or how quickly we would mitigate it, but

03:22:26.880 --> 03:22:32.320
it was absolutely clear that it was going to be an issue, right? The train had come off the

03:22:32.320 --> 03:22:39.440
tracks in Italy. We knew we weren't going to seal our borders. There were already people,

03:22:40.080 --> 03:22:45.280
you know, there are already cases known to many of us personally in the U.S. at that point,

03:22:47.920 --> 03:22:54.400
and he was operating by a very different logic that I couldn't engage with.

03:22:54.400 --> 03:22:59.520
Sure, but that logic represents a part of the population and there's a lot of interesting

03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:04.080
topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them, like the effectiveness of masks, like-

03:23:04.080 --> 03:23:08.960
Yeah, but no, but where things broke down was not at the point of, oh, there's a lot to talk

03:23:08.960 --> 03:23:13.920
about, a lot to debate, this is all very interesting, and who knows what's what. It broke down very

03:23:13.920 --> 03:23:23.520
early at this is, you know, there's nothing to talk about here, like either there's a water bottle

03:23:23.520 --> 03:23:30.160
on the table or there isn't, right? Well, technically, there's only one fourth of a water

03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:35.120
bottle. So what defines a water bottle? Is it the water inside the water bottle? Is it the water

03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:38.320
bottle? Well, I'm giving you as an example of it's worth a conversation.

03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:47.520
This is difficult because we had an exchange in private and I want to honor not exposing

03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:55.680
the details of it, but, you know, the details convinced me that there was not a follow-up

03:23:55.680 --> 03:24:03.200
conversation on that topic. On this topic. That said, I hope, and I hope to be part of helping

03:24:03.280 --> 03:24:07.760
that happen, that the friendship is rekindled because one of the topics I care a lot about,

03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:13.680
artificial intelligence, you've had great public and private conversations about this topic.

03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:20.640
Yeah, and Elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously. I mean, he and I went to

03:24:20.640 --> 03:24:27.040
that initial conference in Puerto Rico together and it was only because he was going and I found

03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:32.240
out about it through him and I just wrote his coattails to it, you know, that I got to

03:24:33.280 --> 03:24:38.320
dropped in that side of the pool to hear about these concerns at that point.

03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:47.280
It would be interesting to hear how has your concern evolved with the coming out of ChadGPT

03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:53.680
and these new large language models that are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning and

03:24:53.680 --> 03:24:59.120
seemingly to be able to do some incredible human-like things. There's two questions. One,

03:24:59.120 --> 03:25:04.080
how is your concern in terms of AGI and superintelligence evolved and how impressed are you

03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:08.560
with ChadGPT as a student of the human mind and mind in general?

03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:18.080
Well, my concern about AGI is unchanged. I've spoken about it a bunch on my podcast,

03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:26.000
but I did a TED talk in 2016, which was the kind of summary of what that conference and

03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:32.240
various conversations I had after that did to my brain on this topic.

03:25:33.680 --> 03:25:40.720
Basically, once superintelligence is achieved, there's a take-off. It becomes exponentially

03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:45.920
smarter and in a matter of time, they're just where ants and they're gods.

03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:57.600
Yeah, unless we find some way of permanently tethering a superintelligent,

03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:04.000
superintelligent self-improving AI to our value system. I don't believe anyone has figured out

03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:07.440
how to do that or whether that's even possible in principle. I know people like Stuart Russell,

03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:12.880
who I just had on my podcast, are trying- Oh, really? Have you released it?

03:26:12.960 --> 03:26:16.960
I haven't released it yet. He's been on previous podcasts, but we just recorded this week.

03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:21.600
Because you haven't done an AI podcast in a while, so it's great. He's a good person to

03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:28.160
talk about alignment with. Yeah, so Stuart has been probably more than anyone,

03:26:28.160 --> 03:26:32.000
my guru on this topic. I mean, you're just reading his book and doing, I think I've done

03:26:32.640 --> 03:26:36.720
two podcasts with him at this point. I think it's called The Control Problem or something like that.

03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:39.040
His book is Human Compatible.

03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:46.400
Yeah, he talks about the control problem. Yeah, so I just think the idea that we can

03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:53.520
define a value function in advance that permanently tethers a self-improving

03:26:53.520 --> 03:27:02.000
superintelligent AI to our values as we continue to discover them, refine them,

03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:08.800
extrapolate them in an open-ended way, I think that's a tall order. I think

03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:14.000
there are many more ways, there must be many more ways of designing superintelligence that

03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:20.160
is not aligned in that way and is not ever approximating our values in that way. So Stuart's

03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:27.360
idea to put it in a very simple way is that he thinks you don't want to specify the value

03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:32.880
function up front. You don't want to imagine you could ever write the code in such a way as to

03:27:32.880 --> 03:27:42.800
admit of no loophole. You want to make the AI uncertain as to what human values are and perpetually

03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:49.120
uncertain and always trying to ameliorate that uncertainty by hewing more and more closely

03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:55.760
to what our professed values are. So it's always interested in saying, oh, no, no, that's not what

03:27:55.760 --> 03:28:00.800
we want. That's not what we intend. Stop doing that. No matter how smart it gets, all it wants

03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:07.440
to do is more perfectly approximate human values. I think there are a lot of problems with that at

03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:10.800
a high level. I'm not a computer scientist, so I'm sure there are many problems at a low level

03:28:10.800 --> 03:28:16.320
that I don't understand. Like how to force a human into the loop always, no matter what.

03:28:16.320 --> 03:28:24.720
There's that and what humans get a vote and what do humans value and what is the difference between

03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:33.200
what we say we value and our revealed preferences. If you were a super intelligent AI that could

03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:41.040
look at humanity now, I think you could be forgiven for concluding that what we value is

03:28:41.920 --> 03:28:48.080
driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and living perpetually on the brink of nuclear war and just

03:28:48.080 --> 03:28:52.800
watching hot girls and yoga pants on TikTok again and again and again.

03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:59.840
You're saying that is not? This is all revealed preference and it's what is an AI to make of

03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:06.640
that and what should it optimize? So part of this is also Stuart's observation that

03:29:07.680 --> 03:29:12.160
one of the insidious things about the YouTube algorithm is it's not that it just caters

03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:20.080
to our preferences. It actually begins to change us in ways so as to make us more predictable.

03:29:20.080 --> 03:29:27.040
If I could find ways to make us a better reporter of our preferences and to trim our

03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:34.480
preferences down so that it can further train to that signal. So the main concern is that

03:29:35.680 --> 03:29:41.520
most of the people in the field seem not to be taking intelligence seriously.

03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:49.440
So as they design more and more intelligent machines and as they profess to want to design

03:29:49.440 --> 03:29:58.320
true AGI, they're not spending the time that Stuart is spending trying to figure out how to

03:29:58.320 --> 03:30:05.200
do this safely above all. They're just assuming that these problems are going to solve themselves

03:30:05.680 --> 03:30:09.600
as we make that final stride into the end zone or they're saying very

03:30:12.640 --> 03:30:20.240
polyanish things like an AI would never form a motive to harm human. Why would it ever form a

03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:27.920
motive to be malicious toward humanity unless we put that motive in there? That's not the concern.

03:30:27.920 --> 03:30:37.360
The concern is that in the presence of vast disparities and competence and in certainly

03:30:37.360 --> 03:30:41.120
in a condition where the machines are improving themselves, they're improving their own code,

03:30:41.840 --> 03:30:48.640
they could be developing instrumental goals that are antithetical to our well-being

03:30:48.640 --> 03:30:56.000
without any intent to harm us. It's analogous to what we do to every other species on Earth.

03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:04.320
You and I don't consciously form the intention to harm insects on a daily basis, but there are many

03:31:04.320 --> 03:31:11.040
things we could intend to do that would in fact harm insects because you decide to repave your

03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:17.760
driveway or whatever you're doing. You're just not taking the interest of insects into account

03:31:17.760 --> 03:31:22.560
because they're so far beneath you in terms of your cognitive horizons.

03:31:22.800 --> 03:31:32.240
The real challenge here is that if you believe that intelligence scales up on a continuum

03:31:33.280 --> 03:31:38.720
toward heights that we can only dimly imagine. I think there's every reason to believe that.

03:31:38.720 --> 03:31:41.600
There's no reason to believe that we're near the summit of intelligence.

03:31:42.560 --> 03:31:52.400
Maybe there are some forms of intelligence for which this is not true, but for many

03:31:52.400 --> 03:31:58.320
relevant forms, like the top 100 things we care about cognitively, I think there's every reason

03:31:58.320 --> 03:32:03.520
to believe that many of those things, most of those things, are a lot like chess or go,

03:32:03.520 --> 03:32:07.680
where once the machines get better than we are, they're going to stay better than we are, although

03:32:08.240 --> 03:32:11.600
I don't know if you caught the recent thing with Go where this guy actually came out of

03:32:11.600 --> 03:32:16.320
Stewart's lab. One time a human beta machine.

03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:23.920
They found a hack for that. But anyway, ultimately, there's going to be no looking back. And then

03:32:23.920 --> 03:32:33.840
the question is, what do we do in relationship to these systems that are more competent than we

03:32:33.840 --> 03:32:41.360
are in every relevant respect? Because it will be a relationship. The people who think we're just

03:32:41.360 --> 03:32:47.520
going to figure this all out without thinking about it in advance, the solutions are just going to

03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:58.240
find themselves, seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating autonomous super

03:32:58.240 --> 03:33:05.440
intelligence seriously. What does that mean? It's every bit as independent and

03:33:05.440 --> 03:33:11.680
ungovernable, ultimately, as us having created, I mean, just imagine if we created a race of people

03:33:12.240 --> 03:33:17.440
that were 10 times smarter than all of us. How would we live with those people? They're 10 times

03:33:17.440 --> 03:33:22.000
smarter than us, right? They begin to talk about things we don't understand. They begin to want

03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:26.880
things we don't understand. They begin to view us as obstacles to them, to their solving those

03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:33.680
problems or gratifying those desires. We become the chickens or the monkeys in their presence.

03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:43.920
And I think that it's, but for some amazing solution of the sort that Stuart is imagining,

03:33:43.920 --> 03:33:49.360
that we could somehow anchor their reward function permanently, no matter how intelligent scales.

03:33:49.920 --> 03:34:00.880
I think it's really worth worrying about this. I do buy the sci-fi notion that this is an

03:34:00.880 --> 03:34:07.120
existential risk if we don't do it well. I worry that we don't notice it. I'm deeply impressed

03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:14.080
with Chad GPT and I'm worried that it will become super intelligent. These language models will

03:34:14.080 --> 03:34:17.840
become super intelligent because they're basically trained in the collective intelligence of the

03:34:17.840 --> 03:34:23.280
human species and then it will start controlling our behavior if they're integrated into our algorithms,

03:34:24.320 --> 03:34:31.760
the recommender systems. And then we just won't notice that there's a super intelligent system

03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:38.720
that's controlling our behavior. Well, I think that's true even before, far before super intelligence,

03:34:38.720 --> 03:34:45.680
even before general intelligence. I mean, I think just the narrow intelligence of these algorithms

03:34:45.680 --> 03:35:01.120
and of what something like Chad GPT can do, I mean, it's just far short of it developing its own

03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:10.000
goals and that are at cross purposes with ours. Just the unintended consequences of

03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:17.280
using it in the ways we're going to be incentivized to use it and the money to be made from scaling

03:35:17.280 --> 03:35:24.480
this thing and what it does to our information space and our sense of just being able to get

03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:36.320
to ground truth on any facts, it's super scary. Do you think it's a giant leap in terms of the

03:35:36.320 --> 03:35:46.800
development towards AGI, Chad GPT, or is it just an impressive little toolbox? So when do you think

03:35:46.800 --> 03:35:53.360
the singularity is coming? Or is it T? It doesn't matter. I have no intuitions on that front,

03:35:53.360 --> 03:36:00.400
apart from the fact that if we continue to make progress, it will come. You just have to assume

03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:04.320
we continue to make progress. There's only two assumptions. You have to assume

03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:11.600
substrate independence. So there's no reason why this can't be done in silico. We can build

03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:19.440
arbitrarily intelligent machines. There's nothing magical about having this done in the wet wear

03:36:19.440 --> 03:36:24.400
of our own brains. I think that is true and I think that's scientifically parsimonious to think

03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:29.520
that that's true. Then you just have to assume we're going to keep making progress. It doesn't

03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:33.520
have to be any special rate of progress. It doesn't have to be Moore's law. It can just be,

03:36:33.520 --> 03:36:40.320
we just keep going. At a certain point, we're going to be in relationship to minds leaving

03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:47.440
consciousness aside. I don't have any reason to believe that they'll necessarily be conscious by

03:36:47.440 --> 03:36:52.800
virtue of being super intelligent and that's its own interesting ethical question. But

03:36:55.200 --> 03:37:02.800
leaving consciousness aside, they're going to be more competent than we are. Then that's like

03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:11.120
the aliens have landed. That's an encounter with, again, leaving aside the possibility that

03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:19.920
something like Stewart's path is actually available to us. But it is hard to picture

03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:25.200
if what we mean by intelligence, all things considered and it's truly general,

03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:42.880
if that scales and begins to build upon itself, how you maintain that perfect slavish devotion

03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:47.360
until the end of time in those systems. The tether to humans?

03:37:48.160 --> 03:37:56.880
I think my gut says that there's a lot of ways to do it. It's not this increasingly impossible

03:37:56.880 --> 03:38:05.760
problem. I'm not a computer scientist. I have no intuitions about his algorithmically

03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:12.240
how you would approach that and what's possible. My main intuitions is maybe deeply flawed, but the

03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:17.840
main intuition is based on the fact that most of the learning is currently happening on human

03:38:17.840 --> 03:38:26.240
knowledge. So even chat GPT is just trained on human data. I don't see where the takeoff happens

03:38:26.240 --> 03:38:32.160
where you completely go above human wisdom. The current impressive aspect of chat GPT is that's

03:38:32.160 --> 03:38:39.840
using collective intelligence of all of us. From what I glean, again, from people who know much

03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:48.160
more about this than I do, I think we have reason to be skeptical that these techniques of deep

03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:56.320
learning are actually going to be sufficient to push us into AGI. They're not generalizing in the

03:38:56.320 --> 03:39:03.920
way they need to. They're certainly not learning like human children. There's brittle and strange

03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:13.840
ways. It's not to say that the human path is the only path. Maybe we might learn better lessons

03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:22.880
by ignoring the way brains work, but we know that they don't generalize and use abstraction the way

03:39:22.880 --> 03:39:31.520
we do. They have strange holes in their competence. But the size of the holes is shrinking every time.

03:39:31.920 --> 03:39:39.680
That's so the intuition starts to slowly fall apart. The intuition is surely can't be this simple

03:39:39.680 --> 03:39:47.600
to achieve intelligence. It's becoming simpler and simpler. The progress is quite incredible.

03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:52.160
I've been extremely impressed with chat GPT and the new models, and there's a lot of financial

03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:57.920
incentive to make progress in this regard. We're going to be living through some very interesting

03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:06.480
times. In raising a question that I'm going to be talking to you, a lot of people brought up this

03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:11.680
topic probably because Eric Weinstein talked to Joe Rogan recently and said that he and you were

03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:21.680
contacted by folks about UFOs. Can you clarify the nature of this contact? I've got very little

03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:27.600
to say on this. He has much more to say. I think he went down this rabbit hole further than

03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:34.800
I did, which wouldn't surprise anyone. He's got much more of a taste for this sort of thing than

03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:40.480
I do, but I think we're contacted by the same person. It wasn't clear to me who this person was

03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:49.200
or how this person got that my cell phone number. It didn't seem like we were getting

03:40:49.200 --> 03:40:53.920
punked. I mean, the person seemed credible to me. Then we're talking to you about the release of

03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:58.320
different videos on UFOs. Yeah. This is when there was a flurry of activity around this. There

03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:08.160
was a big New Yorker article on UFOs and there was rumors of congressional hearings, I think,

03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:18.560
come in and the videos that were being debunked or not. This person contacted both of us, I think,

03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:22.640
around the same time. I think he might have contacted Rogan or other. Eric is just the only

03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:34.800
person I've spoken to about it, I think, who I know was contacted. What happened is the person

03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:42.640
kept writing a check that he didn't cash. He kept saying, okay, next week, I understand this is

03:41:42.640 --> 03:41:48.640
sounding spooky and you have no reason to really trust me, but next week I'm going to put you on

03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:54.000
a Zoom call with people who you will recognize and they're going to be former heads of the CIA.

03:41:56.560 --> 03:42:02.160
Within five seconds of being on the Zoom call, you'll know this is not a hoax. I said, great,

03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:11.440
just send me the Zoom link. That happened maybe three times. There was just one phone conversation

03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:19.760
and then it was just texts. There's just a bunch of texts. I think Eric spent more time with this

03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:28.000
person and I haven't spoken to him about it. I know he's spoken about it publicly. It's not

03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:33.120
that my bullshit detector ever really went off in a big way, it's just the thing never happened.

03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:40.880
I lost interest. You made a comment which is interesting, which I really appreciate.

03:42:40.960 --> 03:42:46.880
You ran a thought experiment of saying, okay, maybe we do have alien spacecraft,

03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:53.280
or just a thought experiment that aliens did visit, and then this very kind of nihilistic,

03:42:53.280 --> 03:42:59.440
sad thought that it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't affect your life. Can you explain that?

03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:08.320
I think many people noticed this. This was a sign of how crazy the news cycle was at that

03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:13.360
point. We had COVID, we had Trump, and I forget when the UFO thing was really kicking off, but

03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:20.960
it just seemed like no one had the bandwidth to even be interested in this. I was amazed to

03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:30.960
notice in myself that I wasn't more interested in figuring out what was going on. I considered,

03:43:31.200 --> 03:43:38.480
wait a minute. If this is true, this is the biggest story in anyone's lifetime. I mean,

03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:45.680
contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest story in anyone's lifetime in human

03:43:45.680 --> 03:43:55.200
history. Why isn't this just totally captivating? Not only was it not totally captivating,

03:43:55.200 --> 03:43:59.920
it was just barely rising to the level of my being able to pay attention to it.

03:44:02.880 --> 03:44:14.240
One, to some degree, an understandable defense mechanism against the bogus claims that have

03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:20.800
been made about this kind of thing in the past. The general sense is probably bullshit,

03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:25.360
it probably has some explanation that is purely terrestrial and not surprising.

03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:31.920
And there is somebody who, what's his name? Is it Mick West? I forget, is it a YouTuber?

03:44:31.920 --> 03:44:33.680
Yeah, Mick West, yeah. He debunked stuff.

03:44:33.680 --> 03:44:40.640
Yeah, I mean, I have since seen some of those videos. Now this is going back still at least

03:44:40.640 --> 03:44:47.040
a year, but some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of some of the optical evidence.

03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:55.360
And I'm surprised we haven't seen more of that. There was a fairly credulous 60 minutes piece

03:44:55.360 --> 03:44:59.600
that came out around that time looking at some of that video, and it was the very video that he

03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:05.120
was debunking on YouTube, and his video only had like 50,000 views on it or whatever.

03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:10.800
But again, it seemed like a fairly credible debunking. I haven't seen debunkings of his

03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:14.960
debunkings, but- I think there is, but he's basically saying that there is

03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:18.080
there is possible explanations for it. Right.

03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:21.280
And usually in these kinds of contexts, if there's a possible explanation,

03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:28.800
even if it seems unlikely, it's going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us.

03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:32.080
Yeah, it's the extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle,

03:45:32.080 --> 03:45:34.640
which I think is generally true.

03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:39.440
Well, with aliens, I think generally, I think there should be some humility about

03:45:39.440 --> 03:45:44.080
what they would look like when they show up. I tend to think they're already here.

03:45:44.080 --> 03:45:47.840
The amazing thing about this AI conversation, though, is that we're talking about a circumstance

03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:55.600
where we would be designing the aliens, and there's every reason to believe that

03:45:55.600 --> 03:46:01.760
eventually this is going to happen. I'm not at all skeptical about the coming reality

03:46:01.760 --> 03:46:03.520
of the aliens, that we're going to build them.

03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:07.200
Now, here's the thing. Does this apply to when superintelligence shows up?

03:46:08.160 --> 03:46:13.040
Will this be trending on Twitter for a day, and then we'll go on to complain about

03:46:14.080 --> 03:46:17.360
something Sam Harris once again said in his podcast the next day?

03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:22.640
You tend to trend on Twitter, even though you're not on Twitter, which is great.

03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:28.560
Yeah, I haven't noticed. I did notice when I was on, but-

03:46:29.520 --> 03:46:36.400
Do you have this concern about AGI, basically, the same kind of thing that we would just

03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:41.440
look the other way? Is there something about this time where even like World War III,

03:46:41.440 --> 03:46:48.320
which has been throwing around very casually, concerningly so, even that the new cycle wipes

03:46:48.320 --> 03:46:56.720
that away? Yeah. Well, I think we have this general problem that we can't make

03:46:58.880 --> 03:47:10.480
certain information, even unequivocally certain information, emotionally salient.

03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:17.120
We respond quite readily to certain things. As we talked about, we respond to the

03:47:18.560 --> 03:47:24.240
little girl who fell down a well. That gets 100% of our emotional resources, but

03:47:25.200 --> 03:47:32.160
the abstract probability of nuclear war, even a high probability, even an intolerable

03:47:32.160 --> 03:47:43.200
probability, even if we put it at 30%. That's Russian roulette with a gun with three chambers,

03:47:43.200 --> 03:47:47.680
and it's aimed at the heads, not only your head, but your kid's head and everyone's kid's head,

03:47:47.680 --> 03:47:56.720
and it's just 24 hours a day. I think people who, this pre-Ukraine, I think the people who have

03:47:56.720 --> 03:48:03.040
made it their business to professionally to think about the risk of nuclear war and to

03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:11.040
mitigate it, people like Graham Allison or William Perry. I think they were putting the

03:48:11.680 --> 03:48:19.440
ongoing risk, the risk that we're going to have a proper nuclear war at some point in the next

03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:26.320
generation, people were putting it at something like 50%. They were living with this sort of

03:48:26.320 --> 03:48:33.920
Damocles over our heads. Now, you might wonder whether anyone could have reliable intuitions

03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:40.800
about the probability of that kind of thing, but the status quo is truly alarming. We've got

03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:48.880
we've got ICBMs on the leaf side, smaller exchanges and tactical nukes and how we could

03:48:48.880 --> 03:48:59.520
have a world war based on incremental changes. We've got the biggest bombs aimed at the biggest

03:48:59.520 --> 03:49:10.800
cities in both directions, and it's old technology. It's vulnerable to some lunatic

03:49:10.800 --> 03:49:17.360
deciding to launch or misreading bad data, and we know we've been saved from nuclear war

03:49:20.080 --> 03:49:27.840
I think at least twice by Soviet submarine commanders deciding, I'm not going to pass

03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:35.360
this up the chain of command. This is almost certainly an error, and it turns out it was an

03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:45.360
error. We need people to, in that particular case, he saw, I think it was five what seemed

03:49:45.360 --> 03:49:51.920
like five missiles launched from the US to Russia, and he reasoned if America was going to engage

03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:57.360
in a first strike, they'd launched more than five missiles. This has to be fictional,

03:49:57.360 --> 03:50:04.560
and then he waited long enough to decide that it was fictional. The probability of a nuclear war

03:50:04.560 --> 03:50:11.520
happening by mistake or some other species of inadvertence, misunderstanding,

03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:20.720
technical malfunction, that's intolerable. Forget about the intentional use of it by

03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:30.000
people who are driven crazy by some ideology. More and more technologies are unable to kind

03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:37.120
of scale destruction. Misinformation plays into this picture in a way that is especially

03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:45.200
scary. Once you can get a deep fake of any current president of the United States claiming to have

03:50:45.200 --> 03:50:52.880
launched a first strike and just send that everywhere. They could change the nature of truth,

03:50:52.880 --> 03:51:00.160
and then that might change the engine we have for skepticism is sharpening it,

03:51:01.120 --> 03:51:06.800
the more you have deep fakes. We might have AI and digital watermarks that help us. Maybe we'll

03:51:07.520 --> 03:51:15.760
not trust any information that hasn't come through specific channels. In my world,

03:51:16.720 --> 03:51:28.000
I no longer feel the need to respond to anything other than what I put out in my channels of

03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:34.480
information. There are so many people who have clipped stuff of me that shows the opposite of

03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:39.200
what I was actually saying in context. The people who have re-edited my podcast audio to make it

03:51:39.200 --> 03:51:45.360
seem like I said the opposite of what I was saying. Unless I put it out, you can't be sure

03:51:45.360 --> 03:51:55.360
that I actually said it. But I don't know what it's like to live like that for all forms of

03:51:55.360 --> 03:52:05.360
information. Strangely, I think it may require a greater siloing of information in the end.

03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:13.200
We're living through this wild west period where everyone's got a newsletter and everyone's got a

03:52:13.200 --> 03:52:17.600
blog and everyone's got an opinion. But once you can fake everything.

03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:23.360
There might be a greater value for expertise for experts, but a more rigorous system for

03:52:23.360 --> 03:52:28.480
identifying who the experts are. Yeah, or just knowing that it's going to be an arms race to

03:52:29.600 --> 03:52:37.360
authenticate information. So it's like, if you can never trust a photograph unless it has been

03:52:37.360 --> 03:52:44.640
vetted by Getty Images because only Getty Images has the resources to authenticate the provenance

03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:51.600
of that photograph and a test that hasn't been meddled with by AI. And again, I don't even know

03:52:51.600 --> 03:52:59.040
if that's technically possible. And maybe whatever the tools available for this will be commodified

03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:04.160
and the cost will be driven to zero so quickly that everyone will be able to do it. It could be

03:53:04.160 --> 03:53:10.560
like encryption. And it will be proven and tested most effectively first, of course, as always in

03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:17.920
porn, which is where most of human innovation technology happens first. Well, I have to ask

03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:22.880
because Ron Howard, the director asked us on Twitter, since we're talking about the threat

03:53:22.880 --> 03:53:27.840
of nuclear war and otherwise, he asked, I'd be interested in both your expectations for human

03:53:27.840 --> 03:53:34.880
society if when we move beyond Mars, will those societies be industrial based? How will it be

03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:41.440
governed? How will criminal infractions be dealt with when you read or watch sci-fi what comes

03:53:41.440 --> 03:53:47.520
closest to sounding logical? Do you think about our society beyond Earth? If we call it as Mars,

03:53:47.520 --> 03:53:54.000
if we call it as space? Yeah, well, I think I have a pretty humbling picture of that. I mean,

03:53:54.480 --> 03:54:00.160
because we're still going to be the apes that we are. So when you imagine colonizing Mars,

03:54:00.880 --> 03:54:06.400
you have to imagine a first fistfight on Mars. You have to imagine a first murder on Mars.

03:54:06.400 --> 03:54:11.600
Also infidelity? Yeah, extramarital affairs on Mars. So it's going to get

03:54:13.520 --> 03:54:19.840
really homely and boring really fast, I think. It's like only the spacesuits or the other

03:54:20.240 --> 03:54:29.600
exigencies of just living in that atmosphere or lack thereof will limit how badly we can behave on Mars.

03:54:30.160 --> 03:54:34.640
But do you think most of the interaction will be still in meat space versus digital? Do you think

03:54:34.640 --> 03:54:40.880
there'll be, do you think we're like living through a transformation of a kind where we're

03:54:40.880 --> 03:54:45.760
going to be doing more and more interaction than digital space? Like everything we've been complaining

03:54:45.760 --> 03:54:50.960
about Twitter, is it possible that Twitter is just the early days of a broken system that's

03:54:50.960 --> 03:54:55.360
actually giving birth to a better working system that's ultimately digital?

03:54:56.960 --> 03:55:05.280
I think we're going to experience a pendulum swing back into the real world. I mean, I think

03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:12.320
many of us are experiencing that now anyway. I mean, just wanting to have face-to-face encounters

03:55:12.320 --> 03:55:18.480
and spend less time on our phones and less time online. I think maybe everyone isn't going in that

03:55:18.480 --> 03:55:26.160
direction, but I do notice it myself and I notice, I mean, once I got off Twitter,

03:55:26.160 --> 03:55:30.560
then I noticed the people who were never on Twitter, right? And the people who were never,

03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:33.600
basically, I mean, I know I have a lot of friends who were never on Twitter.

03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:40.480
And they actually never understood what I was doing on Twitter. It wasn't that they were seeing it

03:55:40.480 --> 03:55:48.560
and then reacting to it, they just didn't know. It's like I'm not on Reddit either,

03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:52.720
but I don't spend any time thinking about not being on Reddit. It's like I'm just not on Reddit.

03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:58.160
Do you think the pursuit of human happiness is better achieved and more effectively achieved

03:55:58.160 --> 03:56:06.000
outside of Twitter world? Well, I think all we have is our attention in the end,

03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:14.000
and we just have to notice what these various tools are doing to it. And it's just, it became

03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:20.480
very clear to me that it was an unrewarding use of my attention. Now, it's not to say there isn't

03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:27.440
some digital platform that's conceivable that would be useful and rewarding, but

03:56:28.400 --> 03:56:36.560
yeah, I mean, we just have, you know, our life is doled out to us in moments. And we have,

03:56:36.560 --> 03:56:44.480
and we're continually solving this riddle of what is going to suffice to make this moment engaging

03:56:45.360 --> 03:56:53.280
and meaningful and aligned with who I want to be now and how I want the future to look,

03:56:54.240 --> 03:56:59.760
that we have this tension between being in the present and becoming in the future.

03:57:02.800 --> 03:57:08.480
It's a seeming paradox. Again, it's not really a paradox, but I do think the ground truth

03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:16.240
for personal well-being is to find a mode of being where you can pay attention

03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:20.800
to the present moment, and this is meditation by another name.

03:57:21.760 --> 03:57:29.200
You can pay attention to the present moment with sufficient gravity that you recognize that

03:57:30.480 --> 03:57:33.680
just consciousness itself in the present moment, no matter what's happening,

03:57:34.480 --> 03:57:42.320
is already a circumstance of freedom and contentment and tranquility. You can be happy now

03:57:43.040 --> 03:57:48.400
before anything happens, before this next desire gets gratified, before this next problem gets

03:57:48.400 --> 03:57:54.320
solved. There's this kind of ground truth that you're free, that consciousness is free and open

03:57:54.320 --> 03:58:01.600
and unencumbered by really any problem until you get lost in thought about all the problems that

03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:08.640
may yet be real for you. So the ability to catch and observe consciousness, that in itself is a

03:58:08.640 --> 03:58:15.600
source of happiness. Without being lost in thought. And so this happens haphazardly for people who

03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:20.800
don't meditate because they'll find something in their life that's so captivating, it's so pleasurable,

03:58:20.800 --> 03:58:27.520
it's so thrilling. It can even be scary, but it can be even being scared is captivated. It gets

03:58:28.880 --> 03:58:36.480
their attention, whatever it is. Sebastian Younger wrote a great book about people's

03:58:36.480 --> 03:58:42.320
experience in war here. Strangely, it can be the best experience anyone's ever had because

03:58:42.320 --> 03:58:48.400
everything, it's like only the moment matters. The bullet is whizzing by your head. You're not

03:58:48.400 --> 03:58:54.320
thinking about your 401k or that thing that you didn't say last week to the person you shouldn't

03:58:54.320 --> 03:58:59.280
have been talking about. You're not thinking about Twitter. It's like you're just fully immersed in

03:58:59.280 --> 03:59:07.280
the present moment. Meditation is the only way, I mean, that word can mean many things to many

03:59:07.280 --> 03:59:15.600
people, but what I mean by meditation is simply the discovery that there is a way to engage the

03:59:15.600 --> 03:59:20.000
present moment directly regardless of what's happening. You don't need to be in a war. You

03:59:20.000 --> 03:59:24.560
don't need to be having sex. You don't need to be on drugs. You don't need to be surfing. Nothing,

03:59:24.560 --> 03:59:29.600
there doesn't have to be a peak experience. It can be completely ordinary, but you can recognize

03:59:30.320 --> 03:59:37.360
that in some basic sense, there's only this and everything else is something you're thinking.

03:59:37.360 --> 03:59:42.640
You're thinking about the past. You're thinking about the future. Thoughts themselves have no

03:59:42.640 --> 03:59:50.000
substance. It's fundamentally mysterious that any thought ever really commandeers your sense of who

03:59:50.000 --> 03:59:57.680
you are and makes you anxious or afraid or angry or whatever it is. The more you discover that,

03:59:58.320 --> 04:00:01.600
the half-life of all these negative emotions that blow all of us around

04:00:02.480 --> 04:00:11.280
get much, much shorter. The anger that would have kept you angry for hours or days

04:00:12.160 --> 04:00:19.440
lasts four seconds because the moment it arises, you recognize it and you can get off. At

04:00:19.440 --> 04:00:25.120
minimum, you can decide whether it's useful to stay angry at that moment. Obviously, it usually

04:00:25.600 --> 04:00:27.760
isn't. And the illusion of free will is one of those thoughts.

04:00:28.320 --> 04:00:34.720
Yeah, it's all just happening. Even the mindful and meditative response to this is just happening.

04:00:37.600 --> 04:00:43.920
The moments where you recognize or not recognize it's just happening. This does open up a degree

04:00:43.920 --> 04:00:49.040
of freedom for a person, but it's not a freedom that gives any motivation to the notion of free

04:00:49.040 --> 04:00:53.200
will. It's just a new way of being in the world.

04:00:53.200 --> 04:00:58.240
Is there a difference between intellectually knowing free will as an illusion and really

04:00:58.240 --> 04:01:05.200
experiencing it? What's the longest you've been able to experience, the escape, the illusion of

04:01:05.200 --> 04:01:15.040
free will? Well, it's always obvious to me when I pay attention. Whenever I'm mindful, the term

04:01:15.040 --> 04:01:21.120
of jargon in the Buddhist and increasingly outside the Buddhist context is mindfulness,

04:01:21.120 --> 04:01:28.160
but there are different levels of mindfulness and there's different degrees of insight into this.

04:01:28.800 --> 04:01:36.720
What I'm calling evidence of lack of free will and lack of the self, two sides of the same coin,

04:01:36.720 --> 04:01:43.360
there's a sense of being a subject in the middle of experience to whom all experience refers.

04:01:44.000 --> 04:01:50.480
A sense of I, a sense of me. That's almost everybody's starting point when they start

04:01:50.480 --> 04:01:55.040
to meditate and that's almost always the place people live most of their lives from.

04:01:55.760 --> 04:01:59.520
I do think that gets interrupted in ways that get unrecognized. I think people are

04:01:59.520 --> 04:02:03.760
constantly losing the sense of I. They're losing the sense of subject to object distance,

04:02:04.400 --> 04:02:12.640
but they're not recognizing it. Meditation is the mode in which you can recognize. You can both

04:02:12.640 --> 04:02:18.320
consciously precipitate it. You can look for the self and fail to find it and then recognize its

04:02:18.320 --> 04:02:26.560
absence. That's just the flip side of the coin of free will. The feeling of having free will

04:02:26.560 --> 04:02:33.040
is what it feels like to feel like a self who's thinking his thoughts and doing his actions

04:02:33.040 --> 04:02:38.320
and intending his intentions. The man in the middle of the boat who's rowing,

04:02:39.040 --> 04:02:45.680
that's the false starting point. When you find that there's no one in the middle of the boat,

04:02:46.320 --> 04:02:50.800
in fact, there's no boat. There's just the river. There's just the flow of experience

04:02:51.920 --> 04:02:55.840
and there's no center to it and there's no place from which you would control it.

04:02:55.840 --> 04:03:00.480
Again, even when you're doing things, this does not negate the difference between voluntary and

04:03:00.480 --> 04:03:07.280
involuntary behavior. It's like I can voluntarily reach for this, but when I'm paying attention,

04:03:07.280 --> 04:03:15.840
I'm aware that everything is just happening. The intention to move is just arising. I'm in no

04:03:15.840 --> 04:03:24.880
position to know why it didn't arise a moment before or a moment later or 50% stronger or weaker

04:03:24.880 --> 04:03:31.040
or so as to be ineffective or to be doubly effective where I lurched for it versus I move

04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:43.120
slow. I can never run the counterfactuals. All of this opens the door to an even more

04:03:43.120 --> 04:03:48.640
disconcerting picture along the same lines, which subsumes this conversation about free will and

04:03:48.640 --> 04:03:59.840
it's the question of whether anything is ever possible. This is a question I haven't thought

04:03:59.840 --> 04:04:04.480
a lot about it, but it's been a few years I've been kicking this question around.

04:04:08.240 --> 04:04:17.040
What if only the actual is possible? We live with this feeling of possibility. We live with

04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:29.520
the sense that I have two daughters. I could have had a third child. What does it mean to say

04:04:29.600 --> 04:04:34.160
that I could have had a third child? Do you don't have kids? I don't think so.

04:04:34.160 --> 04:04:37.040
Not that I know of. The possibility might be there.

04:04:37.840 --> 04:04:47.520
What do we mean when we say you could have had a child or you might have a child in the future?

04:04:51.280 --> 04:04:57.360
What's the relationship between possibility and actuality and reality? Is there a reality in which

04:04:59.600 --> 04:05:09.280
non-actual things are nonetheless real? We have other categories of non-concrete things. We have

04:05:09.280 --> 04:05:23.120
things that don't have spatial temporal dimension, but they none the less exist. There's an abstract

04:05:23.120 --> 04:05:27.520
reality to numbers. It's philosophically interesting to think about these things.

04:05:28.160 --> 04:05:37.840
In some sense, they're not merely invented by us. They're discovered because they have

04:05:37.840 --> 04:05:44.480
structure that we can't impose upon them. They're not fictional characters like Hamlet and Superman

04:05:45.280 --> 04:05:51.680
also exist in some sense, but they exist at the level of our own fiction and abstraction. But

04:05:51.760 --> 04:05:56.960
it's like there are true and false statements you can make about Hamlet. There are true and

04:05:56.960 --> 04:06:02.240
false statements you can make about Superman because our fiction, the fictional worlds we've

04:06:02.240 --> 04:06:06.320
created have a certain kind of structure. But again, this is all abstract. It's all

04:06:06.960 --> 04:06:11.680
abstractible from any of its concrete instantiations. It's not just in the comic books and just in

04:06:11.680 --> 04:06:19.360
the movies. It's in our ongoing ideas about these characters. But natural numbers or

04:06:19.600 --> 04:06:26.720
the integers don't function quite that way. They're similar, but they also have a structure

04:06:26.720 --> 04:06:32.960
that's purely a matter of discovery. You can't just make up whether numbers are prime. If you

04:06:32.960 --> 04:06:39.440
give me two integers of a certain size, let's say you mentioned two enormous integers,

04:06:40.160 --> 04:06:44.960
if I were to say, okay, well, between those two integers, they're exactly 11 prime numbers.

04:06:45.200 --> 04:06:51.200
That's a very specific claim about which I can be right or wrong, whether or not anyone knows

04:06:51.200 --> 04:06:56.400
I'm right or wrong. There's a domain of facts there, but it's an abstract reality

04:06:56.960 --> 04:07:01.600
that relates in some way that's philosophically interesting, metaphysically interesting to

04:07:02.720 --> 04:07:09.280
what we call real reality, the spatial temporal order, the physics of things. But

04:07:09.360 --> 04:07:18.000
possibility, at least in my view, occupies a different space. Again, my thoughts on this

04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:25.040
are pretty in co-ed. I think I need to talk to a philosopher of physics and or a physicist about

04:07:25.040 --> 04:07:28.800
how this may interact with things like the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

04:07:28.800 --> 04:07:36.480
That's an interesting right, exactly. I wonder if discovers in physics further proof or more

04:07:36.480 --> 04:07:41.920
concrete proof that many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has some validity if that

04:07:41.920 --> 04:07:49.360
completely starts to change things. That's just more actuality. If I took that seriously,

04:07:50.960 --> 04:07:58.000
that's a case of, and truth is that happens even if the many-worlds interpretation isn't true,

04:07:58.000 --> 04:08:04.560
but we just imagine we have a physically infinite universe. The implication of infinity is such

04:08:04.560 --> 04:08:12.000
that things will begin to repeat themselves the farther you go in space. If you just head

04:08:12.000 --> 04:08:16.400
out in one direction, eventually you're going to meet two people just like us having a conversation

04:08:16.400 --> 04:08:22.720
just like this and you're going to meet them an infinite number of times in every infinite variety

04:08:22.720 --> 04:08:28.240
of permutations slightly different from this conversation. Infinity is just so big that our

04:08:28.240 --> 04:08:34.960
intuitions of probability completely break down, but what I'm suggesting is maybe probability

04:08:34.960 --> 04:08:42.800
isn't a thing. Maybe there's only actuality. Maybe there's only what happens and at every

04:08:42.800 --> 04:08:47.520
point along the way, our notion of what could have happened or what might have happened

04:08:48.160 --> 04:08:52.000
is just that. It's just a thought about what could have happened or might have happened.

04:08:52.000 --> 04:08:56.160
There's no, so it's a fundamentally different thing. If you can imagine a thing that doesn't

04:08:56.160 --> 04:09:01.840
make it real because that's where that possibility exists in your imagination.

04:09:02.960 --> 04:09:12.080
Yeah, and possibility itself is a spooky idea because it too has a structure. If I'm going to say,

04:09:17.920 --> 04:09:21.680
you could have had a daughter last year,

04:09:22.320 --> 04:09:29.600
so we're saying that's possible but not actual.

04:09:31.520 --> 04:09:39.040
That is a claim. There are things that are true and not true about that daughter. It has a kind

04:09:39.040 --> 04:09:46.160
of structure. It's like- I feel like there's a lot of fog around the possibility. It feels

04:09:46.480 --> 04:09:56.560
like a useful narrative. What does it mean? If we say, I just did that, but it's conceivable

04:09:56.560 --> 04:10:02.320
that I wouldn't have done that. It's possible that I just threw this cap, but I might not have done

04:10:02.320 --> 04:10:07.920
that. You're taking it very temporally close to the original, like what appears as a decision.

04:10:08.720 --> 04:10:13.680
Whenever we're saying something's possible but not actual, this thing just happened,

04:10:14.480 --> 04:10:18.000
but it's conceivable. It's possible that it wouldn't have happened or that it would have

04:10:18.000 --> 04:10:28.000
happened differently. In what does that possibility consist? Where is that? For that to be real,

04:10:28.000 --> 04:10:35.280
for the possibility to be real, what claim are we making about the universe?

04:10:35.280 --> 04:10:39.920
Well, isn't that an extension of the idea that free will is an illusion, that all we have is

04:10:39.920 --> 04:10:44.880
actuality, that the possibility is an illusion? Yeah, I'm just extending it beyond human action.

04:10:47.040 --> 04:10:51.680
This goes to the physics of things. This is just everything. We're always telling ourselves a story

04:10:52.400 --> 04:10:56.320
that includes possibility. Possibility is really compelling for some reason.

04:10:58.800 --> 04:11:08.080
Because it's- I mean, this could sound just academic, but every backward looking regret

04:11:08.080 --> 04:11:15.600
or disappointment and every forward looking worry is completely dependent on this notion

04:11:15.600 --> 04:11:20.240
of possibility. Every regret is based on the sense that something else, I could have done

04:11:20.240 --> 04:11:26.320
something else. Something else could have happened. Every disposition to worry about the future

04:11:27.440 --> 04:11:31.680
is based on the feeling that there's this range of possibilities. It could go either way.

04:11:32.400 --> 04:11:40.240
And whether or not there's such a thing as possibility, I'm convinced that worry is almost

04:11:40.240 --> 04:11:46.480
never psychologically appropriate. Because the reality is that in any given moment,

04:11:47.280 --> 04:11:51.200
either you can do something to solve the problem you're worried about or not. So if you can do

04:11:51.200 --> 04:11:56.080
something, just do it. And if you can't, your worrying is just causing you to suffer twice

04:11:56.080 --> 04:12:01.600
over. You're going to get the medical procedure next week anyway. How much

04:12:01.680 --> 04:12:07.200
time between now and next week do you want to spend worrying about it? The worry doesn't

04:12:07.200 --> 04:12:11.600
accomplish anything. How much do physicists think about possibility? Well, they think about it in

04:12:11.600 --> 04:12:19.280
terms of probability more often. But probability just describes, and again, this is a place where

04:12:19.280 --> 04:12:26.720
I might be out of my depth and need to talk to somebody to debunk this. To do therapy with a

04:12:26.720 --> 04:12:32.240
physicist. Yeah. But probability seems just describes a pattern of actuality that we've

04:12:32.240 --> 04:12:38.160
observed. There are certain things we observe, and those are the actual things that have happened.

04:12:38.800 --> 04:12:44.480
And we have this additional story about probability. We have the frequency with which

04:12:44.480 --> 04:12:53.920
things have happened in the past. I can flip a fair coin and I know in the abstract that I have a

04:12:53.920 --> 04:13:02.240
belief that in the limit, those tosses should converge on 50% heads and 50% tails. I know I

04:13:02.240 --> 04:13:08.080
have a story as to why it's not going to be exactly 50% within any arbitrary timeframe.

04:13:12.400 --> 04:13:18.960
But in reality, all we ever have are the observed tosses. And then we have an additional story

04:13:18.960 --> 04:13:24.800
that, oh, it came up heads, but it could have come up tails. Why do we think that

04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:34.320
about that last toss? And what are we claiming is true about the physics of things

04:13:35.680 --> 04:13:41.360
if we say it could have been otherwise? I think we're claiming that probability is true.

04:13:42.080 --> 04:13:49.280
That it just allows us to have a nice model about the world, gives us hope about the world.

04:13:49.280 --> 04:13:55.600
Yeah. It seems that possibility has to be somewhere to be effective. It's a little bit

04:13:55.600 --> 04:14:00.000
like what's happening with the laws. There's something metaphysically interesting about

04:14:00.000 --> 04:14:05.520
the laws of nature too, because the laws of nature, so the laws of nature impose their work on the

04:14:05.520 --> 04:14:12.800
world. We see their evidence, but they're not reducible to any specific set of instances.

04:14:13.920 --> 04:14:20.480
So there's some structure there, but the structure isn't just a matter of the actual things.

04:14:21.040 --> 04:14:26.080
We have the actual billiard balls that are banging into each other. All of that actuality can be

04:14:26.080 --> 04:14:31.040
explained by what actual things are actually doing. But then we have this notion that in addition to

04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:36.800
that, we have the laws of nature that are explaining this act. But how are the laws of

04:14:36.800 --> 04:14:41.440
nature an additional thing? In addition, it's just the actual things that actually affect

04:14:41.440 --> 04:14:48.240
causally. And if they are an additional thing, how are they effective? If they're not among

04:14:48.240 --> 04:14:56.000
the actual things, they're just actually banging around. Possibly it has to be hiding somewhere

04:14:56.000 --> 04:15:01.200
for the laws of nature to be possible. For anything to be possible, it has to be.

04:15:01.200 --> 04:15:03.120
It has to have. It's a closet somewhere, I'm sure.

04:15:03.760 --> 04:15:06.560
Where all the possibility goes. It has to be attached to something.

04:15:08.880 --> 04:15:13.600
You don't think many worlds is that. Because many worlds still exist.

04:15:13.600 --> 04:15:20.480
Well, because we're in this strand of that multiverse. So still you have just a local

04:15:20.480 --> 04:15:24.800
instance of what is actual. And then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can't

04:15:24.800 --> 04:15:29.120
be affected by it. You can't really connect with the other.

04:15:30.960 --> 04:15:37.040
Many worlds are just a statement of basically everything that can happen happens somewhere.

04:15:40.560 --> 04:15:47.120
Maybe that's not an entirely kosher formulation of it, but it seems pretty close. But there's

04:15:47.120 --> 04:15:56.960
whatever happens. In fact, relativistically, the Einstein's original notion of a block universe

04:15:57.840 --> 04:16:01.440
seems to suggest this. And it's been a while since I've been in a conversation with a physicist

04:16:01.440 --> 04:16:04.880
where I've gotten a chance to ask about the standing of this concept in physics currently.

04:16:04.880 --> 04:16:08.480
I don't hear it discussed much. But the idea of a block universe is that

04:16:09.440 --> 04:16:17.680
space-time exists as a totality. In our sense that we are traveling through space-time,

04:16:18.720 --> 04:16:23.760
where there's a real difference between the past and the future, that that's an illusion of just our

04:16:27.840 --> 04:16:34.800
weird slice we're taking of this larger object. But on some level, it's like you're reading a

04:16:35.520 --> 04:16:40.720
the last page of the novel exists just as much as the first page when you're in the middle of it.

04:16:42.880 --> 04:16:49.360
If we're living in anything like that, then there's no such thing as possibility. It would seem

04:16:49.360 --> 04:16:56.160
there's just what is actual. So as a matter of our experience moment to moment,

04:16:57.440 --> 04:17:02.800
I think it's totally compatible with that being true, that there is only what is actual.

04:17:05.040 --> 04:17:10.560
That sounds to the naïve ear, that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and

04:17:10.560 --> 04:17:18.000
confining. But it's anything but it's actually, it's a circumstance of pure discovery. You have

04:17:18.000 --> 04:17:23.920
no idea what's going to happen next. You don't know who you're going to be tomorrow. You're only

04:17:23.920 --> 04:17:29.840
by tendency, seeming to resemble yourself from yesterday. And there's way more freedom in all

04:17:29.840 --> 04:17:39.360
of that than it seems true to many people. And yet the basic insight is that you're not,

04:17:42.320 --> 04:17:47.040
the real freedom is the recognition that you're not in control of anything. Everything is just

04:17:47.040 --> 04:17:53.200
happening, including your thoughts and intentions and moves. So life is a process of continuous

04:17:53.200 --> 04:18:02.000
discovery. You're part of the universe. You are just this, it's the miracle that the universe

04:18:02.000 --> 04:18:08.640
is illuminated to itself as itself where you sit. And you're continually discovering

04:18:09.520 --> 04:18:15.040
what your life is. And then you have this layer at which you're telling yourself a story

04:18:15.840 --> 04:18:20.400
that you already know what your life is. And you know exactly who you should be and what's

04:18:21.200 --> 04:18:26.240
what's about to happen or you're struggling to form a confident opinion about all of that.

04:18:26.240 --> 04:18:32.320
And yet there is this fundamental mystery to everything, even the most familiar experience.

04:18:33.120 --> 04:18:40.880
We're all NPCs in the most marvelous video game. Maybe, although my game, my sense of

04:18:40.880 --> 04:18:45.520
gaming is does not run as deep as to know what I'm committing to there. It's a non-playing

04:18:45.600 --> 04:18:53.520
character. You're more of a Mario Kart guy. I went back, I was an original video gamer,

04:18:53.520 --> 04:19:00.000
but it's been a long time since I was there for Pong. I remember when I saw the first Pong in

04:19:00.000 --> 04:19:06.240
a restaurant in, I think it was like Benihana's or something. They had a Pong in a table and

04:19:06.240 --> 04:19:08.960
that was an amazing moment. It was an amazing moment when you-

04:19:08.960 --> 04:19:14.720
You Sam Harris might live from Pong to the invention and deployment of a super intelligent

04:19:15.520 --> 04:19:19.440
system. That happened fast if it happens any time in my lifetime.

04:19:19.440 --> 04:19:26.000
From Pong to AGI. What kind of things do you do purely for fun that others might consider a waste

04:19:26.000 --> 04:19:33.920
of time? Purely for fun. Because meditation doesn't count because most people say that's not a waste

04:19:33.920 --> 04:19:40.320
of time. Is there something like Pong that's a deeply embarrassing thing you would never admit?

04:19:42.800 --> 04:19:47.200
I don't think, well, I mean, once or twice a year, I will play a round of golf,

04:19:47.200 --> 04:19:51.440
which many people would find embarrassing. They might even find my play embarrassing,

04:19:51.440 --> 04:19:53.920
but it's fun. Do you find it embarrassing?

04:19:53.920 --> 04:19:58.800
No. I mean, golf just takes way too much time, so I can only squander a certain amount of time on

04:19:58.800 --> 04:20:03.600
it. I do love it. It's a lot of fun. You have no control over your actual performance.

04:20:04.160 --> 04:20:09.520
You're ever discovering. I do have control over my mediocre performance,

04:20:09.520 --> 04:20:16.240
but I don't have enough control to make it really good. But happily, I'm in the perfect spot because

04:20:16.240 --> 04:20:20.320
I don't invest enough time in it to care how I play, so I just have fun when I play.

04:20:20.320 --> 04:20:25.200
Well, I hope there'll be a day where you play around golf with the former President Donald

04:20:25.200 --> 04:20:30.400
Trump, and I would love to be- I would bet on him if we play golf. I'm sure he's a better golfer.

04:20:30.720 --> 04:20:36.880
I miss the chaos of human civilization in modern times as we've talked about. What gives you hope

04:20:37.600 --> 04:20:43.920
about this world in the coming year, in the coming decade, in the coming hundred years,

04:20:43.920 --> 04:20:47.680
maybe a thousand years? What's the source of hope for you?

04:20:50.480 --> 04:20:59.280
Well, it comes back to a few of the things we've talked about. I know that most people are good

04:20:59.280 --> 04:21:07.200
and are mostly converging on the same core values. It's like we're not surrounded by

04:21:08.400 --> 04:21:15.680
psychopaths. The thing that finally convinced me to get off Twitter was

04:21:16.320 --> 04:21:21.600
how different life was seeming through the lens of Twitter. I just got the sense that there's

04:21:21.600 --> 04:21:27.920
way more psychopaths or effective psychopaths than I realized. Then I thought, okay, this

04:21:27.920 --> 04:21:33.360
isn't real. This is either a strange context in which actually decent people are behaving

04:21:33.360 --> 04:21:40.400
like psychopaths, or it's a bot army or something that I don't have to take seriously.

04:21:45.440 --> 04:21:52.800
If we can get the incentives right, I think there's no reason why we can't

04:21:53.760 --> 04:22:03.120
really thrive collectively. There's enough wealth to go around. There's no effective limit

04:22:04.000 --> 04:22:08.560
within the limits of what's physically possible, but we're nowhere near the limit

04:22:09.680 --> 04:22:18.480
on abundance. Forget about going to Mars on this one rock. We could make this place

04:22:19.440 --> 04:22:27.120
incredibly beautiful and stable if we just did enough work to

04:22:31.040 --> 04:22:36.640
solve some rather long-standing political problems.

04:22:36.640 --> 04:22:42.560
The problem of incentives. To you, the basic characteristics of human nature such that

04:22:42.640 --> 04:22:47.360
we'll be okay if the incentives are okay. We'll do pretty good.

04:22:48.320 --> 04:22:52.480
I'm worried about the asymmetries that it's easier to break things and to fix them. It's easier to

04:22:55.520 --> 04:23:03.520
light a fire than to put it out. I do worry that as technology gets more and more powerful,

04:23:03.520 --> 04:23:10.000
it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up to effectively screw things up

04:23:10.000 --> 04:23:16.320
for everybody. It's easier. A thousand years ago, it was simply impossible for one person

04:23:16.960 --> 04:23:25.360
to derange the lives of millions, much less billions. Now, that's getting to be possible.

04:23:26.400 --> 04:23:31.520
On the assumption that we're always going to have a sufficient number of crazy individuals or

04:23:32.320 --> 04:23:42.640
malevolent individuals, we have to figure out that asymmetry somehow. There's some

04:23:43.600 --> 04:23:51.600
cautious exploration of emergent technology that we need to get our head screwed on straight

04:23:51.600 --> 04:23:55.920
about. So gain a function of research. Just how much do we want to democratize

04:23:56.720 --> 04:24:03.200
all the relevant technologies there? You really want to give everyone the ability to order

04:24:03.760 --> 04:24:10.640
nucleotides in the mail and give them the blueprints for viruses online because you're a

04:24:10.640 --> 04:24:16.880
free speech absolutist and you think all PDFs need to be exportable everywhere.

04:24:17.040 --> 04:24:27.440
So there are limits to... Many people are confused about my take on free speech because I've come

04:24:27.440 --> 04:24:35.200
down on the unpopular side of some of these questions, but it's been... My overriding concern

04:24:35.200 --> 04:24:41.200
is that in many cases, I'm worried about the free speech of individual businesses or individual

04:24:41.200 --> 04:24:47.040
platforms or individual media people to decide that they don't want to be associated with certain

04:24:47.040 --> 04:24:50.880
things. So if you own Twitter, I think you should be able to kick off the

04:24:51.440 --> 04:24:55.200
Nazi you don't want to be associated with because it's your platform, you own it.

04:24:55.200 --> 04:25:01.760
That's your free speech. That's the side of my free speech concern for Twitter. It's not that

04:25:01.760 --> 04:25:08.080
every Nazi has the right to algorithmic speech on Twitter. I think if you own Twitter, you should

04:25:08.960 --> 04:25:14.000
whether it's just Elon or in the world where it wasn't Elon, just the people who own Twitter

04:25:14.960 --> 04:25:20.560
and the board and the shareholders and the employees, these people should be free to decide

04:25:21.200 --> 04:25:27.920
what they want to promote or not. I view them as publishers more than as platforms in the end and

04:25:29.760 --> 04:25:35.680
that has other implications. But I do worry about this problem of misinformation and

04:25:36.480 --> 04:25:47.760
algorithmically and otherwise supercharged misinformation. I do think we're at a bottleneck

04:25:47.760 --> 04:25:54.160
now. I guess it could be the hubris of every present generation to think that their moment is

04:25:54.160 --> 04:25:58.800
especially important. But I do think with the emergence of these technologies,

04:25:59.840 --> 04:26:04.240
we're some kind of bottleneck where we really have to figure out how to get this right.

04:26:04.320 --> 04:26:08.080
And if we do get this right, if we figure out how to not drive ourselves crazy

04:26:08.720 --> 04:26:13.680
by giving people access to all possible information and misinformation at all times,

04:26:15.360 --> 04:26:23.360
I think, yeah, there's no limit to how happily we could collaborate with billions of creative

04:26:24.160 --> 04:26:30.480
fulfilled people. It's just- And trillions of robots. Some of them sex robots,

04:26:30.480 --> 04:26:34.160
but that's another topic. Yeah, robots that are running the right algorithm,

04:26:34.160 --> 04:26:37.840
whatever that algorithm is. Whatever you need in your life to make you happy.

04:26:40.240 --> 04:26:44.800
The first time we talked is one of the huge honors in my life. I've been a fan of yours for a long

04:26:44.800 --> 04:26:50.800
time. The few times you were respectful but critical to me means the world. And thank you so

04:26:50.800 --> 04:26:58.320
much for helping me and caring enough about the world and for everything you do. But I should

04:26:58.320 --> 04:27:03.520
say that the few of us that try to put love in the world on Twitter, miss you on Twitter, but

04:27:04.800 --> 04:27:10.720
enjoy yourselves. Don't break anything, kids. Have a good party without me.

04:27:10.720 --> 04:27:14.240
Thanks. I'm very happy to do this. Thanks for the invitation. Thank you.

04:27:14.240 --> 04:27:19.120
Great to see you again. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Harris. To support

04:27:19.120 --> 04:27:23.920
this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you

04:27:23.920 --> 04:27:30.320
with some words from Martin Luther King, Jr. Love is the only force capable of transforming

04:27:30.320 --> 04:27:39.840
an enemy into a friend. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
