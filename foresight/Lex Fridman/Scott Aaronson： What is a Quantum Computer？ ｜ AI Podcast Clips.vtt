00:00.000 --> 00:07.160
As you've said, quantum computing, at least in the 1990s, was a profound story at the

00:07.160 --> 00:11.080
intersection of computer science, physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.240
So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing that represents more than just the

00:16.240 --> 00:17.240
quantum computer.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.240
Yes.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.180
But can we start at the very basics?

00:20.180 --> 00:22.320
What is quantum computing?

00:22.320 --> 00:23.320
Yeah.

00:23.320 --> 00:29.960
So it's a proposal for a new type of computation, let's say a new way to harness nature to

00:29.960 --> 00:34.560
do computation that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

00:34.560 --> 00:40.840
Now, the principles of quantum mechanics have been in place since 1926.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.160
They haven't changed.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.160
What's new is how we want to use them.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.720
So what does quantum mechanics say about the world?

00:50.720 --> 00:55.720
The physicists, I think, over the generations convinced people that that is an unbelievably

00:55.720 --> 01:03.080
complicated question and just give up on trying to understand it, not being a physicist,

01:03.080 --> 01:07.700
I can let you in on a secret, which is that it becomes a lot simpler if you do what we

01:07.700 --> 01:12.640
do in quantum information theory and take the physics out of it.

01:12.640 --> 01:19.320
So the way that we think about quantum mechanics is as a generalization of the rules of probability

01:19.320 --> 01:20.480
themselves.

01:20.480 --> 01:27.760
So you might say there was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today or something.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.840
You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.640
That would be nonsense.

01:32.640 --> 01:38.920
Much less would you say that there was an I% chance, a square root of minus 1% chance.

01:38.920 --> 01:49.200
Now the central discovery that quantum mechanics made is that fundamentally the world is described

01:49.200 --> 01:58.960
by the possibilities for what a system could be doing are described using numbers called

01:58.960 --> 02:07.040
amplitudes, which are like probabilities in some ways, but they are not probabilities.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.640
For one thing, they can be positive or negative.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.680
In fact, they can even be complex numbers.

02:11.680 --> 02:18.080
And if you've heard of a quantum superposition, this just means that some state of affairs

02:18.080 --> 02:26.000
where you assign an amplitude, one of these complex numbers, to every possible configuration

02:26.000 --> 02:28.420
that you could see a system in on measuring it.

02:28.420 --> 02:34.640
So for example, you might say that an electron has some amplitude for being here and some

02:34.640 --> 02:37.360
other amplitude for being there.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.560
Now if you look to see where it is, you will localize it.

02:41.560 --> 02:47.320
You will sort of force the amplitudes to be converted into probabilities.

02:47.320 --> 02:52.320
That happens by taking their squared absolute value.

02:52.320 --> 02:58.400
And then you can say either the electron will be here or it will be there.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.000
Knowing the amplitudes, you can predict at least the probabilities that you'll see each

03:03.000 --> 03:05.100
possible outcome.

03:05.100 --> 03:11.440
But while a system is isolated from the whole rest of the universe, the rest of its environment,

03:11.440 --> 03:18.160
the amplitudes can change in time by rules that are different from the normal rules of

03:18.160 --> 03:22.560
probability and that are alien to our everyday experience.

03:22.560 --> 03:28.400
So anytime anyone ever tells you anything about the weirdness of the quantum world or

03:28.400 --> 03:34.360
assuming that they're not lying to you, they are telling you yet another consequence of

03:34.360 --> 03:38.100
nature being described by these amplitudes.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.140
So most famously, what amplitudes can do is that they can interfere with each other.

03:43.140 --> 03:48.660
So in the famous double slit experiment, what happens is that you shoot a particle like

03:48.660 --> 03:52.740
an electron, let's say, at a screen with two slits in it.

03:52.740 --> 03:58.500
And you find that on a second screen, now there are certain places where that electron

03:58.500 --> 04:04.460
will never end up after it passes through the first screen.

04:04.460 --> 04:10.780
And yet if I close off one of the slits, then the electron can appear in that place.

04:10.780 --> 04:15.580
So by decreasing the number of paths that the electron could take to get somewhere, you

04:15.580 --> 04:18.260
can increase the chance that it gets there.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.220
Now how is that possible?

04:20.220 --> 04:26.620
Well it's because, as we would say now, the electron has a superposition state.

04:26.620 --> 04:32.620
It has some amplitude for reaching this point by going through the first slit.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.540
It has some other amplitude for reaching it by going through the second slit.

04:36.540 --> 04:41.780
But now if one amplitude is positive and the other one is negative, then I have to add

04:41.780 --> 04:42.780
them all up.

04:42.780 --> 04:47.500
I have to add the amplitudes for every path that the electron could have taken to reach

04:47.500 --> 04:48.900
this point.

04:48.900 --> 04:53.420
And those amplitudes, if they're pointing in different directions, they can cancel each

04:53.420 --> 04:54.660
other out.

04:54.660 --> 04:58.980
That would mean the total amplitude is zero and the thing never happens at all.

04:58.980 --> 05:03.500
If I close off one of the possibilities, then the amplitude is positive or it's negative

05:03.500 --> 05:05.460
and now the thing can happen.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.980
So that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.

05:08.980 --> 05:11.820
And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is.

05:11.820 --> 05:22.420
A quantum computer is a computer that tries to exploit exactly these phenomena, superposition,

05:22.420 --> 05:27.380
amplitudes, and interference in order to solve certain problems much faster than we know

05:27.380 --> 05:28.820
how to solve them otherwise.

05:28.820 --> 05:33.780
So it's the basic building block of a quantum computer is what we call a quantum bit or

05:33.780 --> 05:34.980
a qubit.

05:34.980 --> 05:39.620
That just means a bit that has some amplitude for being zero and some other amplitude for

05:39.620 --> 05:40.620
being one.

05:40.620 --> 05:44.220
So it's a superposition of zero and one states.

05:44.220 --> 05:50.220
But now the key point is that if I've got, let's say, a thousand qubits, the rules of

05:50.220 --> 05:55.380
quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal that I do not just need one amplitude.

05:55.380 --> 05:58.660
I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.

05:58.660 --> 06:04.260
In general, I need an amplitude for every possible setting of all thousand of those

06:04.260 --> 06:10.620
bits so that what that means is two to the 1,000 power amplitudes.

06:10.620 --> 06:15.380
If I had to write those down, or let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,

06:15.380 --> 06:20.500
if I had to write down two to the 1,000 complex numbers, that would not fit within the entire

06:20.500 --> 06:22.860
observable universe.

06:22.860 --> 06:27.900
And yet, quantum mechanics is unequivocal that if these qubits can all interact with

06:27.900 --> 06:34.580
each other, and in some sense, I need two to the 1,000 parameters, amplitudes to describe

06:34.580 --> 06:36.300
what is going on.

06:36.300 --> 06:42.740
Now, I can tell you where all the popular articles about quantum computing go off the

06:42.740 --> 06:49.100
rails is that they say what I just said, and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer

06:49.100 --> 06:54.220
works is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.

06:54.220 --> 06:59.820
That sounds too good to be true, and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.

06:59.820 --> 07:06.420
The problem is I could make a superposition over every possible answer to my problem,

07:06.420 --> 07:10.780
even if there are two to the 1,000 of them, I can easily do that.

07:10.780 --> 07:14.540
The trouble is for a computer to be useful, you've got at some point, you've got to look

07:14.540 --> 07:17.420
at it and see an output.

07:17.420 --> 07:22.580
And if I just measure a superposition over every possible answer, then the rules of quantum

07:22.580 --> 07:26.540
mechanics tell me that all I'll see will be a random answer.

07:26.540 --> 07:29.940
If I just wanted a random answer, well, I could have picked one myself with a lot less

07:29.940 --> 07:30.940
trouble.

07:30.940 --> 07:37.740
So the entire trick with quantum computing, with every algorithm for a quantum computer,

07:37.740 --> 07:43.780
is that you try to choreograph a pattern of interference of amplitudes, and you try to

07:43.780 --> 07:48.740
do it so that for each wrong answer, some of the paths leading to that wrong answer

07:48.740 --> 07:52.860
have positive amplitudes, and others have negative amplitudes.

07:52.860 --> 07:57.380
So on the whole, they cancel each other out, whereas all the paths leading to the right

07:57.380 --> 08:02.980
answer should reinforce each other, should have amplitudes pointing the same direction.

08:02.980 --> 08:08.100
So the design of algorithms in this space is the choreography of the interferences.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
Precisely.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.100
That's precisely what it is.

08:10.100 --> 08:15.220
Take a brief step back, and you mentioned information.

08:15.220 --> 08:21.220
So in which part of this beautiful picture that you've painted is information contained?

08:21.220 --> 08:25.580
Oh, well, information is at the core of everything that we've been talking about.

08:25.580 --> 08:34.300
I mean, the bit is the basic unit of information, since Claude Shannon's paper in 1948, and

08:34.300 --> 08:40.060
of course, people had the concept even before that, he popularized the name.

08:40.060 --> 08:43.820
But a bit is zero or one, so that's the basic element of information.

08:43.820 --> 08:44.820
That's right.

08:44.820 --> 08:49.780
And what we would say is that the basic unit of quantum information is the qubit, is the

08:49.780 --> 08:57.100
object, any object that can be maintained and manipulated in a superposition of zero

08:57.100 --> 08:58.860
and one states.

08:58.860 --> 09:03.980
Now sometimes people ask, well, but what is a qubit physically?

09:03.980 --> 09:09.700
And there are all these different proposals that are being pursued in parallel for how

09:09.700 --> 09:11.780
you implement qubits.

09:11.780 --> 09:17.580
There is superconducting quantum computing that was in the news recently because of Google's

09:17.580 --> 09:25.700
quantum supremacy experiment, where you would have some little coils where a current can

09:25.700 --> 09:29.260
flow through them in two different energy states.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.460
One representing a zero, another representing a one.

09:32.460 --> 09:37.700
And if you cool these coils to just slightly above absolute zero, like a hundredth of a

09:37.700 --> 09:42.980
degree, then they superconduct and then the current can actually be in a superposition

09:42.980 --> 09:45.460
of the two different states.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.340
So that's one kind of qubit.

09:47.340 --> 09:53.780
Another kind would be just an individual atomic nucleus, it has a spin.

09:53.780 --> 09:58.460
It could be spinning clockwise, it could be spinning counterclockwise, or it could be in

09:58.460 --> 10:00.940
a superposition of the two spin states.

10:00.940 --> 10:02.380
That is another qubit.

10:02.380 --> 10:07.900
Because just like in the classical world, you could be a virtuoso programmer without

10:07.900 --> 10:14.100
having any idea of what a transistor is, or how the bits are physically represented inside

10:14.100 --> 10:18.060
the machine, even that the machine uses electricity.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.860
You just care about the logic.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.420
It's sort of the same with quantum computing.

10:22.420 --> 10:27.260
Cubits could be realized by many, many different quantum systems, yet all of those systems

10:27.260 --> 10:34.900
will lead to the same logic, the logic of qubits and how you measure them, how you change

10:34.900 --> 10:36.340
them over time.

10:36.340 --> 10:43.060
And so the subject of how qubits behave and what you can do with qubits, that is quantum

10:43.060 --> 10:44.060
information.

10:44.060 --> 10:52.060
So just to linger on that, so the physical design implementation of a qubit does not

10:52.060 --> 10:57.220
interfere with that next level of abstraction that you can program over it.

10:57.220 --> 11:01.860
So it truly is, the idea of it is, is it okay?

11:01.860 --> 11:05.700
Well, to be honest with you, today they do interfere with each other.

11:05.700 --> 11:10.460
That's because all the quantum computers we can build today are very noisy.

11:10.460 --> 11:17.820
And so the qubits are very far from perfect, and so the lower level sort of does affect

11:17.820 --> 11:21.660
the higher levels, and we sort of have to think about all of them at once.

11:21.660 --> 11:27.380
But eventually, where we hope to get is to what are called error-corrected quantum computers,

11:27.380 --> 11:32.980
where the qubits really do behave like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them

11:32.980 --> 11:33.980
to.

11:33.980 --> 11:40.500
And in that future, a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about or think about

11:40.500 --> 11:46.860
today, but in that future, the logic of it really does become decoupled from the hardware.

11:46.860 --> 11:53.540
So if noise is currently like the biggest problem for quantum computing, and then the

11:53.540 --> 12:01.380
dream is error-correcting quantum computers, can you just maybe describe what does it mean

12:01.380 --> 12:03.620
for there to be noise in the system?

12:03.620 --> 12:04.620
Absolutely.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.980
So yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific than noise.

12:07.980 --> 12:14.380
So the fundamental problem, if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer of any

12:14.380 --> 12:18.740
appreciable size, is something called decoherence.

12:18.740 --> 12:23.100
And this was recognized from the very beginning when people first started thinking about this

12:23.100 --> 12:24.820
in the 1990s.

12:24.820 --> 12:32.420
Now what decoherence means is sort of the unwanted interaction between your qubits, the state

12:32.420 --> 12:36.180
of your quantum computer, and the external environment.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.060
And why is that such a problem?

12:38.060 --> 12:43.460
I talked before about how when you measure a quantum system, so let's say if I measure

12:43.460 --> 12:48.540
a qubit that's in a superposition of zero and one states to ask it, are you zero or

12:48.540 --> 12:49.540
are you one?

12:49.540 --> 12:51.980
Well, now I force it to make up its mind.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.820
And now probabilistically, it chooses one or the other.

12:55.820 --> 13:01.300
And now it's no longer a superposition, there's no longer amplitudes, there's just some probability

13:01.300 --> 13:05.140
that I get a zero and there's some that I get a one.

13:05.140 --> 13:10.620
And now the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me who's looking.

13:11.020 --> 13:15.300
In fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.

13:15.300 --> 13:21.620
Any kind of interaction with the external world that leaks out the information about

13:21.620 --> 13:27.860
whether this qubit was a zero or a one, sort of that causes the zero-ness or the oneness

13:27.860 --> 13:35.420
of the qubit to be recorded in the radiation in the room, in the molecules of the air,

13:35.420 --> 13:42.180
in the wires that are connected to my device, any of that, as soon as the information leaks

13:42.180 --> 13:45.940
out, it is as if that qubit has been measured.

13:45.940 --> 13:50.340
It is the state has now collapsed.

13:50.340 --> 13:54.340
Another way to say it is that it's become entangled with its environment.

13:54.340 --> 13:59.140
But from the perspective of someone who's just looking at this qubit, it is as though

13:59.140 --> 14:01.740
it has lost its quantum state.

14:02.380 --> 14:08.220
What this means is that if I want to do a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits

14:08.220 --> 14:13.380
sort of fanatically well-isolated from their environment, but then at the same time, they

14:13.380 --> 14:17.220
can't be perfectly isolated because I need to tell them what to do.

14:17.220 --> 14:22.020
I need to make them interact with each other for one thing and not only that, but in a

14:22.020 --> 14:25.580
precisely choreographed way.

14:25.580 --> 14:28.260
That is such a staggering problem.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.580
How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe, but then also tell them exactly

14:32.580 --> 14:33.580
what to do?

14:33.580 --> 14:39.300
I mean, there were distinguished physicists and computer scientists in the 90s who said

14:39.300 --> 14:41.860
this is fundamentally impossible.

14:41.860 --> 14:47.100
The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits to the degree of accuracy that

14:47.100 --> 14:49.220
you're talking about.

14:49.220 --> 14:57.180
What changed the views of most of us was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s,

14:57.220 --> 15:02.540
which was called the theory of quantum error correction and quantum fault tolerance.

15:02.540 --> 15:08.860
The upshot of that theory is that if I want to build a reliable quantum computer and scale

15:08.860 --> 15:15.940
it up to an arbitrary number of as many qubits as I want and doing as much on them as I want,

15:15.940 --> 15:20.860
I do not actually have to get the qubits perfectly isolated from their environment.

15:20.860 --> 15:26.740
It is enough to get them really, really, really well-isolated.

15:26.780 --> 15:33.340
Even if every qubit is leaking its state into the environment at some rate, as long as that

15:33.340 --> 15:41.740
rate is low enough, I can encode the information that I care about in very clever ways across

15:41.740 --> 15:48.180
the collective states of multiple qubits in such a way that even if a small percentage

15:48.180 --> 15:53.140
of my qubits leak, well, I'm constantly monitoring them to see if that leak happened.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.660
I can detect it and I can correct it.

15:55.700 --> 15:59.460
I can recover the information I care about from the remaining qubits.

16:01.540 --> 16:06.900
You can build a reliable quantum computer even out of unreliable parts.

16:09.300 --> 16:15.660
In some sense, that discovery is what set the engineering agenda for quantum computing research

16:15.660 --> 16:17.940
from the 1990s until the present.

16:17.940 --> 16:25.260
The goal has been engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable but reliable enough

16:25.340 --> 16:31.140
that you can then use these error-correcting codes to have them simulate qubits that are

16:31.140 --> 16:32.980
even more reliable than they are.

16:33.740 --> 16:37.020
The error-correction becomes a net win rather than a net loss.

16:37.620 --> 16:44.420
And then once you reach that crossover point, then your simulated qubits could in turn simulate

16:44.420 --> 16:50.460
qubits that are even more reliable and so on until you've just effectively, you have arbitrarily

16:50.460 --> 16:51.500
reliable qubits.

16:51.780 --> 16:55.220
So long story short, we are not at that break-even point yet.

16:55.380 --> 16:59.900
We're a hell of a lot closer than we were when people started doing this in the 90s, like orders

16:59.900 --> 17:00.980
of magnitude closer.

17:00.980 --> 17:04.260
But the key ingredient there is the more qubits, the better.

17:05.660 --> 17:09.460
Well, the more qubits, the larger the computation you can do, right?

17:09.820 --> 17:15.020
I mean, qubits are what constitute the memory of your quantum computer, right?

17:15.020 --> 17:17.820
But also for the error-correcting mechanism.

17:18.020 --> 17:18.500
Yes.

17:18.700 --> 17:24.700
So the way I would say it is that error-correction imposes an overhead in the number of qubits.

17:24.980 --> 17:29.460
And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems with building a scalable quantum

17:29.460 --> 17:29.980
computer.

17:30.260 --> 17:35.500
If you look at the error-correcting codes, at least the ones that we know about today, and you

17:35.500 --> 17:43.820
look at what would it take to actually use a quantum computer to hack your credit card number,

17:43.900 --> 17:47.780
which is the most famous application people talk about, right?

17:47.940 --> 17:52.340
Let's say to factor huge numbers and thereby break the RSA crypto system.

17:52.620 --> 17:58.460
Well, what that would take would be thousands of several thousand logical qubits.

17:58.780 --> 18:03.460
But now with the known error-correcting codes, each of those logical qubits would need to

18:03.460 --> 18:06.700
be encoded itself using thousands of physical qubits.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.340
So at that point, you're talking about millions of physical qubits.

18:10.540 --> 18:15.020
And in some sense, that is the reason why quantum computers are not breaking cryptography

18:15.020 --> 18:15.540
already.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.260
It's because of these immense overheads involved.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.140
So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?

18:21.140 --> 18:22.180
Well, it's multiplicative.

18:22.180 --> 18:28.100
I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits that you need in your abstract

18:28.100 --> 18:31.140
quantum circuit, you multiply it by a thousand or so.

18:31.460 --> 18:36.820
So there's a lot of work on inventing better, trying to invent better error-correcting codes.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.900
OK, that is the situation right now.

18:38.900 --> 18:45.900
In the meantime, we are now in what the physicist John Preskell called the noisy intermediate

18:45.900 --> 18:47.980
scale quantum or NISC era.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.140
And this is the era.

18:49.300 --> 18:53.660
You can think of it as sort of like the vacuum, you know, we're now entering the very early

18:53.660 --> 18:56.100
vacuum tube era of quantum computers.

18:56.460 --> 19:00.740
The quantum computer analog of the transistor has not been invented yet.

19:00.940 --> 19:01.180
Right.

19:01.180 --> 19:03.780
That would be like true error correction, right?

19:03.780 --> 19:07.780
Where, you know, we are not or something else that would achieve the same effect.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.300
Right. We are not there yet.

19:10.060 --> 19:16.180
And but where we are now, let's say, as of a few months ago, you know, as of Google's

19:16.180 --> 19:21.020
announcement of quantum supremacy, you know, we are now finally at the point where even

19:21.020 --> 19:26.500
with a non-error corrected quantum computer with, you know, these noisy devices, we can

19:26.500 --> 19:30.460
do something that is hard for classical computers to simulate.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.060
OK, so we can eke out some advantage.

19:33.300 --> 19:38.500
Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something beyond what a classical computer

19:38.500 --> 19:42.260
can do that is also useful to someone that we still don't know?

19:42.380 --> 19:46.700
People are going to be racing over the next decade to try to do that by people.

19:46.700 --> 19:51.500
I mean, Google, IBM, you know, a bunch of startup companies and, you know,

19:51.500 --> 19:55.780
a and research labs and research labs and governments.

19:55.780 --> 19:58.700
And yeah, you just mentioned a million things.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.300
Well, I'll backtrack for a second.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.820
Yes, sure. Sure.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.260
So we're in these vacuum tube days.

20:04.260 --> 20:05.700
Yeah, just entering.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.860
And just entering. Wow. OK.

20:07.860 --> 20:11.060
So yeah, how do we escape the vacuum?

20:11.060 --> 20:16.660
So how do we get to how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?

20:16.900 --> 20:19.340
Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?

20:19.340 --> 20:25.460
Is there is there breakthroughs in on the physics side that they're needed on the

20:25.740 --> 20:27.780
computer science side?

20:27.780 --> 20:28.940
What is there?

20:28.940 --> 20:35.420
And is it a financial issue where much larger, just sheer investment and excitement is needed?

20:35.780 --> 20:38.260
So, you know, those are excellent questions.

20:38.380 --> 20:43.620
My guess. My guess would be all of the above.

20:43.980 --> 20:48.100
I mean, my guess, you know, I mean, you know, you can say fundamentally,

20:48.100 --> 20:49.820
it is an engineering issue, right?

20:49.820 --> 20:52.420
The theory has been in place since the 90s.

20:52.700 --> 20:57.060
You know, at least, you know, you know, this is what, you know, error correction

20:57.060 --> 21:01.180
would look like, you know, we do not have the hardware that is at that level.

21:01.420 --> 21:06.780
But at the same time, you know, so you could just, you know, try to power through,

21:06.940 --> 21:11.220
you know, maybe even like, you know, if someone spent a trillion dollars

21:11.220 --> 21:14.140
on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right?

21:14.140 --> 21:20.140
Then conceivably, they could just, you know, build a an error corrected

21:20.140 --> 21:24.100
quantum computer as it was envisioned back in the 90s, right?

21:24.260 --> 21:28.780
I think the more plausible thing to happen is that there will be further

21:28.780 --> 21:31.820
theoretical breakthroughs and there will be further insights

21:32.020 --> 21:34.420
that will cut down the cost of doing this.
