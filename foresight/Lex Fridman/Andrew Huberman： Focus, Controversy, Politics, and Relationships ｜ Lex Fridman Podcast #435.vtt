Hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure. Can you read the quote once more?

00:05.680 --> 00:08.400
Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with

00:13.040 --> 00:17.840
The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman his fifth time on the podcast

00:18.480 --> 00:26.720
He is the host of the Huberman lab podcast and is an amazing scientist teacher human being and

00:27.200 --> 00:30.080
Someone i'm grateful to be able to call a close friend

00:30.960 --> 00:39.840
Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now called protocols and operating manual for the human body

00:40.800 --> 00:47.200
This is the lex freeman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends

00:47.600 --> 00:49.600
Here's andrew Huberman

00:50.400 --> 00:54.320
You think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting? Definitely

00:55.120 --> 00:56.720
I mean I

00:56.720 --> 00:58.000
came up

00:58.000 --> 01:00.480
within and then on the periphery of

01:01.360 --> 01:03.200
skateboard culture

01:03.200 --> 01:05.120
And for the record, I was not a great skateboarder

01:05.280 --> 01:07.840
I always have to say that because skateboarders are relentless

01:08.400 --> 01:10.320
If you call something you didn't do or whatever

01:11.040 --> 01:13.840
I mean, I could do a few things and I loved the community

01:14.400 --> 01:19.280
And I still have a lot of friends in that community jim feebo at deluxe. You can look him up

01:19.360 --> 01:22.240
He's kind of the man behind the whole scene. I know tony

01:22.480 --> 01:29.760
hawk, dany whale these guys I got to see them come up and get big and stay big in many cases start huge companies like

01:29.840 --> 01:31.840
Danny and calling the case our dc

01:33.040 --> 01:38.960
Some people have a long life and something some don't but one thing I observed and learned a lot from in skateboarding

01:40.400 --> 01:44.160
At the level of observing the skateboarders and then the ones that started companies

01:44.960 --> 01:46.960
and then what I also

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
observed in science

01:49.040 --> 01:51.040
and still observe is

01:51.120 --> 01:53.120
You do it for a while

01:53.200 --> 01:55.200
You do it at the highest possible level

01:55.440 --> 01:56.720
for you

01:56.720 --> 01:58.320
and then at some point

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
You pivot and you start

02:00.320 --> 02:02.560
supporting the young talent coming in

02:03.120 --> 02:05.840
In fact, the greatest scientists people like richard axl

02:06.240 --> 02:07.680
Catherine do lock

02:07.680 --> 02:10.560
There are many other labs in neuroscience carl diceroth

02:11.520 --> 02:14.320
They're not just known for doing great science. They're known for

02:15.120 --> 02:18.320
Mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs

02:18.800 --> 02:20.800
and I think in podcasting

02:20.800 --> 02:24.720
I am very fortunate. I got in in a fairly early wave not the earliest wave

02:25.120 --> 02:28.400
But thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave

02:28.720 --> 02:33.680
And I'll continue to go as long as it feels right and I feel like I'm doing good in the world and providing good

02:34.080 --> 02:36.080
But I'm already starting to scout talent

02:36.880 --> 02:41.120
My company that I started with rob more psychom media

02:41.760 --> 02:45.040
A couple other guys in there too. Mike play back our photographer ian macky

02:46.160 --> 02:48.160
chris ray martin fobes

02:48.720 --> 02:52.560
We are a company that produces podcasts right now. That's huberman lab podcast

02:52.640 --> 02:55.840
But we're launching a new podcast perform a dr. Andy galpin

02:56.000 --> 02:56.800
Nice

02:56.800 --> 03:02.000
And we want to do more of that kind of thing finding a really great talent highly qualified people credential people

03:02.480 --> 03:03.760
and I've got

03:03.760 --> 03:06.720
A new kind of obsession with scouring the internet

03:07.360 --> 03:12.240
Looking for the young talent in science in health and related fields

03:12.800 --> 03:14.960
And so will there be a final episode of the

03:15.600 --> 03:16.880
hlp

03:16.880 --> 03:18.880
Yeah, I mean bullet buster cancer

03:20.080 --> 03:24.720
Aside, you know someday they'll be the very last and thank you for your interest in science

03:25.120 --> 03:26.480
And i'll clip out

03:26.480 --> 03:30.880
Yeah, I love the idea of walking weight and not be dramatic about it

03:31.200 --> 03:35.760
Right when it feels right you can leave and you can come back whenever the fuck you want, right?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.080
John steward did this well with the daily show

03:38.640 --> 03:43.920
I think that was during the 2016 election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away

03:44.320 --> 03:46.320
Dave chappelle for different

03:46.320 --> 03:50.800
Reasons walked away disappeared came back gave away so much money

03:51.200 --> 03:56.320
Didn't care and then came back and was doing like stand-up in the park in the middle of nowhere

03:57.520 --> 04:04.880
Genius you have habib who undefeated walks away at the very top of of a sport. Is he coming back? No

04:05.600 --> 04:10.160
It's the least we don't know. Yeah, right. You don't know. I don't know if he bears everywhere or words

04:10.880 --> 04:16.080
Yeah, I think you know, it's um, it's always a call, you know, you know the last

04:17.120 --> 04:22.400
Few years have been tremendous growth. We launched in january 2021 and even this last year

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
2024 has been huge growth

04:25.600 --> 04:28.400
you know in all sorts of ways it's been wild and

04:29.280 --> 04:31.280
We have some short form content planned

04:32.160 --> 04:37.040
That's 30 minute shorter episodes that really distill down the critical elements. We're also

04:38.000 --> 04:40.960
Thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting

04:41.280 --> 04:46.320
so there's always the thought and the discussion but when it comes to like when to hang up your cleats, you know, it's like

04:47.360 --> 04:51.040
There just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in

04:51.760 --> 04:54.960
Then focusing on self and so there will come a time for that

04:55.600 --> 04:58.880
And I think it's critical. I mean, again, I saw this in skateboarding like danny

04:59.520 --> 05:06.480
And callin and danny's brother daemon started dc with ken block the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago

05:06.720 --> 05:08.400
rally car driver

05:08.400 --> 05:09.200
and

05:09.200 --> 05:12.080
They eventually sold it. I think to quicksilver or something like that, but

05:12.880 --> 05:15.920
They're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas

05:16.480 --> 05:18.480
but they brought in the next

05:19.200 --> 05:24.000
You know on the next line of amazing riders for the plan b thing, you know, paul rodriguez for skateboarders

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
They know who this is now in science

05:26.800 --> 05:33.360
There are scientists like fine men for instance. I don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So there are scientists who are phenomenal

05:36.560 --> 05:42.560
Like beyond world class, right multi-generational world class who don't make good mentors

05:42.720 --> 05:45.680
I'm not saying he wasn't a good mentor, but that's not what he's known for and then there are

05:46.720 --> 05:52.080
scientists who are known for being excellent scientists and and great mentors and I think there's no higher

05:52.720 --> 05:56.880
Um celebration to be had at the end of one's career if you can look back and like hey

05:56.880 --> 06:01.040
I put some really important knowledge into the world people made use of that knowledge

06:01.440 --> 06:03.440
And guess what you spawned all these

06:04.400 --> 06:06.000
other

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
scientific offspring or sport

06:08.640 --> 06:10.640
offspring or

06:10.640 --> 06:11.600
podcast offspring

06:11.600 --> 06:16.720
I mean in some ways we look to rogan and to some of the other earlier podcasts is like they

06:17.120 --> 06:21.520
You know, they paved the way ronda patrick first science podcast out there

06:22.400 --> 06:23.440
so

06:23.440 --> 06:25.440
You know it eventually

06:25.600 --> 06:30.560
The baton passes but fortunately right now everybody's active and it and it feels really good

06:31.360 --> 06:33.760
Yeah, well you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also

06:35.440 --> 06:36.640
Uh

06:36.640 --> 06:39.360
a different kind of way where you have uh, something like uh

06:40.240 --> 06:44.400
Grisha gregory perlman the mathematician who refused to accept the fields medal

06:44.640 --> 06:50.000
So he's one of the greatest living mathematicians and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the fields medal

06:50.240 --> 06:52.240
What did he do after he left mathematics?

06:52.720 --> 06:53.920
life

06:53.920 --> 06:59.920
Private 100% I respect that he's become essentially a recluse is these photos of him

07:00.400 --> 07:06.080
Looking very broke like he could use the money. He he turned away the money. He turned away everything

07:06.720 --> 07:08.720
you know, there's there's

07:09.120 --> 07:10.560
You just have to listen to the inner voice

07:10.640 --> 07:16.000
You have to listen to yourself and make the decisions that don't make any sense for the rest of the world and make sense to you

07:16.240 --> 07:22.960
I mean bob dillon didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. Yeah. Yeah, he probably grew in

07:23.440 --> 07:25.280
no variety for that

07:25.360 --> 07:29.360
Yeah, maybe just doesn't like going in sweden, but it seemed like a big fun trip

07:29.440 --> 07:33.200
I think they do it in a nice time of years, but hey, that's his right. He earned that right

07:33.520 --> 07:37.840
I think the best artists aren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for the fame or the money

07:37.920 --> 07:42.880
They're doing it because they love the heart. Yeah, that's the the rick ruven thing. He got a verb it through

07:43.520 --> 07:45.520
Download your inner thing

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
I don't think we've talked about this that

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
this obsession that I have about how

07:51.680 --> 07:52.960
rick

07:52.960 --> 07:54.160
has this

07:54.160 --> 07:56.880
way of being very very still in his body

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
But keeping his mind very active

08:00.880 --> 08:02.560
as a practice

08:02.560 --> 08:04.560
When spent some time with him in italy last june

08:05.360 --> 08:08.640
And we would tread water and his pool in the morning and listen to

08:09.440 --> 08:11.440
history of rock and roll and hundred songs

08:12.240 --> 08:14.960
Um amazing podcast by the way. It is yeah

08:15.360 --> 08:19.920
And um, and then he would spend a fair amount of time during the day, you know in this kind of meditative state

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Where his mind is very active body very still

08:22.720 --> 08:29.600
And then carl dice roth when he came on my podcast talked about how he forces himself to sit still and think in complete sentences late at night

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
after his kids go to sleep

08:31.600 --> 08:32.880
and

08:32.880 --> 08:35.840
You know, there's a state of mind rapid eye movement sleep

08:36.320 --> 08:42.000
Where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active and people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more

08:42.560 --> 08:46.400
elaborate emotion filled dreams and the source of many ideas

08:47.040 --> 08:49.040
and there are other examples

08:49.120 --> 08:51.120
Einstein

08:51.520 --> 08:55.680
People described him as taking walks around the princeton campus then pausing

08:56.560 --> 08:57.360
and

08:57.360 --> 09:02.800
Would ask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a high rate

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
um

09:05.920 --> 09:13.200
So, you know, this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about some incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of

09:14.080 --> 09:16.980
Stilling the body while keeping the mind deliberately very active

09:17.860 --> 09:22.340
Very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report, you know

09:22.340 --> 09:24.900
Great ideas coming to them in the shower while running

09:25.780 --> 09:30.420
So it can be the opposite as well where the body is very active and the and the mind is perhaps more on

09:31.300 --> 09:35.940
Kind of like a default mode network not really focusing on any one specific thing

09:36.180 --> 09:41.460
You know interesting as a there's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians have talked to they talk about

09:42.180 --> 09:43.940
sleep deprivation

09:44.020 --> 09:47.860
And going crazy hours through the night obsessively pursuing a thing

09:48.420 --> 09:51.540
And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get

09:52.100 --> 09:58.740
rest right and and we know we just did this sixth episode special series on sleep with matt walker

09:59.780 --> 10:01.300
we know

10:01.300 --> 10:02.820
that

10:02.820 --> 10:07.540
When you deprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep you get a rebound in rapid eye movement sleep

10:07.540 --> 10:09.700
You get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep

10:10.340 --> 10:15.060
And matt talks about this in the podcast and he did an episode on sleep and

10:15.780 --> 10:20.740
Creativity sleep and memory and rapid eye movement sleep comes up multiple times in that series

10:22.020 --> 10:28.580
There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep people are coming off cannabis often will suffer from

10:29.860 --> 10:33.220
Insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping they like dream like crazy

10:34.260 --> 10:37.940
Cannabis is a very controversial topic right now. Oh, yeah, I saw that what happened

10:37.940 --> 10:39.940
There's a bunch of drama around

10:40.340 --> 10:45.620
Episode you did on cannabis. Yeah, we did a episode about cannabis talked about the health

10:46.340 --> 10:50.180
Benefits and the potential risks right it's neither here nor there

10:50.980 --> 10:55.700
It depends on the person depends on the age depends on genetic background a number of other things

10:57.780 --> 10:59.060
We

10:59.060 --> 11:04.420
published that episode well over a year ago and it had no issues online so to speak

11:04.900 --> 11:08.500
And then a clip of it was put to x where you know

11:09.380 --> 11:12.180
The real action occurs as you know your favorite

11:12.340 --> 11:13.460
box

11:13.460 --> 11:18.020
Yeah, yeah, the the the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves

11:18.500 --> 11:22.020
That is x versus instagram or youtube

11:22.900 --> 11:24.900
there was

11:24.980 --> 11:31.780
Kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the cannabis research field to phds and mds

11:31.860 --> 11:35.220
Yeah, there were people on our side. There were people on our side. I mean

11:36.100 --> 11:38.420
You know the the statement that got

11:39.060 --> 11:44.180
Things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals

11:45.140 --> 11:47.060
there's a

11:47.060 --> 11:54.420
High potential for inducing psychosis with high thc containing cannabis for certain individuals not all

11:55.700 --> 11:57.700
That sparked some issues

11:58.980 --> 12:00.980
There was really a split, you know

12:02.020 --> 12:04.020
See this in different fields it

12:04.740 --> 12:08.820
There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that

12:09.380 --> 12:12.820
In my opinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university

12:13.780 --> 12:15.300
venue

12:15.300 --> 12:21.220
Especially among colleagues, but that's fine. You know, we're all grown-ups. Well for me from my perspective. It was strangely rude

12:21.860 --> 12:23.620
and it

12:23.620 --> 12:25.860
had an era of like elitism

12:27.140 --> 12:29.140
that

12:29.140 --> 12:30.820
to me

12:30.820 --> 12:36.260
Was it the source of the problem during covet that led to the distrust of science

12:36.740 --> 12:43.940
And the the popularization of disrespecting science because so many scientists spoke with an arrogance and a douche baggery

12:44.340 --> 12:49.140
That I wish we would have a little bit less of yeah, it's tough because most academics

12:49.780 --> 12:52.420
Don't understand that people outside the university system

12:53.540 --> 12:54.580
are

12:54.580 --> 12:56.580
they don't they're not familiar with

12:57.380 --> 12:59.300
like the inner workings of science and

13:00.260 --> 13:06.100
And the culture and so you have to be very careful how you present when you're a university professor

13:07.140 --> 13:10.180
And when yeah, so, you know, he came out swinging at some, you know

13:10.740 --> 13:15.220
A four letter word type language and he was obviously upset about so I simply said what I would say anywhere

13:15.540 --> 13:17.860
Which was hey look you come on the podcast. Let's chat

13:18.660 --> 13:19.540
and

13:19.540 --> 13:22.820
Why don't you give your tell me where I'm wrong and let's discuss and

13:23.940 --> 13:24.900
and

13:24.900 --> 13:26.500
Fortunately, he agreed

13:26.500 --> 13:32.500
And initially he said well, no, how can I be sure you're not going to misrepresent me and so I said we got on a

13:33.220 --> 13:38.340
Dm then an email then eventually phone call and just said hey listen like you're welcome to record the whole conversation

13:38.900 --> 13:44.420
We've never done a gotcha on my podcast and let's just get to the heart of the matter. I think this this little controversy is

13:45.060 --> 13:46.740
perfect

13:46.740 --> 13:49.700
kindling for for a really great discussion and

13:50.500 --> 13:54.180
And he had some other conditions that we worked out and and I and I felt like

13:54.660 --> 13:58.900
Cool like he's really interested although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on twitter

13:59.300 --> 14:02.580
I will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule

14:03.060 --> 14:06.020
I said it will fly you out or put you up. He said no he wants to fly himself

14:06.100 --> 14:09.300
He really wants to make sure that there's like kind of a space between

14:10.020 --> 14:10.740
um

14:10.740 --> 14:15.300
I think some of the perception of science and health podcasts in the academic community is that

14:15.940 --> 14:19.220
It's all designed to sell something. No, we run ads so it can be free to everyone else

14:19.540 --> 14:24.740
Yeah, but I think look in the end. Um, he agreed and I'm excited for the conversation

14:25.300 --> 14:27.300
It was interesting because

14:27.540 --> 14:29.780
In the wake of that little exchange

14:31.460 --> 14:37.220
There's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol

14:37.620 --> 14:39.780
in many in many cultures as

14:40.420 --> 14:44.500
Within the united states as when I say cultures. I mean demographics

14:45.220 --> 14:47.220
The united states as the as the drug of choice

14:47.780 --> 14:48.580
um

14:48.580 --> 14:52.900
There have been people highlighting the issues of potential psychosis in high thc containing

14:53.620 --> 14:54.820
and so it's

14:54.820 --> 14:59.700
Kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of on board certain elements that you know, I put forward and

15:00.180 --> 15:04.660
I think there's some controversy as to whether or not the different strains the indicas and sativas

15:04.740 --> 15:09.140
I have are biologically different, etc. So we'll get down into the weeds pun intended

15:10.020 --> 15:14.340
During that one and I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to

15:15.300 --> 15:17.300
A direct criticism online about

15:17.860 --> 15:23.060
Um scientific content in a way that really promoted like oh here the idea of inviting a particular guest

15:23.460 --> 15:26.580
And so it's great. Let's get a guest to um his expert in cannabis

15:26.660 --> 15:31.700
I I believe I could be wrong about this that he's a behavioral neuroscientist is slightly different training

15:31.780 --> 15:35.220
but look he seems highly credentialed to be fun and we

15:36.260 --> 15:38.260
You know, we welcome that kind of exchange

15:38.980 --> 15:39.860
I

15:39.940 --> 15:42.660
I'm not being diplomatic. I'm just saying like it's cool. Like he's coming on

15:42.740 --> 15:44.740
No, you you know, and he was friendly on the phone, right?

15:44.980 --> 15:48.820
Like he literally came out online and was like basically like kind of like fu

15:49.300 --> 15:53.460
Like f this and fu, but you get someone on the phone. It's like, hey, how's it going? And then like, oh, yeah

15:53.540 --> 15:59.460
Well, you know, I there was an immediate apology of like, hey, listen. I came out. Normally. I'm like not like that

15:59.540 --> 16:04.340
But online, you know, you got a different. Yeah. Okay, so it's a little bit like it's a little bit like jiu-jitsu, right?

16:04.420 --> 16:07.460
People say all sorts of things I guess but if they if you're like, all right, well

16:07.940 --> 16:10.020
Let's go then it's probably a different story

16:10.420 --> 16:15.060
You know, it's not like jiu-jitsu because the jiu-jitsu people don't talk shit because they know what the consequences are

16:15.380 --> 16:19.860
Let me let me just say on mic and off mic. You have been very respectful towards this person

16:21.060 --> 16:25.220
And I'm look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been

16:25.620 --> 16:32.180
That said to me that guy was being a dick and when you graciously politely invited him on the podcast

16:32.180 --> 16:38.260
He was still talking down to you the whole time. So I really admire and look forward to listening to you talk to him

16:38.340 --> 16:40.340
But I hope others

16:40.340 --> 16:41.700
don't do that

16:41.700 --> 16:43.460
like you are

16:43.460 --> 16:44.820
a positive

16:44.820 --> 16:46.580
humble voice

16:46.580 --> 16:52.980
Exploring all the interesting aspects of science like you want to learn if there you've got anything wrong

16:54.180 --> 16:57.060
You want to learn about it the way he was being a dick

16:57.780 --> 16:59.380
I was just

16:59.380 --> 17:03.780
Hurt a little bit not because of him but because like there's some people I really really admire

17:04.340 --> 17:07.460
Brilliant scientists that are not their best cells

17:08.100 --> 17:14.020
On twitter on x definitely. I don't understand what happens to their brain. Well, they regress

17:14.660 --> 17:19.460
They they regress and and they also are protected, you know, you know, when you remove the

17:20.180 --> 17:24.340
I mean no scientific argument should ever come to physical blows, right?

17:24.580 --> 17:29.220
But when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody, um

17:29.380 --> 17:33.620
People will throw all sorts of stones at a distance, you know an over a wall

17:34.100 --> 17:35.380
and they've got their

17:35.380 --> 17:39.460
Their wife or their husband or their boyfriend or their dog or their cat to go cuddle with them afterwards

17:40.100 --> 17:40.980
um

17:40.980 --> 17:43.780
But you get in a room and it's like, you know

17:44.420 --> 17:46.420
confrontational people

17:46.980 --> 17:48.980
In real life are are pretty rare

17:48.980 --> 17:53.860
But hopefully if they do it they're like willing to back it up with knowledge in this case, right?

17:53.860 --> 17:58.260
We're not talking about physical altercation. Yeah, he kept coming and he kept putting on conditions

17:58.260 --> 18:00.660
How do I know you want this and I was like, well, you can record the conversation

18:00.660 --> 18:05.540
How do I know you want that? Listen, we'll pay for you to come out. How do you know and eventually he just kind of relented?

18:06.100 --> 18:07.460
and um

18:07.460 --> 18:09.780
And it to his credit, you know, he's agreed to come on

18:09.940 --> 18:11.220
I mean he still has to show up

18:11.220 --> 18:14.980
But once he does, you know, we'll treat him right like we would any other guest

18:15.060 --> 18:20.020
Yeah, you treat people really well and I I just hope that people are a little bit nicer on the internet

18:20.100 --> 18:24.340
Yeah, well, you know x is an interesting one because you it thickens your skin

18:25.060 --> 18:29.380
You know to just to go on there. I mean you have to be ready to deal with sure

18:29.460 --> 18:37.780
But I can still criticize people for for being douchebags because like that's still not good inspiring behavior like especially for scientists

18:38.820 --> 18:41.380
That should be sort of symbols of

18:42.420 --> 18:45.140
Scientific thinking which requires intellectual humility

18:45.940 --> 18:50.740
Humility is a big part of that and twitter is a good place to illustrate that

18:51.300 --> 18:55.460
Yeah, eight years ago. I used to I was a student in ta then

18:56.340 --> 19:02.020
Instructor and then directed a cold spring harbour course on visual neuroscience. These are summer courses that

19:02.980 --> 19:05.140
Explore different topics and at night we would host

19:05.860 --> 19:09.060
Um, what we hoped were battles in front of the students

19:09.780 --> 19:15.460
Where you'd get two people on it, you know, would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that would first, you know

19:16.420 --> 19:18.340
Restore vision to the blind kind of arguments

19:18.340 --> 19:21.540
You know, kind of like it's kind of a silly argument because there's gonna be a combination of both, right?

19:22.100 --> 19:23.060
but

19:23.060 --> 19:24.900
You'd get these great arguments

19:24.900 --> 19:32.180
But the arguments were always couched in data and occasionally you'd get somebody would go like or would curse or something

19:32.180 --> 19:35.460
But it was the rare very um very well placed

19:36.020 --> 19:39.220
You know, um insult it wasn't you know coming out swinging

19:39.700 --> 19:43.060
Um, I think ultimately, you know twitter is a record of people's behavior

19:43.220 --> 19:48.500
That the internet is a record of people's behavior and here i'm not talking about news reports about people's behavior

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
I'm talking about how people show up

19:50.900 --> 19:56.980
Online up is really important. You've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect and

19:57.460 --> 20:00.660
You know, you just you would hope that people would grow from that example

20:00.660 --> 20:04.260
Well, I'll tell you that the the podcasters that i'm scouting it's their energy

20:04.500 --> 20:09.540
But it's also how they treat other people how they respond to comments and um, you know

20:09.620 --> 20:15.060
We're blessed to have pretty significant reach when we put out a podcast like someone else's podcast

20:15.060 --> 20:21.220
It goes far and wide so like a skateboard team like a laboratory where you're selecting people to be in your lab

20:21.700 --> 20:25.700
You're you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and they're collegial

20:27.060 --> 20:30.420
Etiquette and etiquette is is lacking nowadays

20:31.220 --> 20:33.220
But you're in the suit and tie bringing it back

20:33.620 --> 20:34.980
bringing it back

20:34.980 --> 20:37.700
Uh, you said that your conversation with james hollis

20:38.340 --> 20:41.460
A union psychoanalyst had a big impact on you. What do you mean?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.340
james hollis is a

20:44.340 --> 20:46.020
84 year old union

20:46.020 --> 20:49.860
psychoanalyst who's written 17 books including under Saturn shadow

20:50.420 --> 20:56.660
Which is on the healing and trauma of men the eating eden project. Excuse me, which is about relationships and creating a life

20:57.220 --> 21:02.180
I discovered james hollis in an online lecture that was recorded. I think in san diego. It's on youtube

21:02.260 --> 21:04.500
The audio is terrible called creating a life

21:05.300 --> 21:08.980
And this was somewhere in the 2011 to 2015 span

21:09.060 --> 21:12.820
I can't remember and I was on my way to europe and I called my girlfriend at the time

21:12.900 --> 21:15.380
I was like, I just found the most incredible lecture i've ever heard

21:16.260 --> 21:17.620
and I

21:17.620 --> 21:19.300
he talks about

21:19.300 --> 21:20.500
the shadow

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
he talks about

21:22.980 --> 21:29.620
Your developmental upbringing and how you either align with or go 180 degrees off your

21:30.420 --> 21:33.940
Parents tendencies and values in certain areas. He talked about

21:34.580 --> 21:38.740
The specific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life

21:38.820 --> 21:42.020
so it's always been a dream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast

21:42.900 --> 21:43.940
and

21:43.940 --> 21:47.780
He wasn't able to travel so our team went out to dc and sat down with him

21:47.780 --> 21:51.220
we rarely do that nowadays people come to our studio and

21:52.180 --> 21:58.820
He came in he had some surgeries recently and he kind of came in with some assistance from a you know a cane and then

21:59.300 --> 22:01.300
sat down and just

22:01.380 --> 22:04.420
Just blew my mind it from start to finish

22:04.980 --> 22:06.980
He didn't miss a syllable

22:07.060 --> 22:10.020
and every sentence that he spoke was

22:10.660 --> 22:13.860
like a quotable sentence of with real potency and

22:15.380 --> 22:17.620
Actionable items. I think one of the things that was most

22:18.500 --> 22:19.860
striking

22:19.860 --> 22:24.260
To me was how he said when we take ourselves out of stimulus and response

22:25.220 --> 22:30.020
And we just force ourselves to spend some time in the quiet of our thoughts

22:30.980 --> 22:36.100
While walking or while seated or while lying down doesn't have to be meditation, but it could be

22:37.140 --> 22:38.500
that

22:38.500 --> 22:43.780
We access our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want

22:43.860 --> 22:48.180
And that if we do that practice repeatedly 10 minutes a day here 15 minutes a day there

22:49.060 --> 22:51.060
that we start to really touch into

22:51.620 --> 22:57.540
Our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take

22:58.260 --> 23:04.740
But that so often we just stay in stimulus response. We just do do do do do, which is great. We have to be productive

23:05.460 --> 23:07.460
um, but we miss those

23:07.460 --> 23:08.340
um

23:08.340 --> 23:10.340
important messages and

23:10.900 --> 23:12.900
interestingly he also

23:12.900 --> 23:19.060
Put forward this idea of what is this like get up shut up suit up. Yeah something like that like get out of bed suit up

23:19.780 --> 23:24.820
And shut up and get to work. He also has that in him kind of a Goggins type mindset

23:25.220 --> 23:30.580
So be able to turn off all this self-reflection and self analysis and just get shit done get shit done

23:30.820 --> 23:36.660
But then also take dedicated time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind

23:36.980 --> 23:39.860
and he quotes shakespeare and he quotes yung and he quotes

23:40.580 --> 23:44.420
Everybody through history with with incredible accuracy and um

23:45.380 --> 23:47.380
and in exactly the way

23:48.260 --> 23:53.220
Needed to drive home a point, but that conversation to me was one that I really felt like okay, you know

23:53.940 --> 23:56.260
If I don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason

23:57.060 --> 24:01.460
That one's in the can and I feel really great about it. It's it to me. It's the most important

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
guest recording we've ever done

24:04.980 --> 24:06.820
um

24:06.820 --> 24:09.540
In particular because he has wisdom

24:10.420 --> 24:12.420
And while I hope he lives to be

24:12.580 --> 24:14.580
204

24:14.580 --> 24:19.700
Chances are he's got another what 20 30 years with us. Hopefully

24:20.340 --> 24:25.540
More but I really really wanted to capture that information and get it out there

24:25.540 --> 24:27.540
So I'm very very proud of that one

24:27.860 --> 24:28.820
um

24:28.820 --> 24:34.500
And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him young old male female whatever and you're gonna get something of value

24:35.220 --> 24:37.220
What do you think about this idea?

24:38.260 --> 24:40.100
of the shadow

24:40.100 --> 24:41.460
that uh

24:41.460 --> 24:43.460
The good the bad that we were press

24:43.940 --> 24:49.300
That hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves. That's there. You think there's like a ocean

24:50.420 --> 24:52.420
We don't have direct access to yes

24:53.540 --> 24:59.540
Yeah, young said it we have all things inside of us and we do and some people are more in touch with those than others and

24:59.940 --> 25:03.060
Some people it's repressed. I mean does that mean that we could all be

25:04.020 --> 25:06.900
You know horrible people or marvelous people

25:07.700 --> 25:10.100
Benevolent people perhaps I think that

25:10.740 --> 25:12.740
um

25:12.820 --> 25:16.980
Thankfully more often than not people lean away from the like violent and

25:17.780 --> 25:21.460
harmful parts of their their shadow, but I think spending time

25:22.340 --> 25:24.180
thinking about

25:24.180 --> 25:26.180
you know ones

25:27.220 --> 25:32.980
Shadow shadows is super important. How how else are we going to grow otherwise?

25:33.460 --> 25:36.660
you know, we have these unconscious blind spots of denial or

25:37.380 --> 25:38.500
um

25:38.500 --> 25:40.900
Repression or whatever, you know, the psychiatrists tell us

25:41.700 --> 25:47.060
But yeah, it clearly exists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do we have neural circuits for

25:48.100 --> 25:49.220
altruism

25:49.220 --> 25:51.700
um, and no one's born without these things

25:52.260 --> 25:55.300
and some people they're atrophied and some people they're hypertrophied but

25:57.060 --> 25:59.460
Looking inward and and recognizing what's there is

26:00.260 --> 26:01.220
key

26:01.220 --> 26:05.940
Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what rick rubin is accessing when he goes silent

26:06.420 --> 26:08.420
Silent body active mind

26:09.060 --> 26:11.060
That's interesting. What is it for you?

26:11.860 --> 26:13.860
What place do you go to?

26:14.020 --> 26:19.300
That generates ideas that helps you generate ideas. I have a lot of new practices around this

26:19.380 --> 26:24.100
I mean, I'm all like always exploring for protocols. I have to it's like in my nature

26:24.660 --> 26:25.540
um

26:25.540 --> 26:31.300
When when I went and spent time with rick, I I tried to adopt his practice of staying very still and just letting stuff

26:31.540 --> 26:34.900
You know come to the surface or the dystherothian way of

26:36.020 --> 26:38.980
Formulating complete sentences and while being still in the body

26:39.940 --> 26:41.300
what I

26:41.300 --> 26:45.140
I found works better is what my good friend tim armstrong

26:45.700 --> 26:51.300
Does to write music he writes music every day. He's a music producer. He's obviously a singer guitar player for rancid

26:51.940 --> 26:53.940
um, and he's helped

26:53.940 --> 26:55.940
dozens and dozens and dozens of

26:56.020 --> 26:58.260
female pop artists and punk rock artists

26:58.980 --> 27:01.780
write great songs and many of the

27:02.580 --> 27:05.460
famous songs that you've heard from other artists

27:05.940 --> 27:07.940
Tim helped them write

27:08.020 --> 27:08.980
Tim

27:08.980 --> 27:13.780
Wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night and what he does is he'll start drawing or painting

27:14.180 --> 27:19.060
So what he's done and joni mitchell talks about this too. You find some creative outlet

27:20.100 --> 27:21.380
that's

27:21.380 --> 27:23.620
like 15 degrees off center from your

27:24.340 --> 27:29.860
Main creative outlet and you do that thing. So for me, that's drawing. I like doing anatomical drawings

27:30.580 --> 27:34.820
Neuroscience based drawing drawn neurons that kind of thing and if I do that for a little while

27:35.700 --> 27:41.140
My mind starts churning on the the nervous system and biology and then I come up with

27:42.660 --> 27:44.660
Areas I'd like to explore for the podcast

27:44.980 --> 27:47.860
Ways I'd like to address certain topics right now

27:47.860 --> 27:53.620
I'm very interested in autonomic control of beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to control their pupil sizes

27:53.860 --> 27:57.300
And without changing luminance through a bio feedback mechanism

27:57.860 --> 27:59.860
um, and that gives them

28:00.180 --> 28:03.060
control over their so-called automatic autonomic nervous system

28:03.700 --> 28:08.500
And I've been looking at what the circuitry is and it's it's beautiful. So I'll draw the circuitry

28:09.220 --> 28:12.340
That we know underlies autonomic function and as I'm doing that I'm thinking

28:12.340 --> 28:16.180
Oh, like what about autonomic control and those people that supposedly can control their pupil size

28:16.180 --> 28:19.780
Then you go in and there's a paper published in nature press one of the nature journals

28:19.780 --> 28:21.540
And there's a recent paper on this like oh cool

28:21.540 --> 28:26.180
And then we talk about this and then how could this be put into a kind of a post or how could this?

28:26.740 --> 28:31.540
You know, so doing things that are about 15 degrees off center from your main thing is a great way to access

28:31.620 --> 28:35.620
I believe that the circuits for in tim's case painting goes to songwriting

28:36.740 --> 28:38.740
I think for

28:38.740 --> 28:43.300
Joni Mitchell that was also the case, right? I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting

28:43.940 --> 28:45.940
For rick. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's

28:46.260 --> 28:50.580
listening to podcasts. I don't know that that's his business. Do you have anything that you like to

28:51.460 --> 28:55.780
Focus on that allows you then an easier transition into your main creative work

28:56.020 --> 28:59.220
No, I'd really like to focus on emptiness and silence

28:59.460 --> 29:06.100
So I pick the dragon. I have to slay. So whatever the problem I have to work on and I just sit there

29:07.620 --> 29:10.420
And stare at I love how fucking linear you are

29:10.980 --> 29:14.580
And I just and if there's no if you're tired, I'll just sit

29:15.380 --> 29:17.780
I believe in the in the power of just waiting

29:18.500 --> 29:19.620
and

29:19.620 --> 29:21.620
Usually I'll stop being tired

29:21.860 --> 29:25.780
Or the energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere

29:25.780 --> 29:30.420
But there needs to be a silence and an emptiness. It's an empty room. Just me and the dragon and

29:31.140 --> 29:37.460
We wait, that's it. Like if it's a usually with programming you're thinking about a particular design like how do I design this thing

29:38.900 --> 29:40.900
To solve this problem

29:40.980 --> 29:45.060
Any cognitive enhancers? I've got it quite the gallery in front of me. Well, that's right. Yeah

29:45.460 --> 29:48.900
Should we walk through this? Yeah, this is not there's not a sales thing. It's just

29:49.380 --> 29:55.060
Um, I tend to do this bounce back and forth your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices

29:55.060 --> 29:59.860
So water all my refrigerator. I know right. There's no food in there. There's water

30:00.660 --> 30:05.380
There's element which they now have canned. Yeah, and yes, they're a podcast sponsor for both of us

30:05.380 --> 30:08.340
But that's not why I cracked one of these open. I like them provide their they're cold

30:08.500 --> 30:13.540
And that's by the way, my least favorite flavors. I was saying that's that's the reason it's still left in the fridge

30:13.700 --> 30:17.860
The cherry one is really good. The black cherry. There's an orange one

30:18.020 --> 30:22.500
Yeah, I pushed the um the sled this morning and pulled the sled for my workout at the gym

30:22.500 --> 30:30.340
And and it was hot today here in austin. So um some salt is good and then matina urba mate zero sugar full confession

30:30.340 --> 30:36.260
I helped develop this i'm a partial owner, but I love urba mate half argentine been drinking mate since i was a

30:36.260 --> 30:41.540
Little kid there's actually a photo somewhere on the internet when i'm like three sitting on my grandfather's lap sipping mate out the

30:41.540 --> 30:45.940
Gourd and then this my fun interesting. This is just a little bit of coffee

30:47.060 --> 30:52.260
With a scoop of brian johnson gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened cocoa

30:52.660 --> 30:55.220
So I put that in chocolate and I like it it just for the taste

30:55.300 --> 31:00.500
Well, actually nukes my appetite and since i'm we're not going out to dinner tonight until later. I figure that's good

31:01.220 --> 31:05.700
Yeah, brian's an interesting one, right? He's really pushing this this thing the optimization of everything

31:05.860 --> 31:08.660
Although he just heard his ankle. He posted a photo. He heard his ankle

31:08.660 --> 31:13.940
So now he's injecting bpc body protection compound 157 which many many people are taking by the way

31:14.020 --> 31:16.020
I did an episode on peptides

31:16.340 --> 31:20.660
I should just say, you know bpc 157 one of the known effects in animal models

31:21.220 --> 31:26.020
Is angiogenesis like development of new vasculature, which can be great

31:26.820 --> 31:30.980
In some context, but also if you have a tumor you don't really want to vascularize that tumor anymore

31:31.460 --> 31:34.260
So I worry about people taking bpc 157 continually

31:35.060 --> 31:36.900
but um

31:36.900 --> 31:42.420
And there's very little human data. I think there's like one study and it's a lousy one. So a lot of animal data

31:43.220 --> 31:45.220
Some of the peptides

31:45.300 --> 31:48.980
Are interesting. However, there's one that I've experimented with a little bit called pinealyn

31:49.540 --> 31:54.020
Which um, I find even if I've just taken it twice a week before sleep

31:54.660 --> 31:57.300
Then it times it seems to do something to the

31:58.180 --> 32:02.020
Circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other days when I don't take it

32:02.580 --> 32:06.660
I get unbelievably tired at that time that normally I would do the injection

32:06.980 --> 32:11.140
These are things that I'll experiment with for a couple weeks and then typically stop maybe try something else

32:11.220 --> 32:13.220
but I stay out of

32:13.700 --> 32:16.660
Things that really stimulate any of like a major hormone pathways

32:17.300 --> 32:21.460
When it comes to peptides, there's actually a really good question of how do you experiment?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.500
Like how long do you try to think to figure out if it works for you?

32:24.740 --> 32:29.300
Well, I'm very sensitive to these things. So I and I have been doing a lot of things for a long time

32:29.300 --> 32:32.900
So if I add something in it's always one thing at a time and I notice right away

32:32.900 --> 32:36.580
If it does not make me feel good like there's a lot of excitement about some of the

32:37.140 --> 32:39.140
so-called growth hormone secretogogs

32:39.540 --> 32:41.540
hypermoralin, testemoralin, sermoralin

32:42.260 --> 32:45.140
Um, I've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've

32:45.780 --> 32:47.780
Nuked my rap and eye movement sleep

32:48.100 --> 32:51.620
But given me a lot of deep sleep, which doesn't feel good to me, but other people like them

32:52.820 --> 32:54.180
I also

32:54.180 --> 32:55.300
just

32:55.300 --> 32:57.060
Generally try and avoid

32:57.060 --> 33:01.060
Taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into all sorts of issues

33:01.060 --> 33:02.740
But some people take them safely

33:02.740 --> 33:04.500
But usually after about four or five days

33:04.500 --> 33:10.180
I know if I like something or I don't and then I move on, but I am not super adventurous with these things

33:10.180 --> 33:14.660
I know people that will take cocktails of peptides with multiple things. They'll try anything

33:15.140 --> 33:17.140
That's not me and I do blood work

33:17.540 --> 33:20.660
um, but also I'm you know, I'm mainly

33:21.380 --> 33:24.820
reading papers and podcasting and um, I'm

33:25.380 --> 33:29.540
Teaching a course next spring. Stanford. I'm gonna do a big undergraduate course

33:30.180 --> 33:33.140
um, so I'm trying to develop that course and things like that so

33:33.220 --> 33:40.500
Um, I don't need to lift more weight or run further than I already do which is not that much weight or far as it is

33:40.740 --> 33:45.300
All right, you're not going to the olympics. You're not trying to no truly maximize some aspect of your performance

33:45.300 --> 33:50.260
No, and I'm not and I'm not trying to get down below whatever, you know, seven percent body fat or something

33:50.260 --> 33:52.260
I don't have those kinds of goals

33:52.260 --> 33:58.580
So hydration electrolytes caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing and then and then here's one that I think

33:58.900 --> 34:02.740
I brought out for discussion. This is a piece of Nicarat. They're not a sponsor

34:03.380 --> 34:04.260
um

34:04.260 --> 34:06.260
nicotine is an interesting compound

34:06.740 --> 34:08.740
it will raise blood pressure

34:08.740 --> 34:10.740
and it um

34:11.220 --> 34:16.900
Is probably not safe for everybody, but you know, the nicotine is gaining in popularity like crazy mainly these um

34:17.620 --> 34:22.420
Pouches that people put in the lip not we're not talking about. I'm smoking vaping dipping or snuffing

34:23.380 --> 34:24.500
you know, my

34:24.500 --> 34:27.940
interest in nicotine started this was in 2010

34:28.020 --> 34:34.660
I was visiting columbia medical school and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist richard axl won the noble prize

34:35.620 --> 34:40.260
Co-recipient with linda buck for the um discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction

34:40.980 --> 34:47.540
Brilliant guy. He's probably in his late 70s now probably. Yeah, and he kept popping nicorette in his mouth

34:47.940 --> 34:51.300
And I was like, what's this about and he said, oh, well, this was just anecdote, right?

34:51.300 --> 34:55.780
But he said but he said this he said, oh, well, you know, it protects against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

34:55.780 --> 34:58.500
I said it does and he goes, yeah, I don't know if he was kidding or not

34:58.500 --> 35:01.780
He's known for making jokes and then he said that when he used to smoke

35:02.260 --> 35:03.940
It really helped his focus and creativity

35:03.940 --> 35:07.700
But then he quit smoking because he went lung cancer and he found that he couldn't focus as well

35:07.700 --> 35:10.740
So he would choose nicorette. So occasionally like right now

35:11.380 --> 35:14.580
Well, each I do a half a piece, but I'm not russian

35:15.140 --> 35:18.020
So I'm a little, you know, you know, did you spot the whole thing in your mouth?

35:18.820 --> 35:21.460
So I'll do a couple milligrams every now and again

35:22.180 --> 35:26.180
And it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular, but you fast all day

35:26.180 --> 35:31.620
You're still doing one meal a day one meal a day. Yeah. Yeah, I did a nicotine pouch with Rogan at dinner

35:32.180 --> 35:34.580
And I got high. Yeah, that's a lot

35:35.220 --> 35:37.060
That's like usually six or eight milligrams

35:37.700 --> 35:39.220
I know people that

35:39.220 --> 35:41.220
get a canister of zin

35:41.380 --> 35:46.660
Take one a day pretty soon. They're taking a canister a day. So you have to be very careful. I will only allow myself

35:47.620 --> 35:49.620
two pieces of nicorette total

35:50.020 --> 35:51.300
per week

35:51.300 --> 35:53.300
And you will notice that

35:53.300 --> 35:57.220
You know in the day after you use it, you know, sometimes your your throat will feel a little bit like

35:57.700 --> 36:00.100
Like a little spasmy like you might want to cough once or twice

36:00.900 --> 36:05.700
And so, you know, if you're a singer or your podcast or something you have to do a long podcast

36:05.780 --> 36:08.900
You want to just be mindful of but yeah, you're supposed to kind of like keep it in your cheek and

36:09.620 --> 36:11.620
Now here we go, but it did make me

36:12.660 --> 36:18.180
Intensely focused in a way that was a little bit scary because um the nucleus basalis

36:18.980 --> 36:24.900
Is in the you know, basal forebrain nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out

36:26.020 --> 36:30.020
axons little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere

36:30.820 --> 36:32.820
and when you focus on one particular

36:33.300 --> 36:38.740
Topic matter or one particular area of your visual field or listening to something and focusing visually

36:39.380 --> 36:46.820
We know that there's a an elaboration of the amount of acetylcholine release there and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites there

36:46.900 --> 36:49.220
So it's a kind of an attentional modulation

36:50.020 --> 36:53.620
by acetylcholine. So you're getting in with nicotine. You're getting a

36:54.660 --> 36:56.340
Exogenous or artificial

36:56.340 --> 36:57.700
heightening of that

36:57.700 --> 37:02.020
circuitry and the time I had talk of Carlson on the podcast. He told me that apparently

37:02.580 --> 37:04.580
It helps him as he said publicly

37:05.860 --> 37:07.860
keep his

37:08.420 --> 37:12.020
Love life vibrant really it caused a visa constriction

37:12.100 --> 37:15.940
Like he literally said it makes his dick very hard. He said that publicly also

37:15.940 --> 37:18.900
Okay, well as little as I want to think about Tucker Carlson's

37:19.940 --> 37:21.460
sex life

37:21.460 --> 37:23.140
no disrespect

37:23.140 --> 37:25.140
uh the

37:26.020 --> 37:31.940
Major effect of nicotine on the vascular my understanding is that it causes vasoconstriction not vasodilation

37:32.740 --> 37:34.740
drugs like cialis to dallafill

37:35.860 --> 37:38.820
Viagra etc vasodilators they allow more blood flow

37:39.780 --> 37:40.820
Um

37:40.820 --> 37:48.740
Nicotine does the opposite less blood flow to the periphery, but provided dosages are kept low and I don't recommend people use it frequently

37:49.380 --> 37:53.940
Or at all and I don't recommend young people use it, you know, um, you know

37:54.820 --> 38:00.660
25 and younger brain's very plastic at that time and um, and certainly smoking dipping

38:01.380 --> 38:05.620
Vaping it's nothing aren't good because you're gonna run into we were running into trouble

38:06.420 --> 38:11.700
For other reasons, but in any case, um, well and even there vaping is a controversial topic

38:13.140 --> 38:15.700
Probably safer than smoking but has its own issues and

38:16.340 --> 38:19.060
I said something like that and boy did I catch a lot of heat for that

38:19.220 --> 38:22.340
You can't say anything as a health science educator not piss somebody off

38:22.980 --> 38:26.900
You know, it just depends on where the the center of mass is and how far outside that you are

38:27.700 --> 38:30.020
For me the caffeine is the main thing

38:30.500 --> 38:36.340
And actually it's a it's a really big part of my life and one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning

38:36.420 --> 38:38.420
Oh, yeah to consume caffeine if

38:39.220 --> 38:40.740
they

38:40.740 --> 38:44.420
Experience a crash in the afternoon that this is one of the misconceptions. I

38:45.300 --> 38:46.820
um

38:46.820 --> 38:51.380
I regret maybe even discussing it for people that crash in the afternoon

38:53.620 --> 38:58.420
Oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by 60 and 90 minutes in the morning, they will offset some of that

38:59.380 --> 39:03.060
But if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep all the night before you're not gonna avoid that

39:03.620 --> 39:04.820
afternoon crash

39:04.820 --> 39:09.780
But I'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration caffeine, especially if I'm gonna work out. Here's a weird one

39:10.980 --> 39:12.980
If I exercise before

39:14.420 --> 39:16.100
8 30 a.m

39:16.100 --> 39:18.660
Especially if I start exercising when I'm a little bit tired

39:19.140 --> 39:21.140
I get energy that lasts all day

39:21.860 --> 39:26.420
If I wait until my peak of energy, which is mid morning 10 a.m. 11 a.m.

39:26.420 --> 39:32.500
And I started exercising then I'm basically exhausted all afternoon and I don't understand why I mean it depends on the intensity of the

39:32.500 --> 39:35.380
Workout, but so I like to be done showered

39:36.260 --> 39:37.300
and

39:37.300 --> 39:41.220
Heading into work by 9 a.m. But I don't always meet that much

39:41.220 --> 39:44.980
So you're saying it doesn't affect your energy if you start out with exercising

39:45.220 --> 39:51.780
I think you can get energy and wake yourself up with exercise if you start early and it and then that fuels you all day long

39:52.180 --> 39:55.380
I think that if you wait until you're feeling at your best to train

39:56.500 --> 40:00.980
Sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing like the work we get paid for

40:01.620 --> 40:07.860
Like research podcasting, etc. Then oftentimes, you know, your your brain isn't firing as well

40:08.100 --> 40:13.780
That's interesting. I haven't really rigorously tried that wake up and just start running or this is the gioco thing

40:14.100 --> 40:20.660
And then there's this phenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise or eat

40:21.140 --> 40:27.140
Or socialize or if you bright light at a certain time of day for three to seven days in a row pretty soon

40:27.460 --> 40:30.740
There's an anticipatory circuit that gets generated. This is why

40:31.540 --> 40:33.540
anyone in theory can become a morning person

40:34.100 --> 40:36.660
to some degree or another and this is also

40:38.340 --> 40:42.260
Beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off, you know

40:42.260 --> 40:43.860
People wake up and all of a sudden it goes off

40:43.860 --> 40:49.060
It wasn't because it clicked it's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep

40:49.620 --> 40:51.860
And there's some papers that have been published in the last couple of years

40:52.340 --> 40:59.300
Nature neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math problems in their sleep simple math problems, but math problems nonetheless

41:01.380 --> 41:06.020
This does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're going to answer accurately

41:06.660 --> 41:08.660
like they might screw up the whole

41:10.020 --> 41:16.660
A cumulative probability of 20 across multiple months. All right, listen, what happened? What happened? Here's the deal

41:17.220 --> 41:23.060
A few years back. I did a four and a half hour after editing four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility

41:25.300 --> 41:27.300
The entire recording took 11 hours

41:27.860 --> 41:29.140
and

41:29.140 --> 41:32.340
At one point during the and by the way, I'm very proud of that episode

41:32.500 --> 41:35.140
There's many couples have written to me

41:35.860 --> 41:41.300
And said they now have children as a consequence of that episode and my first question is what were you doing during the episode?

41:41.940 --> 41:46.580
But in all seriousness, um, we should say that it's four and a half hours

41:47.300 --> 41:48.500
and

41:48.500 --> 41:52.980
People then they should listen to the episode. You're it's extremely technical episode

41:53.220 --> 41:59.380
Like you're not stopped dropping facts and and referencing huge number of papers. It must be exhaust

41:59.460 --> 42:03.220
I don't understand how you can possibly that's about sperm health sperma genesis. It talks about

42:03.780 --> 42:07.860
The ovulatory cycle it talks about things people can do that are that are considered

42:08.340 --> 42:13.540
Absolutely supported by science that talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental

42:13.540 --> 42:15.860
It talks about IVF. It talks about xt. It talks about

42:15.860 --> 42:20.500
Um, all of that it talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age

42:21.540 --> 42:22.980
et cetera

42:22.980 --> 42:27.780
um, but there's this one portion there in the podcast where I'm talking about the

42:28.500 --> 42:30.660
uh, probability of a successful pregnancy

42:31.220 --> 42:33.220
as a function of age and

42:34.100 --> 42:35.300
so

42:35.300 --> 42:39.220
There was a clip that was cut in which I was describing cumulative

42:39.860 --> 42:40.740
probability

42:40.740 --> 42:45.300
And by the way, we've published cumulative probability historians in many of my laboratory's papers

42:45.300 --> 42:48.820
Including one that was a nature article in 2018. So we run these all the time

42:48.820 --> 42:53.300
And yes, I know the difference between independent and cumulative probability. Okay, that's like I do

42:54.020 --> 42:56.180
um, the way the clip was cut

42:57.220 --> 43:02.740
And what I stated unfortunately combined to like a pretty great gaffe

43:03.380 --> 43:05.780
Where I say you're just adding percent

43:05.780 --> 43:10.420
I said you just adding percentages 20 20 to 120 percent and then I made us kind of

43:11.220 --> 43:14.500
Unfortunately, my humor isn't always so good and I made a joke. I said

43:15.060 --> 43:19.780
um 120 percent, but that's a different thing altogether. What I should have said was

43:20.740 --> 43:23.140
um, that's impossible

43:23.140 --> 43:25.460
You know and here here's how it actually works

43:25.460 --> 43:31.220
but then that it continues where I then described the cumulative probability histogram for um

43:32.100 --> 43:38.260
Successful pregnancy, but somewhere in the early portion. I I misstated something right. I made a math error

43:38.820 --> 43:42.900
Um, which implied I didn't understand the difference between independent and cumulative probability

43:43.540 --> 43:50.260
Which I do and it got picked up and and run and people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense

43:51.060 --> 43:54.100
And so what I did in response to it was rather than

43:54.740 --> 43:56.740
Just say everything I just said now

43:56.740 --> 43:57.620
I said

43:57.620 --> 43:59.780
I just came out online and said hey folks

44:00.420 --> 44:01.940
In an episode

44:01.940 --> 44:04.420
They did this on fertility. I made a math error

44:04.980 --> 44:07.620
Here is the formula for cumulative probability

44:08.420 --> 44:12.260
Successful pregnancy at that age. Here's the graph. Here's the you know, and I

44:12.820 --> 44:17.060
Offered it as a teaching moment in two ways one for people to understand cumulative probability

44:17.380 --> 44:20.660
It was sort of interesting to a number of people that had come out critiquing the gaffe

44:21.380 --> 44:26.820
also, um like biology and folks came out pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability

44:26.820 --> 44:31.060
So there was a lot of posturing, you know, the dog pile oftentimes people are quick to dog pile

44:31.220 --> 44:34.740
They didn't understand but a lot of people did understand some smart people out there, obviously

44:35.700 --> 44:38.420
I called my dad and he was just laughing. He goes. Oh, this is good

44:38.660 --> 44:42.100
This is like the old school way of of hammering academics. Um

44:42.820 --> 44:44.820
But the point being there was a teaching moment

44:45.460 --> 44:51.460
Um, give me an opportunity to say hey, I made a mistake. I also made a mistake in another podcast where I

44:52.180 --> 44:58.340
Did a micron to millimeter conversion and or centimeter conversion, but and we always correct these in the show note captions

44:58.340 --> 45:00.340
We correct them in the audio now

45:00.340 --> 45:05.780
um, unfortunately on youtube, it's harder to correct you can't go and edit in segments we put in the captions, but

45:06.740 --> 45:10.340
That was the one teaching moment if you make a mistake that's substantive and relate to data

45:10.500 --> 45:13.540
You you apologize and correct a mistake use this teaching moment

45:13.540 --> 45:15.540
The other one was to say, hey, you know

45:16.260 --> 45:20.420
In all the thousands of hours of content we've put out. I'm sure I've made some small errors

45:20.500 --> 45:25.940
I think I once said serotonin 1m and dopamine and you know, you're going you're you're riffing and

45:26.740 --> 45:28.740
It's a reminder to be careful

45:28.980 --> 45:34.420
To edit double check but the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections

45:34.500 --> 45:38.980
But it didn't feel good at first but ultimately, you know, I can laugh at myself about it

45:40.580 --> 45:42.900
Long ago at Berkeley when I was teeing my first

45:43.780 --> 45:48.180
Class it was a biopsychology class between 1998 or 1999

45:49.060 --> 45:51.060
I was drawing the pituitary

45:51.300 --> 45:55.540
Gland it which is you know, it has an interior and a posterior lobe actually is a medial lobe too

45:56.020 --> 46:00.180
I have five six hundred students in that lecture hall and I drew it was chalkboard

46:00.180 --> 46:04.500
And I drew the two lobes of the pituitary and I said my back was to the audience

46:04.500 --> 46:07.220
I said, you know, and so they just sort of hang there

46:07.940 --> 46:12.020
And everyone just erupted in laughter because it looked like a scrotum with two testicles

46:12.500 --> 46:14.500
And I remember thinking like oh my god

46:14.900 --> 46:17.380
I don't think I can turn around like in face this

46:18.100 --> 46:21.540
You know and like I only got to turn around sooner or later

46:21.540 --> 46:25.540
So I turned around and we just all had a big laugh together. It was embarrassing

46:25.940 --> 46:29.300
I'll tell you one thing though. They never forgot about the two lobes of the pituitary

46:29.780 --> 46:33.460
Yeah, and you haven't forgotten about that either right. There's a high

46:34.020 --> 46:37.060
High salience for these kinds of things and it also was

46:37.940 --> 46:39.940
kind of fun to see

46:40.500 --> 46:43.700
How excited people get to see people trip

46:44.100 --> 46:47.620
It's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid like, you know

46:47.620 --> 46:52.100
Runs the opposite direction out of the blocks or something like that and and or uh, you know

46:52.740 --> 46:54.580
I recall it one world cup

46:54.580 --> 46:59.380
Match years ago a guy scored against his own team. I think they killed the guy. Do you remember that?

47:00.100 --> 47:03.780
Some South American or Central American team. Yeah, and they killed the guy

47:04.820 --> 47:06.820
But yeah, let's let's look it up. I just said

47:07.540 --> 47:09.540
World cup. Yeah, he was gunned down

47:10.500 --> 47:16.820
Andres Escobar, yeah scored against his own team in 1994 world cup in the United States

47:17.620 --> 47:25.140
Just 27 years old playing for the Colombia national team. Yeah, last name Escobar. It's a good name

47:25.540 --> 47:27.540
I think it would protect you

47:27.700 --> 47:29.700
listen, you know, so

47:29.860 --> 47:31.860
There are some gaffes that get

47:32.180 --> 47:33.860
people

47:33.860 --> 47:34.980
killed

47:34.980 --> 47:36.500
right, so

47:36.500 --> 47:38.100
you know

47:38.180 --> 47:40.820
How forgiving are we for online mistakes?

47:40.820 --> 47:44.740
You know, I said just the nature of the mistakes people were quite gracious about the

47:45.380 --> 47:48.580
the gaff and some weren't and you know, it's interesting that

47:50.900 --> 47:52.420
We

47:52.420 --> 47:54.980
As you know public health science educators

47:56.820 --> 48:01.620
You know, we'll do long podcast sometimes and and you need to be really careful. What's great is AI

48:03.300 --> 48:06.100
Allows you to check these things now more readily

48:07.060 --> 48:08.100
so

48:08.100 --> 48:10.100
that's cool and

48:11.140 --> 48:15.140
There are ways that it's now going to be more self-correcting. I mean, you know, I think

48:15.780 --> 48:20.180
There's there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool

48:20.260 --> 48:25.460
Like things are getting cleaned up. Yeah, but mistakes nevertheless will happen. Are you do you feel the pressure?

48:26.500 --> 48:28.020
of

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
Not making mistakes. Sure

48:30.180 --> 48:34.580
I mean, you know, I try and get things right to the best of you know, to the best of my ability

48:35.140 --> 48:40.420
Um, I check with experts. It's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast

48:41.220 --> 48:47.860
A lot of times I chuckle because I'm you know at Stanford. We have some amazing scientists, but I talk to them else people elsewhere

48:48.900 --> 48:50.740
um, and

48:50.740 --> 48:52.740
it's always interesting to me

48:53.780 --> 48:55.780
how

48:56.580 --> 48:58.900
You know, I'll get divergent information

48:59.700 --> 49:04.660
And then I'll find the overlap in the Venn diagram and I have this like question

49:04.660 --> 49:06.820
Do I just stay with the overlap in the Venn diagram?

49:07.380 --> 49:13.060
They I didn't episode on oral health. I didn't know this until I researched that episode, but

49:13.700 --> 49:15.060
Oral health is

49:15.060 --> 49:20.660
critically related to heart health and brain health that there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus, you know

49:21.620 --> 49:22.580
that

49:22.580 --> 49:26.020
can make its way into other parts of the body through the mouth that

49:26.900 --> 49:33.060
Can cause serious issues. There's the idea that some forms of dementia some forms of heart disease are start in the mouth

49:33.220 --> 49:34.260
basically

49:34.260 --> 49:36.260
I talked to no fewer than four

49:37.140 --> 49:41.540
Dentists dental experts and there was a lot of convergence. I also learned that

49:42.580 --> 49:45.780
Teeth can demineralize that's the formation of cavities

49:45.780 --> 49:49.860
They can also remineralize as long as the cavity isn't too deep it can actually fill itself back in

49:50.260 --> 49:52.900
Especially if you provide the right substrates for it

49:53.300 --> 49:59.380
That saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth provided the milieu is right

49:59.940 --> 50:04.100
Things like alcohol-based mouth washes killing off some of the critical things you need

50:04.420 --> 50:07.220
This is fascinating and I put out that episode thinking oh, I'm not a dentist

50:07.220 --> 50:13.060
I'm not an oral health episode. I talked to a pediatric dentist. There's a terrific one doctor downscore stacy

50:13.700 --> 50:15.700
staci on

50:15.700 --> 50:17.940
Instagram does great content talk to some others

50:18.500 --> 50:19.700
Um

50:19.700 --> 50:24.420
And like and then I just waited for the attack. I was like here we go and it didn't come

50:25.140 --> 50:27.140
And dentists were thanking me. I was like, whoa

50:27.540 --> 50:28.660
You know

50:28.660 --> 50:33.860
That's a rare thing more often than not if I do an episode about say psilocybin or mdma

50:34.660 --> 50:37.700
You get some people liking it or adhd and the drugs for adhd

50:37.700 --> 50:40.740
We did a whole episode on the riddle and vivants adder all stuff

50:41.060 --> 50:45.940
You get people saying thank you, you know, I prescribe this to my kid and it really helps and and this and

50:46.660 --> 50:47.540
But they're

50:47.540 --> 50:51.140
Private about the fact that they do it because they get so much attack from other people

50:52.100 --> 50:53.140
so

50:53.140 --> 50:55.140
I like to find the center of mass

50:55.540 --> 50:57.060
report that

50:57.060 --> 50:59.060
Try and make it as clear as possible

50:59.220 --> 51:02.260
And then I know that there's some stuff where I'm going to catch shit

51:03.220 --> 51:05.780
What's frustrating for me is when

51:06.420 --> 51:11.300
Like I see claims that I'm like against fluoridization of water, which I'm not right

51:11.300 --> 51:15.620
Like we talked about the benefits of fluoride it builds a hyper strong bonds within the teeth

51:15.940 --> 51:17.700
I went and looked at some of the

51:17.700 --> 51:22.020
the literally the crystal struck not excuse me not the crystal structure, but the they

51:23.140 --> 51:30.500
Essentially the like micron and sub micron structure of teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds

51:31.380 --> 51:36.100
And you can also form them with things like hydroxyapatite. And why is there fluoride in water? Well, it's the best

51:36.260 --> 51:37.140
Okay

51:37.140 --> 51:39.620
You get you say some things that are interesting

51:39.620 --> 51:42.740
But then somehow it gets turned into like your against fluoridization

51:42.740 --> 51:48.260
Which I'm not or I've been accused of being against sunscreen. I wear mineral based sunscreen on my face

51:48.980 --> 51:51.860
I don't want to get skin cancer or I use a physical barrier

51:52.340 --> 51:55.780
There is a cohort of people out there that think that all sunscreens are bad. I'm not one of them

51:55.780 --> 51:57.780
I'm not what's called a sunscreen truther

51:57.780 --> 52:02.820
But then you get attacked for like if you so we're talking about there are certain sunscreens that are problematic

52:03.380 --> 52:09.300
So what and ronda patricks now starting to get vocal about this and so there are certain topics. It's interesting for which

52:10.260 --> 52:12.260
You have to listen

52:13.060 --> 52:14.660
carefully to

52:14.660 --> 52:21.380
What somebody is saying, but there's a lump or or lumping as opposed to splitting of of what health educators say

52:21.860 --> 52:27.780
And so it just seems like like with politics. There's this like urgency to just put people into a camp of

52:29.060 --> 52:35.460
Expert versus like renegade or something and it's not like that. It's just not like that. So the short answer is I really strive

52:36.100 --> 52:40.900
Really strive to get things right, but I know that I'm going to piss certain people off and you've taught me

52:42.180 --> 52:43.460
and

52:43.460 --> 52:45.460
joe's taught me and

52:45.860 --> 52:49.940
Other podcasters have taught me that like if you worry too much about it

52:51.220 --> 52:54.900
Um, then you aren't going to get the newest information out there like peptides

52:54.900 --> 52:58.820
There's very little human data unless you're talking about by lisi or the melana

52:59.140 --> 53:01.540
You know the stuff in the alpha melana site stimulating hormone stuff

53:01.540 --> 53:05.060
which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or

53:05.780 --> 53:11.140
Um, sermorellen which is for certain growth hormone deficiencies with with rare exception. There's very little human data

53:12.100 --> 53:15.060
But people are still super interested and a lot of people are taking and doing these things

53:15.060 --> 53:17.620
So you you want to get the information out do you try to

53:18.900 --> 53:22.820
Not just look at the science but research what the communities are talking with the various communities

53:22.820 --> 53:28.340
They're talking about like maybe research what the conspiracy theorists are talking about just so you know

53:29.300 --> 53:33.540
All the armies that are going to be attacking your castle

53:33.940 --> 53:35.140
Yes, so like for instance

53:35.140 --> 53:40.820
There's a community of people online that believe that like if you consume seed oils or something that like

53:41.380 --> 53:45.380
You're setting up your skin for sunburn and if you don't you know, like there's all these like

53:46.020 --> 53:49.780
Theories, but I liked so I like to know what the theories are. I like to know what the extremes are

53:50.420 --> 53:57.700
But I also like to know what the standard conversation is, but there's generally more agreement than disagreement. I think where um

53:59.300 --> 54:03.300
You know, I've been kind of bullish actually is you know, or like supplements like people go

54:03.300 --> 54:06.340
Oh supplements. Well, there's food supplements like a protein powder

54:06.500 --> 54:09.540
Just different than a vitamin and then they are compounds

54:09.620 --> 54:11.620
There are compounds that have real benefit

54:11.780 --> 54:14.740
But people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated

54:15.220 --> 54:22.020
But some of them are are vetted with for potency and for um safety with with more rigor than others

54:22.500 --> 54:24.900
You know, and it's interesting to see

54:25.860 --> 54:27.300
How

54:27.300 --> 54:29.300
people who take care of themselves

54:30.340 --> 54:34.100
And put a lot of work into that are often attacked that's been interesting

54:34.180 --> 54:41.620
Also, one of the most controversial topics nowadays is ozampic munjaro. I'm very middle of the road on this. I don't understand why the

54:42.740 --> 54:46.020
Quote-unquote health wellness community is so against these things

54:46.020 --> 54:50.180
I also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route for some people

54:50.180 --> 54:55.620
They've really helped them lose weight and yes, there can be some muscle loss and other lean lean body loss

54:56.020 --> 54:59.220
But that can be offset with resistance training. They've helped a lot of people

54:59.700 --> 55:02.260
And other people are like, no, this stuff is terrible

55:02.260 --> 55:06.260
I think the most interesting thing about ozampic munjaro is that they are glp one

55:06.340 --> 55:08.820
They're in the glp one pathway glucagon like peptide one

55:09.460 --> 55:13.780
and it was discovered in healer monsters, which is a

55:14.420 --> 55:15.540
uh

55:15.540 --> 55:20.260
Lizard basically and someone what the now the now the entomologists will dive on me

55:20.660 --> 55:23.540
It's a big big lizard looking thing that doesn't eat very often

55:23.940 --> 55:26.820
And they figured out that there's this peptide that allows it to

55:27.700 --> 55:29.700
curb its own appetite

55:30.180 --> 55:32.180
At the level of the brain and the gut

55:32.180 --> 55:36.180
And it has a lot of homology to sequence homology to what we now call glp one

55:36.500 --> 55:41.860
So I love anytime there's animal biology links to cool human biology links to a drug

55:41.860 --> 55:47.540
That's powerful that can help people with obesity and type 2 diabetes and there's evidence that can even curb some addictions

55:48.180 --> 55:49.300
um

55:49.300 --> 55:50.820
Those are newer data

55:50.820 --> 55:56.260
But I don't see is it either or in fact, I've been a little bit disappointed at the way that the um

55:56.340 --> 56:00.580
Whatever you want to call it health wellness biohacking community has like slammed on ozampic munjaro

56:00.580 --> 56:02.900
It's like they're like just get out and run and listen

56:03.060 --> 56:07.300
There are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them

56:07.380 --> 56:12.180
They get on these drugs and they can improve and then hopefully they're also doing resistance training and eating better

56:12.180 --> 56:14.180
And then you know, you're bringing all the elements together

56:14.420 --> 56:18.420
Well, why do you think the criticism has happened? Is it that ozampic became super popular?

56:18.420 --> 56:22.740
So people are misusing it or that kind of thing? No, I think what it is is that people

56:23.620 --> 56:29.700
Think if it's a pharmaceutical, it's bad. Yeah, and then or if it's a supplement

56:29.700 --> 56:35.780
It's bad depending on which camp they're in and and it wouldn't be wonderful to kind of like fill in the gap between this divide, you know

56:36.340 --> 56:39.620
um, what I would like to see in politics and in health is

56:40.100 --> 56:46.500
Um, neither right nor left, but what we can just call a league of reasonable people that looks at things on an issue by issue basis

56:47.300 --> 56:52.660
And fills in the center because I think most people are in that are I don't want to say center in a political way

56:52.660 --> 56:57.540
But I think most people are reasonable. They want to be reasonable, but that's not what sells clicks

56:58.100 --> 57:00.420
That's not what that's not what drives interest

57:00.980 --> 57:05.540
Um, but I'm a very like like I look at issue by issue person by person

57:05.940 --> 57:09.940
I don't like in group out group stuff. I never have I've got friends from all walks of life

57:09.940 --> 57:14.420
I said this another podcast and it always sounds like a like a political statement, but like the the

57:15.300 --> 57:17.060
push towards like

57:17.060 --> 57:23.380
You know polarization is it's so frustrating if there's one thing that's discouraging to me as I get older each year

57:23.940 --> 57:26.180
I'm like, wow, are we ever going to get out of this?

57:26.660 --> 57:27.460
like

57:27.460 --> 57:29.220
polarization

57:29.220 --> 57:31.300
Speaking of which, how are you going to vote for the presidential election?

57:33.220 --> 57:40.100
I'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people involved and do it. Well, what do you think the role of podcast is going to be in this

57:40.420 --> 57:41.940
year's election

57:41.940 --> 57:43.460
I would love

57:43.460 --> 57:45.460
a long-form conversations to happen with

57:46.980 --> 57:51.540
With the candidates. I think it's going to be huge. I would love trump to go on rogan

57:52.420 --> 57:55.300
I would I'm embarrassed to say this, but I would love to

57:56.260 --> 57:59.780
Honestly, we'd love to see Joe Biden go on Joe Rogan also

57:59.940 --> 58:05.540
I would imagine that both would go on but separately separately. I think it's I think a debate

58:06.500 --> 58:10.900
Joe does debates, but I think Joe at his best is one-on-one conversation really intimate

58:11.780 --> 58:18.100
Um, I I just wish that Joe Biden would actually do long-form conversations. I thought he had done it

58:18.260 --> 58:20.260
It wasn't me. I think it was on

58:20.340 --> 58:24.740
Jay Shetty's podcast. He did Jay Shetty. He did he did a few but what I mean long form. I mean

58:26.020 --> 58:29.460
Um, really long form like two three hours and more relaxed

58:29.460 --> 58:34.100
It was much more orchestrated because what happens when it's the interviews a little bit too short

58:34.820 --> 58:36.820
It becomes into this generic

58:38.340 --> 58:40.340
Political type of

58:40.420 --> 58:45.460
NBC cnn type of interview you get a set of questions and you don't get to really

58:46.100 --> 58:47.700
Feel the human

58:47.700 --> 58:53.380
Expose the human to the light in it the full we talked about the shadow the good the bad and the ugly

58:53.460 --> 58:56.740
So I think there's something magical about two three four hours

58:57.940 --> 59:01.860
But it doesn't have to be that long, but it has to have that feeling to it

59:02.420 --> 59:07.220
Where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous and you're going to be

59:07.860 --> 59:09.060
Uh

59:09.060 --> 59:12.980
Strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel but just shooting shit

59:13.060 --> 59:19.700
Which Rogan is the best by far in the world at that. I don't think people really appreciate

59:21.060 --> 59:22.580
how

59:22.580 --> 59:23.940
skilled

59:23.940 --> 59:25.220
he is

59:25.220 --> 59:27.060
at what he does

59:27.060 --> 59:31.860
And the number I mean the three or four podcasts per week plus plus the ufc announcement saying plus

59:32.580 --> 59:34.580
comedy tours and stadiums plus

59:35.860 --> 59:36.900
you know

59:36.900 --> 59:39.380
doing comedy shows in the the middle of the week plus

59:40.180 --> 59:42.260
You know husband and a father and a friend and

59:42.820 --> 59:45.620
Jiu-Jitsu the guys got like superhuman levels of output

59:46.180 --> 59:50.340
I I agree that long-form conversation is a whole other business

59:50.660 --> 59:54.260
And I think that people want and deserve to know the people that are

59:55.140 --> 59:59.380
Running for office at a in a different way and to really get to know them

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.140
Well, listen, you know, I I guess you

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.140
I mean, is it clear that he's going to do jail time or maybe he gets away?

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:12.180
No, I don't think I'm because I was gonna say I mean that does that mean you're gonna be podcasting from imprisonment

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.260
Yeah, we're going to back down going to

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:21.140
Figure out how to commit a crime so I can get in prison. Please don't please though. Well, that's I'm sure they have visitors

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:25.780
Right. That just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview. But yeah, I understand

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.580
You wouldn't be able to wear that suit. You'd be wearing a different suit. That's true. Yeah

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.540
Um, it's gonna be interesting and and you do I'm not just saying this because you're my friend

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:42.900
But you would do a marvelous job. I think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and um and see what

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.820
What happens?

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.820
Here's one thing that I found really interesting

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.460
In this whole political landscape

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.820
When I'm in Los Angeles, I often get invited to these like

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.340
They're not dinners, but gatherings where you know a local

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.700
Um, you know, a bunch of podcasters will come together

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.380
But a lot of people from the entertainment industry big agencies

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.380
Big tech like big big tech many of the people have been on this podcast

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.140
and

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:14.980
They'll host a discussion or debate and what you find if you look around the room and you talk to people is that

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.460
About half the people in the room

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:22.820
Are very left leaning and very outspoken about that and they'll tell you exactly who they want to see in the

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.620
When the presidential race and the other half

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.700
We'll tell you that they're for the other side a lot of people that

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.060
People assume are on one side of the aisle or the other

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:40.340
Are in the exact opposite side now some people are very open about who that who they're for but

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.820
it's been very interesting to see how

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.140
Um when you get people one on one

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:50.180
They're like telling you they want x candidate to win or y candidate to win and sometimes like really?

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:56.740
I can't believe it like you like yep, and so it's what people think about

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.620
um

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.620
People's political lean is as often

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.260
Exactly wrong and and that's been

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.180
eye-opening for me

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.980
And I've seen that um in university campuses too

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:15.300
And and so it's going to be really really interesting to see what happens in in november in addition to that as you said

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.540
Most people are close to the center

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.540
Despite what twitter makes it seem like

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.380
Most people whether they're sent a lot to center right they're kind of close to the center

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.460
Yeah, I mean here's to me the most interesting question who is going to be the next

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.580
big candidate in years to come

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.300
Like who's that going to be right now? I don't I don't

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:39.860
I don't see or know of that person. Who's it going to be? Yeah, the young promising candidates. We're not seeing them

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.300
We're not seeing like who another way to ask that question

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.620
Who would want to be?

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.060
Well, that's the issue right?

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.900
You know it who wants to live in this 12 hour news cycle where you're just trying to

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:56.740
You know dunk on the other team so that nobody notices like that you're the shit that you fucked up

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:02.580
You know like that that's not like that's not only not fun or interesting. It also is just like

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.300
it's got to be psychosis inducing at some point and

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.100
I think that

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.140
You know god willing we're gonna you know

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.380
some young

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.500
guy or woman is like on this and refuses to

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.060
to back down

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.260
And was just like determined to be president and will make it happen

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.660
But like I don't even know who the

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.020
Bible candidates are

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.020
Maybe you lex, you know, we should ask sagar sagar would know

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.340
Yeah, yeah

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.340
Maybe sagar himself

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:42.420
Sagar's show is awesome. Yeah, he and crystal do a great thing. He's incredible

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.420
Especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on things. Yeah, that's what makes it so cool. He's great

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.580
He looks great in a suit looks real sexy. He's taking real good care of himself. I think he's getting married soon

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:57.620
Congratulations sagar forgive me for not remembering your wife a future wife's name. He uh, he won my heart by giving me

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:03.860
A biography of hitler as a president. That's what he gave you. Yeah, I gave you a hatchet

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.780
With a poem and that just shows the fundamental difference with a poem inscribed in it

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.900
Which was pretty damn good

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.580
I realized everything we bring up on the screen is like really

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.260
Depressing like the soccer player getting killed

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:26.180
Can we bring up something happy? Uh, sure. Let's go to uh nature's metal instagram

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:32.980
Those are pretty intense. We actually did a collaborative post on a on a shark thing. Really? Yeah, what kind of shark thing?

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:38.100
so to generate the fear vr stimulus for my lab in 20

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.340
Was it yet 2016 we went down to guadalupe island off the coast of mexico

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.980
Me and a guy named michael muller who's a very famous

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.940
portrait photographer, but also takes photos of sharks and

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.580
we

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.700
used

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.860
360 video to build vr of great white sharks brought it back to the lab

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.340
We published that study in current biology

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.900
in 2017 went back down there

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.220
um

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.420
and

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.260
That was the year that

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.260
I exited the cage

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.740
That you lower the cage with a crane and that year I exited the cage

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:19.220
I had a whole mess with a air failure the day before I was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.220
I had no scuba on divers were out

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:26.420
The thing got bow constricted up and I had an air failure and I had to actually share air and it was a whole mess

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.860
Story for another time

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.660
But the next day because I didn't want to get ptsd and it was pretty scary the next day I cage exited

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.260
Um with some other divers and it turns out with these great white sharks

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.940
In guadalupe the the water's very clear and you can swim toward them

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.700
And then they'll they'll veer off you if you swim toward them. Otherwise, they see you as prey

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:49.060
Well in the evening you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.700
and we

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:57.140
We're hanging out fishing for a tuna. Uh, we had a one of the the crew on board had

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.820
um

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.940
A line in the water was fishing for tuna for dinner and a shark took the tuna off the line

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:10.020
And it's a it's a very dramatic take and you can see the the just absolute

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:14.420
Size of these great white sharks the the waters there are filled with them. That's the one

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:20.420
But so this video just the neural link link was shot by matt mcdougall

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.500
Who is the um head neurosurgeon at neural link there it is takes it now

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:29.220
Believe it or not looks like it missed like it didn't get the fish it actually just cut that thing like a band saw

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.860
So i'm up on the deck with matt

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.660
Yeah, and so when you look at it from the side you you really get a sense of this

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.860
Of the the girth of this freaking thing

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.740
So as it comes up

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.860
Size of that thing and they move through the water with such speed just a couple

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.140
So when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered down below the surface

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.380
There they're going around you're not allowed to chum the water there. Some people do it

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:56.820
um

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.860
But and then when you cage eggs sit they're like, well, what are you doing out here?

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.980
And then you know they you swim toward them they veer off

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.980
But what's interesting is that if you look at how they move through the water

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.020
All it takes for one of these great white sharks when it sees

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.620
A tuna or something it wants to eat is like two flicks of the tail

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:19.140
And it becomes like a missile. It's just unbelievable economy of effort

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:25.860
And ocean ramsey who is in my opinion the greatest of all cage exit shark divers this woman who dealt with

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.340
enormous great white sharks

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:33.300
She really understands their behavior when they're aggressive when they're not going to be aggressive. She and her husband Juan

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:37.860
I believe his name is do they understand how the tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks?

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.700
We were down there basically

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.420
Like not understanding any of this we never should have been there and actually the air failure of the day before

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.900
Plus cage eggs in the next day

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:51.380
I told myself after coming up from the cage exit. That's it. I'm no longer taking risks with my life

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.540
I want to live got back across the border

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.020
Um a couple days later and I was like, that's it. I don't take risks with my life any longer

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.700
But yeah, mcdougal not mcdougal shot that video and then it went

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.860
quote-unquote viral

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.180
through uh, nature is metal we passed them that video actually, uh

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.340
I saw a video

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:14.500
Where an instructor was explaining how to behave with a shark in the water

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.020
And that you don't want to be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:23.620
And then you want to be acting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it right towards them and they'll bank off

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.700
Now if you don't see them they're ambush predators

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:30.100
You know, you're swimming in the surface and apparently if they get close you should just like guide them away by

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.700
Like grabbing them and moving some people will actually roll them

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.140
Um, but if they're coming in full speedy, you're not going to roll the shark

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:43.700
But here we are back to dark stuff again. I like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.780
Um, you know, northern california. There were a couple actually a guy's head got taken off

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:52.740
Um, he was swimming north of san francisco. There's been a couple of northern, uh, california

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.140
That was really tragic, but most of them are in florida in australia florida

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:02.820
The surfrider foundation shark attack map. There it is. Yeah, they have a great map. There you go

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.980
So they look like they have all the scars on them. So if you if you zoom in on

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.340
I mean, look at this if you go to the north america

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.380
Um, look at skulls. There's there's a yeah where they're where they're deadly attacks

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:20.420
Um, but in yeah, northern california. Sadly, this is really tragic if you zoom in on this one

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.140
Um, I read about this

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:25.620
This guy if you can click the link

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:32.020
50-year-old male he was in chest high water. This is just tragic. I feel so sad for him and his family

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.660
you know, he's just um

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:37.060
Three members of the party chose to go in he was you know

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:42.180
Nine gai was in his chest high water 25 to 50 yards from shore

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.020
Great breached water seized his head and that was it, you know, so it does happen. It's very infrequent

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.780
um

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:56.340
If you don't go in the ocean, it's a very very very low probability. Um, but but if it doesn't happen

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.540
Six times in a row

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:05.460
120 chance. Yeah, who do you think wins a saltwater crocodile or a shark? Okay?

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:11.220
I do not like saltwater crocodiles. They scare me to no end moller michael moller who dove all over the world

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.060
He sent me a picture of him

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.060
diving uh with

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:21.540
Salty saltwater crocs in cuba. It was a smaller one. But goodness christ. Have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs?

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:26.580
Yeah, um, I'm thinking that I'm thinking the the sharks are so agile. They're amazing

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.380
They've head cammed one or body cammed one

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.100
moving through the kelp bed

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:38.100
And you look and it's just they're so agile moving through the water and and it's looking up at the surface like the camera's

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.100
Looking at the surface and you just realize if you're out there, um, you're not

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:49.300
In your swimming and you get hit by a by a shark you're not gonna talk shit and say that a salty has way

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.260
more bite force, but according to the internet

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:56.180
Recently data indicates that the shark has a stronger bite

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:02.660
So I was I was assuming that a crocodile would have a a stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.580
But apparently a shark

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:09.300
Yeah, and turning one of those big salties this is probably not that you know turning around

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.140
It's like a battleship. I mean those sharks are unbelievable. They hit from all sorts. Oh, and they

01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.220
They do this thing

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:20.500
We saw this you're out of the cage or in the cage and you and you'll look at one and you'll see its eye kind of like

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:22.580
Looking at you. They can't really fove it

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:27.940
But they'll look at you and you're tracking it and then you'll look down and you'll realize that one's coming at you

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.180
They're they're they're ambush prayers. They're working together

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.220
They're fascinating. I like I like how you know

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.020
That they can't fovee

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.980
You're already considering the vision system there. Yeah, it's a very permanent eyes on the very primitive eyes on the side of the head

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.980
Their vision is decent enough. They're mostly obviously sensing things with their

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.020
Electro sensing in the water, but also

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.060
Oh faction

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.060
Yeah, I spend far too much time

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:58.020
Thinking about and learning about the the visual systems of different animals if you get me going on this like we'll be here all night

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.780
See, this is what I have this my blood out too. I saw this in a store and I got it

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.820
Because this is from a shark

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:10.100
Goodness. Yeah, I can't say I ever saw one of teeth this big, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.060
Yeah, it's probably you know

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.580
Probably your blood pressure just goes and you you don't feel feel a thing. Yeah

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.620
Before we went down for the cage exit a guy in our crew

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.260
pat dosos

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.500
Very experienced diver

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.740
asked one of the south african divers that

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.620
So, you know, like what's the contingency plan if like somebody catches a bite and they were like

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.580
He was like every man for himself and they're like basically saying like if somebody catches a bite like that's it

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.660
Yeah, you know

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.660
Anyway, I thought we were gonna bring up something happy

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:48.500
Oh, that is happy. Well, we nature is beautiful. Yeah, what nature is beautiful. Uh, we lived

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:54.900
But you know that there are there are happy things you brought up nature is metal. This is this is the difference between

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.740
russian

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.580
Yeah, americans and americans is like maybe there's actually a good time to bring up

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.620
Your ayahuasca journey. I've never done ayahuasca

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.300
But i'm curious about it. I'm also curious about

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.940
ibogaine iboga

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.500
But you told me that you did ayahuasca and

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.580
That for you, it wasn't the dark scary ride that it is for everybody else. Yeah, it was an incredible experience for me

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:28.180
I did it twice actually and have you done high dose psilocybin? Never. No, I just did small dose psilocybin a couple times

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.260
So I was you know nervous about it. I was very yeah, I understand myself

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:36.820
I've done high dose psilocybin. It's terrifying, but I've always gotten something very useful out of it

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:42.980
So, I mean I was nervous about like whatever demons might hide in the shadow in the yungi in the shadow

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.460
like I was I was nervous

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:50.020
But I think it turns out. I don't know what the lesson is to draw from that but my experience

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.180
Be boys russian

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:55.860
It must it must be the russian thing. I mean, there's also something to the jungle

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.820
There it strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:05.860
I I forgot the outside civilization exists. I forgot time because like

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.660
When you don't have your phone

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:14.180
You don't have meetings or calls or whatever you you lose the sense of time the sun comes up the sun comes down

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:19.220
That's the the fundamental biological timer. You know every mammalian species

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.460
has a short wavelength. So you think like blue uv type but like

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.900
Absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone and the and it does this interesting

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:35.300
Subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky, you've got short wavelength and long wavelength light

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.660
Like when you look at a sunrise, it's got blues and yellows orange and yellows

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:42.260
You look in the evening reds orange and and blues and in the middle of the day

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:47.220
It's like full spectrum light now. It's always full spectrum light but because of some atmospheric

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.660
Elements and because of the low solar angle you like that difference between

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:58.420
The different wavelengths of light is is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your eye pay attention to

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:04.020
And signal to your circadian timekeeping mechanism like we are that the core of our brain and the suprachiasmatic nucleus we are

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:05.700
we are

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.980
like

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.580
Wired to be

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:15.300
Entrained to the rising and setting of the sun like that's the biological timer which makes perfect sense because you know obviously as the planets

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.260
Um as the planets spin and revolve

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:23.940
I also wonder like how that is affected by you know in the rainforest the sun is not visible often

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.260
So you're under the cover of the trees. So maybe that affects

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.180
Well, there are social rhythms

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:36.980
They're feeding rhythms sometimes in in terms of some species will signal the timing of activity of other species and

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.500
um

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.460
But yet getting out from the canopy is is critical

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.740
Of course, even under the canopy during the daytime, there's far more photons than at night

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.820
You know, there's always when i'm telling people to get sunlight in their eyes in the morning and in the evening

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:55.460
People say there's no light no sunlight this time here. I'm like it go outside on a really overcast day

01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:01.220
It's far brighter than it is at night, right? So um, there's still lots of sunlight even if you can't see the sun as an object

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.220
but I I love

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:09.940
Time perception shifts and you mentioned that in the jungle it's linked to the rising and setting of the sun

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.700
You also mentioned that on ayahuasca you zoomed out from from the earth

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:18.660
These are like to me the most interesting aspects of having a human brain as opposed to another brain

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:22.420
Of course, only ever had a human brain, but which is that you can

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.300
consciously set your

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.820
time

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.460
Domain window like you can we can be focused here

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:32.500
We can be focused on all of austin or we can be focused on the entire planet

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.900
You can make those choices consciously

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:41.460
But in the time domain it's it's hard like different activities bring us into fine slicing a more or more broad binning of time

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.620
depending on what we're doing

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:47.380
programming or exercising or researching or podcasting but

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.860
um, just how unbelievably

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.740
um fluid the human brain is in terms of its

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.900
The aperture of of the time space window of our cognition and of our experience

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:02.020
And I I feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:08.740
Tools that we have access to that we don't really leverage as much as we should which is when things are really hard

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.180
you

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:15.460
Need to zoom out and see it as one element within your whole lifespan and that there's more to come

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.940
um

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:23.220
You know, I mean people commit suicide because they can't see beyond the time domain they're in or they think it's going to go on forever

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:31.060
Um, when we're happy we rarely think this is going to last forever, but uh, which is interesting contrast in its own right

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.140
but I think that

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.820
Psychedelics while I have very little experience with them

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.860
I have saw them and it sounds like they're just a very interesting

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.820
Window into the the different apertures

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.100
Well, how to surf that wave is probably a skill

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:51.380
One of the things I was prepared for and I think it's important is not to resist

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.780
I think

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:57.940
I understand what it means to resist the thing a powerful wave and it's not going to be good

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:03.940
So you have to be able to surf it so I was ready for that to relax through it. Maybe because I'm quite good at that

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.580
from

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.460
knowing how to relax and all kinds of disciplines

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.180
playing piano and uh

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:17.540
Guitar when I was super young and then through jiu-jitsu knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:24.980
Should be able to relax the body fully just accept whatever happens to you that process is probably why it was a very positive experience for me

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:29.140
Do you have any interest in iboga? I'm very interested in ibogaine iboga

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.420
There's a colleague of mine and researcher at Stanford Nolan Williams

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:36.260
Who's been doing some transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people who have

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.060
taken the ibogaine ibogaine

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.900
um

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:47.860
As I understand it gives a 22 hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open, but you close your eyes and you get a

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:52.500
um a very high resolution image of actual events that happened in your life

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.940
But then you have agency within those movies. I think you have to be

01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.180
Of healthy heart to be able to do it. I think you have to be on a heart rate monitor. It's not trivial

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.180
It's not like these other psychedelics

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.980
But there's a wonderful group

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:07.940
called veteran solutions

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.700
um that

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.140
has used iboga combined with some other psychedelics

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.700
um in the veterans community to

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.940
to great success for things like PTSD and

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:26.020
It's a group. I've really tried to support in in any way that I can mainly by being vocal about the great work they're doing

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:30.500
but um, you hear incredible stories of people who are just like

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:37.060
Like near cratered in their life or zombied by PTSD and other things post war

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.380
um get back a lightness or achieve a lightness and a clarity

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:47.220
Um that they didn't feel they had so I'm very curious about these compounds. Um, the state of Kentucky

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:50.740
We should check this but um, I believe it's taken money from the

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:58.500
Opioid crisis settlement for ibogaine research. I mean, so this is like no longer. Yes. If you look here, let's see

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.620
Did they do it? Oh, no. No. Oh, no

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:06.180
They backed away Kentucky backs away from the plan to fund opio treatment research

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.180
They were going to use the money

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:15.300
To treat opio. Now officials are backing off 50 billion. What is on its way over the coming years 50 billion dollars

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.220
50 billion dollars is on its way to state and local government over the coming years

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:25.700
The pool of funding comes from multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.860
Painkillers, Kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:33.700
So they were going to do psychedelic research with ibogaine

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.860
Supporting research on illegal illegal folks

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.220
Psychedelic drug called ibogaine. Well, I guess they backed away from it. Well

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:45.220
Sooner or later, we'll get some happy news up on the

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.180
Internet during this episode

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:52.580
Talk about the the the shark and the crocodile fighting. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.380
And you survived the jungle. Well, that's the the thing

01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:00.020
I was I was I was writing to you on what's that multiple times because I was going to put on the internet

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:03.300
Are you okay? And if you're like alive and then I was going to just like put it to twitter

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:08.580
Just like he's alive, but then of course you're far too classy for that. So you just came back alive

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:12.580
Well jungle or not

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.060
One of the lessons is also, you know, when you hear the call for adventure

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:24.260
Just fucking do it. I was gonna ask you it's kind of silly question, but like give me a

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.060
Small fraction of things on your bucket list

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.100
Bucket list. Yeah

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.060
Go to mars

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.060
Yeah, what's what's the status of that?

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:40.580
I don't know. I'm being patient about the whole thing red planet ran that cartoon of you guys

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:46.260
Going to my that was pretty funny. That's true. That was pretty funny. One where Goggins is already up there. Yeah

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.420
That's a great. That's a funny one

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.820
Probably also true. Uh, I would love I would love to die in mars

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.220
But I just love humanity reaching onto the stars and doing this

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.180
Bold adventure and taking big risks and exploring. I love exploration

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:09.300
What about seeing different animal species? I'm a huge fan of this guy Joel Sartori

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:15.220
Um, where he he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of all these different animals

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.900
If people aren't already following him on instagram. He's doing some really important work

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.980
um

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.500
this guy's

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.500
instagram is

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:29.300
Amazing like portraits. Well, look at it. Look at these portraits the amount of um,

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:35.220
I must say personality because we don't want to project anything onto them. But yeah, the the like the eyes

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:40.740
And he'll occasionally put him a movie. No, there's a little owl. I delight in things like this

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:45.860
I've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.900
And now dogs or all kinds of all animals

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:51.380
um, and I'm very interested

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.180
in um

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:58.180
Kids content that that incorporates animals. We have some things brewing there

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:00.340
Like I could look at this kind of stuff all day long

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:05.300
Look at that bat like bats people think about bats is kind of like little flickering a little annoying disease carrying things

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.300
But look how beautiful that little sucker is

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.100
How's your uh podcast with the cookie monster coming?

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.940
Oh, yeah, we've been in discussions with cookie the um

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:22.180
It's uh, can't say too much about that. But um, cookie monster embodies dopamine, right? Cookie monster wants cookie

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:26.100
Right wants cookie right now, you know, like it was that it was that one tweet cookie monster

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.180
I bounce because cookies come from all directions

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:35.140
You know, it's like it's just embodying the the desire for for something and and which is an incredible aspect of ourselves

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.540
The other one is you remember a little while ago

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.260
Elmo put out a tweet

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.380
Hey, how's everyone doing out there and it went viral

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:47.620
And you know the surgeon general of the united states have been talking about the loneliness crisis

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:53.060
He came on the podcast and you know a lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness mental health issues with loneliness

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.140
Elmo puts out a tweet. Hey, how's everyone doing out there? And

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.860
Everyone gravitates toward it, you know

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:06.180
So that the different sesame street characters really embody the different that kind of aspects of self through very like narrow

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.660
Neural circuit perspective

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:13.860
You know snuffle off against the shy and um oscar the grouch it's grouchy, right and the count

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:20.420
Won a tool the archetypes of yeah, the archetypes is very young in once again. Yeah, and I think that um

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.780
You know the creators of sesame street clearly either understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:31.220
So yeah, there are some things brewing on on uh conversations with sesame street characters

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.780
It's not I know you'd like to talk to vladimir putin. I'd like to talk to cookie monster

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:42.580
It illustrates the differences in our like a sophistication or something. Well, that's illustrates a lot. Yeah

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.740
But yeah, I also I love animation

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:52.500
So I'm not anime. That's not my thing but animation. So I'm very interested in the use of animation to get

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.940
Uh science content across so there are a bunch of things brewing

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.260
but um, but anyway, I delight in

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:04.340
Sartori's work and and and it's there's a conservation aspect to it as well. But I think that um

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:09.780
Mostly want to thank you for finally putting up something that like where something is not being killed or like let some sad

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:15.780
Sad outcome. Well, these are all really positive. They're really cool. They're really cool and every once in a while look at look at that

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.340
mountain line

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:22.420
But I also like to look at these and and some of them remind me of certain people

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:27.380
Right, so let's just scroll through like for instance. I think when we don't try and process it too much

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:32.020
So like like okay, look at this cat this is amazing

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.020
Like I feel like that somebody I feel like this is like a like someone I met once

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.700
as a curiosity and curiosity and a playfulness

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.700
um carnivore

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.700
Carnivore frontalized eyes

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:48.340
Found in forces the area right so then you go down, you know, it's like

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.620
This beautiful fish neon pink

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:58.820
Right, so it reminds you of some of the like the influencers you see on instagram, right? Except this one's natural. Just kidding. Um

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.900
Uh, let's see no filter. Um filter. Yeah

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.660
um

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.660
Let's see like I feel like

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:10.580
Bears I'm a big fan of bears. Yeah bears are beautiful. This one kind of reminds me of you a little bit

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:13.140
There's like a stoic nature to it a curiosity

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:17.940
So you can kind of feel like the essence of animals. You don't even have to do psychedelics to get there

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:21.540
Oh, look at that. He's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually yeah

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500
and then there's um

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:27.300
Wow, yeah

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.900
Yeah, the in the jungle the diversity of life was also stark

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.660
From a scientific perspective just the the fact that most of those species are not identified was fascinating

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:41.300
Right. It was like a little every little every little insect is a kind of discovery

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.340
Right. I mean one of the reasons I love new york city so much

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:50.020
Just by its problems at times is that um everywhere you look there's life

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.900
It's like a tropical reef if you've ever done scuba diving or snorkeling you look on a tropical reef and it's like

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:58.340
There's some little crab working on something and like everywhere you look there's life

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.860
You know the bay area if you go scuba diving or snorkeling it's like a kelp bed

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:06.100
You know the bay area is like a kelp bed every once in a while some big fish goes by it's like a big IPO

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.820
But like most of the time not a whole lot happens

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.980
Actually, the bay area it's interesting as I've been going back there more and more recently

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.500
um

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:20.180
There are really cool little subcultures starting to pop up again. Nice. Um

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:25.620
There's incredible skateboarding the gx-1000 guys are these guys that that bomb down hills

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:26.900
They're in

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:30.740
Nuts like they're just going like that's just speed not tricks

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.180
You gotta see gx-1000 these guys going down hills in san francisco

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:40.340
They are wild and occasionally unfortunately occasionally someone will get hit by a car, but gx-1000

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.940
Look into intersections. They have spotters. You can see someone there

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:46.900
Um, oh, I see there's uh

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:53.220
Into traffic. Yeah into traffic. So in san francisco. Yeah, this is crazy. Like this is unbelievable and

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.460
um, and they're

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.460
They're just wild

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.460
But in any case

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:04.100
What's on your bucket list that you haven't done? Well, I'm working on a book. So I'm actually going to

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:08.260
Head to a cabin for a couple weeks and right which I've never done

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.980
People talk about doing this, but I'm gonna do that

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:17.380
That's I'm excited for that just the mental space of really dropping into writing like jack dickelson in the shining cabin

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.860
Let's hope not. Okay. Let's hope not, you know before

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.260
I mean only started doing public facing anything for posting on instagram in 2019

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:28.500
But I used to head up to walla la on the northern coast of california

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.060
um, sometimes by myself

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:35.540
um to a little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.140
Read and write papers and things like that. I used to do that all the time

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.100
I I I missed that so some of that

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:48.500
Um, I'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in argentina relatives in on the east coast

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:54.260
See my parents more. They're in good health. Thankfully. I want to get married and have a family. That's an important priority

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:59.140
And put a lot of a lot of work in there. Yeah, that's a big one. Yeah. Yeah, I'm putting a lot of work

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.940
Into the the the runway on that

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.500
um, what are advice

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.820
for people about

01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:12.580
That or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world how to find how to build a family

01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:16.580
Get there and and then I'll listen to it someday and see if I hit the marks

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.260
um

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.340
Yeah, but well, obviously pick the right partner

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.540
But also like do the work on yourself. No know yourself

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.820
That the oracle know thyself and I think

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.780
um, listen

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.100
I have a friend. He's a new friend, but he's a friend uh who I met

01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:36.580
for uh a meal

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:39.140
He's a very very well known actor overseas

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:43.780
And his stuff has made it over here and um, we become friends and we went to lunch

01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:48.660
And we were talking about work and being public facing and all this kind of thing and

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.060
And then I said you have kids, right? He says he has four kids. I was like, oh, yeah, you know

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:57.300
I see your posts with the kids. You seem really happy. He said he just looked at me leaned in and he said

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.020
It's the best gift

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.020
you'll ever give yourself

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:07.060
And he also said and pick your partner the mother of your kids

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.220
very carefully

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:16.100
So, you know, that's good advice coming from excellent advice coming from somebody who's, you know, very successful in work and family

01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:20.660
So that's the only thing I can pass along. We hear this from friends for ours as well, but

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:25.460
um kids are amazing and family is amazing and um

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.180
You know, that's the different

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:32.500
People all these people who want to like be immortal and like live to be 200 or something, you know

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:37.140
There's also the the old fashioned way of you know, having children that

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.100
Live on and evolve a new legacy

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:46.100
But they have, you know, half your dna. So that's exciting. Yeah, I think you make an amazing dad. Thank you

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:50.500
It seems like a fun thing and you know, I've also gotten advice from friends who are

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.500
Super high performing and have a lot of kids

01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:57.220
They'll say just don't overthink it

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.300
All right, start having kids

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:02.340
Let's go right. Well the chaos of kids is kind of the like

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:06.260
You can either bury you or it can or it can give you energy

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:12.420
But I grew up in a big pack of boys always doing like wild and crazy things and so that kind of energy is great

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.980
And and if it's not a big pack of wild boys, it's you know

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:20.100
You have daughters and they can be you know, different form of chaos sometimes same form of chaos

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.900
Um, how many kids do you think you want? Hmm?

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.740
You know, it's either two or five

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:32.100
Yeah, very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You know the other yeah

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.820
Um, I mean, I'm very close with my sister

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:39.540
I couldn't imagine having another sibling because it there's so much richness there. We talk almost every day

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.740
Sorry, you know three four times a week, you know

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.180
Sometimes just briefly but we're we're tight, you know, we're

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:48.980
Really look out for one another

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.180
um

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:53.860
She's an amazing person like truly an amazing person and has like

01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:57.060
Raised her daughter in an amazing way. She's like

01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:59.620
You know, my niece is like

01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:03.060
Going to head to college in a year or two and like my sister's done an amazing job

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:07.380
And her dad's done a great job too. They they both really put a lot into

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.060
um

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:13.460
The family aspect and she has to spend time with a really amazing person in the

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:19.620
In peru in the amazon jungle and he is one of 20 kids. Wow. So he's got

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:24.820
It's mostly guys. That's just a lot of brothers and I think two sisters

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:30.100
I just said jonathan height on the podcast the guy who's talking about the anxious generation causing the american mind

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.060
He's great, but he was saying that you know in order to keep kids healthy

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:36.820
They need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're 16

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.700
I've actually been thinking a lot about

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.020
Getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties, you know, everyone talks about this

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:50.260
Not creating a commune or anything like that, but I think I think jonathan's right. We were more or less

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:54.020
Our brain wiring does best when we I'm raised in

01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:58.340
Small village type environments where kids can forage the whole free range kids idea

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:02.980
And I grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt clawed wars and all that stuff

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:07.140
Um, it would be so strange to have a childhood without that

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.420
Yeah, and I think more and more

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:17.380
As we wake up to the negative aspects of the digital interaction will put more and more value to in-person interaction

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.660
So I mean it's cool to see for instance kids in new york city

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.740
I'm just kind of moving around the city with so much sense of agency. It's really really cool

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:26.900
The suburbs like where I grew up

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:32.740
Like as soon as we could get out take the 7f bus up to san francisco and hang out with you know

01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:35.380
Wild ones like you know while there were dangers

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:38.740
I mean we couldn't wait to get out of the suburbs the moment that you know

01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:44.900
Forts and dirt clawed wars and stuff didn't didn't cut it. We just like wanted into the city. So I um bucket list

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:49.700
I will probably move to a major city not los angeles or san francisco

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.620
um

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.620
In the next few years

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.060
new york city

01:33:55.060 --> 01:34:00.980
Potentially there's all such different flavors of experiences. Yeah, so I'd love to live in new york city for a while

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.380
I've always wanted to do that and I and I will do that

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.740
I've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:12.180
Some area so colorado montana are high on my list right now and to be able to

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:16.900
Pivot back and forth between the two would be great just for such different experiences

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.060
I and also I like a very physical life

01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:24.180
So the idea of getting up in the sun with the sun in the montana or colorado type environment

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.100
um

01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:29.860
And I've been doing some putting some effort towards finding a spot

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.900
Um for that and new york city to me

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:37.060
I know it's got its issues and people say it wasn't what it was. Okay. I get it but listen

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:39.940
I've never lived there. So for me would be entirely new and um

01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.180
You know

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.020
Schultz seems full of life

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:47.620
There is an energy to that city and he represents that I mean there's yeah

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.140
And and the full diversity of weird that is

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.420
represented in new york city is great. Yeah, you walk down this tree

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:57.620
There's like a person with like a cat on their head and no one gives a shit. Yeah, that's great

01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:01.220
All right, San Francisco used to be like that the joke was like

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.540
You have to be naked and on the fire and San Francisco before someone takes it but now it's changed

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:11.940
But again, it recently I've noticed that San Francisco. It's not just about the skateboarders. It's there's um some community

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:15.780
Houses of people in tech that are super interesting. There's some community housing

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.340
of people not in tech

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:25.300
That I've learned about him and um known people have lived there and and it's it's cool like there's stuff happening

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:31.700
Um in these cities that's new and different. I mean, that's what youth is for they're supposed to evolve evolve things out

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.340
uh

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.380
So amidst all that you still have to get shit done. I've been really

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:40.020
obsessed with tracking time recently

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:44.900
Like making sure I have daily activities of habits that I'm maintaining

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.860
and I'm very

01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:54.020
Religious about making sure I get shit done. Do you use an app or something like that? No, just google sheets

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:58.180
So basically a spreadsheet and I'm tracking daily and I write scripts that

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.100
That uh, whenever I achieve a goal it glows green

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:09.540
Yeah, do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too? No, just the fact that I got the workout done

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:14.100
Yeah, so I just it's a checkmark thing. So I I'm really really big

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:19.860
On making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. I have a rule for myself that I

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.500
Do a set of tasks, uh for at least five minutes every day

01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:30.660
And it turns out that many of them I do way longer, but just even just doing it

01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:34.020
I have to do it every day and there's currently

01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.420
11 of them

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.140
It's just a thing like one of them is playing guitar, for example

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:45.220
So do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do uh, like daily habits? Yeah, I do my um

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.060
I wake up if I don't feel I slept enough

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.060
I do this non-sleep-deep-rest yoga nidra thing that I've talked about a bunch

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.500
We actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on spotify

01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:57.700
um

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:02.980
10 minute 20 minute ones puts me back into a state that feels like sleep and I feel very rested

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:07.860
Actually matt walker and I are gonna run a study. He's just submitted the IRB to run a study on nsdr

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:12.260
And what is actually doing to the brain? There's some evidence of increases in dopamine, etc

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:15.380
But those are older studies still cool studies, but um, so I'll do that

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.940
get up hydrate and if I've

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.220
Got my act together. I punched some caffeine down

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.900
Like some matina some coffee maybe another matina and

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:30.580
Resistance train three days a week run three days a week and then take one day off

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:31.860
um

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:35.780
And like to be done by 839 and then I want to get into some real work

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.580
I actually have a sticky note on my computer

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:43.620
It's like just like reminding me how good it feels to accomplish some real work and then I go into it right now

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.380
It's the book writing

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.380
researching a podcast and just

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.380
fight tooth and nail to stay off

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:54.020
Social media text message. What's app youtube all that?

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.540
Get something done. How long can you go? Can you go like?

01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:59.700
three hours

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:05.300
Just deep focus if I hit a groove. Uh, yeah 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:06.980
um

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:12.260
That's tough for me. I start the day actually that's why I'm afraid I'd really prize that

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:17.380
Those morning hours I start with the work. Yeah, and it's it's it's uh

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:22.420
I'm trying to hit the four hour mark of deep focus great

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:27.540
I love it. Then it often can't work. It's important. I'm really really deeply. Yeah

01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:33.300
It's it's often torture actually. It's really really difficult. Oh, yeah the agitation but I've

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:37.860
Sat across the table from you a couple years ago when I was out here in austin doing some work

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:41.940
And I was working on stuff you were and I noticed you're just like stare at your notebook sometimes just like

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.420
pen at the

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:49.780
Same position and then you'll get back into it like there are those won't you're building that hydraulic pressure and then go

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:55.380
Yeah, I try and get something done of value then it the communications start and

01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:03.460
Talking to my podcast producer. My team is everything. I mean like the the magic potion in the podcast is rob more

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.380
right

01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:08.260
Who's in the has been in the room with me every single solo

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:13.460
Costello used to be in there with us because that's it people have asked journalists have asked can they sit in friends have asked

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:14.820
Nope

01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.340
just rob

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:17.300
and

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:21.700
For guests interviews. He's there as well. And I talk to rob all the time

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:25.460
all the time we talk multiple times per day and

01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:27.460
You know in life

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:32.900
I've I've made some errors in certain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that and

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.420
Certainly don't blame all of it on them. But you know, I played my role but but in terms of picking

01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:40.740
business partners

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:43.220
And friends like you know to work with I mean rob

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:49.220
It's just it's been bull's-eyes and it's just rob has been amazing my play back our photographer and the guys I mentioned earlier like

01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:51.140
We just

01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.140
Communicate as much as we need to

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:58.980
And we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we make we put anything out there and

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:03.220
So including like even created decisions of like topics to cover all that

01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:07.140
Yeah, like a photo for the book jacket the other day Mike shoots photos then

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.020
And then we look at them. We pour over them together

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:15.380
Logo for the perform podcast with Andy Gallop and then we're launching like is that the right contour Mike's the real

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:19.380
He's got the aesthetic thing because he was at DC so long as a portrait photographer

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.020
And his cute with close friends with

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.300
Ken block

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:29.140
To Jim conna like all the car jumping in the city stuff like I mean Mike is a master. He's a he's a true master of that stuff

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.540
and um

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:37.220
And we just pour over every little decision, but even which sponsors, you know, there are dozens of ads now

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:41.860
By the way that that whole josser-sizer thing of me saying oh a guy went from a two to a seven

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:43.780
I never said that that's AI

01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:49.540
Like I would never call it number off somebody a two to a seven. Are you kidding me? It's crazy. So it's AI if you bought the thing

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.900
I'm sorry

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:55.700
But like our sponsors we list the sponsors that we have and why on our website and like the decision

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:58.580
Do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product?

01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:03.300
I mean we've we've got ways with sponsors because of like changes in the product or change, you know

01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:06.180
Most time it's amicable all good

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.500
But you know like just every detail and that just takes a ton of time and energy

01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:12.580
but I try and

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.500
Work mostly on content and my team is constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions

01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:24.500
But I because I obsess but um, yeah, you you have to you have to have a team of some sort someone that you can run

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:27.860
Things bot for sure, but one of the challenges the larger the team is

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:34.020
And I I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff including engineering stuff robotics work research

01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:41.220
All of those interactions at least for me take away from the deep work the deep focus

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.700
Unfortunately, I get

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:48.260
Drained by social interaction even with the people I love and really respect and all that kind of stuff

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.620
You're an introvert. Yeah, like fundamentally an introvert. So

01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:55.220
To me it's a trade-off getting shit done versus

01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:00.340
Collaborating and I have to choose wisely because without collaboration without a great team

01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.580
Which I'm fortunate enough to be a part of

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.820
Like you wouldn't get anything really done

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:08.980
But as an individual contributor to get stuff done like to do the hard work of

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:13.700
Researching or programming all that kind of stuff. You need the hours of deep work

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.940
I used to spend a lot more time alone

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.700
That's that's on my bucket list spend a bit more time dropped into work alone

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:22.420
it I think social media like

01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:25.300
It causes our brain to go the other direction

01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:30.180
I try and answer some comments and then and then get back to work. I'm really

01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:33.220
After going to the jungle, I

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.620
appreciate not using the device

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.500
I've played with the idea of

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:43.220
Like spending certainly maybe like one week a month not using social media at all

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:49.220
I used it. So after that morning block, I'll eat some lunch and I'll usually do something while I'm doing lunch or something

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:52.900
And then a bit more work and that real work deep work and then

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:58.180
Around 2 30 I do a non-sleep deep rest to go short nap wake up. Boom

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:01.780
Maybe a little more caffeine and then lean into it

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.900
Again, and then you know if you I find if you really put in the deep work

01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:10.820
Two or three bouts per day by about five or six p.m. It's over

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:15.860
I was down at Jaco's place not that long ago and in the evening did a sauna session with him and

01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:18.660
Some family members of his and some of their friends

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.580
And it's really cool like they all work all day and train all day and then in the evening

01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:26.900
They get together and they they sauna and cold plunge. I'm really into this

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.380
whole thing of

01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:31.220
gathering with other people

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:36.100
At a specific time of day. I have a gym at my house and I you know tim will come over and train or

01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:37.780
you know

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:40.980
That we've kind of slowed that down in recent months, but I think

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:47.140
Gathering in groups once a day being alone for part of the day. It's like very fundamental stuff

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:51.700
We're not saying anything that hasn't been said millions of times before but how often do people actually do that?

01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:56.900
And and and call the party, you know, like be the person to like bring people together if it's not happening

01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:58.500
That's something I've really had to learn

01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:02.020
Even though I'm an introvert like hey, I'm like gather people together

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:05.060
You came through town the other day and there's a lot of people at the house

01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:08.980
Yeah, Brad actually I was playing because I was getting a massage when you walked in

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:11.780
I don't sit around getting massages very often

01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:16.980
But I was getting one that day and then everyone came in and the dog came in like everyone's piled in. It was very sweet

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:21.460
Again, no devices, but choose wisely the people

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.660
You gather with right right and I was clothed

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.980
Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't which is very weird

01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.020
Uh

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:36.900
Yeah, yeah, the the the frenzy surround yourself with that. That's another thing. It's like

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:42.020
I understood that from my Alaska and from just the experience in the jungle is like

01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:44.740
Just select the people

01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:48.100
Just be careful how you allocate your time. I just saw on

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:53.780
Somewhere Conor McGregor has this good line. I wrote it down about loyalty

01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.300
He said don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with

01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:03.860
That guy's I mean, he's being on loyalty all the shit talk all of that set that aside

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:06.500
To me like loyalty is really big

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:11.060
because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them and

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.140
What what else is life about? Yeah, well hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:18.980
and

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.300
um, you know, we're fortunate to have a lot of them

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:27.460
It'll also show you who you know, who really like has put in the time to try and understand you and

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:32.260
And understand people like people are complicated. I love that. So

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.820
Can you read the quote once more?

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:37.940
Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.620
Yeah, so in that way a hardship is a gift

01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:51.780
It shows you definitely and it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:58.660
Let's go get some food. Yeah, you're one meal a day guy. Yeah, I actually ate something earlier

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:03.140
But it was like a protein shake and a couple pieces of bil-tongue. I hope we're eating a steak

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:09.140
I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine. Yeah. What do you think? How you feel? I feel good

01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:12.740
Yeah, I was I was thinking you'd probably like I only did a half a piece

01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:17.220
And I won't have more for a while, but a little too good. Yeah

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:22.260
Thank you for talking once again, brother. Yeah, thanks so much Lex. Um

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:27.380
It's been a great ride this podcast thing and you're the reason I started the podcast you inspired me to do it

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:32.900
You told me to do it. I did it and you've also been an amazing friend. You showed up in some

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:41.940
Some very challenging times and you've shown up for me publicly. You've shown up for me in my home and my life and you know

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:48.340
It's an honor to have you as a friend. Thank you. I love you brother. Love you too

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.620
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman to support this podcast

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:58.980
Please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:03.380
Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life

01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:05.940
And you will call it fate

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:09.700
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
