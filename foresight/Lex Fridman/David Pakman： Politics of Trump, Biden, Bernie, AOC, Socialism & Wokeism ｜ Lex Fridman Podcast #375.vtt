WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
I tweet that and then I finish the day and I wake up the next morning and I glance at my phone.

00:05.680 --> 00:11.840
I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are quote-tweeting it and demanding a retraction

00:11.840 --> 00:15.760
and whatever. And I go, uh-oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention.

00:17.360 --> 00:24.800
I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got a hundred messages

00:25.360 --> 00:31.360
from, you should have aborted your son to, we're gonna find all of you to whatever else.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.760
My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have a hundred DMs

00:36.960 --> 00:43.920
to everything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know,

00:45.760 --> 00:50.400
your Jewish faith, this and that and the other thing. And so at that point to me,

00:50.400 --> 00:54.640
I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.800
And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed,

00:59.360 --> 01:06.400
yes, the attacks escalated. It went through Candace Owens and then at foxnews.com, Newsmax,

01:06.400 --> 01:10.240
kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.520
The following is a conversation with David Pakman, a left-wing progressive political commentator

01:17.520 --> 01:23.600
and host of the David Pakman show. I hope to continue to have many conversations on politics

01:23.600 --> 01:28.880
with prominent, insightful, and sometimes controversial figures across the political

01:28.880 --> 01:34.320
spectrum. David and I have been planning to speak for a long time and I'm sure we'll speak many

01:34.320 --> 01:40.560
more times. This conversation was challenging, eye-opening, and fun. This is the Lex Rudman

01:40.560 --> 01:46.240
podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

01:46.240 --> 01:53.040
here's David Pakman. Are there interesting differences to you between terms like liberal,

01:53.040 --> 01:58.160
Democrat, left-wing, leftist, progressive, socialist, communist, Marxist, far left,

01:58.160 --> 02:02.160
center left, all of these labels? Is there interesting distinctions between them?

02:02.160 --> 02:06.960
Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions. One is if you just want to say let's define each of these

02:06.960 --> 02:12.080
as political terms, they're all different terms. You can be a progressive ideologically, but not

02:12.080 --> 02:16.960
be a member of the Democratic Party. Many say the Democratic Party isn't even really very progressive,

02:16.960 --> 02:22.720
so these are certainly terms that we could define in order to have a conversation about

02:22.720 --> 02:29.120
the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation. Sometimes the terms are used

02:29.840 --> 02:37.440
in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not really linked to policy

02:38.080 --> 02:43.200
or any particular political question, but they can be used positively or negatively to just kind

02:43.200 --> 02:48.880
of say, here's the image of this individual that I have in my mind. So like Marxist is

02:48.880 --> 02:56.320
right now very popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats. There's very

02:56.320 --> 03:01.520
few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of power in the United States, but even among the

03:01.520 --> 03:06.400
general population. So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because

03:06.480 --> 03:11.600
we want to compare and contrast the ideas that a particular group might bring to the discussion,

03:11.600 --> 03:16.160
or are we using them as insults or to stifle conversation? There are terms that can be used to

03:16.160 --> 03:22.080
start conversation or to stop it. And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month.

03:22.720 --> 03:27.440
So the term leftist, I think, is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context

03:27.440 --> 03:38.160
to describe what an outraged left-wing commentator? I think what you're kind of grasping onto is that

03:38.800 --> 03:45.360
there's probably some set of ideas that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on

03:45.360 --> 03:51.040
the left. The discussion of how that term is mostly being used is not about policy ideas. You're

03:51.120 --> 03:58.960
accurately identifying that. And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear

03:58.960 --> 04:03.600
and leftist is being used as a smear more at this point. Okay. But sometimes some of these

04:03.600 --> 04:09.440
terms are useful. Can we try to pick the terms that are useful, like liberal and progressive and

04:09.440 --> 04:16.880
Democrat, liberal and progressive? Is there an interesting, definable distinction between liberal

04:16.880 --> 04:23.280
and progressive to you? That's maybe one of the most interesting ones. 10 years ago, liberal often

04:23.280 --> 04:31.760
meant what now we mean by progressive. More recently, the progressive socialist-leaning

04:32.320 --> 04:39.600
part of the political spectrum has started to use liberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who

04:39.600 --> 04:45.040
is not really left enough. So liberal is very interesting because I remember talking with

04:45.040 --> 04:50.080
my audience years ago, maybe eight years ago or something like that, where I identified I'm going

04:50.080 --> 04:56.160
to now use the term progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs because liberal has now

04:56.160 --> 05:01.680
been made a smear, it's being shifted into something else, and it also means more of like a center left

05:01.680 --> 05:10.160
politics. So it's changed in some sense by necessity, by force, and also because the spectrum has

05:10.160 --> 05:16.880
shifted to some degree. So the term liberal has evolved. Now liberal meaning some kind of

05:17.680 --> 05:23.840
embodiment of the mainstream Democratic party, almost? To some degree. Sometimes I'm called,

05:23.840 --> 05:30.080
I'm written off by, within my space, there are all sorts of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can

05:30.080 --> 05:36.800
talk about, about where I am versus should be, could be, or am wrongly placed. And sometimes

05:37.600 --> 05:44.080
an attack on me is he's just a lib, meaning I'm not left enough. I'm not progressive,

05:44.640 --> 05:49.600
socialist, wherever else you want to go. So yeah, the problem with a lot of these terms and

05:49.600 --> 05:55.280
they're used very casually by people who call into my show is that unless we actually define them

05:55.280 --> 05:59.680
each time, they very often mean very different things to different people and often come with

05:59.680 --> 06:04.640
an agenda attached to them. And so I find that they often stifle meaningful conversation rather

06:04.640 --> 06:12.080
than encourage it. Do you sense that there's a drifting of what is the threshold to be a progressive

06:12.080 --> 06:18.240
or is there, should we use progressive synonymously with Democratic socialist?

06:19.040 --> 06:24.080
I think we should not use it synonymously with Democratic socialist. And this is where there's

06:24.080 --> 06:29.600
another linguistic confusion and a political confusion. So we'll first talk about the linguistic

06:29.600 --> 06:36.960
one. Social democracy versus Democratic socialism, very similar words in a different order. Okay.

06:38.480 --> 06:46.640
My, the way I operate is Democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one would

06:46.640 --> 06:52.720
seek to socialize ownership of the means of production as an example. Social democracy is a

06:52.720 --> 06:58.160
very highly regulated form of capitalism, the likes of which we would see in Northern Europe,

06:58.160 --> 07:04.800
Denmark, et cetera. These are very different things. I associate progressivism in 2023

07:05.360 --> 07:10.960
with social democracy and would consider Democratic socialism a form of actual socialism that is

07:10.960 --> 07:15.920
different. We're no longer talking about a capitalist organization of society.

07:15.920 --> 07:22.160
So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in how society operates then?

07:22.160 --> 07:28.720
Absolutely. And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about socializing

07:28.720 --> 07:36.240
a couple more things than we socialize in most modern capitalist countries. I had this

07:36.240 --> 07:41.280
conversation with Patrick Bet David recently. Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized

07:41.280 --> 07:46.960
the military already in the United States. We've socialized some healthcare in the sense of like

07:46.960 --> 07:53.680
the VA and Medicaid, et cetera. We're talking about socializing a couple more things still in a

07:53.680 --> 08:00.160
capitalist country. Democratic socialism would be something beyond that. And as someone who is not

08:00.160 --> 08:06.560
a Democratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best advocate for explaining exactly how

08:06.560 --> 08:11.040
that system would function, but it would have some version of socializing ownership of the

08:11.040 --> 08:16.880
means of production, businesses, et cetera. So you mentioned you appeared on the PBD podcast

08:16.880 --> 08:25.360
with Patrick Bet David. The debate was pretty intense. I should say, I personally enjoyed it.

08:25.360 --> 08:30.960
I thought, actually, you did well. And I thought Patrick did well. It was a good conversation.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.800
I think there was a little bit of tension. Yeah. And I thought that Patrick actually,

08:35.440 --> 08:38.880
so I disagreed with the internet, I thought Patrick just took on a kind of devil's advocate.

08:39.760 --> 08:45.280
He was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you. But the internet thought that

08:45.280 --> 08:50.400
he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas. I thought the tension between ideas,

08:51.600 --> 08:56.960
I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with Donald Trump and Trump supporters.

08:56.960 --> 09:02.320
That certainly could be the case. And people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can

09:02.320 --> 09:07.440
imagine from this was your best thing you've ever done in public to you got humiliated and

09:07.440 --> 09:11.920
your mother should have aborted you. And everything in between. So take your pick. But

09:13.440 --> 09:18.320
the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me after was it incredibly

09:18.320 --> 09:24.000
tense and awkward and because it seemed so combative. And I think I'm so used to those

09:24.000 --> 09:28.560
types of tensions in the discussions that I have, that it's very comfortable to me. It's not like

09:28.560 --> 09:33.600
afterwards, it's there's a grudge or it's tense or whatever the case may be. I'm very comfortable.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.680
I disagree with people and that's it. So I did not find anything that happened

09:37.680 --> 09:40.240
inappropriate. I disagreed with a lot of the things he said, certainly.

09:41.200 --> 09:46.080
So you've also spoken with Michael Knowles, I think about the idea of what is a woman.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.840
Can you speak broadly about your conversations with the people you disagree with?

09:53.920 --> 09:56.160
Some of the cases, it feels like it's gone wrong.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.120
The conversations have gone wrong. Yeah.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.680
Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple different things and I'm the first to tell you that

10:04.640 --> 10:10.560
depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different attitude about how, quote,

10:10.560 --> 10:16.160
seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether I think it's going to be a deep policy discussion

10:16.160 --> 10:20.880
versus whether it's going to be more of a performance for an audience that is expecting

10:20.880 --> 10:24.160
a certain thing. And I think there's different types of shows. When I was interviewed by this

10:24.160 --> 10:28.720
guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different, for example, than when I'm talking to

10:28.720 --> 10:34.960
Patrick Bette David, just to give two examples. I think the reason I stopped doing the Michael

10:34.960 --> 10:39.360
Knowles show was the number of threats I would get after the fact. That's really the reason.

10:39.360 --> 10:43.760
I was glad to engage with him to the extent that the interviews were interesting and we could

10:43.760 --> 10:50.240
organize it reasonably efficiently. But the reason I stepped away was sort of the aftermath.

10:50.240 --> 10:57.200
But I did find him to be someone who was abundantly clear about his view and where he comes from.

10:57.200 --> 11:01.760
And while I could not possibly disagree more with him in terms of politics and culture and

11:01.760 --> 11:07.840
our backgrounds, everything is just so different, I found it easy to engage in the conversation

11:07.840 --> 11:11.200
just because of how upfront and clear he was about what his beliefs were.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.560
But the number of threats was too much. Yeah, it was just too much. And this,

11:17.440 --> 11:22.480
I don't know how much you saw about this recent Twitter dust-up I was involved in that peaked

11:22.480 --> 11:27.440
with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting about me and then declining from there.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.080
Oh, let's talk through it. I didn't see it. I have to understand. The way you study Shakespeare,

11:32.080 --> 11:35.920
I have to study your Twitter. I have to understand how much of a sarcasm.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.400
It's mostly sarcasm. I mean, here's the thing. And I know that there are people who will say,

11:40.400 --> 11:45.680
David, you're dealing with such serious issues. It's really not okay not to take everything

11:45.680 --> 11:52.960
you do completely seriously. But my view is it's so incredible that I've between chance and timing

11:52.960 --> 11:57.840
and so different things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally and it's

11:57.840 --> 12:02.960
a career and it's financially sustainable and all these different things. I don't want to end up

12:02.960 --> 12:08.720
taking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and all of these other things.

12:08.720 --> 12:13.680
And this could have gone a completely different way. So my approach to a lot of this is let's not

12:13.680 --> 12:17.440
take ourselves too seriously. And in particular on Twitter, a platform that

12:18.480 --> 12:24.560
the degree to which it should be taken very seriously maybe has changed over time. I'm always

12:24.560 --> 12:27.200
sort of thinking a little bit tongue-in-cheek on Twitter.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.440
So what happened with Donald Trump Jr.?

12:29.440 --> 12:30.080
So...

12:30.080 --> 12:31.360
Or the full arc of it.

12:31.360 --> 12:36.560
Yeah, to give you a one-minute arc and then we can pick whichever parts we want. After

12:37.440 --> 12:41.280
a mass shooting, now you might say there's like two or three a day. You're correct.

12:41.280 --> 12:50.000
After the Nashville mass shooting at a Christian school, I tweeted snarkily tongue-in-cheek to

12:50.880 --> 12:56.400
point that thoughts and prayers not only aren't particularly useful after a shooting,

12:56.400 --> 13:03.200
they also don't prevent shootings, that there's some confusion about how there would be a shooting

13:03.200 --> 13:08.880
at a Christian school, given that it is a place where prayer is taking place. I think I jokingly

13:08.880 --> 13:12.400
said something like, were they not praying enough or correctly?

13:12.400 --> 13:15.120
In my deep journalistic integrity.

13:15.120 --> 13:15.840
You have it.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.640
I have your tweet.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.200
Beautiful.

13:17.200 --> 13:17.760
Beautiful.

13:17.760 --> 13:23.280
This is the only display of journalistic integrity I will show today. Okay.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.880
And I have a couple of responses.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.200
Beautiful.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.040
And you deleted the tweet since then.

13:27.040 --> 13:27.760
Which I regret.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.040
Oh, interesting.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.000
And we can talk about that.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.040
I would love to, because it's such an interesting decision.

13:33.680 --> 13:39.120
Because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often

13:39.120 --> 13:44.960
understand how it's going to be read. It's going to be analyzed like I mentioned Shakespeare.

13:44.960 --> 13:51.120
Like there's certain, the use of certain words that you regret saying in a certain kind of way,

13:51.120 --> 13:56.080
maybe just because it wasn't as eloquent as powerful, it didn't actually convey the thing,

13:57.120 --> 13:59.680
or is the distraction to the main message, all that kind of stuff.

13:59.680 --> 14:04.000
Okay. The actual tweet is very surprising that there would be a mass shooting at a Christian

14:04.000 --> 14:09.040
school, given that lack of prayer is often blamed for these horrible events.

14:09.040 --> 14:14.400
Is it possible they weren't praying enough or correctly, despite being a Christian school?

14:15.200 --> 14:25.760
And a lot of people quote, retweeted that, which I'm assuming was the criticism.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.160
So Colin Wright wrote, I used to consider you a reasonable progressive, but you clearly

14:30.720 --> 14:35.600
devolved into partisan hackery. I'm an atheist. It cannot begin to fathom using the murder of

14:35.600 --> 14:40.720
children and adults at a Christian school as an opportunity to dunk on the concept of prayer.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.400
And you responded, I'm dunking on the people who send thoughts and prayers

14:44.400 --> 14:49.440
and do nothing else. And the shootings continue. Okay. I'm sure there's a lot of other interactions.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.000
There's a few other 100,000 interactions.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.240
So that you want the arc leading to the leading.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.200
Yes, please. Sorry.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.720
I just wanted to display the...

14:56.720 --> 14:59.280
Do you know what time of day I tweeted the original one?

14:59.280 --> 15:02.800
I feel like it was in the afternoon or evening on a Monday.

15:04.880 --> 15:09.600
3.42 p.m. on 27th, March 27th.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.960
Which was a Monday. Okay.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.920
So basically, I tweet that and then I finish the day.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.120
So you tweet and then you go on with your day.

15:17.120 --> 15:22.320
I might have looked once at Twitter and it had 2000 likes and a few people saying,

15:22.720 --> 15:27.040
this might have missed the mark, but it's sort of like it's one of my 20,000 tweets.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.680
I don't know. I wake up the next morning.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.960
My baby daughter did not sleep till 7.30 the way I would like.

15:32.960 --> 15:37.920
So she's up at 6 a.m. and I get up and I'm just there starting to make breakfast.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.720
And I glance at my phone and I'm starting to...

15:40.720 --> 15:43.440
This was when verified meant a different thing than it means now.

15:44.160 --> 15:50.320
I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are quote tweeting it and demanding a retraction

15:50.320 --> 15:54.240
and whatever. And I go, uh-oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.640
I then continue about my day.

15:58.640 --> 16:04.400
Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got 100 messages from,

16:04.400 --> 16:09.840
you should have aborted your son to, we're gonna find all of you to whatever else.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.200
My dad has no idea what's going on.

16:11.200 --> 16:16.960
He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs to everything else you can imagine.

16:17.920 --> 16:27.040
And I start to get emails about your Jewish faith, this and that, and the other thing.

16:27.040 --> 16:31.840
And so at that point, to me, I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse.

16:31.840 --> 16:37.200
And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed,

16:37.760 --> 16:44.800
yes, the attacks escalated. It went through Candice Owens and then at FoxNews.com, Newsmax,

16:44.880 --> 16:51.920
kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. I mean, thousands and thousands of the,

16:51.920 --> 16:58.400
okay. But once I told my audience about what happened, I got thousands of messages from

16:58.400 --> 17:06.160
people saying, David, only someone who doesn't know you and is determined to interpret this in

17:06.160 --> 17:12.480
the worst possible faith would think you're blaming kids who died for getting shot. Of course,

17:12.480 --> 17:18.240
you weren't doing that. I wish you hadn't deleted it so that it would still be up and you would now

17:18.240 --> 17:24.800
see the tide kind of turning on it. This was not a fun three days, regardless. But I do regret

17:24.800 --> 17:32.320
having deleted it because I wanted to do the quickest thing I thought I could to get people

17:32.320 --> 17:38.480
to stop trying to find family members and send them threats. And so around noon, that's what I did.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.920
And the truth is the threats didn't stop anyway because everybody had screenshoted it.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.080
And I do wish I had left it up.

17:45.040 --> 17:50.400
And is there some degree, maybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that?

17:51.120 --> 17:59.360
In that, it feeds the mockery engine that fuels Twitter. So like, does that tweet really

17:59.360 --> 18:10.640
represent what you believe? It absolutely represents the disgust with a politics that includes saying

18:10.640 --> 18:17.920
we can't touch guns. We just, we can't. But we're willing to point to mental health or say we need

18:17.920 --> 18:25.280
more prayer in schools or whatever. 1000 percent, it represents that view. Is it the type of snark

18:25.280 --> 18:31.280
and sarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the topic rather than whatever the

18:31.280 --> 18:36.240
number of characters is now on Twitter? No, definitely not. And so I am very cognizant

18:36.240 --> 18:41.440
of the fact that it was unnecessarily provocative how it was written.

18:43.120 --> 18:48.640
I think I asked a similar question to Ben Shapiro. Do you worry that this style of presentation

18:48.640 --> 18:56.000
can turn you from being a deeply thoughtful, objective political thinker to somebody who's

18:56.000 --> 19:02.480
just a partisan hack or partisan, what's a good word, talking head?

19:03.040 --> 19:06.000
Do you mean with regard to Twitter or the format of my show in general?

19:06.640 --> 19:14.160
So Twitter for now, let's start with Twitter for now. And can you silo your style of communication

19:14.240 --> 19:17.680
on Twitter from being a virus that affects your mind?

19:17.680 --> 19:23.840
Right. I don't have deep thoughts about the Twitter component beyond, I think,

19:23.840 --> 19:29.280
across all sorts of disciplines. This is not the best way to most effectively solve problems

19:30.160 --> 19:33.760
and figure out solutions to complex issues. You're talking about Twitter.

19:33.760 --> 19:39.520
Now, right now I'm talking about Twitter. That being said, I think all of us, to some degree,

19:39.520 --> 19:45.760
have to adapt our content to the platform that we're using in the same way that what I post to

19:45.760 --> 19:51.360
YouTube is different than what I post to TikTok. What I post to Twitter is also different.

19:51.360 --> 19:59.600
Do I think Twitter has been an unmitigated good for society? No. Have I chosen to step into

19:59.600 --> 20:04.880
Twitter as one of the ways in which I get my message out with the good and the bad? Yes.

20:05.600 --> 20:11.760
And I think that there is a deep conversation to be had there. I think zooming out a little bit

20:12.320 --> 20:15.840
in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would come up because I think it's really interesting,

20:16.560 --> 20:21.680
I will often get emails from people who say two things. I will get the, you would have

20:21.680 --> 20:28.000
such a bigger audience if you did X type emails. And usually they are plays to sensationalism,

20:28.880 --> 20:35.520
salacious and titillating content, more pop culture stuff, et cetera. On the other hand,

20:35.520 --> 20:41.280
it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing really isn't as serious as it could be. And it

20:41.280 --> 20:46.960
seems like you could do something more serious. And you should consider doing deep dives. Once

20:46.960 --> 20:50.720
it was do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge. And I was like, nobody will watch that. So

20:51.680 --> 20:57.520
it's not by accident that my show is the way it is, right? In an hour, I'm thinking of all the

20:57.520 --> 21:04.080
platforms I'm on and I'm saying, okay, I want to do a relatively deep dive on the federal budget.

21:04.640 --> 21:11.360
And I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office.

21:11.360 --> 21:16.400
And I'm going to do a segment about the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made

21:16.400 --> 21:21.840
up three words and said he endorsed a candidate who's named, right? I'm crafting that in total

21:21.840 --> 21:27.520
to find a balance between let's build this audience as much as I can in order to have a

21:27.520 --> 21:33.440
bigger base to get my message out there and include the more serious stuff with the hope

21:33.440 --> 21:37.600
that there's a little bit of something for everyone. And I'm finding a balance between those two

21:37.600 --> 21:43.200
sides of the spectrum. It's a deliberate thing. And I'm aware that if I were producing my show

21:43.200 --> 21:47.360
50 years ago, the balance would probably be different and it would probably change again.

21:47.360 --> 21:52.000
If the show was audio only rather than having all these video platforms,

21:52.000 --> 21:58.320
it would also be different. But it's a decision that's proactively made to try to get the best

21:58.320 --> 22:01.360
and most out of the hour that I'm creating every day.

22:01.360 --> 22:08.400
It just feels like there's an entire machine fed by Twitter and journalism that wants to divide

22:08.400 --> 22:15.920
people and the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division

22:15.920 --> 22:21.520
feels like it's a tension with objective clear thinking sometimes. And so that's the,

22:22.880 --> 22:32.800
I worry that there's a drug to it. There's too much fun to mock ridiculous people on the other side.

22:33.520 --> 22:41.280
I think you're right about that. And the fact that that is true to me supports,

22:41.840 --> 22:45.840
I've talked with my audience about, you know, like the old food pyramid, which I guess was

22:45.840 --> 22:48.880
like wrong, but let's imagine that there was a pyramid that made sense.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.480
What's at the bottom bread?

22:51.040 --> 22:55.600
I think like whole grains, maybe. I don't remember. It's been a while since I saw that.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.440
Junk food is at the very top. I'm very open with my audience.

23:00.240 --> 23:04.080
The vast majority of what I do is the top of that pyramid.

23:05.040 --> 23:11.840
And I tell people very openly, I don't consume a lot of the type of content I produce.

23:12.800 --> 23:18.240
And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical thinking,

23:18.240 --> 23:23.600
epistemology, how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world.

23:24.480 --> 23:28.880
After that, reading history, economics, philosophy, etc.

23:29.680 --> 23:35.120
After that, now we're getting into current events, I would mostly be looking at consuming

23:36.720 --> 23:43.520
primary source reporting, things like associated press, whatever. I know everybody will have a

23:43.520 --> 23:49.280
different list of what counts there. After that is when I'd say indulge in some of the commentary

23:49.280 --> 23:55.280
type stuff that I do. If you find that I'm thoughtful enough to make it into that,

23:55.360 --> 23:59.680
but I'm very open. And really, what I try to do on my show often is,

23:59.680 --> 24:04.000
in being that at the top of the pyramid, tell people there's all this other stuff

24:04.000 --> 24:08.960
that should be forming your foundation that I hope you're consuming in addition to just

24:08.960 --> 24:11.200
watching me. And I'm very open with my audience about that.

24:11.920 --> 24:17.520
What about the shape, the dynamics, the characteristics of your audience? Is there

24:17.520 --> 24:23.920
some degree to which you're through mocking maybe Republicans that there's a

24:26.000 --> 24:29.440
lean to that audience and then you become captured by the audience? Do you worry about

24:29.440 --> 24:37.440
the audience capture? I worry about it. I'm relatively comfortable that it's not shaping

24:37.440 --> 24:45.040
the program to a great degree in the sense that at this point, I have a pretty good sense of the

24:45.040 --> 24:50.400
things I can say that will upset what I might call my core audience. One of the interesting things

24:50.400 --> 24:55.840
just to briefly go back to the Twitter thing was those people who were furious with me on Twitter

24:55.840 --> 25:01.200
and they contacted my advertisers and some advertisers dropped me and on and on and on.

25:01.920 --> 25:07.200
None of them are actually in my audience. None of them are regular consumers of my audience.

25:07.200 --> 25:11.200
They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, hey, look at this.

25:11.200 --> 25:15.200
The people who follow Candace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value,

25:15.200 --> 25:19.760
they're not in my audience. And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk

25:19.760 --> 25:25.120
about that will generate displeasure, I guess you could say with my audience. Sometimes when

25:25.120 --> 25:29.440
I touch the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that will happen. Sometimes on vaccines,

25:29.440 --> 25:34.480
there's a portion of my audience that is more generally skeptical of vaccines.

25:35.440 --> 25:43.120
Sometimes on some foreign policy issues. Or I'm not a big fan of Marianne Williamson,

25:43.120 --> 25:49.200
nor Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s challenges to Joe Biden, not because I love Joe Biden,

25:49.200 --> 25:52.480
but because I don't consider them to be the most serious challengers. I know there's people in

25:52.480 --> 25:57.200
my audience who don't like that. They get mad at me about that. And I'm totally okay with that

25:57.760 --> 26:04.000
and that tension with my core audience. So in that sense, I don't feel as though I've had that

26:04.000 --> 26:10.320
audience capture take place. But I know it can happen. And I'm very open to being told ways

26:10.320 --> 26:17.280
in which it may be happening without me noticing. So I've made a call for questions on Reddit

26:17.280 --> 26:22.080
for this conversation. There's a lot of good questions that I'll probably bring up. But

26:22.080 --> 26:29.920
one of them was about Marianne Williamson asking why David thinks she is a garbage candidate,

26:30.640 --> 26:37.040
which of course, I've never said, but perhaps you have more eloquently criticized. So let's

26:37.040 --> 26:44.000
go there to the 2024 election. Okay. So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running

26:44.000 --> 26:49.680
again. Donald Trump officially announced that he's running again. And if that's the matchup,

26:49.680 --> 26:55.280
who do you think wins? If the elections held today, I think Biden.

26:55.520 --> 27:03.200
What? Well, first of all, I believe he won last time. And if I start with the results from 2020,

27:03.760 --> 27:10.080
and I think to myself, what has happened since then that would push or pull voters one way or

27:10.080 --> 27:17.200
the other, I have a hard time making a case that Trump is in a better position today than he was

27:17.200 --> 27:23.040
in November of 2020. So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an

27:23.040 --> 27:31.600
election with a known outcome. What has changed? And I can't make a case for circumstances having

27:31.600 --> 27:36.720
changed in Trump's favor to give a couple of state level examples. Florida seems to be kind of

27:36.720 --> 27:44.240
moving more to the Republican side since 2020. But Trump won that state already in 2020. So it

27:44.240 --> 27:50.080
wouldn't really change the outcome. Arizona was close. I think Arizona has moved to the left

27:50.080 --> 27:56.000
since 2020. So I don't see Trump taking that one. Wisconsin, I think the same sort of thing applies.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.840
So being very practical, that would be kind of the start of my reasoning.

28:03.440 --> 28:08.960
Do you think Joe Biden is a better candidate now than he was in 2020?

28:10.240 --> 28:17.440
I think he's a worse candidate. This is going to sound agist, but I think he's a worse candidate

28:17.440 --> 28:25.280
in that he's even older and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates,

28:25.280 --> 28:32.080
particularly on the Democratic voting side. So he's going to be four years older and in a sense

28:32.080 --> 28:39.040
that could be a liability. However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments. Now,

28:39.040 --> 28:42.400
you might not like the things he's done in which case that would hurt him,

28:42.480 --> 28:48.400
but he has started to accumulate a not insignificant number of accomplishments.

28:48.400 --> 28:52.640
Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act and COVID Stimulus,

28:53.440 --> 28:57.200
but also less well-known things like a bunch of little tweaks to health care,

28:57.840 --> 29:01.280
a bunch of little tweaks to student lending. There's been a lot of little things.

29:02.800 --> 29:08.240
At the macro level, I don't actually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this the same way

29:08.240 --> 29:12.960
I didn't credit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but Inflation has started

29:12.960 --> 29:18.160
to come down significantly. The stock market's quite steady, these sort of things. I think looking

29:18.160 --> 29:24.160
historically, it's a pretty okay environment for Joe Biden with the exception that he was

29:24.160 --> 29:29.680
already the oldest president to be inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat his own record in

29:29.680 --> 29:32.880
January of 2025. And I just don't know how voters are going to see that.

29:33.600 --> 29:39.680
So in terms of just a public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden? So if I were

29:39.680 --> 29:47.040
to give criticism towards Trump, it would be that his chaotic, maybe to the point of being

29:47.040 --> 29:51.760
disrespectful to a lot of different groups, to a lot of different ideas, to a lot of different

29:51.760 --> 29:56.320
nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff. And then the criticism towards Biden would be that

29:57.280 --> 30:04.960
he may be perhaps because of age or any other kind of cognitive capabilities is not really there

30:04.960 --> 30:10.960
mentally as in the way that perhaps you could say that Barack Obama was there,

30:10.960 --> 30:17.760
just mentally being able to handle all kinds of aspects of being a public representative of a

30:17.760 --> 30:25.600
nation to the world and to the people of that nation. So which in the competition of personality

30:25.600 --> 30:32.160
flaws, which do you think is more powerful? You've laid out fair and I believe accurate

30:32.160 --> 30:40.240
assessments of elements of both of those men. You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value

30:40.240 --> 30:45.600
each of those assessments, which is where I think the kind of meat of this question really is.

30:47.520 --> 30:52.800
I don't see, and I know that Biden's going to get us into World War III, World War III,

30:52.880 --> 31:00.480
doesn't seem to be happening. I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on.

31:01.040 --> 31:09.040
I don't see them as dangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this kind of

31:09.840 --> 31:18.240
environment with our traditional Western allies and geopolitics, etc. in the way that the sort

31:18.320 --> 31:23.360
of unhinged personality of Trump combined with his lack of knowledge about most issues

31:24.080 --> 31:31.520
is a threat. So for me, if those two are the candidates, Biden would be my choice. Now,

31:31.520 --> 31:36.960
are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side? Yes. If I knew the president

31:36.960 --> 31:42.560
would be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump? Absolutely. It's so funny

31:42.560 --> 31:49.120
when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference seemed so significant between them.

31:49.680 --> 31:55.120
Thinking back, I'm sure I would disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his views on LGBT,

31:55.120 --> 32:00.960
or I know are different than mine, but it seems without looking at him with rose-colored glasses,

32:00.960 --> 32:06.160
so comparatively benign given the four years of Trump. So that's kind of where I come down.

32:06.160 --> 32:13.760
Even McCain and Obama, the differences seemed quite drastic. Yeah. McCain was interesting

32:13.760 --> 32:19.360
because Palin, as his running mate, opened the door to the sort of cartoonish stuff that we've

32:19.360 --> 32:25.840
started to see on the Republican side. Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor-Green, it started going in

32:25.840 --> 32:31.120
that direction, which has made the party a bit of a joke. Aside from what you believe the tax rate

32:31.120 --> 32:38.320
would be. You can say taxes are too high, but Jewish space lasers come on, but I agree with

32:38.320 --> 32:43.760
you on McCain also. Going back to the political terms we talked about, where in that spectrum do

32:43.760 --> 32:49.600
you place yourself today? Which of the label do you think captures your political views?

32:49.600 --> 32:56.960
Progressive Social Democrat, which again, is a capitalist. I own my own business. I pay the

32:56.960 --> 33:02.480
taxes I'm legally required to pay and not a penny more and all those things. That's where I place

33:02.480 --> 33:09.520
myself. Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden? Yes. Where does the AOC fit into that?

33:11.440 --> 33:16.400
That's a good question. What do you think about AOC as a candidate? Do you think she eventually

33:16.400 --> 33:25.280
runs? I think that if she doesn't run into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal in the

33:25.280 --> 33:35.440
sense of some personal impropriety, but I mean some kind of major political problem, it seems that

33:35.440 --> 33:41.600
she has the staying power to be an American elected politics for a long time. Whether she would even

33:41.600 --> 33:46.720
want to be president versus maybe going to the Senate or being governor or whatever the case

33:46.720 --> 33:52.080
may be, I have no idea what her ambitions are in that sense. But certainly, policy aside,

33:52.640 --> 34:02.160
she has this combination of charisma, likeability to some, but also something about her personality

34:02.160 --> 34:07.920
that angers the people who don't like her in a way that only fuels her presence,

34:08.960 --> 34:13.840
which I think applies to Trump as well, that I do think that she has the potential to have

34:13.840 --> 34:16.880
significant staying power in American politics. President, I don't know.

34:16.880 --> 34:22.080
Do you think that's the future of political elections and politics in general,

34:22.720 --> 34:27.280
is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side, like AOC and Trump did?

34:27.280 --> 34:34.080
I think it's an aspect of it. I think it's also understanding how to communicate policy ideas.

34:35.280 --> 34:39.280
Trump, I have things I can praise Trump about if we want to get to that segment at some point.

34:39.280 --> 34:44.080
You let me know when that is, but I do think that there are some things Trump is very good at,

34:44.080 --> 34:48.400
and this is why it's very hard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes

34:48.400 --> 34:54.960
to actually fight Trump in a national primary. And one of those things is

34:55.760 --> 35:00.800
Trump has a, even though he often says very strange things, that if you transcribe them,

35:00.800 --> 35:05.200
you go, what language is that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the moment,

35:05.200 --> 35:12.400
the way he relates to adversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that he is very much

35:12.400 --> 35:16.000
aware of how it is going to be seen by the audience. And so that's why a lot of times it's

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
more about, doesn't matter that a word salad came out of his mouth, how he immediately responded

35:20.000 --> 35:27.280
and related to the person, very good. So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared

35:27.280 --> 35:33.200
all the time, often out of context, is extraordinarily important. Knowing how to use social media,

35:33.200 --> 35:37.840
which every election cycle, that means something different. But understanding how to use social

35:37.840 --> 35:44.720
media, very important. Those things are absolutely so important. And whether you're able to do a

35:44.720 --> 35:51.040
deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful, but I would say it's a bad thing. It's becoming

35:51.040 --> 35:56.480
less important in terms of figuring out who we want to represent us. So just lingering on the AOC,

35:56.480 --> 36:02.160
and then maybe let's throw in Bernie Sanders on that. Yeah. So where do you place yourself and

36:02.160 --> 36:09.440
how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe Biden, and David Backman?

36:10.160 --> 36:17.600
My instinct is, and I'm going to answer it, the thing that makes this tough is Bernie says,

36:18.240 --> 36:25.120
he's a democratic socialist. He ran as a social democrat. He didn't run on anything that was

36:25.120 --> 36:30.960
really socialism. So I'm going by their public facing platforms.

36:30.960 --> 36:35.440
I've been listening to him for many, many years and all the way back to the Tom Hartman show.

36:35.440 --> 36:41.280
And I think using the terms as you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever been a

36:41.280 --> 36:49.440
democratic socialist. I haven't heard him speak about socialism. I think I've heard him speak about

36:50.320 --> 36:56.080
social programs and the value of social programs throughout the history of the United States and

36:56.640 --> 37:00.960
how they've been beneficial. My understanding is very similar to yours, although there may be

37:00.960 --> 37:05.680
stuff from the 70s where he really was talking about bona fide. We've all did some shit in the

37:05.680 --> 37:09.840
70s. Yeah, you and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the 70s. I feel like I would

37:09.840 --> 37:15.760
did, yeah. My sense would be Biden is like center left, and then I'm to the left of that,

37:16.960 --> 37:24.160
but maybe just inside of where AOC and Bernie are very, very similar to Bernie. I mean, I identify

37:24.160 --> 37:30.160
with a lot of Bernie's ideas, maybe their implementation I'm more flexible on. I'll give you

37:30.160 --> 37:36.640
one example, Medicare for all. One way of trying to get healthcare to everybody, which Bernie's

37:36.640 --> 37:41.520
very big on, is you take the current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit,

37:41.520 --> 37:47.520
make it available to everybody, pay for it through taxation. Interesting. However, I'm open to other

37:47.520 --> 37:54.080
models if they get everybody healthcare, that is good quality and affordable. Singapore has

37:54.080 --> 38:00.080
an interesting model, Germany has an interesting model. I am more agnostic about how we do it

38:00.080 --> 38:06.080
than just saying, let's expand Medicare. Whether that puts me to the right of Bernie, I don't know,

38:06.080 --> 38:09.040
but I'm not like exactly right there on it has to be Medicare for all.

38:09.600 --> 38:15.120
Yeah, that's more of a, that's more just flexibility versus dogmatism. So I don't

38:15.200 --> 38:18.960
know if that puts you to the left or to the right. I don't either. What do you think about

38:18.960 --> 38:26.720
the term manipulation or the corruption in the DNC that perhaps tipped the scales against Bernie

38:26.720 --> 38:29.840
in the election? Do you think there was such a thing? 2016 or 2020?

38:34.000 --> 38:39.760
Both, I would say. In different, the dynamics there were different with Hillary Clinton and

38:40.400 --> 38:44.160
the pressure from Hillary Clinton as a candidate and so on. Yeah, what, I mean,

38:44.720 --> 38:49.440
was there, why didn't Bernie win? I guess there's one way to ask.

38:49.440 --> 38:56.000
Okay. I think there's a couple of things here. First, the DNC, I'm not a Democrat,

38:56.000 --> 39:01.280
just your audience may not know, I'm just an independent. I mostly vote for candidates that

39:01.280 --> 39:05.520
end up being Democrats in local elections. Often there's no party designation. So, okay,

39:05.520 --> 39:09.360
I'm obviously on the left, I'm not denying that, but the Democratic Party as an institution is

39:09.360 --> 39:14.480
never really been interesting to me. You're still a rebel that resists belonging to any institution.

39:14.480 --> 39:21.680
Exactly right, exactly right. And whether it matters, I don't know. The DNC and the RNC

39:22.320 --> 39:27.840
really are organizations that to some degree exist to justify their own existence because

39:27.840 --> 39:35.840
if they were no longer necessary, they would go away. And so they have to assert their value

39:35.840 --> 39:40.160
and their importance. They do this in a number of different ways, organizing the way that the

39:40.160 --> 39:46.640
nominee is chosen, the convention, working with states on everything from redistricting to whatever

39:46.640 --> 39:51.040
else the case may be, setting the order of primaries and having some involvement in how

39:51.040 --> 39:58.320
that's all going to happen. And also coordinating behind the scenes, I guess they would describe it

39:58.320 --> 40:04.000
as making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways. We might see it and say,

40:04.000 --> 40:09.600
they're picking the winner. There's nothing illegal about them being involved in picking

40:09.600 --> 40:15.120
the winner, but we might say it's not in people's interests. I think the 2020 primary was really

40:15.120 --> 40:23.280
interesting. Bernie supporter, myself, I started telling my audience after a couple primaries and

40:23.280 --> 40:29.120
even before based on polling and different things, I see a real uphill battle here for Bernie.

40:30.080 --> 40:36.320
And it's really important. People in my audience are not the average union worker in Michigan

40:36.320 --> 40:41.120
who is mostly working and raising a family and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote

40:41.120 --> 40:45.760
on election day. If you spend a lot of time on Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated

40:45.760 --> 40:53.760
sense of Bernie's popularity within the Democratic Party. That was my sense. And to some degree,

40:54.720 --> 41:00.480
we saw that in certain states. I don't have the exact primary order and results in front of me

41:00.480 --> 41:06.880
or in my head, but the big turning point was South Carolina. South Carolina was when Joe Biden,

41:06.880 --> 41:13.040
one and one handily, understood to be because of the larger African-American population in South

41:13.040 --> 41:18.320
Carolina. And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now, whether it was the

41:18.320 --> 41:22.960
day after or the day before, some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of support,

41:23.520 --> 41:31.360
got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden. And to some degree, of course, it was all organized

41:31.360 --> 41:37.680
and timed to help Joe Biden. There's no doubt about that. This is what the DNC does. It's hard

41:37.680 --> 41:44.880
for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like, if we believe they were there to be

41:44.880 --> 41:50.320
unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on the side as possible, it would make sense to be furious

41:50.320 --> 41:56.000
that they've gone against their stated kind of mandate. But we know that the DNC

41:57.120 --> 42:02.240
negotiates and is working behind the scenes and has a favorite, that favorite was Hillary in 2016,

42:02.240 --> 42:08.480
2020. So I share the frustration about the power that the DNC has, but for people who were saying

42:08.480 --> 42:13.040
they did something illegal or whatever else the case may be, that doesn't seem to be the case.

42:13.600 --> 42:18.800
But this is part of why, I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans and

42:18.880 --> 42:23.120
Democrats. And there's probably four major changes that have to happen in order to make that a

42:23.120 --> 42:30.240
reality. But I share the frustration of folks while recognizing that Reddit was not accurately

42:30.240 --> 42:35.440
representing Bernie's level of popularity. Still, I wish that the bias wasn't towards the,

42:36.240 --> 42:41.600
what could be negatively termed a deep state, towards the bureaucracy, towards the momentum

42:41.600 --> 42:47.120
of the past, which I think Joe Biden kind of represents, versus new ideas, which is funny

42:47.120 --> 42:52.880
to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas, because he's also an older gentleman.

42:52.880 --> 42:58.240
Well, it's a frame, it's a lot of framing. And the other aspect to that is, on paper,

42:59.360 --> 43:05.440
Joe Biden's platform was arguably the most progressive of any Democratic candidate who

43:05.440 --> 43:09.920
won the nomination. Now, of course, there were people who challenged the nominations who were to

43:09.920 --> 43:17.360
Joe Biden's left. A lot of this is perspective. And that's how you end up saying the guy who's

43:17.360 --> 43:21.200
a couple of years older than Biden is actually the guy with the fresh perspective, which is

43:21.200 --> 43:25.760
interesting because I don't disagree with you. Yeah. And then you also have to say the perspective

43:25.760 --> 43:30.960
doesn't always align with the policies. You're right. The actual policies of Joe Biden are different

43:30.960 --> 43:36.560
than maybe the perception of Joe Biden. Or what he ran on. I mean, just two examples I would give

43:36.640 --> 43:43.120
are, during his campaign, he played up a little bit his interest in doing student loan forgiveness

43:43.120 --> 43:48.480
and something on cannabis. I never bought it. I told my audience, I think he's saying this stuff

43:48.480 --> 43:53.280
because this is the way the tide is kind of, the wind is blowing and he's being advised to

43:53.280 --> 43:56.960
say this stuff. I don't think he's going to do very much on either of these things. He did actually

43:56.960 --> 44:03.360
do some student loan stuff. But that would be two examples, I think. Okay, let's go to the

44:03.760 --> 44:10.480
something you alluded to, which is the pros and cons of a particular candidate. Well, what do you,

44:10.480 --> 44:19.040
as a critic of Trump, what do you are the pros, the strengths of Donald Trump,

44:19.040 --> 44:24.800
and what do you are as big as weaknesses? The strengths of Trump. Let's see how I can frame

44:24.800 --> 44:30.160
them in a way that is both accurate and accurately assesses my feeling about it.

44:30.160 --> 44:33.920
It could be taken out of context most masterfully through the clipping process.

44:33.920 --> 44:44.080
Yes, Trump's strengths are mostly superficial and in terms of presentation. Trump was able to,

44:44.800 --> 44:50.880
I call it a grift, some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people.

44:50.880 --> 44:58.080
Trump, as a rich guy from New York City, was able to convince people that he spent most of his life

44:58.080 --> 45:05.200
trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind, that he knew

45:05.200 --> 45:12.880
why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy, and that he had solutions that he was going to

45:12.880 --> 45:19.280
bring forward. The truth is, he never really liked those people, and as soon as they weren't useful

45:19.280 --> 45:24.960
to him for a brief period of time, that love affair with his followers stopped, and then

45:24.960 --> 45:30.640
now it's back that he needs them again, he didn't really understand the causes of the problems that

45:30.640 --> 45:35.040
those folks were experiencing, and his solutions were laughable. Jared was going to solve the

45:35.040 --> 45:39.920
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in year one, he was going to replace Obamacare in 2017,

45:39.920 --> 45:45.200
things that were never going anywhere, anywhere. But what he did really well was,

45:45.200 --> 45:52.640
he put up a united front of, I know what is ailing you, I know how to fix it, and I know how to fix

45:53.040 --> 45:58.400
it, I guess because he's a businessman, and he's been above the fray of politics for so long,

45:58.960 --> 46:02.640
knowing how to use political donations to his advantage, he called that smart, etc.

46:02.640 --> 46:10.240
I think that's his greatest strength. Why do you say that the Jared plan for Israel-Palestine

46:10.240 --> 46:14.720
and the plan for healthcare to improve Obamacare, why do you say that's laughable?

46:14.720 --> 46:19.600
Well, only someone, I would include the North Korea plan as well, which I'm glad to talk about,

46:20.160 --> 46:27.840
only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues

46:28.400 --> 46:34.400
could so arrogantly say that they could solve them in that way and on that timeframe. I'm all

46:34.400 --> 46:42.480
for optimism and bringing a new face to things, absolutely, without a doubt, but a wall with

46:42.480 --> 46:48.720
Mexico that Mexico will pay for at the end of my first term. I know there are people who believed

46:48.720 --> 46:53.120
it because they would call into my show and say, I'm voting for Trump because of it, but it's hard

46:53.120 --> 46:58.880
to believe that anybody serious would fall for that unless you were deliberately wanting to just

46:58.880 --> 47:04.080
believe whatever was being fed to you or you just hadn't ever thought about these issues before.

47:04.080 --> 47:11.120
The healthcare plan, in 2017, they proposed one would have led to 24 million or so people ending

47:11.120 --> 47:15.280
up without healthcare, didn't go anywhere because it was so terrible, and then in August of 2020,

47:15.280 --> 47:21.600
Trump said, in two weeks, I'm going to finally have my healthcare proposal. It's 2023. We still

47:21.600 --> 47:26.320
never got it. With all of these things when you think them through, it was just sort of arrogance,

47:26.320 --> 47:32.560
and I get the perspective of, I want optimism and I liked that optimism. It worked. I mean, fair.

47:32.560 --> 47:37.200
A lot of people saw it and liked it. As someone who followed a lot of those issues closely,

47:38.080 --> 47:40.800
they seemed, of course, like impossible promises.

47:40.880 --> 47:46.000
What's a double-edged sword? It's a pushback a little bit. If you look at the things I have

47:47.520 --> 47:50.960
a little bit more knowledge about, which is the space of artificial intelligence,

47:52.080 --> 47:55.280
there's a company called DeepMind and it's a company called OpenAI

47:56.160 --> 48:00.320
that we'll laugh at for a long time when they were talking about that they're going to solve

48:00.320 --> 48:07.360
intelligence. Now, they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT,

48:07.920 --> 48:13.600
they've made progress that most of the community would not have imagined they'd be able to make.

48:14.160 --> 48:19.840
Everything from AlphaGo beating the World Go champion, just all the different

48:20.640 --> 48:26.160
steps in progress they can get into were surprised to everybody, and they are legitimately

48:28.880 --> 48:35.920
fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence. The other aspect, he gets a lot of

48:35.920 --> 48:42.960
criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk. I can say a lot of things like SpaceX,

48:43.520 --> 48:48.000
so commercial space flight, he was laughed at for a long time that that's possible.

48:49.520 --> 48:54.000
Same thing with autopilot in Tesla, autonomous vehicles, his approach was

48:54.000 --> 49:00.400
harshly criticized by all the experts and still criticized, to this day, deeply criticized,

49:00.480 --> 49:06.480
and I as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a

49:06.480 --> 49:13.600
semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising. The reason I mention that is sometimes

49:13.600 --> 49:23.840
it feels like you need the guy or the gal who makes those preposterous, ambitious statements,

49:24.240 --> 49:31.680
we're going to solve healthcare this year. And then there's experts like yourself,

49:31.680 --> 49:37.600
that are looking, thinking, have you read anything about the history of Israel-Palestine,

49:37.600 --> 49:44.480
is a good example of that. Do you know there's a history there? Do you realize how complicated,

49:44.480 --> 49:49.440
how many people have tried, how many people have failed, how many millions of people hate each other

49:49.520 --> 49:58.240
in this little place, in this land? Sometimes the expertise can really weigh you down,

49:58.240 --> 50:04.800
so to push back, sometimes you have to have the almost be naive and stupid and just rush in

50:04.800 --> 50:07.840
with an optimism in order to actually make some progress.

50:07.840 --> 50:13.520
I agree with you 100%. I think it's interesting that all of the examples you gave of successes

50:13.520 --> 50:16.320
are from the technology space. Not politics yet.

50:16.320 --> 50:21.200
Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on some of these

50:21.200 --> 50:25.840
issues more quickly without a doubt. I do think at some point though, when it comes down to voting

50:25.840 --> 50:30.960
and saying one of these people is going to be ostensibly in charge for four years through all

50:30.960 --> 50:35.920
of the departments and secretaries and choices that they make, we do want to apply some level of

50:35.920 --> 50:41.760
realism with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space and they're good examples.

50:41.760 --> 50:46.000
There's no question about it. One thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley

50:46.000 --> 50:53.760
Hope's new book about North Korea and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter,

50:53.760 --> 51:00.000
but in the background of the book, it's written, much of what is written about happens during the

51:00.000 --> 51:04.800
Trump era and when Trump did the first and then the second, I guess you'd call them summits with

51:04.800 --> 51:12.720
Kim Jong-un. It actually did seem like to some degree, Trump's, we're going to handle this like

51:12.720 --> 51:20.640
I do a business deal approach to Kim Jong-un. In some sense, it actually was logical because of

51:20.640 --> 51:27.520
Kim Jong-un and the way that it was so ego-driven and they both as sort of authoritarian strongmen

51:27.520 --> 51:32.000
types to different degrees wanted that. There was actually a kernel where I actually thought,

51:32.000 --> 51:37.280
as I read it, Trump's initial idea wasn't crazy. The problem was he knew nothing about the backstory

51:37.280 --> 51:42.400
of the relationship. He fell for all sorts of lies from Kim Jong-un and he made offers that

51:42.400 --> 51:46.720
didn't make any sense to me. It fell apart. Fine. But that's an example where I think Trump's

51:46.720 --> 51:52.640
personality was not actually at its base, the problem when it came to North Korea.

51:52.640 --> 51:56.640
Well, there's other things of this nature that could go in, or some people argue,

51:56.640 --> 52:01.920
goes into the strengths and pros of Donald Trump. For China, for example, terrorist on China.

52:02.640 --> 52:06.800
Can you make the case that there's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump

52:06.960 --> 52:11.200
acted with China? It's really tough. And I'll give you a couple reasons why.

52:11.200 --> 52:19.600
Okay, then also cons. It's tough to make. So the China thing is really, so just very recently to

52:19.600 --> 52:24.320
when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed by a guy named Mark Levin.

52:24.960 --> 52:30.720
And Trump proposed a new, I call it a conspiracy theory, maybe it will strike you as something

52:30.720 --> 52:37.120
different about China, COVID and tariffs. And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs

52:37.120 --> 52:44.080
cost China so much money, China sent the US so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as

52:44.080 --> 52:50.640
punishment. Now there's a couple problems with that. One, American companies pay the tariffs.

52:51.680 --> 52:57.440
Trump still doesn't seem to know this. Trump seems to believe that when he puts a tariff on Chinese

52:57.520 --> 53:04.320
imports, someone in China is cutting a check to the United States. American companies buy the

53:04.320 --> 53:08.800
stuff from China, and then American companies cut a check to the United States for the tariff.

53:10.160 --> 53:14.160
Trump doesn't seem to get that. But it still has a sting to the Chinese economy.

53:14.160 --> 53:19.280
You can make the argument that if there is a suitable alternative domestically or from a

53:19.280 --> 53:25.360
different country, that it will reduce imports, but it didn't happen. And we actually have reports

53:25.360 --> 53:33.360
now that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter million American jobs. The other problem with

53:33.360 --> 53:44.320
that idea is China created and released a virus in order to hurt you. But as of today, 5.7 of the

53:44.320 --> 53:50.080
6.8 million deaths were in other countries. It's a very indirect way. You're mostly killing people

53:50.080 --> 53:57.200
in other countries to hurt Trump. This is the sort of thing where when I think about how Trump

53:57.200 --> 54:03.840
dealt with China, it's very scary. Because given another four years, who knows what he might do

54:03.840 --> 54:11.280
if he still doesn't understand how tariffs work? Geopolitics operates in complicated ways with

54:11.280 --> 54:18.080
carrots and sticks. Henry Kissinger has written quite a lot about this. In some sense, the positive

54:18.080 --> 54:25.440
aspect here that Donald Trump is willing to take big risks in the game of geopolitics

54:25.440 --> 54:33.120
with this giant superpower that is China. And a lot of others are too afraid, too afraid to call

54:33.120 --> 54:41.280
them out, to come to the table and criticize. I certainly think that's an argument that can be

54:41.280 --> 54:48.800
made. My question would be, what tangible positive outcomes did it lead to? And it's tough to identify

54:48.800 --> 54:54.400
any. But I think it's a great thing. I mean, listen, one of the things you're kind of getting at,

54:54.400 --> 55:01.200
maybe indirectly, is that there's been this sense that politics has been done very similarly for a

55:01.200 --> 55:06.320
long time. And even between Democrats and Republicans, still, even with some policy

55:06.320 --> 55:12.160
differences, there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC mostly dealing

55:12.160 --> 55:17.280
with issues that don't directly affect. I get that. I'm with you on that. I think the question

55:17.280 --> 55:23.920
is to whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than extraordinarily humiliating in many ways.

55:23.920 --> 55:28.720
I just come down on it was an absolute and total humiliation. But I understand that

55:28.720 --> 55:34.080
you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude was refreshing in some way.

55:34.080 --> 55:38.000
That's a reasonable position for someone to take. I disagree with it, but I understand it.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.480
But it's trying and feeling better than not trying.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.520
This goes well beyond politics. Wayne Gretzky is waiting about this. Michael Jordan is waiting about

55:47.520 --> 55:52.880
this. Is it better to have tried and failed than never? Is it better to have loved and lost

55:52.880 --> 55:57.920
than never to have loved? I don't know. I mean, listen, we live through four years of Trump.

55:57.920 --> 56:04.640
We know what that four-year term was like, and it's very hard for me to say that the things

56:04.640 --> 56:10.160
he tried were overwhelmingly reasonable. But I get the point you're trying to make,

56:10.160 --> 56:15.760
and I appreciate it. If we don't do any of it, then where do we end up? Sure. We know where we

56:15.760 --> 56:22.080
ended up with Trump, and it was pretty embarrassing. Okay, let's linger on some more strengths.

56:22.080 --> 56:26.400
We didn't start any new wars. Is there something to that?

56:26.400 --> 56:30.960
Yeah, it's interesting. There's a few different approaches to dealing with that.

56:32.160 --> 56:38.160
First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who like to

56:38.160 --> 56:42.480
say that was that Hillary Clinton was going to start three wars. Sometimes they say four wars.

56:42.480 --> 56:49.360
Sometimes they say five wars. Okay. The geopolitical situation during the four years that Trump was

56:49.360 --> 56:55.680
in office, I don't know that they obviously lent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was able

56:55.680 --> 57:00.960
to keep us out of. I think the Russia thing is interesting because now it's very popular to go

57:01.520 --> 57:07.680
back and say, the reason Putin didn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump and to somehow give

57:07.680 --> 57:14.880
Trump credit for that. There's a counterpoint to it, which is Putin under Trump, particularly if

57:14.880 --> 57:20.480
Trump got four more years, would have been able to maybe consolidate power in other ways because

57:20.480 --> 57:24.160
of his relationship with Trump. I'm not coming down on one side or the other. It's not my area

57:24.160 --> 57:29.760
of expertise, but it's not the open shut slam dunk that Trump likes to say it is. Putin didn't

57:29.760 --> 57:37.200
invade because he knew I would crush him. Okay. It's not obvious to me that there were imminently

57:37.200 --> 57:45.120
wars that would have started during that time. That being said, for all the criticism of Obama

57:45.120 --> 57:51.200
during Crimea, Trump seemed to just forget about that after all the criticism and say,

57:51.200 --> 57:56.960
I'm not actually going to do anything about that. There are foreign policy criticisms that could be

57:56.960 --> 58:03.120
made, but it is true. No new wars were started under Trump. I like that. I don't like wars.

58:03.120 --> 58:08.240
What do you think about his handling of COVID? Can you say what are the pros and cons of his

58:08.240 --> 58:13.760
handling of COVID? The con for him is he'd be president right now if he had handled it differently.

58:14.400 --> 58:20.480
I think it's abundantly clear. Early on, and there's now a lot of really good reporting about

58:20.480 --> 58:26.000
the conversations he was having with Jared Kushner and others. He became convinced either because

58:26.000 --> 58:29.280
of things he was being told or because he decided this is the way it's going to be.

58:29.280 --> 58:34.880
This is going to go away. Fine. It's in China. Okay. It's in China and Italy. Okay. We have 15

58:34.880 --> 58:40.800
cases, but it'll soon be zero. We'll be opened by Easter of 2020. None of it happened.

58:42.480 --> 58:48.480
If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan and I've said this to

58:48.480 --> 58:54.080
Patrick Bet-David, and they tend to all see my side of this. If Trump had said, listen,

58:54.960 --> 59:01.120
we don't know how bad this is going to be, but I care too much about the American people to

59:01.120 --> 59:07.280
take a shot. It's not going to be two weeks. It's going to be a little bit, but I need your help.

59:07.280 --> 59:10.880
We're going to bring everybody together. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican.

59:10.880 --> 59:15.120
We're going to have MAGA masks, and you could have kept 50 cents on the dollar to pay off,

59:15.120 --> 59:22.240
store me or whoever. But it would have been, I think he wins reelection because the perception

59:22.240 --> 59:28.800
was, and reality is a version of that, the perception was that he was way too cavalier

59:28.800 --> 59:36.720
about it early on. People died who didn't need to die. I think that it was arguably

59:37.760 --> 59:42.880
the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that he was going to get himself

59:42.880 --> 59:47.520
reelected. Well, to push back on that, I mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns

59:47.520 --> 59:52.080
kind of a solution to COVID. I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy.

59:54.080 --> 59:59.200
There's several solutions to a pandemic, broadly speaking, and one of them is vaccine,

59:59.920 --> 01:00:07.120
and so you didn't mention that. He'd fast-tracked the development. His administration fast-tracked

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.320
the development of the vaccine, which, surprising, he didn't really take much credit for.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.360
I think he did. I think he tried. There's a couple, there's a lot there.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:23.200
Well, to me, it seems like you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures that

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.040
his decisions for fast-tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.360
You could, in the Trumpian way, make that case.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.080
So a couple different things. I know you don't necessarily follow Trump's rallies as closely

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:46.320
as I do, and I'm jealous of you for that, but he did tout the vaccine stuff hugely for a while

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:54.000
until his audience turned against him, and then he had to draw this line where he was going,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.920
I made the vaccines, which none of you have to take, by the way,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.840
freedom. You don't have to take them, but it's fantastic, and nobody else could have done it,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.920
but don't worry, nobody's going to make you take the vaccine. And he actually got booed at a couple

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.040
of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines. But let's back up a little bit.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.920
Fast-tracking. My understanding of what he did is he did what any president in his situation would

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.400
do and what many world leaders elsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to pre-purchase supply

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.240
of vaccine in order to provide money to pharmaceutical companies to scale up the manufacturing,

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:34.080
which is absolutely fine. But he wants, one of the stories he tells is it usually takes

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:41.680
12 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months, thanks to me. Decades of mRNA technology

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:48.320
being developed created the platform in which you can make a particular vaccine in nine months,

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.360
didn't have anything to do with Trump. He did pre-fund and say, we will buy huge supply,

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.240
and that provided liquidity to the pharmaceutical companies. But he also delegated control to

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.760
to people, to experts that enable that kind of fast-tracking of vaccines.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.400
He was very eager for the FDA to approve it because he saw that there would be a political

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.400
benefit. And he didn't get in the way, I guess. He didn't get in the way. Fair. I think now we're

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.640
on the same page. He did not get in the way of vaccines being developed, which is good.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.280
Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.400
I don't disagree with that. I'm not aware of really any governments that got in the way.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.680
I mean, it seemed given the global situation, everybody, European countries were pre-purchasing

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.920
vaccine. African countries were who were going to be later to receive vaccines, were partnering

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.560
with the European countries that had pre-purchased. But the most interesting thing about all of this

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:50.000
is Trump did play up the vaccines for a long time until his crowd didn't want to hear about it

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.040
anymore, which was crazy. It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created,

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.400
to some degree. One of the effects of all this that makes me truly sad is this division over

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.640
the vaccines has created distrust in science. And also what makes me sad is the scientific

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.640
leaders, Anthony Fauci, being one of the representatives of that community,

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.600
I would say completely dropped the ball. They spoke with arrogance.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.240
They spoke down to people. They spoke in a way that a great scientist does not speak,

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.760
which is they spoke with certainty, without humility. They have all the wisdom and all

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.000
of us are too dumb to understand it, but they're going to be the parent that tells us exactly

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.600
what to do versus speaking to the immensity of the problem, the deep core of the problem,

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.800
being the uncertainty. We don't know what to do. The terrifying thing about the pandemic,

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.200
we don't know anything about it as it's happening. And so you have to make decisions. You have to

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:02.480
take risks about, well, maybe you have to overreact in order to protect the populace. But it's in the

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:09.760
face of uncertainty. They have to do that, not empowered by science somehow. And the deep

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:19.120
expertise that somebody like Anthony Fauci claims to have. I'm really troubled by the

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.600
distrust in science that resulted from that. And you have to blame the leaders to the degree.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.800
Leaders take responsibility. And I think Anthony Fauci was the scientific leader behind

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.560
the American response to the pandemic. And I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:45.120
of science. I don't know if interested is the right word, but the Fauci review

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.720
is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you mentioned,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.040
which is the distrust in science. And sometimes I'll get voicemails or emails from people in my

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:04.000
audience who say that I have had to backpedal on certain things related to this. And one of the

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.160
things I tried to do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when we really didn't

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.360
have complete information. So there was this period where hydroxychloroquine was first sort

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:22.720
of mentioned as a possible treatment, prophylactic or proactive treatment for COVID or active treatment

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.600
for COVID, along with a bunch of other stuff. There was ivermectin, there was vitamin D,

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:34.960
there were all sorts of different things. And I tried to be careful to say, right now, we don't

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.800
have rigorous science that tells us that some of these things work. It doesn't mean that won't come

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.960
in the future, at which point, if there was something as cheap as hydroxychloroquine that

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:52.000
treated COVID effectively, unbelievable, fantastic. It's not, there's no way it ever will be determined.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.800
We don't have that information right now. So it's not super wise right now to go and start

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:02.640
taking this stuff. We eventually learned, like with vitamin D, having an appropriate vitamin D

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.680
level does seem to be, based on what I most recently read, generally protective and a good

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.240
thing when it comes to infections of different, great. Okay, so that one we figured out.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:21.200
One of the really difficult things is that the quote truth about the vaccines did change. And

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.920
the original, again, this is all, I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone who's synthesizing

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:34.960
the medical data and writing about it. Originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.160
did seem to be very effective, not only at preventing death and serious illness,

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:45.120
but also transmission. There were people then saying it doesn't prevent transmission.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.200
Over time, as the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that. At that

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.440
point, I started telling my audience something different because as far as I was concerned,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:02.320
the reality on the ground had changed. In my mind, that's how science works. It's not backpedaling.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.800
It's we're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.120
Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends, virologists and biologists,

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.360
they have way more humility than people like Anthony Fauci who was speaking about this,

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.840
or the CEO of Pfizer who was speaking about this. This is the fundamental problem here,

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:30.480
is the way science works is there's usually a lot more humility and a lot more transparency about

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:38.000
what we know and what we don't know. And people like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.920
for the world if he speaks with more certainty. But because of the political division that formed

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.920
around that, that certainty resulted and became completely counterproductive, that people didn't

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:55.840
trust anything about the vaccine, didn't trust any institutions that contained the experts that

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.080
actually knew what they were doing, and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of the

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:06.320
mouths of scientists, some large percentage of the population. So that made you completely

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:14.160
ineffective at scale as a society trying to respond to a terrible pandemic. And that's where I

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:20.800
put a lot of blame on leaders. So political leaders and scientific leaders are the ones that

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.280
should inspire us to all get together and respond. That should be the case for the pandemic.

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.560
That should be the case in the time of war, all this kind of stuff.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.840
I generally agree with you. And for me, it's really about shared blame. And there were a lot

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.320
of different reasons why that the early communication wasn't good. Part of it was,

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:47.840
I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy rather than overconfidence. I would prefer, listen, we don't

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.840
really know right now whether masks do X or Y. What we do know is the supply is really limited

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.320
of this type of mask. We're going to try to keep them for the frontline workers. I love that.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.480
That's the way I want to be communicated to. A call was made to do it differently,

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.440
which was to say the masks don't actually help. But the real reason is they want to keep them

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.400
for healthcare workers. And then later, the masks are what's going to solve. I'm with you 100%.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.880
I think the other layer to it is you can't ignore the political situation at the time.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.880
If Trump had one reelection and the vaccine distribution had taken place while Trump was

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.640
president rather than Biden, my belief is that the same number of Democrats would have gotten

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.680
vaccinated, but way more Republicans would have as well because they were following not science

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.480
but political leaders. And when it was Biden in DC instead of Trump, a lot of those people said,

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.360
I don't trust the vaccine. But wait, it's Trump's vaccine, I thought. Yeah, but something about the

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.840
way Biden's distributing it. So I do think you can't ignore that political layer. I agree with

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.360
you the communication was a disaster. Let me ask you about Joe Biden. What are the strengths

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.880
and weaknesses of Joe Biden? Weaknesses, I think, are some of the things you've identified.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:11.120
He is not seen as high energy. He is not the same Joe Biden that debated Paul Ryan in 2012

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:20.640
and ran circles around him in just an incredible debate performance. He is not inspiring in the way

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.400
that someone like a Barack Obama was to people coming up and starting to get interested in

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:33.680
politics. I think a lot of those are fair criticisms. I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.840
of the things that younger voters are interested in. I mentioned cannabis reform. I mentioned

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:48.320
student loans. So I think that that's a deficit for Biden. I think the upside to Biden is when it

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:55.120
comes to foreign policy, diplomacy, high-level negotiations, knowing how to engage with allies

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.880
in a productive way, it's tough to find someone with more experience than Biden. I know that there

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.680
are counterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include, that was the old Biden, the new Biden

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.400
doesn't have it. That includes, that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.440
Nobody should be around that long in politics. Perfectly reasonable criticisms to talk about.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:22.800
But I do see that as one of his strengths. And he also is good at knowing when he can work with

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:30.240
Republicans and when he can't and not wasting more time than is sort of expected for posturing

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.760
reasons. And I think that that's a good thing. Do you think he's actually there? So in day-to-day

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:42.320
operational government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think he is an active

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.560
and practicing executive? I don't know that I can say that it's because of what may be going on

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:56.640
cognitively, but my sense from the people I talk to is that he's very much involved in the highest

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:04.160
level geopolitical and big domestic economic stuff, but that a lot of the smaller issues that

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.200
presidents might or might not be in sort of plugged into, that he's not plugged into the

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.960
details of a lot of the lower level stuff. I mean, you could probably apply the same exact

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.000
criticism even more so towards the Donald Trump administration in terms of being a practicing

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.920
active executive who's paying attention. Like for example, like Vladimir Putin is somebody

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.640
who loves the role of the executive, has a huge amount of meetings, has constantly tracking

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.560
information about agriculture and all the different subsystems of government. Stalin,

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.480
funny enough, was also extremely good at this. So certain people just love the job of being an

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:53.520
executive. And I'm not sure if Donald Trump did and I'm not sure if Joe Biden in his current

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.200
state has the cognitive capability to. That's a good question. Kim Jong-un's another one,

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:06.720
by the way. There's videos of him examining a factory where they make plates and making very

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.560
specific comments about how the plates should be made. I think that in that case, there's a lot

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.560
of propaganda value to it. With Trump, I think you're probably right. He did get involved in

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.440
the minutiae of things. I mean, once he pulled out a weather map and with a Sharpie drew a

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.800
different hurricane path that was more politically convenient to him. That's pretty micro, saying

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.520
the weather channel is wrong. I see what you did there. Okay. So that's a micro. He went to

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.400
Puerto Rico and he gave out paper towels after a hurricane. Now he was shooting them like free

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.920
throws, which didn't look very good. So he will get involved in the micro when it's advantageous.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.760
You know what I mean? But I do agree with you that he wants to just kind of make it so. Build

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.080
the wall. I don't know. Just build it. Figure it out. Get it done. Quick pause. Bath and break?

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:56.320
Sure. You're hilarious. And just for the sake of completeness, I should mention,

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.000
the subreddit wouldbiden has done. There's also what Trump has done, but it's not as active.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.520
And it has like this master list of all the accomplishments. I recommend people look at it

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:14.400
because there's a kind of rigorous and interesting with links list of all the things he's done.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:21.520
Just list some of them restored daily press briefings, cancel the Keystone pipeline, reverse

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.240
Trump's Muslim ban, required masks on federal property, rejoins the Paris climate agreement,

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.680
extends student loan payment freeze, extend eviction freeze, historic stimulus bill,

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.480
as you mentioned, ends funding for border wall, and so on and so forth DACA,

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.320
border strengthening of DACA, rejoins the World Health Organization. And the timing of this,

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:48.240
of course, is important. Yeah, several historic stimulus bills, which of course,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.920
you could criticize or support, raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and federal employees

01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:02.560
for $15. There's a lot. There's a lot. It makes you realize with both Trump and Biden that there's

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:09.920
a bunch of small details that matter, like that matter on people's lives, like actual little

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:17.040
policies. Trump did a lot of stuff as far as I heard for the military, like not big stuff,

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.240
but small stuff. Yeah, I'd be curious what you're thinking of. I mean, I know one of the

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.520
big things under Trump was we're going to get trans people out of the military.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.480
That's not what I was referring to. You weren't referring to that. Trump's hilarious with these

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.640
stories that he tells, and one of the stories, and you get to know them if you follow him at all,

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.760
he tells the story, you know, when I came into office, the generals came to me and they said,

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.640
sir, the cupboards are bare. We have no bullets. And so I rebuilt the military. You know, the

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.280
cupboards were bare when Obama left it and it was just terrible, but I rebuilt it and the generals,

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.960
I've got the best generals, they said, sir, it's incredible what you were able to do. You look

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:59.040
into it and it's like, yeah, that's not really true. Like it is true that there are armaments that

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.280
just like on a schedule do get replaced and that's part of the military industrial complex, but

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.480
there's nothing like special Trump really did. But these stories become, they take on like a life

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.560
of their own. And it's interesting to sometimes try to dig down and figure out like, was there any

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.200
policy connected to that? Or is that just a story? Do you think it's possible to have a good conversation

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:23.520
with each of them? Donald Trump and Joe Biden in a podcast context or in a debate context?

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.240
Absolutely. Yeah. You're saying like, could I with either of them? Oh, 100%.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.200
Joe Biden too? Sure. Yeah. But can you dig into that a little more?

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.320
Well, I mean, I don't know what, I think there's maybe something implicit in your question,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.800
but that's deeper about the nature of politics and politicians. Yes.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:48.800
I think with either of them, I mean, the political differences wouldn't be an impediment to having

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:55.520
a good conversation with either of them. I think one of the things that's really tough in my experience

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.680
when talking to elected officials is they could be super interesting about 100 different topics,

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:09.120
but handlers decide or try to get you to talk about something you don't really care about and

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.720
something really narrow, which doesn't bring out your best nor their best. And that's a frustration.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.640
But I think that given an unstructured three-hour conversation, I think it would be interesting

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.400
to talk to both. I mean, listen, with Biden, aside from his view on cannabis or whatever,

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:31.520
his background and the incredible unimaginable family tragedy that he had in his first wife

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:39.120
and multiple kids dying. I mean, it's just incredible. And with Trump, I think also you

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.720
could have an interesting conversation. Yeah, those are the human beings with a life story.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.400
And they're some of the most successful humans who have ever lived to have

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.880
rose to this highest office in interesting complex ways. Yes.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.680
I mean, one of the things I'm troubled by maybe you can speak to is why we're so negative

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:07.440
towards presidential candidates and presidents. Why? It's just they go through this shit storm,

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.520
no matter who they are. Yeah. They're like hated. Like all the conspiracy theories and just

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:20.560
the dynamics of how we talk about them is vicious. If you just look at reply,

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:28.160
Steven Barack Obama on Twitter, it's like, what is going on here? Why? Because we look at other

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:34.320
leaders and other spaces and we're generally positive about it. Yeah, there's a couple different

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.320
things. There's this dynamic, which is really unfortunate, which is you ask people, do you

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.000
approve of the job a particular president is doing? And very often, if at any point, while they were

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.920
in office, they did something you don't like, people will say, I don't approve. And so by its

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.920
nature, what that means is just like the longer you're in office, the lower your approval ratings

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.600
going to be. And very often, that's the way it works. I mean, there's major events like 9-11,

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.560
Spike George W. Bush's approval to an incredible level, then it came back down with the Iraq War.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.440
But there's this unfortunate thing that when people are just asked,

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:13.040
you think Biden's doing a good job? If four months ago, Biden did something on healthcare

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.280
that somebody didn't like, even if you like most of it, a lot of people from that point forward

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.200
will say, I don't approve. They might still vote for them because they like him better than the

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:26.080
alternative or whatever. It's just the dynamic of politics. And I agree, it's very...

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.760
Does it have to be that way? Do you think?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.640
I don't think it has to be that way. But to unwind it, so many things would have to change.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.840
I think our election system is part of why politics is the way it is, where you have two choices,

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.880
and it's first past the post. And we have this electoral college, so that depending on which

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.280
state you vote in, the kind of meaning and significance of your vote is different. If you

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:54.640
vote in Montana, it's the Republican candidate, it's going to win, and that changes the dynamics.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:01.280
I think that's part of it. I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.360
a lot. We've become, and by we, I mean people in the United States to some degree who talk

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:13.360
about this stuff, we've become uncomfortable when there is disagreement, and it bleeds over into,

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.760
now we can't have a normal interpersonal relationship anymore. I'm from Argentina,

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:24.160
and in Argentina, it's really common, even in my family. There are incredibly heated political

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.880
debates at the start, the middle, the end of some kind of gathering. But then everybody just goes

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:36.080
back to like, okay, we disagree on some things, but that's okay. And we can now go and finish

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:41.040
cooking the beef or whatever it is that we're doing. And I experienced this even with people who

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.320
come up to me on the street, and they go, just earlier today, a guy came up to me and he said,

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:52.560
RFK all the way, baby, talking about Bobby Kennedy Jr. And I just kind of, I said, oh,

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.840
all right, let's see what happens. And then there was another moment where the guy ended

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.520
up standing next to me for maybe longer than he thought, and I could tell this guy's getting so

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.280
awkward because it was an utterance he thought that would just be on the fly and he'd be gone.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.760
But now we're standing next to each other waiting for our sandwiches. It's like no big deal. It's

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:15.280
just, oh, okay, you like Bobby Kennedy Jr. I don't plan to vote for it. It's fine. And that's like

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.720
a socio-cultural thing. I think there's lots of other countries. I've spent time in Italy. I have

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.040
relatives in Israel where like shouting at each other is sort of like normal. And then you just

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.680
go back and finish them. It sounds like shouting. I'm sort of exaggerating, but very animated,

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:34.480
what seemed like big disagreements. And then everybody's cool. I wish it were more normal.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:40.880
So maybe the mechanism of going from shouting to being cool again needs to improve. Because maybe

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.760
we can't solve the shouting at each other. Maybe not. So maybe we need to somehow figure out the

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.960
de-escalation, like making up. I've had a few recent fights with friends like that.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:22:03.920
For politics. No. But political style, emotionally drenched stuff. And it was interesting to go

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.960
through that full process and then make up at the end, but it was a process. And it was a process

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:16.000
that required being in person and talking through it. And it was stressful, the whole thing. And

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.200
maybe because most of our interactions are online, we don't get a chance to do that in person,

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:26.160
making up again. I don't know, but do you think it's a feature or a bug of the system that we're

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:33.920
so, we just hate the powerful? You mentioned the online part. You mentioned it earlier perfectly,

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:41.520
which is you take contentious political issues. You create a platform that rewards

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:47.760
controversy and disagreement and limits the number of characters you can use to express yourself.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:54.640
You kind of throw it into a baking dish and mix the entire thing up. It's complete and total chaos.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.200
And one of the things that I've talked before about all the angry emails and threats and stuff

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.480
that I get, I'm acutely aware that if I had in person conversations with most of these people,

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.840
the conversations would basically be like, oh, we have different views about how to solve some

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:16.000
of the problems we're facing. We probably agree about what the problem is. And we probably share

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.600
many values. But on these particular four issues, we may have very different views. But that's okay.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:30.000
Online, that's not the case. And it leads to the mess that we get ourselves in. But I think

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.840
that it's a feature of a lot of the systems that are being used to disseminate information.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:42.800
Again, let me linger on that. Do you regret some of the mockery and the snark you use on Twitter

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.080
and even in your show that feeds that division?

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:55.840
I don't regret it in the sense that it's a calculated part or tool that I use in addition to

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:01.120
figuring out how to simplify complicated concepts and choosing stories that I think are

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:08.480
underrepresented. It's all part of the package of what I'm doing. I recognize that my show is not

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:17.520
the audio visual version of a peer reviewed, randomized controlled trial about views on abortion

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:23.840
or whatever the case. I'm very much aware of that. But I don't regret including it as a tool

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.840
that I've used to build the community in some total that I've built over the last more than

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:35.040
10 years. I guess I could ask about the different trajectories you think your show might take. So

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.400
the dynamic you had with Donald Trump Jr. and maybe Candice Owens is the more appropriate

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:47.440
comparison. Are you okay having that dance for the next few years between you and Candice Owens

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:54.640
and just the mockery, the division that's a part of that process and taking part in that?

01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:06.800
I'm fine with it in the sense of personally, I tolerate it well until it crosses the line

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:14.480
and people pull my family in. If we set the family stuff aside, just in the digital space,

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.440
you're okay with that. Now the truth is Candice Owens has had me blocked for years up until

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.960
this incident. She unblocked me. She unblocked me just to tweet about what I tweeted about.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.440
I don't know the backstory of that genuinely. I have no idea. So I don't have a sense that

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.160
she's super interested in engaging with me on that. But all of these people, I mean, Candice

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.560
Owens is welcome on my show anytime. Don Jr. is welcome on my show anytime. It's been a decade

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.880
since I had Ben Shapiro on. He's welcome anytime. I'm glad to have these conversations and I think

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:50.480
it's an important thing. And also, I wish that everybody was willing to have the conversations

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.800
in good faith rather than as performance. It's not even really performance art,

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.680
rather than being simply performative for an audience that you have.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.640
In terms of your motivations, do you worry about the effects of something you spoke about offline

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:12.560
or the YouTube algorithm? Are you driven by the number of views your videos get?

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:18.800
Or are you driven by something else? So in my world, I guess I would say,

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:27.520
the number of views that any platform generates is a metric that I can choose how to interpret.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.160
I can choose to interpret it as I've created content that's interesting to people

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.520
or I've created content that's really angering people and that's why they're showing up. They

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.360
don't actually like it. It's because they're angry or whatever else the case may be. But

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.000
it is true that there are algorithmic changes that can take place. Something happened in early

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.200
January that affected us on YouTube or there are periods on TikTok where you can tell we're

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.560
doing all the same things, something has happened and then you never usually figure out what it is.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:02.560
So for me, it's sort of just like a general tool to see what is the level of interest in what I'm

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.600
doing and are the numbers so out of whack with what I would expect that I should look into whether

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.520
something deeper is happening. Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:18.480
may be? I had a debate once with someone who accused me of using clickbait to generate views

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.800
and we had a really interesting conversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:29.680
Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent what's in the video?

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.640
No, what's in the title is in the video. I go, okay, so it's not that the title is dishonest.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.840
Are you saying I'm deliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience?

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.800
And they said, yeah, that's kind of what I mean. And I said,

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.480
isn't that kind of what we're all doing? The alternative would be choosing titles

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.480
to generate a smaller audience, which seems like a real kind of waste of time. So

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.760
I'm trying to navigate and play the game in a way that's comfortable,

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.160
but use the metrics more as a tool than as something to obsess over.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:07.280
Nevertheless, the metrics are what they are and that they are able to affect your psyche.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.080
It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views and all that

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:21.680
on YouTube for me. It's difficult not to let it affect how you think about ideas.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.280
So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.400
generated very few views. It's difficult for you to still care about healthcare.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:39.440
There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views. And I think that's

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:47.040
a really dangerous thing. Mostly it's probably beneficial because it probably makes you a better

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.200
presenter. If you do care about a topic a lot, you become more charismatic, more you learn

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.440
sort of in Jimmy, Mr. Beast, the way how to present the ideas better. But it also can affect

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.520
which topics you choose to cover, what you choose to think about those topics,

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.360
audience capture those topics. And that's a really scary effect. I'm really worried about my own

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:16.800
mind in that. So I run from that aggressively. One of the things that I include in my overall

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:23.040
approaches, I don't think about any one clip. I think about an entire show or a week of shows

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:30.240
or a month of shows. And so it's less about does anyone clip do well. My view going in is

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.880
I'm going to do stuff that won't do that well, but I think it's really important to do. And I

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:40.400
want to make it part of my show. And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence,

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.720
I know that that's not going to get 500,000 or a million views. I know it's just not going to.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:52.160
And the first day it'll get 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care. That's fine. There's a group of people

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.800
in my audience that values this stuff. And I want to keep doing this stuff. I'll end up surprised

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:03.600
sometime. And two weeks later has 150,000 views because it started being shared. Great. But I

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:10.320
don't go into it thinking these all need to be home runs by that metric. I always go in saying I

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.880
want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that is less titillating and salacious,

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.200
but is important to do. It's more researched, etc. And so that's the way I try to resist exactly

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.280
what you're talking about. And I think you have to probably know yourself. For me, metrics,

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.840
I just like numbers too much. And for me, metrics do affect me. That's just why I don't pay attention

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:36.960
at all. I would love to hire somebody in the team who cares because we currently have folks who

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:43.360
just all of us just don't care because he probably is good to care enough to kind of just do good

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:49.280
thumbnails and this kind of stuff to pay attention. But to me personally, I just find inner peace and

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:56.320
focus if I don't think about the numbers at all. Because I find myself... I just remember a long

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:04.320
time ago when I started a podcast, I would think that I failed if it didn't do well. Like if I didn't

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:08.880
celebrate the person well enough, I didn't do a good job enough of a conversation. Well,

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:14.560
that's not necessarily at all what that means. It's hard not to... This is tough stuff. I mean,

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:22.160
yeah, I know exactly what you're saying. And part of it is... I mean, it starts in my... You have a

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.800
little bit of a different situation than me because you're doing long form conversations with people

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:31.520
and the prep is a little bit different. One of the things in my space because I'm reacting mostly

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.360
to what's going on in the news and then also picking topics to dive into a little bit more deeply

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:41.360
is I have very little control over the news cycle. And there is a meta metric or a macro

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:47.920
metric that affects me that will quadruple my audience and then take 75% of it away,

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:54.480
which is the seasonality of election cycles. And the first few election cycles, it's very tough

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.000
because I go, it's October. I'm like, at this rate, we're going to have 20 million subscribers by

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.320
the next... These numbers are unbelievable. And then it's January 30th, the inauguration's over,

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:12.960
the debate is about the debt ceiling and nothing's going on. And I go, nobody's watching my content.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:19.360
I must have forgotten to upload a... Something must be wrong. It's completely beyond my control.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.320
So I just... And I think part of what you're saying is I try to focus on the things I can control

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.280
and understand those that I really have no control over whatsoever and try not to worry about them.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:37.120
And try to do the things that make you happy at the end of the day. You mentioned RFK, the guy you

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:43.040
met. What do you think about some of the other candidates outside of Joe Biden in the Democratic

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:49.520
Party, RFK Jr.? What do you think of him as a candidate? I've met him. We once had dinner and

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.920
we have a number of friends in common, which is what makes this a little more awkward. But I think

01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:03.760
his campaign is basically sort of like a chaos candidacy to raise awareness and maybe raise

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:08.640
money either for his book or his anti-vaccine organization, Children's Defense Fund, I believe

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:13.840
it's called. I think there's some reporting that Steve Bannon really liked the idea of him running

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:19.760
as a Democrat, again, to just generate chaos. I don't find it super interesting. I don't find

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:28.400
it worthy of that much discussion. Smart guy, nice guy, has been doing anti-vaccine work that I

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:33.440
don't find particularly inspiring for a long time. So it's not just anti-COVID vaccine? It's more

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.440
broader than that? He's been in that space long before the COVID vaccines. Yeah. Yeah, I don't

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:43.840
find it super interesting. Well, he also wrote the book The Real Anthony Fauci. Is that the name

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:49.200
of the book? Did he write that? That's interesting. I don't know. I'm not sure about that. I'm aware

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:55.680
of that book. I didn't know he wrote it. I think, but it's been on my reading list to get... I've

01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:02.400
been trying to get a good balanced reading list about the COVID pandemic to understand what the

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:09.920
hell happened. And anytime I start to try to go into that place, I'm exhausted by it. Well,

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.520
it's interesting to me that you wouldn't wait longer before delving into those books to have

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:24.880
maybe a more clear hindsight. But I think this is a pretty good time. You don't think so. It depends

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:30.160
on your goals. If you're thinking of it as a historical event, yes, you should probably wait

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:38.400
longer. But if you're thinking about understanding what is broken about our system that we responded

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:44.000
so poorly, that there was so much division, what is broken about our political system that

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:50.320
it didn't unite us. It divided us. Who's to blame? There's probably a lot of different

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:55.120
narratives. But I feel like the more you learn about this, the better you can understand. I read

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.440
on just Vladimir Putin, I read like five biographies already, maybe more.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:06.800
Just it helps to really understand the people involved, the organizations involved. I don't

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:12.720
know. Everything from the scientists to the political leaders. It felt like the blog posts and

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.360
the tweets didn't quite cap it. They didn't quite cap it. No, one of the things I read a ton,

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:24.080
I don't read any modern political books, so I don't read the memoirs of elected officials.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:30.320
I just feel like I get enough of it in my job. So my reading list is just other things. It's

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:36.560
history, it's narrative nonfiction, economics, et cetera. And that's my bias because I'm so

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.560
overloaded with a lot of the stuff you're talking about. I haven't read any of Obama's books.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.400
I didn't read John Bolton's book. I don't read any of that stuff,

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.720
although I'm sure there is value to be gleaned from it.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.640
What about the other candidate that, according to the subreddit, and as you mentioned,

01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:01.760
you've criticized a little bit, Marianne Williamson. Do you think, what are the pros and cons of her

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:08.880
as a candidate? This is another area where many in my audience really are angry with me. I don't

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.680
find her candidacy super interesting. I'll tell you the pros and the cons as I see them.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:18.560
I do think that we have elected officials in the US, particularly presidents,

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:25.360
from a really narrow range of backgrounds. So it's lawyers and sometimes business people,

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.560
very, very often lawyers. I think we would benefit from a much greater diversity of backgrounds.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:36.320
And I once said, and that would include people from education, people from the science world,

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.240
people with backgrounds maybe running nonprofits, et cetera. Now, Marianne Williamson did, I guess,

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:44.720
at one point, run some kind of small nonprofit. And some in my audience thought that credential alone

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:49.840
would make me fall head over heels in love with the idea of a Marianne candidacy. I've interviewed

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:57.840
for her. It's just not for me is the way I like to say it. The background of the woo-woo type stuff

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:04.640
is a bit off-putting to me. I understand that someone with literal Christian Bible beliefs

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:11.040
that also I don't like, maybe I'm more willing to accept, as most of our presidents, of course,

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:17.120
have had those views because they're otherwise more qualified. But some of the things that she

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:23.440
says just strike me as, I just don't know. I'll give you an example. When she was on with Russell

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.360
Brand, she said, there's no such thing as clinical depression. It just means someone in a clinic

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.720
told you you have depression. I don't believe that to be the case. I think we have an understanding.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.160
There's two types of depression. There's like a genetic predisposition depression.

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:43.680
There's like a acute something's happening in my life, temporary depression. When she was asked

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:49.760
about it recently, she said, I didn't mean it. I was just trying to impress Russell Brand.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.440
I don't know if I'm more bothered by the thing she first said or by the fact that she wanted to

01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:01.200
impress Russell Brand. But it's just like, it's just really not for me. And I agree with her on,

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.400
we need to take the climate more seriously. We need to expand access to health. I'm with

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:11.840
all of that stuff. Now, I want to say one other thing about this. Anybody who wants to run should

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:18.720
run. I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested primary for Joe Biden. Absolutely.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.320
So you think it should be contested? Well, what I mean by contested is so there's two

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:26.560
parts to what we mean by contested. Will the DNC organize debates? And we'll get to that in a second.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.000
But should anybody who's on the left get out of the way because Joe Biden is president and he's

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.680
running for reelection? Absolutely not. The question about, should there be debates? I would

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:44.240
like there to be debates. The DNC pretty clearly isn't going to organize them. I think if you did

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.520
them, you would have to say at what polling level do you qualify? And I don't know exactly where you

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:54.400
put that number. But I think it would be a great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage with, if you

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.280
can get what, 6%, 8%. I'm not really sure what the number would be. I'm totally all for that.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.600
Why is a set of candidates, at least from my perspective, so weak?

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.480
Do you have an understanding of this? There's a lot of different answers to this.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.720
One aspect to this, which I think is more of a socio-cultural thing, which I've recently

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:21.360
read about to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at it

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.560
because of what you need to do to become president. And it includes

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.640
all but completely abandoning your existing day-to-day life job, which you may depend on,

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:40.560
and family to some degree. It's horribly negative, as we already talked about. And at the end of all

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.520
of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild, and maybe you're not in a position to be able to

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.840
do that, or you win. And then now you've got four years of being one of the most hated people,

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.320
no matter how good a job you do. So I think by its nature, it turns off a lot of people that

01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:02.160
would otherwise be good. I also think that there's a lot of posturing from within the parties about,

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.720
well, you might be good, but it's not your time yet, so you should wait. And then let's talk about

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.640
maybe a Senate seat here and there. So it's like a company, essentially, and they're figuring out

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.920
where they want to place people. I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.360
most people aren't super thrilled with. So it's difficult for somebody who's young or an outsider

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:28.720
to quickly become a candidate? I think that that's true. And I think also, in a lot of ways, it's

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.080
just not... I mean, would you want to be president? No. I mean, I can't because I wasn't born in the

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:40.400
U.S., so it's easy for me to say, but... If everyone says no, then we'll get the people that we have.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.080
No, I understand that. So I would love to help somehow.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.600
Sure. And I feel like there's not even a mechanism for helping, except through the

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.360
democratic, through the voting process. But I'm just annoyed how little technology there is in

01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.720
the whole process, how little innovation there is in the whole process, all of this.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:07.200
The sad thing is this is written about a lot, which is there's this thing called political

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:14.160
hobbyism. And I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are political

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:21.200
hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some degree. And I've written

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.280
a lot about how... I've read a lot and talked a lot about how, okay, we vote every two years or

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:32.000
every four years in our local elections, et cetera. And then we think about politics all the time.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.520
Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death. But what are you actually

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:43.120
going to do about the kids starving in this country and the nuclear buildup in that country?

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:48.480
It's okay. If everybody refocused their attention on their immediate communities, and that could mean

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.520
any number, it could mean the town or city you live in, or it might mean an athletic club or

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.160
whatever. If everybody, this time they spent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else,

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.440
which might put me out of a job, that's okay. I'm willing to lose my job because I think it

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.160
would be so beneficial. Then our communities would just be that much better, because you can

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.560
actually affect change in a much more tangible way locally, whether it's... People talk about

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:17.120
potholes, but other things as well. Yeah. And I wish our system was more amenable to that kind

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:23.440
of contribution, hopefully through the digital space it would be. Let me ask you about on the

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:30.080
Republican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him as a candidate running against Donald Trump?

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:36.480
I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:43.520
even started, has sort of started to implode. And this was something that I started thinking about

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:49.760
in September, October. He really doesn't seem ready for prime time in the sense that just being

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.200
confronted, and confronted's not even the right word, just being asked about some topics he didn't

01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:02.640
really seem to want to talk about, he responded in such a sort of disproportionate, unhinged way

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:08.640
during his recent trip to Asia. He was asked about, why aren't you or why are you responding,

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:14.160
but in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you? And he went into this weird bobblehead thing with

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.880
a weird smile, and something came out that didn't make any sense, and he sort of got mad at the

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.760
reporter. And it was just like, if you can't handle that, you can't be on a debate stage with

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.080
Donald Trump. And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage,

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:34.080
he can make you look pretty silly. He was recently asked about his role at Guantanamo Bay when he

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:40.640
was an officer in, I forget, which branch of the armed forces. And he just sort of attacked

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.640
the journalist asking the question, and it just looked very bad. And there are increasingly big

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.560
Republican donors who are not fans of Trump, and we're sort of hoping to put their eggs in the

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.080
Ron DeSantis basket, who are saying, this guy just doesn't have what it takes, I don't think he can

01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:59.520
do it. So I don't know if DeSantis will be able to get away. Once you're polling 20-something,

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:04.400
like he is, and you haven't even announced, it's very attractive. And he probably to some degree

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:10.720
is thinking, if I wait till 20-28, I might not have this opportunity again. But Trump's polling

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:17.440
52-53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump vote, he has to figure out

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.800
how to take something more from Trump. I just don't know how he does it.

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:25.360
First of all, the implosion aspect, that's part of the process, isn't it? You kind of implode

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.320
a bunch of times. And then rebuild yourself.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.280
And rebuild them because the new cycle kind of forgets.

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:39.200
It's possible. The problem is, the first debate is in August. So that's only a few months away.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:47.120
And the decision's going to have to be made pretty soon. And unless he can get a new momentum going,

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.600
I just don't know how he gets what he needs in order to really have a shot.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.920
So would anyone else run against Donald Trump?

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.360
It's very tough right now. I mean, there are other people running. There's this guy Vivek

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.560
Ramaswamy who's running. Nikki Haley is running. Her campaign basically dead on arrival.

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.800
Trump actually does better in polls the more people run. When it's just him and DeSantis,

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.400
that's the best scenario for DeSantis. It's not great for DeSantis, but it's certainly better.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.760
But I think the difficulty is, this is a question for Republicans to figure out.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.800
The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.760
still believe this guy's not good for their party. But many of them recognize that most of the voters

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:38.000
are still behind him. You can always say it's early. His polling doesn't really mean anything.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.240
Anything could happen. Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that lead.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:46.640
If he got more, if he was arrested two more times and had more indictments and it just

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.480
became like, this guy can't even campaign because he's so busy going from court to court,

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:54.000
maybe that would make a difference. It's really tough to imagine.

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.880
You said that there are three categories of people who vote Republican,

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:04.800
and that Trump introduced the fourth one. Can you go through the four categories?

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.320
Sure. So you've got your pro-business low tax Republicans. These are mostly people like Mitt

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:14.800
Romney. Mitt Romney has a bit of the social conservatism as well. He's Mormon and that's

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.480
there. But Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a Northeast sort of Republican, I mean,

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:23.680
I know Utah, but Governor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax pro-business type guy.

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:30.160
You've got your libertarian type Republicans who are primarily about freedom and liberty.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.160
Often they are actually more socially liberal where they go, I don't care about gay marriage,

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:41.280
I don't care so much about abortion. And that overlapped a little bit with the Tea Party

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.440
movement in 2010, although Tea Party did have a religious component, but sort of like the

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.600
libertarian freedom minded folks. And then the religious conservatives, people that support

01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:55.840
candidates like Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz, et cetera, where their big thing are social issues.

01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:02.000
Often they actually want Christianity being civil government. They don't want separation

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.240
of church and state. Those are traditionally the three Republican groups. The one that Trump

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:10.720
introduced was people who just didn't really pay attention to politics, but either followed

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:19.040
celebrity or had grievances that they didn't yet have a scapegoat for and were sort of right-leaning

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.560
culturally, even though they didn't attribute that to Republicanism. And Trump was able to

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.600
bring them into politics often for the first time as voters. They could be part of any of

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.440
those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of be their own thing. But they're more

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.680
kind of like cult of personality. I'm here for Trump types.

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:44.160
Did it have to do anything about the culture wars and the identity politics, all that kind of stuff?

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.240
Yeah. I mean, so in 2016, when Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues the way they are now.

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.960
So I think at that time, it certainly was not a factor.

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.200
What was the mobilizing issue? I don't know. It was just anti-Hillary in 2016.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.880
He did a good job on anti-Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying real economic problems, wage

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.720
depression, lack of jobs in parts of the country, Ohio and Indiana. Trump rightly identified. We

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.200
have an issue here. We don't have enough entrepreneurship, et cetera. But there was also a

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.960
lot of scapegoating that was China and people coming through the US-Mexico border were popular

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.440
scapegoats for a lot of those problems. This gets us kind of to populism.

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:35.840
Populism is a rhetoric, and populism as a rhetoric doesn't necessarily come with particular policies.

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:43.600
You can be a user of populist rhetoric and propose solutions that would be more aligned

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:49.120
with Bernie or Tucker Carlson. Populists will often identify the plight of the middle class.

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:55.360
The difference would be Bernie will say, we've got to put some restrictions on how much

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.240
billionaires can make, and we've got to reinvest in these social programs.

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:07.600
Tucker will say, BLM taking your house and a brown person from Mexico taking your job

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.280
are what we need to deal with. So the populist rhetoric can lend itself to very different

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.320
policy, and Trump used that very effectively in 2016.

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:22.960
Why do you think Hillary Clinton was hated as intensely as she was by a certain percent

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.720
of the population? It feels like that's the first election I witnessed where there's a lot of hate.

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:37.600
Maybe I'm misremembered. I don't remember Obama. I don't remember the degree of hate.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.520
There was conspiracy theories that he wasn't born in this country, but I don't remember

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.040
hate towards Obama. Record death threats under Obama more than any previous president.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.840
Towards him. Yeah. Do you mean more hate between voters?

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:58.400
Between voters, between voters, but that's I guess what I was speaking to, but that hate was

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:06.240
directed towards the narrative, the thread that connected all of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:13.760
Few different things. And I'm not ranking these. These are just all things that come to mind.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:20.640
One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time,

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.200
from her time as First Lady, through a senator, secretary of state, etc. So I think that

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.880
there was enough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards her for different

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:44.320
reasons. So time. Secondly, Trump's branding of her as crooked was very effective where there

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:49.600
were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned. If you ask them what is the crime,

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.240
they don't know. But she should definitely be locked up. That became a very big thing.

01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:04.320
The email story, as it were, and James Comey doing a second public event about that investigation,

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.840
even though there wasn't any actual news about it, just doing a second event about it at the last

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:13.840
minute, I think hurt her and also generated some hate. And I don't find Hillary Clinton to be

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:19.280
particularly likable, although I voted for her. I thought she was the better candidate. And I think

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:25.200
that there are others who also didn't find her particularly likable. Those are a lot of impediments

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.520
to becoming president. I was trying to understand why there's so many conspiracy theories about

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:36.800
Clintons in general, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And maybe I'm not researched well enough.

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:42.560
Of the why of it? The why of it, actually, the extent of the conspiracy theories,

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.360
the conspiracy theories that they've killed a lot of people, this kind of stuff.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
It's hard for me to speak to them because I'm aware that they exist, but I'm not an expert in

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.680
them because they seem so obviously baseless to the degree that I've researched them a little bit,

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:02.320
and then I move on. And it's been years since I've looked at this stuff. I know there's the Seth

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:08.480
Rich one and there's the Clinton body count one. I think there's one connected to Epstein,

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.520
if I recall correctly. There's all sorts of these different ones. Without speaking to any of them

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:19.280
specifically because I'm not the expert on Clinton conspiracies, it does seem as though

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:25.120
this stuff for so long has generated an audience. I mean, I remember in the supermarket

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:30.160
when Bill Clinton was president at the checkout seeing the tabloids and there were stuff about

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:36.000
Hillary birthing alien baby. It seems like it's been titillating to people for a very long time.

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:42.320
Well, another question from Reddit speaking of aliens. I would be curious to hear David's views

01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:48.160
on conspiracies and conspiracy theories, the extent to which real conspiracies happen,

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:54.400
and why conspiracies that have little evidence behind them managed to be so compelling to people

01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:01.440
regardless. Also, please bring up aliens and UAPs. Okay. Where do we start? The conspiracy. What?

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:10.240
So, what in general, as a person who thinks about politics, thinks about this world,

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:16.400
like where do conspiracy theories fit in for you? I think there have been conspiracies. And by

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:23.040
conspiracies, I'm using a colloquial definition, which is basically individuals working together

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:32.800
to, in a clandestine way, impact or affect some kind of event or phenomenon very, very broadly.

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:39.920
I mean, certainly that those things have happened. To jump around to some of the things that were

01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:46.800
in there, I think the reason that conspiracy theories are so compelling is that it's really

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:55.040
tough for a lot of people to accept there are random events, not predictable specifically,

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:59.200
at a stochastic level, we might be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable,

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:06.720
bad events in many ways. I could be the victim of one or you could or my family could. That's

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:12.480
really scary to a lot of people, understandably so. And for some people, it's less scary and more

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:18.880
soothing in a way to say there aren't really random events like this. Somebody planned it,

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:23.520
and if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would have

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:31.520
known exactly when. That's just a psychological level easier to accept for people. And I get that

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.520
to some degree because, listen, it's not the most exciting thing that everything can just

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.640
be going fine and something absolutely horrible happens and kills who knows some number of people.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:48.400
So I think that's the biggest attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories. It doesn't apply

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.600
to all of them though. But yeah, but there's still a basic understanding of human nature where

01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:02.160
some people are greedy and want power and are corrupted by power. So there's these compelling

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:12.720
narratives that stick that, I don't know, the vaccine is an opportunity for a powerful

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:19.360
billionaire to implant chips into you so you can control you further. Right. It doesn't seem,

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.480
what do I want to say? It's like, for some reason, that doesn't seem as crazy as it should.

01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:35.920
Because you think maybe Hollywood contributes to that. But you think, yeah, you could imagine

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:42.880
an evil person, a person that wants more control, more power, and is also at the same time able to

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:47.440
convince themselves, as history shows, that they're actually have the best interest of the populace

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:53.040
in mind, that they're trying to do good for the world. So they do evil while trying to do good.

01:55:53.040 --> 01:56:00.080
And you can kind of imagine it. So it's like, why not? And you listen to people in power,

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:10.880
authorities, they kind of look and sound shady. The transparency, especially the older ones,

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:16.480
I think younger folks are better at being real and transparent and just revealing their flaws

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:20.800
in the basic humanity. But people that are a little bit older in the positions of power,

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.240
they're more polished. It feels like they're presenting a narrative where the truth is hidden

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:33.280
in the shadows. I don't think there's anything wrong with suspecting. Maybe a public figure

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:39.120
isn't giving me the full story, totally reasonable thing to question. I don't think there's anything

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:46.000
wrong with exploring a lot of these different things. I think the problem becomes, and I know

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.640
you've talked about this in so many different ways with other guests, the problem becomes when we

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:56.640
lose a shared understanding of how we would assess whether any of these things are true.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:04.880
And then both alleged evidence and an absence of evidence both become supportive of the conspiracy

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:09.520
theory. Because if there's bad evidence, you manipulate it and say it's good evidence. If

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.000
there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried out

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.480
the thing or whatever. So unless we can have a shared understanding of how we would determine

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.120
what's true, these are common conversations often between atheists and religious folks.

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.040
How can we determine, is my faith in something or my desire for something to be true a good

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:32.240
way to evaluate whether it is true? They're really similar questions.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.520
Well, let me ask you about Trump on that front. About the election, 2020 election,

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.200
maybe the better question is about January 6th. Do you think January 6th was a big deal?

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.320
I do.

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.240
How big of a deal?

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:47.680
Compared to what?

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.000
Civil War.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.200
I think it was less of a big deal than the Civil War.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:00.400
It's a very interesting thing, though, because we have not only the event, that's clever,

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:07.760
actually. It's not only the event, but it's what led up to it and what has happened since and did

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:18.240
it change what is considered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they disagree

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:23.280
with the results of an election? So I think that there are further reaching consequences than just

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:29.120
was the six-hour period on January 6th, a bigger or smaller deal than the Civil War,

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:36.240
and there's so much wrapped up into it. Many conspiracy theories flowed from January 6th as

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:41.840
well. 60 Minutes recently featured a guy named Ray Epps, who was targeted by some on the right,

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:46.880
claiming that he was an instigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those lines.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.280
There were people claiming that no real, it was like a no true Scotsman sort of thing, like

01:58:53.280 --> 01:59:00.160
Trump supporters wouldn't riot. So by definition, it must have been Antifa, police let him in,

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.360
or police were, you know, all these different things. I think it was a big deal in a lot of

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:09.360
ways because it completely made us have to go back to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:15.680
of valid discussion and activism in the United States? But what aspect of the January 6th

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:25.360
was bad for you? Well, I mean, if you're thinking from a big philosophical political

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:33.200
perspective, so presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:40.480
is not the only metric to consider here. Absolutely. I think the sum total of what it means

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:46.880
about how the United States operates is what's most concerning, and I'll kind of just like

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:54.560
flesh it out a little bit. So summer of 2020, Trump's already saying they're going to cheat.

01:59:55.440 --> 02:00:01.520
Now, the polling is close, but it shows that Biden's in a good position. People aren't happy

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:07.280
with Trump. Any reasonable person would look and say it's going to be close, but Biden certainly

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:10.880
wouldn't be a crazy thing if Biden won. Trump's already saying they're going to

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:14.000
cheat with mail-in ballots, or they're going to cheat with early voting, or they're going to

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
cheat with machines, or we should do only in person, or whatever else the case may be.

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.640
We have the election. We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go,

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:28.800
some states stopped counting at 10 p.m., some states count all of the mail-in stuff up front,

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:35.120
some don't. Everything was completely predictable. At 2 a.m., Trump comes out and says,

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.640
I won. Okay, but where are you getting that, sir? As he claims people always refer to him,

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:47.040
where are you getting that? And with that statement, immediately we see that there is a

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:52.560
large portion of this country that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second,

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:59.200
the polling all said this was a real possibility. The counting schedules are all being adhered to.

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:07.440
But Trump won. That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't happen. It builds. People are donating

02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:12.960
millions to Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define, and lawsuits, which go nowhere,

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:17.600
and it builds and builds and builds. And we have a total separation from a factual reality.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:23.360
There's no reason to think, by December 1, give three weeks to look through some of this stuff.

02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.720
By December 1, there's no reasonable case to be made that Trump actually won. But it doesn't end

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:35.600
there. It goes into maybe we can just send different electors, even though Biden won Arizona.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:39.280
Let's just send, I don't remember how many electors it is in Arizona. Let's just send

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:43.760
Republican electors to say we vote for Trump. But that's not democracy. That's not the way

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:50.480
the system works. Let's make sure we're ready. Ready for what exactly? And then it builds to

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:57.520
maybe Mike Pence can just prevent Biden from being president, or maybe we can just interfere in

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:04.080
this other way. And then it gets to let's break into the Capitol. It's the height of saying

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:11.920
we no longer comport ourselves attached to what is a verifiable factual reality.

02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:19.920
And when we no longer do that, we're also willing to commit crimes, property crimes,

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:25.760
violent crimes, different degrees, in order to try to have something other than democracy.

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:29.600
It wouldn't be democracy if any of those things had happened.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:36.080
Yeah, I think it's not the height of it. I think there's still a case to be made that that

02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:44.240
did not leave the realm of protest versus a violation of the principles of democracy.

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:52.000
So to me, the height of what could happen on January 6th is if Donald Trump was much

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.600
better executive, he could take control of the military.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.480
If it had succeeded. No, not even succeeded. The attempt would have been more

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:08.480
empowered. I understand. So like the way not to bring up Hitler every other word,

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.440
which is something your subreddit also told me not to do. It's kind of an important figure.

02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.680
It's interesting to study that moment in history because it reveals so much about human nature

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.760
and that all of us are capable of good and evil. But thank you to your subredditor or

02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.480
redditor for your contribution to the conversation. I will keep bringing up

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:31.040
Hitler and the Third Reich and I'll keep bringing up Stalin. There's so much to learn from that.

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:40.720
Anyway, an effective practice authoritarian could roll the tanks out into the city streets

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:51.760
to establish order and in so doing pause the process of democracy as opposed to a few protesters

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:58.640
breaking in to a questionably protected building. I agree that what you're saying would be worse.

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.440
I don't want to use it to minimize what the protesters were intent on doing. They failed,

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:09.040
fortunately. To you, the intention was there. Well, the intention was Trump should remain

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.760
president. That's the intention. And to what lengths they would have been willing to go if

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.840
by the evening, early evening, they were sort of forced out. I don't know. I agree with you

02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.480
that Trump trying to use the military would absolutely be worse. There's these reports

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:27.760
that he tried to seize voting machines, which is kind of funny because it's like,

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:31.680
once you get the machine at Mar-a-Lago, what do you do with it exactly? I don't know. There's

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:37.280
like a comedic element to Trump sitting around with voting machines. But he did float trying to

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.560
do some other things. I don't believe there's reporting that he actually tried to use the

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:47.920
military. I wanted to what degree this opened the door to further things like this with other

02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:56.320
candidates, even in the Democratic Party also. Do you think there would be more and more

02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:02.000
questioning of the election results? There has been already. It's very clearly the playbook.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.840
Kerry Lake lost. She ran for governor in Arizona, 2022. She lost. What I mean by that is her

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:13.200
opponent received more votes. It's like very clear what it means that she lost. She insists to this

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:20.560
day that she won, to this day. She did the same grift Trump did about donate. We've got a case.

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:27.920
We won in the case. You didn't win. They just set a court date. Lies upon grift upon lies.

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:36.240
They did it then. It's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be part

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.480
of the playbook. Do you think people on the left will start doing it?

02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:44.800
I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say it never

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:49.120
could. It certainly could. People on the left could start using it as a tactic. Right now,

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:53.520
there's not a sign that that's going to happen, but it's certainly good. My expectation is,

02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:59.040
and I'm not a betting man, but I would bet money. If Joe Biden loses in November of 2024,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.840
he will say, I lost. He will call the winner. He will concede and he will leave the White House

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:11.520
in an orderly fashion. You don't think there will be claims of a hacked election? The ability to

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:19.200
hack elections is becoming more and more effective with the developments on the artificial intelligence

02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:26.160
side. The difficulty is you're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything

02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:30.800
about the election? Imagine there really was evidence of a hacked election. Then I would want

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:36.320
those claims to be made, but the way elections have gone in the past, I don't expect that that's

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:41.280
a claim that would be made. No. Speaking of evidence of things that were claimed,

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:51.120
what do you think about the Hunter Biden laptop? Or as you tweeted, the laptop from hell TM.

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:57.600
To what degree was this laptop story important and to what degree was it not?

02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:07.440
At this point, I have said many times, if there is any reason to believe that Hunter Biden, Joe

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:15.760
Biden, Naomi Biden, Jill Biden, Hillary, Obama, Doug, and if there's any evidence any of them

02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:21.920
committed a crime, they should be investigated, they should be charged, and they should be tried.

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:28.080
Period. The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long,

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:39.760
and we still have zero actual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly involving Joe Biden.

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:46.320
There's the claim from some that references to the big guy are about Joe Biden getting 10%

02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:50.960
for some illicit. It's been years they've been saying this, they've not been able to bring forward

02:07:50.960 --> 02:08:00.560
any evidence on it. My assessment of the Hunter Biden laptop is, it seems to mostly be a story

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:08.560
about nude images released without someone's consent, which is illegal in most states and violates

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:15.280
Twitter's own policies. That's the main story to me. Beyond that, I don't know how many people

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:19.600
have a copy of this hard drive at this point. Rudy had it. Tucker, do you remember when Tucker,

02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:27.680
this is unbelievable. Tucker said that he mailed himself a copy, a USB stick,

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:34.080
and it got lost in the mail. You have the mother load proving the criminality of Joe and Hunter

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:38.960
Biden. You just dropped it off with a stamp and it got lost in the mail. You don't have a backup

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:44.640
copy. I'm ready for the evidence to come forward. Hunter Biden has nothing to do with Joe Biden's

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:49.600
administration, but as a person who, if he committed a crime, charge him, investigate him,

02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:54.720
whatever. It's almost getting satirical, the degree to which they're talking about the Hunter

02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:00.720
Biden laptop. What do you think about the social media aspect of this, that story got censored?

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:07.120
What do you think about censorship in general on social media, that that story, during an

02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:15.440
important time in the electoral process, got censored? As a matter of principle, I think we

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:21.120
have to define what we mean by censorship, but I'm against censorship short of illegal content,

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:26.160
I guess is the way I would put it. I do respect the company's right to have terms of service and

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:30.960
to enforce them, as long as they're not illegal. If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content

02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:39.520
from Jewish people, okay, now we've got a problem on our hands. But what is dubious to me is the

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:46.400
claim that had people been able to see Hunter Biden's genitals, they would have voted for Trump,

02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:52.160
which I know it's like, David, you're making light of and, but at the end of the day,

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:57.360
what exactly is the claim that if you had known more about Hunter Biden, I guess,

02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.840
allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem and seeing pictures,

02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.640
you wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden? I mean, I know me as a voter, I don't feel that way.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:15.760
I think it's less about the content of the story and about the actions of a social media company

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:21.920
to control what you see and what you don't see. So you could imagine a social media company like

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.800
Facebook and Twitter making the same kind of decision about a more impactful story than

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.320
if you dick pics on a laptop. Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different,

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:36.560
right? But I do, my general view, though, on the Hunter Biden story is,

02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:43.440
had the articles not contained those images that were illegal in many states and violated

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:47.600
Twitter's policies, I would say publish it. Absolutely. I don't think it would have had

02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:52.000
an impact, but I would be in favor of it being, of the links being allowed 100%.

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.120
Okay. You mentioned Tucker. What do you think about Tucker getting fired from Fox?

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.280
You're a media person that works independently. Yes.

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:06.000
Tucker was a media person who doesn't work independently. Right.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.680
Yeah, what do you think about that particular situation? Is it representative of some big

02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:17.840
shift that's happening in mainstream media? What would the shift be?

02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:23.920
Basically, mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and less and less

02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:29.280
and less, and there's going to give more power to individual commentators. Basically,

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:33.200
Tucker Carlson just starting a podcast. So, a YouTube channel.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:37.680
I think that's what he should do. I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.960
to work for Newsmax or whatever the case may be. But the firing fundamentally was not a politically

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.480
oriented firing that suggests Fox News is changing its tune politically in any way. There's no

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.840
evidence of that whatsoever. Tucker Carlson basically became a legal problem for Fox News.

02:11:53.840 --> 02:12:01.360
There's really four points to it. One is the $787.5 million settlement with Dominion, partially

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:07.920
was because of the claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program. So, to some degree,

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:15.440
Tucker's program was a prominent node of the problematic claims that became the subject

02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:19.120
of the lawsuit. That's number one. Number two, Smartmatic, which is another voting machine

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:24.960
company, still has a similarly sized lawsuit against Fox News based on the exact same sorts

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.840
of claims. It may cost Fox News again. So, this is now two problems that Tucker's a big contributor

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:36.240
to. Number three, former Tucker staffer has brought a lawsuit, and I don't remember the

02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:41.840
exact claims, but I know that there are claims of different types of discrimination. It seems

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.880
like it has legs and that may be a third payout related to Tucker Carlson. And based on the 60

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:52.320
minutes piece from a few weeks ago, Ray Epps saying Tucker ruined his life by fomenting conspiracies

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:59.600
about him around January 6. That's ripe for another lawsuit. So, to me, Tucker's firing was a risk

02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:05.920
mitigation strategy of many that will be employed as these lawsuits come forward.

02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:10.960
There's no evidence that it's because Fox didn't like. And what we mean by that,

02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.960
are we talking about Rupert Murdoch doesn't like or the, I don't know. But I don't have

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:19.280
any reason to believe it's because Tucker's ideas were no longer welcome on Fox. Certainly,

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:25.200
the audience liked them. So, interesting. It's not even about the ratings. It's about just the

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:31.120
legal costs. Fox is interesting. The ratings question is interesting because Fox, unlike

02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:38.320
most other or every other cable news channel, they negotiate a fee from every cable subscriber.

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:42.560
If you have Fox News as a channel, even if you don't watch it, Fox gets a little bit of money.

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.240
They are dramatically less dependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC. So, the ratings

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:51.040
question is an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Another question from Reddit. Both sides are the same in quotes. Is a meme notion that has spread

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.520
far and wide in American political discourse on the internet? To what extent do you agree or

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:11.760
disagree with this notion? And why do you think it is so popular? Now, this Reddit comment also

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.280
says that podcasts like Russell Brand and Joe Rogan or the legendary comic George Carlin are

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:24.560
examples of big proponents of this notion, all of which I kind of disagree with. Russell Brand,

02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:32.960
Joe Rogan and George Carlin claim that both sides are the same and use that. All politicians are

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:39.840
crooked and they suck and this kind of thing. I don't know if that's true. Maybe George Carlin.

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:46.880
Anyway, let's leave that aside. To what degree do you agree with this notion that both sides

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:53.280
are the same? Left and right, the crooked corrupt politicians, they do what politicians do.

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:57.840
I don't agree that it's the same. I think there are different factions that like to say that

02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:05.920
for different reasons. There are some individuals who want to present themselves as kind of being

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.480
above the fray of partisan politics. And so, I call it enlightened centrism.

02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:15.520
Do you mean that positively or negatively? No, I mean it negatively. Yeah, it's a bit

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:22.240
of a pejorative. The idea that I am not going to fall for being a Democrat or a Republican,

02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:29.120
I can see that these are just two sides of the same coin, equally bad, lying to everyone. Okay,

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.680
so that's one, it's sort of like it's popular at dinner parties in some circles to go,

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:40.080
both all these politicians left and right. So that's one side of it. The other side of it is that

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:50.080
it's often used when your side has really stepped in it. It's a popular way to acknowledge

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:56.560
that your side has done something wrong. But while framing it as it's not uniquely wrong,

02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:00.720
and it's not worse than what anybody else does. And I find that it's one of the

02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:08.560
lamest and most kind of cringe-inducing things to hear because of the what comes next.

02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:16.320
And usually what comes next is not a good, accurate criticism of something that took place

02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:21.280
and a discussion of how to solve a real problem that we have. I find it a conversation stifler.

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:26.320
It also is used to kind of suppress voter turnout, not actively. It's not that the people who say

02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:31.600
that go around saying don't vote. But the idea, of course, is the more people that believe that it

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:36.160
doesn't really make a difference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout. And I want

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.080
voter turnout to be as high as possible, not as low as possible. So I also dislike it for that

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:46.640
reason. So is it possible to say that one side is worse than the other in modern current political

02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:54.720
climate? Listen, I'm a person on the left. I'm not pretending to come here as not knowing that my

02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:58.800
view is biased because I'm a person of the left. If you ask Ben Shapiro, he'll tell you something

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:06.400
different. I think in 2023, some total, the influence of the American right wing, if the

02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:13.120
American right wing were to get everything it wants, it would be a horrifying reality. If the

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:18.880
left were to get everything it wants, we'd have to figure out a few things, including exactly how

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:25.520
we pay for certain programs. But they're mostly noble goals. And I believe that they are more

02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:32.160
supportive of an individual self determining what they want to do in life and how they want to live

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:37.280
and is more in line with the idea of freedom and liberty than what the right is currently

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:42.800
proposing. That's my view. And of course, people will disagree with me all day. No, we get to

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.960
freedom and liberty the way that the right wants to do it. Okay, well, we can have that conversation.

02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:55.840
So I think you've implied in your answer, it was kind of focused on policy. It felt like it was

02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:00.960
focused on policy. There's other stuff that people worry about, particularly with the left.

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:09.600
What maybe termed the woke mind virus. Where have I heard who's using that term a lot now?

02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:16.640
I'm trying to think. I'm not sure. I'm not sure where it comes up. But the cultural aspect of

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:25.120
this, that if you give a lot of power to people on the left, as you gave as an example, there would

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:33.200
be a lot of kind of censorship and suppression of speech and a kind of dividing up of a society of

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:40.400
who's allowed to basically a reallocation of resources not based on merit, but based on some

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:46.320
kind of high ethical notions of what is right. And only a very small percentage of the population

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:53.040
gets to decide what is what is fair, what is right, which is, you know, we already have a

02:18:53.040 --> 02:19:00.880
small portion of the population deciding fair. I don't know how many different ways I can say

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:06.240
kind of a negative characterization of folks on the left when we're now comparing it,

02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:12.000
just as a to play devil's advocate. So is that something that you worry about? So setting policies

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:19.600
aside, wokeism, how big of a problem is it? This is a great conversation. So two sides of it.

02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:27.120
Okay. We have new polling that seems to suggest so-called wokeism is kind of more popular in

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:32.000
the United States than anti-wokeism. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. This is the less

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.040
interesting part. We'll go to the more interesting part second. Sometimes what people mean by wokeism

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:47.520
is an overreaction to a perceived injustice that goes beyond what would be fair and equitable.

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:51.920
There was this really interesting poll and it asks questions like, for example,

02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:58.000
do you believe society has gone too far, not far enough, or just about the right amount,

02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:06.560
in dealing with issues affecting the trans community? The woke position, which is society

02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:12.880
hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular than we've gone too far. Now the right wing media

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:17.360
narrative is we've gone way too far. This is out of control. And there are lots of other

02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:23.360
similar answers. It's not a huge margin. A lot of these are like 58 to 42, 60 to 40. It's not

02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:29.920
like 90 to 10. But by a small margin, the so-called woke perspective of we actually haven't yet done

02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:36.240
enough to fix some of these issues is a little bit more popular. So if we went back to DeSantis,

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:41.600
this is part of why I think DeSantis' anti-woke agenda may just be a political misstep.

02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:47.920
That's a really interesting result. I wonder how the questions are framed. But it's still

02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:56.480
interesting, nevertheless, no matter what, to hear that people are majority of people in America

02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:01.680
are woke, not in the negative sense of the word. The poll didn't use the term woke, right? This

02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:07.360
is a critical thing. Let's use the term woke positively. The term has kind of been perverted

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:11.920
four years ago when the term was started to be used, I would have said, oh, yeah,

02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:19.200
woke just means like I have become aware of problems that are bigger than any one person

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:26.160
can fix for themselves that relate to the system. And we might disagree on which problems fall

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:31.440
into that category, but it was kind of benign. I think now it just means like outrageously

02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:38.320
left wing, maybe even with socialist or Marxist undertones, it's becoming a pejorative at this.

02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:45.760
But also like bullies. Sure, censors. Yeah, but people that go around calling others racist,

02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:56.560
sometimes oftentimes without any proof of or justification. Fair. But that's a few folks

02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:01.120
on Twitter, you're saying like the polling is starting to show that like, no, they're still

02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:08.160
most Americans still care about these issues and want to want to want to improve, want to make

02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:12.080
progress. I think that's the case. And they want to do it in a genuine way that doesn't suppress

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:17.520
or oppress anybody. But now let me get to like to what degree do I think that actual when it goes

02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:23.840
too far is a problem. It absolutely exists. We can find instances of where this exists on the left.

02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:31.520
I've been told many times that as a Jewish, Argentinian immigrant to the United States,

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:41.920
I actually don't qualify as oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the U.S.

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:47.440
and my family had just enough money to leave Argentina. So there's this kind of like oppression

02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:52.640
Olympics thing where I've been told you don't get to comment, for example, like a topic in the

02:22:52.640 --> 02:23:01.200
Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latin X? In Spanish, there's an analogous movement

02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:09.440
where words by their nature sort of like have a gender. So like the word for friend is amigo.

02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.920
But if it's a woman, you would say amiga. So right from there, you can tell the gender that

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:22.240
we're talking about. And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos. It's the male with an S,

02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:26.400
but it could include both. There's a movement now which wants to do away with that and put the

02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:34.080
letter E in. It's a new word. It's a gender neutral word. Amigos, totally new. I don't like that.

02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:39.040
And I don't know anyone. No one in my family uses it. And I think it's kind of like a strange

02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:45.920
imposition from someone kind of with a solution in search of a problem. I've been told you moved

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:49.600
to the U.S. long ago and like your English is good and like you look wide and said like you

02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:54.800
don't get to weigh in on that. That, I think, is an example, if I understand correctly, of the

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:59.200
type of thing you're talking about. I'm kind of being bullied. I'm fine. I'm surviving fine, but

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:03.680
I'm being bullied over it and disqualified and saying you don't get to speak on this issue.

02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:10.080
All of those examples, all of that stuff, I am completely against and I tell people on the left,

02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.320
we're actually hurting our own movement with this stuff. I just don't think it's as big

02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:18.880
as some others believe. You don't think it's an existential threat to

02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:24.640
our civilization in the West? No, I don't. And I mean, look, we've got a Biden administration.

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:30.960
I see Biden as center left. Those who see Biden as extreme far left. This stuff has played

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:34.880
almost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years of his administration.

02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:37.200
Were there people that see him far left as far left?

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:42.480
There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a Marxist socialist communist.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:48.320
I haven't heard that because I don't think that would stick very much.

02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:49.760
He says it at every rally.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.080
Which I also tell us that you don't watch these things.

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.480
I love how deeply researched you are in Trump. I can only imagine how good your

02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:01.200
Trump impression is at this point. It's not very, sadly, it's not good.

02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:02.080
It's not, all right.

02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:07.280
No, and I'll say one other thing on that. Take trans because just to talk about it a little

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:12.640
bit, we haven't dealt with it much. The trans issue has become huge, I believe, because the

02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.720
right is obsessed with it. The right is very much not concerned with gay men anymore. It used to

02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:21.760
be that gay men is like, oh, we have to stop gay men from adopting and unnatural and pedophiles.

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:29.200
Now it's trans, it's drag shows, et cetera. I do think that there is a fair question to say,

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:38.000
how do we deal with trans women in a very small short list of sports? That's real.

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:46.000
My view, though, is I go, okay, we have all issues. We have issues related to gender and

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:53.280
sexual orientation. We have issues related to trans. Within that, we have specifically sports.

02:25:53.280 --> 02:26:01.920
You can eliminate from that trans men. Nobody's worried about biological women who are trans.

02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:06.720
And then when you say it's only in certain sports that it matters, hey, I'm right there.

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.680
I think it's a complicated question. I don't know how we deal with it. I would ask leagues

02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:16.640
that have experienced with this already and whatever. The problem I have is pretending that

02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:26.080
the vanguard of left-wing politics right now is trying to force trans women into sports.

02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:31.760
It's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were.

02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:40.400
But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to continue discussing it. I mean,

02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:46.960
I feel like even in institutions, even at universities, it feels like these ideas of

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:54.800
diversity, inclusion, and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of what a university

02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:03.200
should also care about, which is merit. And it feels like reprioritization is going a little

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:10.080
too far the other way, meaning prioritizing this kind of amorphous concept of diversity

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:17.280
is moving away, is giving power to people that don't care about merit, and it just want to bully

02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:29.680
people with a big stick that says racism or sexism or anti-diversity. And it kind of suffocates the

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:37.840
people that care about merit, about meritocracy, about inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds

02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:41.840
to succeed. And it's just you kind of observe that. I'm sure that happens in all kinds of

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:46.160
institutions. And the concern, I think the people that are concerned about wokeism

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:51.760
are concerned about at scale, what impact does that have on a society when there's so much

02:27:51.760 --> 02:28:00.560
conversation about racism and oppression, not to talk about merit, like who's the actual good

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:05.600
person in the room, the best person in the room. Generically, that's a concern to me. The degree

02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:12.000
to which it's happening at different institutions, I think is worthy of exploration. I know people

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.360
who work in academia that are getting out of academia because they don't like the environment

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:21.600
on their campuses for exactly the reason you're saying. So it exists. There's no question about

02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:27.280
it. I also think that the idea of a perfect meritocracy is maybe not necessarily the goal,

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:34.320
in the sense that when you talk about perfect meritocracy, someone wrote a book about this

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:38.560
who I interviewed about a year and a half ago, whose name escapes me. There are problems with

02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:48.560
perfect meritocracy. I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal opportunity for people,

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:54.640
understanding that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people,

02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.040
generally speaking, to determine the path that they want to take and giving them,

02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:05.600
if it's possible, the ability to pursue that without suppressing, limiting. I mean,

02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:10.640
this is like relatively uncontroversial stuff among, I would argue 95% of the left

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:15.200
with the caveats of what you're talking about, which I agree exist.

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:19.360
It would be nice to know the actual data. Sometimes people blow stuff out of proportion.

02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:25.520
What is, it's hard to measure how much self-censorship happens at university campuses.

02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:30.480
That's true. I think also it's sort of like the pit bull bite stories thing,

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:35.600
where when a pit bull bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on

02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:42.000
because it fits a certain narrative. There are right-wing publications that are very

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:48.240
interested in making this seem as if it is an epidemic. I'm the first to say it is happening

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:52.800
to a degree. I don't know the degree that it's happening to. I know a lot of people in academia,

02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:54.720
only a couple of them say that it's an issue.

02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:59.120
Would they say it though if they believed it?

02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:02.480
I think they would say it to me. These are just personal contacts.

02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:03.760
It's not like I'm going to go blabbing.

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:09.520
To push back, I kind of agree with you, but at the same time, most, I mean,

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:14.960
I'm deeply connected in academia of a huge number of colleagues. Most people

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:20.480
self-censor by not thinking about it at all. They're like, screw it.

02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:21.280
That's deeper.

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:25.680
Whatever. I'm just going to focus on the thing I love doing, which is the work,

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:33.200
and they don't think about, they basically remove themselves from politics and social issues,

02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:37.040
and they just kind of say, I'm going to do my engineering. I'm going to do my mathematics.

02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:41.440
Sure. The problem with that is it's kind of, you can't go anywhere further to figure it out.

02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:44.480
It's sort of like there's this funny clip where Jordan Peterson says,

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:48.240
even atheists are actually religious. They just don't know it. It's like,

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:52.800
it's hard to test that. I don't know. Okay. I mean, I don't, but it's a fair point.

02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:56.960
That means there may be some people, if it has become so toxic for some people,

02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:01.040
they may have repressed it way down into their subconscious, but I don't know how we would

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:05.760
know that. But you know symptoms of it because when certain people speak up,

02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:13.520
kind of lightly, and then a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old responds and is outraged,

02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:20.080
the fact that the administration listens to that 19 and 20-year-old and then reprimands

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:26.080
whoever spoke up a little bit, that's a really dangerous sign to me. And I don't really care

02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:31.200
about these, like, so I'm more with you. I don't think it's a big issue, but then I notice it.

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:36.240
I wonder, wait a minute, would this kind of environment allow a young Noam Chowsky to be

02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:43.600
around? With this environment allow, like, I don't know, like what tenure was designed for,

02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:49.680
which is to have controversial thinkers and not kind of weird controversial things,

02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:53.440
but really people that challenge things that should be challenged.

02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:59.920
Yeah. I sympathize with that significantly. I always try to look at specific examples.

02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:03.920
And sometimes I'll look at people, I'll ask for them and people will send me five.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.720
And one of them is a legit bona fide example of what we're talking about. And four are kind of like,

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.640
there was a complaint and it was investigated, but the teacher's tenure was never in jeopardy.

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:21.120
And I don't know that I chalk this up to a big woke event. What do you think the kind of apparatus

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:24.400
of the four-year degree in college is going to look like in 20 years?

02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:31.840
Oh, that's, I mean, we're like, day by day, that seems to be changing with GPT. I don't know if

02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:36.400
you've gotten a chance to interact with chat GPT. Absolutely. My entire show now is written by chat

02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:45.520
GPT. I mean, there's a, that's partially a joke. It is only because it stopped looking at the

02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:49.920
internet in 2021. If it was current, I could completely just tune it out. No, I'm kidding,

02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:55.760
but it's a fascinating tool. And it's changing the nature of how we do homework assignments,

02:32:55.760 --> 02:33:00.480
it's changing the nature of how we learn, how we look up new information, how we explore

02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:07.520
information, how we care about things we're interested in. I think it, I don't think we'll have

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:14.400
value for a university degree in 20 years the way we do now. I just think it changes everything. I

02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:22.400
think language models. I mean, Google search has already, and Wikipedia has already transformed,

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:29.120
I would say, our civilization, but it's, there was still a value for basic education. I don't,

02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:36.560
I think that starts to dissipate with chat GPT. So I don't, I don't know. I really, I really don't

02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:41.280
think there's a university the way we think of a university in 20, 20, 30 years. I mean,

02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:46.320
I have a personal interest in it, in that my daughter is 10 months old. And I'm doing the 529

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:52.880
account, I'm going through the motions as if, but I also recognize, you know, if she went to the

02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:59.680
schools I went to, just with the rate of tuition increase, you're talking 200K a year by the time

02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:05.440
she's 18. And what happens with wages relative to that, this is like separate from the technological

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:13.120
thing. And in my mind, I'm thinking, is this going to continue being the right path? What I would

02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:19.840
love to see is so many people that I interact with just by virtue of what I do, have no foundation

02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:24.080
in critical thinking, epistemology, philosophy, or media literacy. And

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:31.600
if there were some way to make that the core of some basic education that everybody's receiving,

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:39.280
which goes beyond, you know, chat GPT can do so many things, but I've not yet seen good examples

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:45.520
of how it can teach you to think. Maybe you have a different view on how chat GPT can teach a user

02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:51.680
to think, but those skills seem to be so lacking in so many of the people I interact with. If there's

02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:56.800
any positive change to come from a changing dynamic with higher education, I wish it would be to go

02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:04.400
in that direction. Well, no, chat GPT is actually much better at helping me think than any educator,

02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.800
even books that I've encountered, because it's very good at presenting the full picture,

02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:14.880
even better than a lot of Wikipedia articles, you know, on questions like the virus leak from

02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.480
a lab, the COVID leak from a lab. This just presents to you all the different hypotheses,

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:27.280
the amount of evidence available to it. It's like a full, calm, objective picture of it.

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:31.440
There's no partisanship. It's like a really nice list of things that's available.

02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:38.400
But I guess what I mean is, does it tell you how as a thinking human, you should evaluate the

02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:42.000
strength of each of the paragraphs it presents to you? You can literally ask the question.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.520
You can ask it to do it. Oh, fair. Okay. And then it's actually a fun,

02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:53.280
it's fun to ask chat GPT that question, because you get good answers. And so you basically

02:35:54.400 --> 02:36:02.880
have a kind of socratic, like a deep, intimate, like great podcast style conversation with an AI

02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:09.280
system every single day, for as many hours as you want, especially as it improves and as the

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:14.240
interfaces by which you communicate with a thing improves. So yeah, I think, I think it will do

02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:20.240
exactly that, which is teach you how to think, because you will offload the memory effects

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:29.440
and equations and whatever else school teaches you, you'll offload that to AI. And instead,

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:35.920
you'll be using your human mind, which is what it for now is uniquely good at, which is asking good

02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:42.240
questions, thinking through the complexities of issues when there's multiple perspectives on it,

02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:46.000
all of that. Well, then I stand corrected, maybe then I don't know what college is going to be in

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:52.880
20 years. Well, but you were sort of commenting, I see to the financial aspect of it, like, why does

02:36:52.880 --> 02:37:00.400
it even make sense? Yeah. I'm thinking about the transformative effects of AI and what starts

02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:08.720
to ask, what is even education? Right. What are you supposed, what is the purpose of education?

02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:13.520
So one is to give you kind of a background knowledge on a bunch of different topics,

02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.680
but the other is to discover the thing you're truly passionate about, and the thing you're

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:22.640
really good at, such that you can make money, and you can contribute to society and have a

02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:28.880
fulfilling life. Yeah, and also learning to interact with other people, relationships are built,

02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:34.640
socializing, and so many other things as well. But is that, you know, that is the big value of

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:39.840
university? Yeah. And maybe you should be called something else. Can you get that for less than

02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:44.400
200K a year somewhere else? Yeah, no, it's a fair question. Kind of social club. And you know, one

02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.800
of the things I think about also is people who are well connected, I mean, this has always been,

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:54.480
this isn't new, right? But if you're well connected, and you have a sort of drive towards

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:58.480
entrepreneurship and doing your own thing, and you're not pursuing a field that is very licensing

02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:04.800
dependent like medicine or law, getting started four years earlier with some internships can be

02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:10.080
a privilege in some cases. But again, that path is available to the people that would likely do

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:15.520
well regardless of whether they went to college. And so it's a very privileged, self-selected group

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:24.000
anyway. Another question from Reddit. Ask David to explain why American-style libertarianism

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:30.000
is an unserious philosophy. I don't know what they mean by American-style libertarianism.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:38.080
I've talked before about these kind of utopian libertarians where, you know, we have, we don't

02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:45.760
have police. You just kind of like hire a for-profit company if you want protection. And if there's a

02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.720
conflict between two of these private security companies, then I don't know, you figure it out

02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:55.920
somehow. So it's almost like anarchism. So take care of that. Yeah. If by, I don't know what the

02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:01.360
question means by that American-style libertarianism. But in general, my problems with libertarianism

02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:08.320
as it is often presented come from the work of sociology as well as human psychology,

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:13.520
which is the reality that once you get a group that's bigger than 150 people,

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:20.080
you really have to start centralizing some decisions unless you're going to subdivide

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:26.480
the 150 endlessly into 275s that now no longer have contact. But then that's not really one

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:32.320
society. Now it's two. I've not seen good evidence. And I've read a fair bit about this that once you

02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:38.720
get beyond 150, you can keep all decisions decentralized. And once you say some things

02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:44.560
need to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it. And it's going to be some version

02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:49.680
of government that conflicts with aspects of libertarianism. Well, it could be companies,

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:55.520
right? It could be more market-driven, which is the idea of anarchism that you're not,

02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:59.760
you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence.

02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:08.560
You know, and then if you think that the markets are efficient at delivering, especially in this

02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:16.480
21st century and beyond, where a market could have perfect information about people. So one

02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:20.800
of the issues is that you can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information. But now

02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:30.240
in a digital age, we can be higher bandwidth participants in the market. So if you're choosing

02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:34.720
between different security companies or you're choosing between different providers of different

02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:41.120
services, you could do so more efficiently and more effectively in the digital space.

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:48.400
So you could kind of imagine it, but we haven't successfully done it without governments.

02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:55.520
Yeah. And I think there's a practical, once you get beyond 150, you also start specializing.

02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:01.040
It just is a matter of fact, you don't have, everybody isn't growing their own food. Some

02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:05.600
people grow the food and other people do other things. And you come across a lot of the problems

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:10.960
that started at the agricultural revolution. And whether you say that it's a company that's

02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:16.320
solving it or a government, the problems are going to be very similar. And I've not read

02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.680
anything that to my satisfaction explains how you deal with that.

02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:24.160
Well, there's underlying principles of libertarianism, which is putting priority at the

02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:30.480
freedom of the individual, right? And that's a compelling notion.

02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:35.440
Yeah. Whenever I do these various political compass things that put you on two axes,

02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:41.920
on the authoritarian libertarian axis, I am way down on the libertarian side as a left libertarian.

02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:50.560
So my tendencies are always anti-authoritarian and towards that option when it makes sense.

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:54.800
So I sympathize with that a lot. Another question from Reddit,

02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.880
ask David what issues he disagrees with you on. Is there something?

02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:03.760
I have no idea. Okay, that's great. There you go. There's no issues. Perfect agreement.

02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:08.800
What's your view on Tesla? That's a good opportunity to ask. What do you think is

02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:15.840
the strengths and weaknesses of Elon Musk? You mentioned Twitter, have you paid your $8?

02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.600
I have not paid my $8. I don't see the point in paying for it. I have no problem paying for

02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:27.040
services. I use a ton of services. I'll try the free. I'll go to the paid. Right now, so the way

02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:35.360
I used to use the verified feed was I would post a tweet and then the next day when I review what's

02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.800
going on in my social media, I would look at the replies to the tweet, which would give me a mix

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:44.080
of replies from verified and unverified people. But then I would also look at the verified and see

02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:52.480
who that are verified public folks have responded to me or maybe I want to engage with whatever

02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:57.920
the case may be. I don't even understand why I would look at the verified feed anymore. So I

02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:03.680
never do because it's random folks who I don't know. It sort of lost its utility to me.

02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:10.080
Oh, yeah. Sorry to interrupt. But the idea is if everybody who's human pays the $8,

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:14.240
it shows to you that it's not bots. It's at least humans.

02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:17.600
From the reports about the number of people that have bought the blue checkmark,

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:22.880
I think we may be a thousand years from enough signups in order to make that sort of like a

02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:26.800
reality. That was the idea. That was the idea. It's an interesting idea. Honestly,

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:34.080
for my experience, obviously, I was seeing all sorts of attack comments, some of which were,

02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.240
I'm sure, from bots. But I'm ignoring all of those comments anyway. So it really didn't affect

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:42.400
my experience that much. I mean, here's the thing about Elon. And I say this, people sometimes

02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:48.720
are like, David, you obviously hate Elon or you obviously love Elon. I was an investor in Tesla

02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:55.760
starting in 2015. I've since sold all my shares. Great run. I'm on my second Tesla right now.

02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:01.600
I probably won't get a third one because I think that electric vehicle technology

02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:07.600
is now maturing such that when my lease is up, I'm going to have many more options with the

02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:11.200
range and charging network that's important to me. But I could be wrong. Maybe, you know, I don't

02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:16.720
know. I have no, the cult of personality around people, they mean nothing to me. So for me,

02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:24.160
it's just like people are people. Nobody has only good ideas. Fine. I think that what Elon Musk did

02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:29.360
accelerating and pushing forward the battery and electric vehicle technology is unbelievable.

02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:38.400
It's a one person wrecking ball in the best sense of saying, we're not going to slow play this and do,

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:45.600
okay, now Toyota hasn't actually entered, but now whoever, we've got a 90 mile range car and

02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:50.480
next year it'll be 110. And it's just like, we're doing this right now. You can compete or you can

02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:56.800
opt out and look at what's happened. Fantastic. On the Twitter side of things, I don't really get

02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:03.200
the whole plan. I don't know if it started maybe as kind of a goof of some kind and it developed

02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:08.320
into, I guess I have to buy it. And I think something about it ended up with, there was a

02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:12.000
clause invoked where I think he did try to get out of buying it, but then was forced to to some

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.840
degree. Yeah, he was forced. The way Twitter used to work was you followed people. And when you

02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:22.400
looked at your feed, you either saw the posts from the people you were following in reverse

02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:28.640
chronological order or posts from the people you followed algorithmically tailored to what

02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:35.280
you're most likely to want to see. And if you didn't follow someone, you generally wouldn't

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:40.480
see their posts unless it was like a sponsored tweet or someone you follow quoted or retweeted them.

02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:48.080
Fine. The for you feed, TikTok, I believe first had a so-called for you feed. The idea is this is

02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:54.480
stuff you might like based on, I don't know what, either demographic data about you, your other

02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:59.680
habits, whatever. And so it's useless to me. It's just basically mostly right-wing content that

02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:04.880
is not interesting to me. Why do you think that is? I mean, so the signals that are used to generate

02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:14.000
the for you page is looking at all your likes, all your comments, all your blocks and mutes,

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.040
and all that. I mean, I don't know what I was looking at. Okay. So it's supposed to be very

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.760
pleasant for you. I'm sure other people go, wow, this for you thing is awesome. Like if you had

02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:29.760
insert some right-wing or sitting here, they would go, Twitter used to suppress right-wing voices.

02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:34.400
And now finally, they're getting the fair shake that they deserve in the for you feed.

02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:41.200
Okay. I mean, I wonder if there's left-wing folks setting their feelings of Elon aside

02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:45.680
that are enjoying the for you page. That's a really important question because it's supposed to be

02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:48.320
people on the left and people on the right should be enjoying the for you page.

02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:54.880
Sure. Yeah. I mean, so for me, my thought on Elon is some incredible successes. I don't know about

02:46:54.880 --> 02:47:01.840
Twitter. I do think that I don't believe Elon is a right-winger. And when you see interviews with him,

02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:10.320
certainly, at least socially and in many ways culturally, seems very moderate or even

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:14.160
somewhat on the left in my experience. So I don't think it's Elon's a right-winger. I don't that's

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:20.640
not an interesting critique. It does seem though that throughout the Twitter escapade, he certainly

02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:26.560
ended up closer to some voices that may be influencing him in a particular way.

02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:32.880
That's giving some people that impression. But as far as the Elon hate or the Elon love,

02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:37.600
it's just a person who's done some interesting things, some of which I like and some of which

02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:48.160
I could kind of leave aside. I have seen folks drift towards the right more

02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.200
in response to just the viciousness of attacks from the left.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.200
Like who? Well, Elon. So you do think he's drifted towards the right?

02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:08.720
So I don't think at the core, but I think on the surface. I think Joe Rogan has as well

02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:15.200
on the surface because maybe you can correct me, but it feels like people on the left attack

02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:25.120
more viciously. That has not been my experience. Let me know because my sense was that they

02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:31.120
attack people on the left viciously as well. Left attacks its own because you're not progressive

02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:36.320
enough. It's just this kind of bullying that happens very intensely.

02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:46.080
No, you're 100% right that when the left has attacked me, it's almost as vicious as when

02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:52.800
the right attacks me. The difference in my experience is it's a smaller contingent on the

02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:57.760
left that's willing to levy those attacks against me, but I'm on the left. So to some degree,

02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:03.680
you could say, well, that's to be expected. There is toxicity on the left.

02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:08.080
But it's intense, isn't it? And that's what I mean. The attacks on people who are on the left,

02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:13.200
you're not left enough. Yeah, that's no. And it is a small number of people.

02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:21.600
I can't deny that that is absolutely a real phenomenon. And depending on what sort of

02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:28.080
topics you take on publicly, you are going to suffer the wrath of that to a greater or lesser

02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:33.040
degree. But with all of these things, what I always go back to is, I probably would have

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:36.960
more disagreements with Rogan today than the last time I was on his show, which was at the beginning

02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:43.040
of the pandemic. And I've done clips critical of things that he has said, substantive, of course.

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:48.960
To me, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, I could sit down with him and do a podcast and it would be

02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:53.200
zero big deal. And I would tell him, I stand by everything I said about what you said. And I

02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:57.840
would say it to you right now. There are people who write to me and go, oh, man, things must be

02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:03.680
really, really tense now. If you were to, Rogan would never have you on because you disagree.

02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:07.760
He loves you. I'm sure he's just not thinking of me. I'm not the most important thing to Joe

02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.760
Rogan. I think both of us would be able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms.

02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:18.000
It would not be taken personally. And then we would move on and it would be the next day.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.080
You get attacked a lot. How do you not let that break you mentally?

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:32.080
I don't know. So let's see. I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space. The news and politics,

02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:36.560
partisan news and politics, partisan news and politics on the internet with a social media

02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:41.440
component, just completely and totally toxic. From a personal perspective, when I'm done producing

02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.960
my last show of the week until Monday, I try to completely tune out from news and politics

02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:53.520
altogether and also make an effort to just not look at feedback and what's going on.

02:50:53.520 --> 02:51:01.600
I also really limit my visibility. I don't need to read every comment. I don't need to

02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:07.200
look at every email or every tweet. I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my social

02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:13.440
media platforms, look at generally what has the reaction been, maybe include that in my assessment

02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:17.360
of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed a good point or something like that and

02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:21.120
basically try to move on. When something like we've talked about at the beginning happens,

02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:25.680
it becomes obsessive. I mean, it's unhealthy, right? Where I'm going, oh my God, who's attacking

02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:31.840
me now and scrolling? It becomes, you know, I'm sweating. It's horrible. But I think just like

02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:37.760
limiting exposure to that and remembering that it is impossible to please everybody. And so I'd

02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:46.080
really rather have fresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are sort of restricted

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:49.520
and flattened by what I perceive to be people's preferences.

02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:55.680
So just can you speak a little more to the full process of creating the David Backman show?

02:51:57.760 --> 02:51:59.840
You're doing five shows a week?

02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:04.560
I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days. I shoot Monday to

02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:10.640
Thursday, but we're doing five episodes. Basically, our guests we schedule in advance.

02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:17.520
I'm picking six to eight stories each day that are like I said, a blend of stuff I think will be

02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:23.600
interesting, things I want to talk about, and things where it's being discussed at one layer

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:28.640
and I want to go deeper on it and I feel like I'm able to do that. I choose those stories in the

02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:33.120
morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show out by that afternoon.

02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:40.320
What's the preparation? What's the how do you take notes? Are you on a sheet of paper?

02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:45.280
No sheets of paper anymore. I used to do sheets of paper. I found something about it,

02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:51.360
like at work, the tactile nature of it. It became inconvenient for sharing the notes with my team.

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:57.360
But basically, we use a wiki type system. It's called Media Wiki, which is basically like a

02:52:57.360 --> 02:53:03.120
Wikipedia clone. Old school. Yeah, old school. So we can have pages for every guest, every topic.

02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:06.960
Oh, that's interesting. I haven't heard that. Yeah. I don't know anyone else who's using it. It

02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:13.520
works really well. It's so fast and it takes up almost no space. So it just is a really good tool.

02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:19.920
When my team, when we book a guest and they have notes from the publicist, they'll put it in there

02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:25.120
and then I can access it. So I'm basically working off of notes rather than a script. I'll pull any

02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:34.000
audio-visual stuff that I want so that that's available. And it's really a very seamless,

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.280
you know, we're doing this every day, four days a week. And so we have it down to a well-oiled

02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:44.800
machine. Where do you get ideas from? Everywhere. I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I

02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:50.800
think are talking about interesting things. I have a curated list for which I still use Twitter,

02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:55.680
and it is very good for this. It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are

02:53:55.680 --> 02:54:02.400
doing interesting work. So I'll see what's there. Look at the sort of standard news reporting,

02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:10.240
wire services, AP and Reuters. Glance at what? Everything from Drudge to CNN to whoever is

02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:17.200
covering that day. Look at Google News. How do you try to fact check stuff on your show?

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:22.240
So like is there sources or is there a process? I always try to get to a primary source first

02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:28.720
and foremost for the facts of the story. And then I'll use other tools for background research.

02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:36.880
Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes, I find to be useful tools. Chat GPT is a good one. You really

02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:41.920
have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of where to do the fact checking, which I think is

02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:45.680
fantastic. Sometimes it gives me information that's flat out wrong. And when you ask for the source,

02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:50.880
it's like, oh, yeah, that actually is not real, which is, hey, it's part of the process.

02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:56.320
And then when there's like an expertise type of thing, if it's a breaking legal matter,

02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.800
I'll just call like a friend who's a lawyer or call a friend who's a doctor or something like that.

02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:06.880
If it lends itself to that. Let me ask you about the nature of truth. Do you think it's

02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:11.760
becoming more and more difficult to know what is true and will become continuously,

02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:15.280
continue to get more difficult, especially with GPT?

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:23.360
I think the big difficulty is in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact

02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:29.360
and what is a statement of opinion. I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or

02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:34.880
less agree on how to get to the truth. Or if we can't get to it, at least figure out how we would

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:38.720
if the information were available. But the bigger challenge I'm having is

02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.640
someone will call in with an opinion, but say they want to talk about fact.

02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:50.320
And I have to explain to them, you're talking about an opinion and not a fact. And this goes

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:56.240
back to the lack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy. But that's the bigger challenge

02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:59.440
for me right now. But I mean, I think the big statements are always going to be

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:11.520
somewhat opinions. Like was the 2020 election fair? I think any answer to that is an opinion.

02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:14.960
Disagree. If we define fair.

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:23.840
Well, yes. So then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs

02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:32.000
where each sentence now has facts, right? So what do you mean by fair? Is it who can show up

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.880
to vote? What was the process of how easy it is to vote? Was there actual cheating going on?

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.720
And different like what is the evidence of that cheating? You have to actually get to the actual

02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:48.720
like details of a thing. High level, you know, everything is just going to be an opinion, it

02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:56.480
feels like. And you can approximate that to be like, it's a well-founded opinion. Well,

02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:01.440
most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion. So like, I think there's a threshold

02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:08.240
beyond which an opinion becomes like, this is a pretty reliable thing to assume for now that

02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:15.440
that's okay. So let me revise. So I think maybe better said, I think that the difficulty,

02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:23.360
I mean, the process you described is probably the right process and it's exhausting for mundane

02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:31.360
things and that causes major problems. If we were to say, is it better for the economy to have

02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:39.840
a tax rate on people making over a million dollars that's 20% or 50%? Okay. What do we mean by better

02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:45.360
for the economy? It's not an overwhelming task to decide on that. We could say, well, we'll say it's

02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:49.760
better for the economy by looking at what was the unemployment rate based on the tax rate on

02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:55.600
million, you know, people earning a million a year and what was GDP and whatever. Okay. We've

02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:02.880
agreed. This is a statement. We are now in the realm of just determining what is given the parameters

02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:09.120
that we've established. I think that that's relatively doable. The issue is with the bigger

02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:14.880
ones like you're talking about where what do we mean by a fair election and fair in whose eyes and

02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:21.200
but I am with you that it often devolves into a conversation about opinions about what is fair

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:28.000
rather than an ascertainment of the facts. Yeah. And it feels like maybe avoiding some

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:33.440
of these big, maybe there's some trigger words too, maybe avoiding them allows you to actually

02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:39.520
talk about the facts and through that educate yourself and learn about like whether the virus

02:58:39.520 --> 02:58:45.600
leaked from a lab or not. To me was always a super interesting question. I don't know why

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:50.720
everybody got super touchy about it. Mostly people I know, colleagues, biologists thought

02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:58.400
it's pretty good likelihood that it leaked from a lab given everything. They just didn't the evidence

02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:03.760
is not there for a either one. And so like you should be able to just openly talk about it.

02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:08.960
Unless you're in the high political office where there could be geopolitical consequences to your

02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:12.240
statements. But in general, it's an interesting question. You should be able to talk about it.

02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:16.160
But there's no, first of all, there's not many facts around there, unfortunately.

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:21.920
And a lot of very conclusive statements about especially in the early days were just opinions.

02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:28.000
And so you have to the idea of what is true and not becomes a little

02:59:28.880 --> 02:59:31.840
even mentioning the word truth in that context. It feels

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:39.440
divisive. Yeah, I completely agree with you, which is strange. You think it shouldn't.

02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:45.120
One of the really good opening questions that I've had work to my advantage when talking with

02:59:45.120 --> 02:59:50.400
people who I know disagree with me about a contentious topic is how do you think we would

02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:58.400
figure out X? And it often gets people thinking first collaboratively. And obviously we might

02:59:58.400 --> 03:00:02.560
have very different opinions. But with something like the COVID lab leak, I think it's an interesting

03:00:02.560 --> 03:00:07.520
one. Because if you say, okay, maybe it leaked, maybe it didn't. How would we figure that out?

03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:12.240
Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count? Now we're kind of on the

03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:18.720
same team. And then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for a capital T truth together

03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:23.200
or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky. But in some conversations, I've actually had success with

03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:29.360
that. And then you can kind of realize if there's no amount of evidence that's going to prove

03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:34.720
a show to you that you're wrong in your current opinion, that that's probably a really bad sign

03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:38.720
for you. It's a waste. It may be a waste to pursue the conversation further at that point.

03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.760
So, okay, you think Trump was a good president. How do you determine that? And what evidence

03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:50.160
might exist that would change your mind? There is no evidence. Trump was the best president ever.

03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:51.680
I think the conversation is probably done.

03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:53.120
Except Abraham Lincoln.

03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:59.440
You mentioned Israel-Palestine. Well, what do you think about the situation in Israel-Palestine?

03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:03.920
Something you've thought about, spoken about for quite a time. Do you think we'll ever see peace

03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:08.720
in this part of the world? I don't know. I mean, I could say yes.

03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:09.840
That's an honest answer.

03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:17.360
I could say yes. One of the problems is, and I'll give, you may not know that

03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:23.760
there are people on the left of my audience who call me a Netanyahu shill,

03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:30.000
even though I've never been a supporter of Netanyahu and I'm on the left. I just don't think

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:37.920
that some of the kind of black and white characterizations about Israel are even remotely

03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.520
accurate. And I think most people, it's become a sort of litmus test. Are you criticizing Israel

03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:46.960
enough? Are you showing us that you're actually left-wing? I don't do any of that stuff.

03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:49.200
I should really look at the situation for what it is.

03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:54.160
That's become a litmus test in American politics, in the spectrum of American politics.

03:01:54.160 --> 03:02:05.200
Yes. My view, big picture, is that I don't think we're going to really get anywhere

03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:13.680
until some pre-negotiated terms are set and the parties to do the negotiating

03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:19.200
are all good faith parties. For example, I don't think Israel's right-wing party,

03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:26.240
Likud, is a particularly good faith arbiter of peace because I think Likud benefits from

03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:31.600
their not being peace and the threat of violence. And there is violence. It's not just the threat

03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:37.680
of violence. I don't think Hamas is going to be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people

03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:42.880
either. I think the Palestinian Authority is a question mark. I'm not sure. So I think that

03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:48.800
there need to be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything from

03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:56.320
settlements to a lot of this minutia. Big picture, though, if I imagine what the most likely solution

03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:00.240
looks like, it doesn't mean it's a perfect solution. And obviously, it's a solution many people will

03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:06.480
say it's not going to happen. I think it's a solution where the borders are similar to what

03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:13.600
was being discussed in the Clinton era to some degree. As many of the settlements as possible

03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:18.800
have to go, understanding that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go. And there's going

03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:24.800
to have to be meaningful land swaps with which Yasser Arafat seemed to be amenable to when he

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:31.680
weighed in on it. I believe it was in the 90s. The topic of the Temple Mount and Jerusalem,

03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:39.360
is a complicated one. But I think that almost certainly East Jerusalem is going to have to be

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:45.520
part of an eventual Palestinian state. We can go as far as we want to with a lot of this stuff.

03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:50.880
What role does U.S. have to play in this coming to the table with good faith parties?

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:56.960
I don't know whether I go back and forth between believing that the U.S. should play a big role,

03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:04.560
to the U.S. should play essentially no role whatsoever. Because, of course, of the funding

03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:12.480
of Israel that the U.S. provides, it's not that I have a personal problem with American involvement

03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:16.880
and somebody like Bill Clinton was arguably relatively well positioned to try to make something

03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:22.880
happen. Will it be seen as credible on the global stage? And that's, I think, the most

03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:27.920
important thing. Because at the end of whatever negotiation takes place, both sides need to agree

03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:33.440
that this is where we are renouncing all past claims. And in the future, if there's a disagreement,

03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:37.680
we can't go back to that thing from the 80s or the 90s. That's just like a critical piece of this.

03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:46.480
Yeah. It has to be stable and materialized into something stable over years.

03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:56.240
Yes. Another difficult conflict going on in the world is the war in Ukraine. What do you think

03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:02.560
about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022? I don't pretend to be an expert on this

03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:06.960
issue. I think you probably know more about this than I do, just from the brief conversation we

03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:13.680
had before we started filming. My view as a general observer of geopolitics and the way that

03:05:14.640 --> 03:05:20.480
this part of the world is related to American presidents over the last several cycles is I

03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:26.320
don't think it's controversial to say that this was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression,

03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:37.360
an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin. I do believe that if Trump had been re-elected,

03:05:38.320 --> 03:05:43.040
Putin may have seen himself as having other tools with which to try to

03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:50.800
expand influence that may have been different than geographic pursuits, geographic pursuits.

03:05:51.680 --> 03:05:59.680
But we don't know that for sure. I also have a really hard time imagining what the end of this

03:05:59.680 --> 03:06:09.840
looks like. That's very scary because sometimes the most benign end seems to be that Putin ends

03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:18.800
up out of power either through no longer being alive or deposed in some way. It doesn't feel like

03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:23.520
that latter is super likely. The former, there's reports about his health. I don't know how accurate

03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:31.280
they are. It's just hard to imagine a face-saving exit that is going to be even remotely...

03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:38.640
What's the word? It's not even a question of acceptable. It's not satisfying either. Just

03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:44.320
not tragic, I guess is what I'm looking for. In terms of Putin speaking to the Russian

03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:49.680
people and being able to figure out what to say, what kind of narrative to say why this word made

03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:57.440
sense. Yes. The same with the Ukrainian side to figure out how to exit this war. Yes. I mean,

03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:04.160
to some degree, it requires Russian troops leaving Ukraine and that is somewhat under the

03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:11.520
control. Of course, it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues. But what I

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:18.480
am not thrilled with are some of the reflexive... If Trump had been in power instead of Joe Biden,

03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:28.000
a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, if you say Ukraine is just acting defensively,

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:31.920
you're supporting neo-Nazis or some of these things that have come out of the American

03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:37.520
Republican Party seem both wacky and like they would be saying completely different things if

03:07:37.520 --> 03:07:41.840
Trump happened to be in the Oval Office. They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden.

03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:47.200
Well, that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of political litmus test

03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:52.560
of how you speak about it. I think because of the huge amount of funding that's going

03:07:53.360 --> 03:08:01.840
from US to Ukraine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that this

03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:06.320
topic has become politicized already. 100%. There are people like Marjorie Taylor-Green

03:08:06.320 --> 03:08:11.440
and others saying, we should be doing nothing for Ukraine. Zelensky is a comedian and we're

03:08:11.440 --> 03:08:18.240
supporting neo-Nazis. That's it, full stop. And you either subscribe to that or you don't. And it

03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:25.600
very quickly becomes as partisan as so many other issues. And it's really the most disappointing

03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:30.800
thing is that some of these issues become incredibly divisive, but they're simple. Like,

03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:35.040
for example, a conspiracy theory that we know isn't true. It shouldn't be divisive because

03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:40.800
it's so simple. Other issues become divisive and they are simplified, but in reality,

03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:45.280
they're extraordinarily complex. And you lose the ability to talk about the complexity

03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:49.280
because they're becoming partisan. Do you think there will always be war in the world?

03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:54.400
As a bunch of folks on the subreddit that were interested in your different complex

03:08:54.400 --> 03:09:00.240
perspectives on foreign policy. So let's talk about war. When you look at the war in Ukraine,

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:06.400
you look at what's going on in Israel in the past time. You look at the wars across the world.

03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:11.440
Do you think there will always be war? As a redditor put it, is it a necessary evil

03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:18.000
in the game of geopolitics? I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective,

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:27.520
which is that if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homo sapiens

03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:33.920
that all of our differences would immediately be exposed to so insignificant, we would never fight

03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:39.280
again and we would realize that intelligent life. And then I spoke to people who deal in space

03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:44.560
exploration and other scientists and they all said, David, that's extraordinarily naive. There

03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:50.000
would be a period during which this was as momentous as you're imagining and then it would become

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:56.640
normal and then we would go back to many of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, etc.

03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:05.280
I think that in all likelihood, there will always be conflict between factions, whether it's what

03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:11.280
we currently think of as war, probably not. I mean, it seems as though the tactics will evolve

03:10:11.920 --> 03:10:16.880
and it will be less about missiles and I don't know where it's going to go. I don't know whether

03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:22.320
it's going to become more biological or cyber or certainly something we haven't even considered yet,

03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:26.880
but I think there will always be conflicts we would refer to in that way.

03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:32.480
Do you agree with Chomsky on his general harsh criticism of U.S. foreign policy in war,

03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:38.800
that many actions, military actions in the United States are criminal in nature,

03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:41.440
almost terrorist in nature?

03:10:41.440 --> 03:10:49.040
I am not, it's been a decade or more since I've read any Chomsky and I don't keep up with everything

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:54.320
that he has recently said, so I don't want to mischaracterize any of it.

03:10:54.320 --> 03:11:02.400
In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading freedom across the world

03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:07.680
and Chomsky takes a perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the number of civilians you kill

03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:11.440
while doing it, it's incomparable to any other military actions across the world.

03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:17.440
Right, so I very much disagree with those who take the view that the U.S. is this

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:24.720
wonderful global police force that's spreading democracy and fixing problems very, very much

03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:30.160
wrong. I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more he frames,

03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:36.880
he seems to frame the U.S. as a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases, and I think it's

03:11:36.880 --> 03:11:44.480
more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the U.S. and less about uniquely negative intentions,

03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:48.800
and so I think that would be my general disagreement with Chomsky based on stuff I

03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:53.680
read a decade ago. Well, he says that he lives in the United States, he's an American,

03:11:53.680 --> 03:11:58.240
and so he feels his focus of criticism should be in America, and I think that's one of the great

03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:05.200
things about being an American and being in America is the freedom to criticize harshly.

03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:08.320
Sure. While being a university professor, by the way,

03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:14.000
he's basically the embodiment of why 10 years are a really valuable thing.

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:21.040
I agree. Whether you agree with him or not. Question from Reddit. Ask David what he plans

03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:26.160
for his garden this year. Is this a joke or is this a- It's not a joke. I got into gardening a

03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:32.880
few years ago. Honestly, I'm with the baby, I can't do a garden this year, and I have a lot

03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:38.160
of travel coming up, so everything would die, but I did start to try to figure out gardening.

03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:43.760
If you're stressed by the toxicity of the social media world, gardening is a great hobby. It really

03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:48.800
is, but it is extraordinarily time-consuming, so I have no garden planned this year.

03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:57.920
Other books or maybe movies in your life that had a big impact on you, you're thinking about that

03:12:57.920 --> 03:13:05.920
diet. Has there been stuff you read? Forget about even just books like blogs or writers or

03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:13.280
just sources of information that molded you into the intellectual,

03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:19.680
into the political thing that you are. It's so hard. This is sort of like you

03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:25.280
win an Oscar and you want to make sure you thank all the right people. I read so much and have

03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:32.640
been reading for so long that it's really hard to say, but I think certainly, for me, narrative

03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:42.160
nonfiction has been a fantastic genre to learn not only about history, but also about people and

03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:48.080
psychology. Very often, when people say, I don't really read, what can you recommend to me that

03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:55.360
might be interesting? Depending on knowing them to some degree, I'll give recommendations there.

03:13:55.360 --> 03:14:00.160
In terms of just things I picked up recently that I think are interesting,

03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:08.800
I've been reading a bunch of Neil Postman. I read a Jenny O'Dell has a new book on time and

03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:15.840
the concept of saving time, spending time, etc. She just published it. Super interesting. I just

03:14:15.840 --> 03:14:24.480
read Lansing's book about the Shackleton voyage in Antarctica in 1914, 15, and 16. Super interesting.

03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:28.560
I'm really all over the map. I have that one on audiobook. I've been meaning to listen to it.

03:14:28.560 --> 03:14:34.400
It's very interesting and it seems inconceivable how these guys survived. It's completely inconceivable

03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:42.080
and yet they did. It kind of inspires you to think of space exploration and taking on similar

03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:47.440
kinds of risky and dangerous journeys. In narrative nonfiction, I grew with you very much. I've been

03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:54.160
reading a lot of 20th century history about Stalin and about Hitler. Rise and Fall of the

03:14:54.160 --> 03:15:00.480
Third Reich. I've read twice now and I recommend it. What did you get out of reading at the second time?

03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:14.400
So, the second time I listened to the audiobook as I ran, I get the same thing from it as I get,

03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:21.920
maybe reading Man's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of day to day in the modern

03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:30.480
world kind of fade away and dissipate when I'm thinking about the, you know, basically the

03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:37.920
embodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history. So, it makes me sort of appreciate

03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:43.040
all the, it fills me with gratitude to have all the freedoms, all the just simple joys of life that

03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:51.600
we have today. And I think the second time I was, as I was reading it, because William Shire was there,

03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:55.920
he's the author, he was there through the whole thing, you start to pick up little details as

03:15:55.920 --> 03:16:04.240
opposed to like big things, you start to pick up the little quirks of how history turns and just

03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:10.160
like these little events. You notice of the dynamics between people in a room during a meeting

03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:14.480
with Hitler. You just notice these little things that are mentioned because he was either there

03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:20.400
directly or heard it the next day. So, you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall, the third rank

03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:27.840
is interesting is because it's by a guy who's there, who's reporting on it, versus a sort of a

03:16:27.840 --> 03:16:34.080
more distant, displaced retelling. And I also like biographies, I'm a big fan of biographies.

03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:38.720
And Walter Isaacson has just written some incredible ones. There's Steve Jobs and

03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:44.880
Einstein, all that kind of stuff. Victor Frankel's book is one I've read a bunch of times. And it's

03:16:44.880 --> 03:16:49.360
so short. And you know, reading in general, I know a lot of people who read way more than I do.

03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:53.280
And I also know a lot of people who don't read at all. I mean, they haven't read a book since

03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:59.040
college, essentially. To me, it's almost like the amount I get from it, it's almost like a secret

03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:04.960
weapon, where when I think, you know, in two or three or 400 pages, which I can read in whatever,

03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:10.480
10 days or however long it takes reading 30 pages a day, the amount of information

03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:17.040
insights into so many aspects of the human psyche that I can get, it's sort of like,

03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:21.200
it's not like I'm in a competition for anything in particular with anybody, I just do my show.

03:17:21.200 --> 03:17:26.160
But it's sort of like, if I'm reading dozens of books a year, and you're reading zero,

03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:32.880
I'm exposed to so many different things and ideas that are not even in your universe. It just

03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:38.560
seems like the power of reading just seems overwhelming. I had speaking or getting attacked.

03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:46.480
I had a fun time getting attacked a few months ago for publishing a reading list. So I'm reading

03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:53.680
at least a book a week. I read 18 or 19 books from the beginning of the year. You got attacked for

03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:59.520
the books you chose or for this? I don't know for what, but it became quite viral. Attacked for

03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:06.640
reading. That's something. So basically what happened is that people, I actually don't,

03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:12.400
it's not worth folks who know, know, fair, folks who don't, don't even worry about it.

03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:19.280
It's the, what I really loved about being attacked for it is it shows you can get attacked for anything.

03:18:19.280 --> 03:18:24.400
Apparently. It's, so it's not like I did something wrong. It was kind of a beautiful thing. It was

03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:33.600
just the most intensely beautiful display of absurdity of Twitter and the internet,

03:18:33.600 --> 03:18:36.960
that there would be, there were articles written about me with the book list.

03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:45.120
There's no bad books on it. The thing I was being mocked for is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff

03:18:45.200 --> 03:18:52.400
that sounds like a high school reading list. Oh, I see. Or all these kinds of aspects of the

03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:59.440
reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of legitimate kind of criticism. But the fact that

03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:04.400
people are just looking for single words or single aspects of a tweet and so on to criticize.

03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:11.200
It actually forced me to, because I released a video about, you know, summarizing my take

03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:15.680
away from, from one of the books and I've been meaning to do more and more. But every time I

03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:22.400
start to like, want to record it, I have this negative feeling. They kind of ruin the fun

03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:28.000
of sharing with others. I know exactly what you're talking about. My advice on that is don't do it.

03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:32.720
Just don't record it. Yeah. Because, and, and is that what you basically, yeah.

03:19:32.720 --> 03:19:38.160
But I, I think time cures it. But for now, I decided not to. Yes. It's just until I'm,

03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:44.320
until I feel joy when I do it. Yeah. We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do this

03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:51.200
sort of thing, right? I have taken on projects and then it sort of sounds good or I end up doing it

03:19:51.200 --> 03:19:55.440
because there's some third party that brings the idea and I feel like I can't really say no or

03:19:55.440 --> 03:19:59.840
whatever. And then when I get in front of the camera or I have to write something for a while,

03:19:59.840 --> 03:20:06.800
I did a newspaper column that I hated doing. I realized that I'm ruining the exact thing

03:20:06.800 --> 03:20:11.200
that I have worked to build, which is that I can just do whatever I want. Why am I doing this?

03:20:11.200 --> 03:20:16.160
And sometimes it takes me a week to realize it. Sometimes it takes me a year, but just don't do

03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:21.120
it. That's the, in this case in particular, it's also the, there's a private thing I enjoy, which

03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:28.080
is reading. Right. And if sharing that private thing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it.

03:20:28.800 --> 03:20:35.120
That that's, yeah, there's certain things, there's certain private things that should remain private.

03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:41.440
That's like, which is one of the first things ever. I'm the same person privately as I am publicly,

03:20:41.440 --> 03:20:46.480
but the books, it's like, man, I don't get to share. I guess through these conversations I can

03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:52.400
share some of the stuff I'm reading and enjoying it because it sucks. It sucks to get

03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:56.400
attacked for stuff and it sucks to get attacked for stuff you love.

03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:02.560
Yeah, especially reading. I mean, it's, you know, that's the bottom of the barrel. I have these ideas

03:21:02.640 --> 03:21:08.160
where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing, I'll go from politics, which is so toxic,

03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:12.560
I'll go to travel blogging because I, there's so many travel bloggers I follow and there's

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:18.160
so many interesting places. And then I go, wait a second, I like traveling and just hanging out.

03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:22.000
Now traveling is going to be my job and now I've got to bring two cameras with me and I've got to

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:26.000
get shots and I've got to film my food and I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to do what

03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:30.720
I'm doing, but then I'll travel when I want to take a vacation. And of course, some of it could

03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:37.840
be fun. I mean, I have to say when I did one video on a book in 1984, I really enjoyed it,

03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:45.680
the whole process was fun. It was, I don't think I've ever thought as hard about a book when I

03:21:45.680 --> 03:21:50.880
had to make a video about it because I had to like, you know, I read 1984, I don't know many times,

03:21:50.880 --> 03:21:59.360
probably five, 10 times. I don't remember. I read Animal Farm way more. But I don't think, I was like,

03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:03.600
what do I think about? Like what are the key takeaways for me? I didn't really know. Like

03:22:03.600 --> 03:22:07.360
if you asked me what I think about, even Animal Farm, because I haven't done that one, and I've

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:13.040
read that one, I don't know, over 50 times, it's probably my favorite book is like, I would have

03:22:13.040 --> 03:22:18.640
to struggle and making a video about it, basically a little mini lecture, forced me to actually have

03:22:18.640 --> 03:22:24.080
an opinion about the details of it and to do enough research to think like, okay, what is the

03:22:24.080 --> 03:22:28.960
historical context of this book? I mean, it allowed me to say interesting and to think interesting

03:22:28.960 --> 03:22:35.040
stuff about the book. I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing,

03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:40.960
one of the best ways to learn is to teach. Yeah, I can't think of one thing I would say

03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:45.120
about Animal Farm. And I read it again, not that long ago, but I don't know what comment

03:22:45.120 --> 03:22:49.440
you're gonna have. You kind of have a generic comment about like authoritarianism and so on,

03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:55.120
whatever. Yeah. But there could be interesting quirks of the book and the characters and how

03:22:55.840 --> 03:23:01.520
corruption happens. You could say all kinds of stuff that it may be contrasting it. Like,

03:23:01.520 --> 03:23:10.640
even when 1984 allowed me to contrast with Brave New World and how that 1984 was politicized

03:23:10.640 --> 03:23:14.000
and how it's used by the Republican Party of today, like you could say a lot of interesting

03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:17.920
stuff if you like to think about it and write it down or sheet of paper, maybe you don't need to

03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:24.480
make a video about it. So I found it to be really rewarding in general. So I probably will do more

03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:28.560
of it. But not always. Not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging. I agree with

03:23:28.560 --> 03:23:33.360
that. I mean, you get threatened a lot. You get attacked a lot online. Do you think about your

03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:38.880
mortality? Well, the other day I went to the doctor and he said, you know, next physical,

03:23:38.880 --> 03:23:43.840
we're going to be talking about a lot of new things. And so I was thinking about it a lot

03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:51.200
that day. Yeah. No, I mean, it's funny. I recently did a bunch of estate stuff. Yeah.

03:23:51.280 --> 03:23:57.360
And when you have intellectual property, there's a question of like, okay, I have my assets, but

03:23:57.360 --> 03:24:05.600
also if I died tomorrow, especially in a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would probably,

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:09.760
for a while, generate more money because it would be like, oh my goodness, this person died in a

03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:14.080
terrible, what happens with a future revenue stream and all these different things? And it

03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:19.680
got me thinking about legacy and about the fact that people who do this sort of thing, it's kind

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:25.840
of a new thing in a sense. And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire

03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:32.000
and someone else fills in for you, how does my career wind down given like, I don't actually

03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:39.440
know the answer. I'm not sure. What is it? I just one day stop posting videos, but all my content

03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:46.320
stays up, getting fewer and fewer views, or do I delete everything? Do I, I don't know. What is

03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:50.720
I mean, so my trip to Ukraine, because I knew I was going to the front,

03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:57.120
is the first time I did a recorded video if I die. Oh, and I posted it and I give instructions to

03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:04.320
folks what to do. So like, there's a closure. Yeah. But it's an interesting process. Like,

03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:10.720
what happens to your, at which point does GPT take over and continue tweeting for David Packard?

03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:15.040
Well, the tweeting I care less about right now, unless blue becomes something unbelievable,

03:25:15.040 --> 03:25:19.680
I'm less worried about Twitter. But some of my audience members have been saying, you know,

03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:26.000
some of these tools, David, are getting good enough that we could clone your voice and also

03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:32.320
make it match video. And with scripts, you could just keep pumping out content,

03:25:32.320 --> 03:25:36.080
even if you were gone. And I said, now that I'm interested in that I want to learn more about.

03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:42.400
Boy, it's going to be a weird future. What advice do you have to young folks

03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:47.920
that are facing this future? Almost always, it's some version of

03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:54.800
start right away. And that applies in so many different ways. So if you're thinking about,

03:25:54.800 --> 03:26:00.160
oftentimes the context is people want to do what I do. And I always say, do not sit around for a

03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:06.720
year thinking about lighting. This is how you never do anything. And I dozens of people who I

03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:11.760
felt obligated to talk to on the phone because of a personal connection, I go through all the advice

03:26:12.400 --> 03:26:17.760
and I can tell they're not going to do it. They just they're it's already sounding too complicated.

03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:21.440
And so instead, they'll sort of say, well, I got to get the right lighting and the right room and

03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:26.560
the best thing you can do no matter what you're doing is just start right away. And that applies

03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:30.720
in this business. And in whatever else you're doing, if you want to learn a new thing, find a new

03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:36.640
hobby, the ability to get data right away about what's working, what's not working and whether

03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:42.320
you even like this approach that you're taking is so valuable. And it will allow you to iterate.

03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:46.400
And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of direction will also be lower.

03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:51.280
If there's any I don't do like self help or generic advice type stuff. But the one thing

03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:57.360
that applies in so many situations is situations is just try it right away and iterate from there.

03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:03.440
Yeah, start today, and then do it every day. Or decide, hey, you know what I figured out,

03:27:03.440 --> 03:27:09.840
I don't actually want to do it. Yeah, and iterate. Yeah. Well, usually you'll discover you do.

03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:16.160
You think we'll make it out of the century? Humanity? Human civilization?

03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:19.840
Out of the select to 2100. Yeah, how much we got? 80 years?

03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:25.840
Yeah, 77. I think we're going to make it. You think so? Yeah.

03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:28.000
What are the biggest threats facing our civilization?

03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:38.800
If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say. I actually think that if you believe

03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:47.520
that we are on an inflection point of sorts in changes to society and acceleration of technology,

03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:54.480
et cetera, I think it's really tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat.

03:27:54.480 --> 03:28:01.920
So I don't know. It's so cliche to say nuclear and climate change and another pandemic.

03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:06.720
Technologically, our world might look so different that it's almost unimaginable.

03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:13.520
What it means to be human is unimaginable. And also, the degree that we make progress out into

03:28:13.520 --> 03:28:19.040
space is also unimaginable. I think space is super interesting. And there's people on both

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:24.240
the left and right who for different reasons are kind of not into the whole space exploration thing.

03:28:24.480 --> 03:28:29.600
The people I hear from, the ones on the right, think it's just kind of dumb. The ones on the

03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:35.840
left think it's an excuse not to fix problems here. And also, they say it's the plaything of

03:28:35.840 --> 03:28:41.760
billionaires, which is another funny kind of concept. Yeah, I mean, someone's got to pay for it.

03:28:43.520 --> 03:28:47.200
Why not be people who have a lot of money to... It could either be billionaires

03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:54.160
or governments that are trillionaires. Somebody has to pay for big, ambitious moonshot projects.

03:28:54.160 --> 03:29:02.080
To me, the most interesting thing is that in getting closer to the next step of space exploration,

03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:08.320
we may well learn things that can then be used to improve circumstances here. For me, it's not

03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:15.840
one or the other. And I recently read a long piece about why not Mars, because it's terrible in

03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:21.840
every way for supporting life. Okay, so that's one perspective. But still, in so exploring,

03:29:22.560 --> 03:29:27.920
who knows what we might end up learning? So, I'm big on it. I don't share the view of some on

03:29:27.920 --> 03:29:32.560
the left about it. So, I guess to add to your advice, young people, if a thing seems terrible,

03:29:32.560 --> 03:29:37.280
you still might want to consider doing it. I would say so. Yeah. How many things have...

03:29:37.280 --> 03:29:46.000
I mean, listen, there are so many trips where the day before, I say, why am I doing this?

03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:52.080
The jet lag. I've got to do this and that. And now, if my guest host falls through,

03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:58.240
I should just stay and work. And I go, hold on. You do this every time. Just go. You never

03:29:58.240 --> 03:30:01.920
regret it. You learn something. You try something. I never regret the trip.

03:30:04.640 --> 03:30:09.920
This hopefully applies to the conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you

03:30:09.920 --> 03:30:14.560
so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to talk earlier.

03:30:15.520 --> 03:30:20.560
Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective and thoughtful and

03:30:21.280 --> 03:30:24.480
fearless on the internet. Thank you. Big fan of yours as well. I appreciate it.

03:30:25.520 --> 03:30:29.760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman. To support this podcast,

03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:34.640
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from

03:30:34.640 --> 03:30:41.040
Mahatma Gandhi. What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless,

03:30:41.680 --> 03:30:47.760
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of

03:30:47.760 --> 03:30:56.960
liberty or democracy? Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
