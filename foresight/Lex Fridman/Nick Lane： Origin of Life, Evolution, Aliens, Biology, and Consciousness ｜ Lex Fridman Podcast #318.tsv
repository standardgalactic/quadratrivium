0	4640	the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
4640	10080	And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic, which is to say they release energy.
10080	15760	This, if you have hydrogen and CO2 and you put them together in a falcon tube and you warm it up
15760	20320	to say 50 degrees centigrade and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it, nothing's
20320	26560	going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable, two gases hydrogen and CO2 is less
26560	32400	stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out. Why doesn't that happen?
32400	35760	It's because of the kinetic barriers. It's because that's where you need the spark.
38080	43360	The following is a conversation with Nick Lane, a biochemist at University College London
43360	49040	and author of some of my favorite books on biology, science and life ever written,
49600	54000	including his two most recent title transformer, the deep chemistry of life and death,
54480	63120	and the vital question, why is life the way it is? This is the Lux Friedman podcast to support it.
63120	68800	Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.
69760	72880	Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious, the most interesting question
73760	80160	that we little humans can ask of ourselves. How did life originate on earth?
80560	86880	You could ask anybody working on the subject and you'll get a different answer from all of them.
86880	92080	They will be pretty passionately held opinions and their opinions grounded in science,
94000	97680	but they're still really at this point, their opinions, because there's so much stuff to know
98800	104800	that all we can ever do is get a kind of a small slice of it and it's the context which matters.
104800	112240	So I can give you my answer. My answer is from a biologist's point of view. That has been missing
112240	118560	from the equation over decades, which is, well, what does life do on earth? Why is it this way?
118560	124720	Why is it made of cells? Why is it made of carbon? Why is it powered by electrical charges on
124720	130400	membranes? There's all these interesting questions about cells that if you then look to see, well,
130400	135520	is there an environment on earth, on the early earth, four billion years ago that kind of matches
135520	139520	the requirements of cells? Well, there is one. There's a very obvious one. It's basically created
139520	146960	by whenever you have a wet rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents which generate hydrogen
146960	154000	gas in bucket loads and electrical charges on kind of cell-like pores that can drive the kind of
154080	163280	chemistry that life does. So it seems so beautiful and so obvious that I've spent the last 10 years
163280	167680	or more trying to do experiments. It turns out to be difficult, of course. Everything's more
167680	171680	difficult than you ever thought it was going to be. But it looks, I would say, more true
171680	176080	rather than less true over that 10-year period. I think I have to take a step back every now and
176080	181280	then and think, hang on a minute, where's this going? I'm happy it's going in a sensible direction.
182240	188240	And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas. I mean, I'm often accused of being
189760	196240	too focused on life on earth, too kind of narrow-minded and inward-looking, you might say.
196240	201600	I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells, and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,
201600	206320	ah, yeah, but life can be anything. I have no imagination. And maybe they're right. But
207280	211920	unless we can say why life here is this way, and if those reasons are fundamental reasons,
211920	217600	or if they're just trivial reasons, then we can't answer that question. So I think they're
217600	221600	fundamental reasons, and I think we need to worry about them. Yeah, there might be some deep truth
221600	229200	to the puzzle here on earth that will resonate with other puzzles elsewhere that will solving
229200	234640	this particular puzzle will give us that deeper truth. So to this puzzle, you said
235440	246080	vents, hydrogen, wet, so chemically, what is the potion here? How important is oxygen? You're
246080	250320	the book about this. Yeah. And I actually just came straight here from a conference where I was
250320	254560	chairing a session on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life. Of course, it matters.
255280	261360	But it matters most to the origin of life to be not there. As I see it, we have this,
262400	268800	I mean, life is made of carbon, basically, primarily, organic molecules with carbon,
268800	274480	carbon bonds. And the building block, the Lego brick that we take out of the air or take out of
274480	280400	the oceans is carbon dioxide. And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules, we need to strap
280480	286880	on hydrogen. And so we need, and this is basically what life is doing, it's hydrogenating carbon
286880	290400	dioxide, it's taking the hydrogen that bubbles out of the earth in these hydrothermal vents,
290400	296720	and it sticks it on CO2. And it's kind of really as simple as that. And actually,
296720	303360	thermodynamically, the thing that I find most troubling is that if you do these experiments
303360	307840	in the lab, the molecules you get are exactly the molecules that we see at the heart of biochemistry
307840	315520	in the heart of life. Is there something to be said about the earliest origins of that little
317680	323280	potion, that chemical process? What really is the spark there?
324640	333040	There isn't a spark. There is a continuous chemical reaction. And there is kind of a spark,
333040	337360	but it's a continuous electrical charge, which helps drive that reaction.
337360	338320	So literally spark?
339840	345280	Well, the charge at least, but yes. I mean, a spark in that sense is we tend to think of,
345280	350080	in terms of Frankenstein, we tend to think in terms of electricity, and one moment you zap
350080	355280	something and it comes alive. And what does that really mean? You've come alive, and now what's
355280	362720	sustaining it? Well, we are sustained by oxygen, by this continuous chemical reaction. And if you
362720	366960	put a plastic bag on your head, then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.
366960	370800	So it's some way of being able to leverage a source of energy?
370800	375600	Well, the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
375600	381040	And amazingly, most of these reactions are hexagonic, which is to say they release energy.
381680	386720	If you have hydrogen and CO2, and you put them together in a falcon tube, and you warm it up
386720	390240	to say 50 degrees centigrade, and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,
390880	397120	nothing's going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable, two gases hydrogen and CO2
397120	401840	is less stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out.
403760	408320	So why doesn't that happen is because of the kinetic barriers is because that's why you need
408320	414960	the spark. Is it possible that life originated multiple times on earth? The way you describe it,
414960	421440	you make it sound so easy. There's a long distance to go from the first bits of
421440	427520	prebiotic chemistry to say molecular machines like ribosomes. Is that the first thing that you would
427520	433760	say is life? Like if I introduce you to the two of you at a party, you would say that's a living
433760	442000	thing? I would say as soon as we introduce genes information into systems that are growing anyway,
442000	449280	so I would talk about growing protocells. As soon as we introduce even random bits of
449280	455600	information into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example, doesn't have to have
455600	460160	any information. It can be completely random sequence. But if it's introduced into a system
460160	465040	which is in any case growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself, then any changes in that
465040	470720	sequence that allow it to do so better or worse are now selected by perfectly normal natural
470720	479120	selection. So that's when it becomes alive to my mind. That's encompassed into an object
480320	485680	that keeps information and involves that information over time or changes that information
485680	491120	over time in response to the. So it's always part of a cell system from the very beginning.
491120	496800	So is your sense that it started only once because it's difficult or is it possibly started
496880	502720	multiple occasions on earth? It's possible it started multiple occasions. There's two
502720	510320	provisos to that. One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really for life to start. So as soon
510320	515360	as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere, then life isn't going to keep starting over. So I often get
515360	519600	asked by people, why can't we have life starting? If it's so easy, why can't life start in these
519600	524400	vents now? And the answer is if you want hydrogen to react with CO2 and there's oxygen there,
524400	528640	hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead. It's just, you know, you're getting explosive reaction that
528640	533440	way is rocket fuel. So it's never going to happen. But the other for the origin of life earlier than
533440	538960	that, all we know is that there's a single common ancestor for all of life. There could have been
538960	545600	multiple origins and they all just disappeared. But there's a very really interesting deep split
545600	551120	in life between bacteria and what are called archaea, which look just the same as bacteria.
552080	557920	And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly. And they are very different in their biochemistry.
557920	562720	And so any explanation for the origin of life has to account as well for why they're so different
562720	568320	and yet so similar. And that makes me think that life probably did arise only once.
569040	573040	Can you describe the difference that's interesting there? Well, how they're similar,
573040	578640	how they're different? Well, they're different in their membranes primarily. They're different
578720	583200	in things like DNA replication. They use completely different enzymes and the genes behind it for
583200	589040	replicating DNA. So they both have membranes, both have DNA replication. Yes. The process
589040	594800	of that is different. They have, they both have DNA. The genetic code is identical in them both.
594800	601840	The way in which it's transcribed into RNA into the copy of a gene and the way that that's then
601840	606960	translated into a protein, that's all basically the same in both these groups. So they clearly share
607040	611360	a common ancestor. It's just that they're different in fundamental ways as well. And if you think
611360	618640	about, well, what kind of processes could drive that divergence very early on? I can think about
618640	623200	these in terms of membranes, in terms of the electrical charges on membranes. And it's that
623200	628080	that makes me think that there were probably many unsuccessful attempts and only one really
628080	634880	successful attempt. Can you explain why that divergence makes you think there's one common
634880	640320	ancestor? Okay, can you describe that intuition? I'm a little bit unclear about why the divert,
640320	646880	like the leap from the divergence means there's one. Do you mean like the divergence indicates
646880	654640	that there was a big invention at that time from one source? Yes. If you've got, as I imagine it,
654640	661600	you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent. Let's say there are millions of vents and
661600	667760	millions of potential common ancestors living in all of those vents, but only one of them makes it
667760	673360	out first. Then you could imagine that that cell is then going to kind of take over the world and
673360	678160	wipe out everything else. And so what you would see would be a single common ancestor for all of
678160	684640	life, but with lots of different vent systems all kind of vying to create the first life forms,
684640	690080	you might say. So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism? We're always talking about populations
690080	696960	of cells, but yes, these are celled organisms. But the fundamental life form is a single cell,
697520	705760	right? So they're always together, but they're alone together. There's a machinery in each
705760	713200	one individual component that if left by itself would still work. Yes, it's the unit of selection
713200	718320	is a single cell, but selection operates over generations and changes over generations in
718320	722560	populations of cells. So it would be impossible to say that a cell is the unit of selection
722560	726640	in the sense that unless you have a population, you can't evolve, you can't change.
727360	736240	Right. But there was one Chuck Norris, it's an American reference cell that made it out of the
736240	742560	vents, right? Or like the first one. So imagine then that there's one cell gets out and it takes
742560	746640	over the world. It gets out in the water, it's like floating around. We're deep in the ocean
746640	754800	somewhere. But actually two cells got out and they appear to have got out from the same vent
755440	760080	because they both share the same code and everything else. So unless all the, you know,
760080	765520	we've got a million different common ancestors in all these different vents. So either they all have
765520	772560	the same code and two cells spontaneously merged from different places or two different cells,
772560	778560	fundamentally different cells came from the same place. So either way, what are the constraints
778560	783680	that say not just one came out or not half a million came out, but two came out? That's kind
783680	789360	of a bit strange. So how did they come out? Well, they come out because what you're doing inside
789360	794800	event is you're relying on the electrical charges down there to power this reaction between hydrogen
794800	799280	and CO2 to make yourself grow. And when you leave the vent, you've got to do that yourself. You've
799280	803680	got to power up your own membrane. And so the question is, well, how do you power up your own
803680	809600	membrane? And the answer is, well, you need to pump, you need to pump ions to give an electrical
809600	814480	charge on the membrane. So what do the pumps look like? Well, the pumps look different in these two
814480	819440	groups. It says if they both emerge from a common ancestor, as soon as you've got that ancestor,
819440	826320	things move very quickly and divergently. Why does the DNA replication look different? Well,
826320	829680	it's joined to the membrane. The membranes are different. The DNA replication is different
829680	833120	because it's joined to a different kind of membrane. So there's interesting,
834240	838240	this is detail, you may say, but it's also fundamental because it's about the two
838240	842960	big divergent groups of life on earth that seem to have diverged really early on.
842960	850160	It all started from one organism. And then that organism just start replicating the heck out of
850160	859280	itself with some mutation of the DNA. So there's a competition through the process of evolution.
859280	863760	They're not like trying to beat each other up. They're just trying to live the way.
863760	868560	They're just replicators. Yeah. Well, let's not minimize their...
868560	868880	Yeah.
868880	873760	They're just trying to chill. They're trying to relax up in the... But there's no sense of trying
873760	879520	to survive. They're replicating... I mean, there's no sense in which they're trying to do anything.
879600	882720	They're just a kind of an outgrowth of the earth, you might say.
882720	885520	Of course, the aliens would describe us humans in that same way.
886640	887120	They might be right.
887120	893360	This primitive life. It's just ants that are hairless, mostly hairless.
893360	894320	Overgrown ants.
894320	901280	Overgrown ants. Okay. What do you think about the idea of panspermia, that the theory that
901280	908560	life did not originate on earth and was planted here from outer space? Or pseudo panspermia,
908560	912880	which is like the basic ingredients, the magic that you mentioned was planted here
912880	914000	from elsewhere in space?
914720	917280	I don't find them helpful. That's not to say they're wrong.
918880	923920	So, pseudo panspermia, the idea that the chemicals, the amino acids, the nucleotides are
923920	927920	being delivered from space. Well, we know that happens. It's unequivocal. They're delivered on
927920	933040	meteorites, comets, and so on. So, what do they do next? That's to me the question.
933040	937520	Well, what do they do is they stock a soup, like presumably they land in a pond or in an ocean or
937520	942640	wherever they land. And then you end up with a best possible case scenario is you end up with
942640	946560	a super-nucleotides and amino acids. And then you have to say, so now what happens? And the
946560	952320	answer is, oh, well, they have to go become alive. So, how did they do that? You may as well say,
952320	960080	then a miracle happened. I don't believe in soup. I think what we have in event is a continuous
960080	965280	conversion, a continuous growth, a continuous reaction, a continuous converting a flow of
965280	969520	molecules into more of yourself, you might say, even if it's a small bit. So, you've got
970640	975760	a kind of continuous self-organization and growth from the very beginning. You never have that in
975760	984080	a soup. Isn't the entire universe and living organisms in the universe? Isn't it just soup
984080	988080	all the way down? Isn't it all soup? No, no. I mean, soup almost by definition doesn't have a
988080	994640	structure. But soup is a collection of ingredients that are like randomly... Yeah, but they're not
994640	1000080	random. They're not. I mean, we have chemistry going on here. We have metal grains forming,
1000080	1004640	which are, you know, effective oil-water interactions. Okay, so it feels like there's a
1004640	1009120	direction to a process, like a directive process. There are directions to processes, yeah.
1010000	1015520	And if you're starting with CO2 and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together
1015520	1020880	and they react, what are they going to make? Well, they make carboxylic acids, which include
1020880	1026400	the fatty acids that make up the cell membranes. And they form directly into bilayer membranes.
1026400	1031280	They form like soap bubbles. It's spontaneous organization caused by the nature of the
1031280	1035840	molecules. And those things are capable of growing and are capable in effect of being
1035840	1040720	selected even before there are genes. We have that. So, we have a lot of order. And that order is
1040720	1046000	coming from thermodynamics. And the thermodynamics is always about increasing the entropy of the
1046000	1051440	universe. But if you have oil and water and they're separating, you're increasing the entropy of
1051440	1056320	the universe, even though you've got some order, which is the soap and the water are not missable.
1056320	1064800	Now, to come back to your first question about panspermia properly, that just pushes the question
1064800	1069600	somewhere else. That just, even if it's true, maybe life did start on earth by panspermia. But
1069680	1075920	so, what are the principles that govern the emergence of life on any planet? It's an assumption
1075920	1082720	that life started here. And it's an assumption that it started in a hydrothermal vent or it started
1082720	1087920	in a terrestrial geothermal system. The question is, can we work out a testable sequence of events
1087920	1092320	that would lead from one to the other one, and then test it and see if there's any truth in it
1092320	1097760	or not? With panspermia, you can't do any of that. But the fundamental question of panspermia is,
1097760	1109040	do we have the machine here on earth to build life? Is the vents enough? Is oxygen and hydrogen
1109600	1115760	and whatever the heck else we want and some source of energy and heat, is that enough to build life?
1117280	1124640	Well, that's, of course, you would say that as a human. But there could be aliens right now
1124640	1134560	chuckling at that idea. Maybe you need some special sauce. Your sense is we have everything here.
1134560	1140080	I mean, this is precisely the question. I like to, when I'm talking in schools, I like to start
1140080	1146080	out with the idea of, we can make a time machine. We go back four billion years. And we go to these
1146080	1150640	environments that people talk about. We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent. We go to a kind of
1150640	1158000	Yellowstone Park type place environment. And we find some slime that looks like we can
1158000	1162480	test it. It's made of organic molecules. It's got a structure, which is not obviously cells, but
1164400	1170480	is this a stepping stone on the way to life or not? How do we know? Unless we've got an
1170480	1174480	intellectual framework that says, this is a stepping stone, and that's not a step. We'd
1174480	1178480	never know. We wouldn't know which environment to go to, what to look for, how to say this.
1178480	1181760	So all we can ever hope for, because we're never going to build that time machine,
1181760	1186880	is to have an intellectual framework that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,
1186880	1194000	how we go from a sterile inorganic planet to living cells as we know them. And in that framework,
1194000	1198000	every time you have a choice, it could be this way, or it could be that way, or there's lots of
1198720	1205120	possible forks down that road. Did it have to be that way? Could it have been the other way,
1205200	1207600	and would that have given you life with very different properties?
1208880	1213920	And so if you come up with a, it's a long hypothesis, because as I say, we're going from
1213920	1218000	really simple prebiotic chemistry all the way through to genes and molecular machines. That's
1218000	1222960	a long, long pathway, and nobody in the field would agree on the order in which these things
1222960	1226800	happened, which is not a bad thing, because it means that you have to go out and do some experiments
1226800	1229840	and try and demonstrate that it's possible or not possible.
1229840	1240960	It's so freaking amazing that it happened though. It feels like there's a direction to the thing.
1241920	1249280	Can you try to answer from a framework perspective of what is life?
1251040	1259040	So you said there's some order, and yet there's complexity. So it's not perfectly ordered.
1259040	1265120	It's not boring. There's still some fun in it. And it also feels like the processes have a direction
1266240	1273040	through the selection mechanism. They seem to be building something always better, always
1273040	1278080	improving. I mean, maybe it's- I mean, that's a perception. That's our romanticization of
1278080	1282800	things are always better. Things are getting better. We'd like to believe that.
1282800	1286720	I mean, you think about the world from the point of view of bacteria, and bacteria are the first
1286720	1291680	things to emerge from whatever environment they came from, and they dominated the planet very,
1291680	1296640	very quickly. And they haven't really changed. Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.
1296640	1303680	So if about four billion years ago, bacteria started to really run the show, and then nothing
1303680	1308080	happened for a while. Nothing happened for two billion years. Then after two billion years,
1308080	1313920	we see another single event origin, if you like, of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells,
1314000	1318800	cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside. Another singular origin, it only
1319360	1322880	happened once in the history of life on Earth. Maybe it happened multiple times, and there's no
1322880	1328080	evidence, everything just disappeared. But we have to at least take it seriously, that there's
1328720	1334400	something that stops bacteria from becoming more complex, because they didn't. That's a fact that
1334400	1339920	they emerged four billion years ago, and something happened two billion years ago, but the bacteria
1340000	1346000	themselves didn't change. They remain bacterial. So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory
1346000	1350400	towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it. It's very easy to imagine that without
1350400	1354880	photosynthesis arising, or without eukaryotes arising, that a planet could be full of bacteria
1354880	1359840	and nothing else. We'll get to that, because that's a brilliant invention. And there's a few
1359840	1366240	brilliant invention along the way. But what is life? If you were to show up on Earth, but to
1366320	1371440	take that time machine, and you said, asking yourself the question, is this a stepping stone
1371440	1378160	towards life? As you step along, when you see the early bacteria, how would you know it's life?
1380320	1383920	This is really important question when you go to other planets and look for life.
1386320	1391520	What is the framework of telling a difference between a rock and a bacteria?
1392160	1396480	I mean, the question's kind of both impossible to answer and trivial at the same time,
1396480	1400560	and I don't like to answer it, because I don't think there is an answer. I think we're trying to
1400560	1407760	describe the process at the same time. There's lots of at least 40 or 50 different definitions
1407760	1413760	of life out there, and most of them are obviously bad in one way or another.
1414320	1420800	I mean, there's freaks. I can never remember the exact words that people use, but there's a NASA
1421680	1428400	working definition of life, which more or less says a system which is capable of a
1428400	1431680	self-sustaining system capable of evolution or something along those lines.
1432560	1437600	And I immediately have a problem with the words self-sustaining, because it's sustained by the
1437600	1442400	environment. And I know what they're getting at. I know what they're trying to say, but I pick a
1442400	1447360	hole in that. And there's always wags who say, but by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.
1447360	1452160	Only a pair of rabbits would be alive, because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.
1452720	1459040	There are all kinds of pedantic, silly, but also important, objections to any hypothesis.
1459040	1465200	The real question is what is... We can argue all day, or people do argue all day about,
1465200	1470880	is a virus alive or not? And it depends on the content. But most biologists could not agree
1470880	1474160	about that. So then what about a jumping gene, a retro element or something like that? It's even
1474160	1481520	simpler than a virus, but it's capable of converting its environment into a copy of itself.
1482960	1486880	And that's about as close... This is not a definition, but this is a kind of a description of life,
1487440	1494160	is that it's able to parasitize the environment, and that goes for plants as well as animals and
1494160	1502320	bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy of themselves, information on the
1502320	1508000	exact copy of themselves. By the way, it doesn't really have to be a copy of itself, right? It just
1508000	1517200	has to be... You have to create something that's interesting. The way evolution is... So it is
1517200	1523280	extremely powerful process of evolution, which is basically make a copy yourself and sometimes mess
1523280	1527680	up a little bit. Okay, that seems to work really well. I wonder if it's possible to
1528400	1533760	mess up big time as a standard, as the default. It's called a hopeful monster. And
1535840	1541840	in principle, it can. Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due a reemergence. This
1541840	1545440	is some amazing work from Michael Levin. I don't know if you came across him, but
1546240	1552800	if you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him. Yeah, yeah, I'm talking to him in
1552800	1560160	a few days. Oh, fantastic. So I mentioned there's two people that, if I may mention,
1560880	1566560	Andre Capati is a friend who's really admired in the AI community, said you absolutely must talk
1567200	1573520	to Michael and to Nick. So this, of course, I'm a huge fan of yours, so I'm really fortunate
1573520	1578640	that we can actually make this happen. Anyway, your second. Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work
1579280	1583200	basically about the way in which electrical fields control development.
1584720	1589120	And he's done some work with planarian worms, so flatworms, where he'll tell you all about
1589120	1592640	this. So I won't say any more than the minimum, but basically you can cut their head off and they'll
1592640	1598880	redevelop a different, a new head. But the head that they develop depends if you knock out just one
1601280	1605200	iron pump in a membrane, so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,
1605280	1610080	you can come up with a completely different head. It can be a head which is similar to those that
1610080	1614640	diverged 150 million years ago, or it can be a head which no one's ever seen before, a different
1614640	1620880	kind of head. Now, that is really, you might say a hopeful monster. This is a kind of leap into a
1620880	1626160	different direction. The only question for natural selection is, does it work? Is the change itself
1626720	1630960	feasible as a single change? And the answer is yes, it's just a small change to a single gene.
1631040	1634800	And the second thing is it gives rise to a completely different morphology.
1634800	1643440	Does it work? And if it works, that can easily be a shift. But for it to be a speciation, for it to
1644400	1651920	continue, for it to give rise to a different morphology over time, then it has to be perpetuated.
1651920	1660400	So that shift, that change in that one gene has to work well enough that it is selected and it
1660400	1665680	goes on. And copied enough times to where you can really test it. So the likelihood it would be
1665680	1670320	lost, but there will be some occasions where it survives. And yes, the idea that we can have
1670320	1676560	sudden fairly abrupt changes in evolution I think is time for a rebirth. What about this idea that
1677520	1685040	kind of trying to mathematicalize a definition of life and saying how many steps, the shortest
1685040	1688880	amount of steps it takes to build the thing, almost like an engineering view of it?
1690160	1696160	I like that view, because I think that in a sense that's not very far away from what a
1696160	1700400	hypothesis needs to do to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life. You need to spell out,
1700400	1706480	here's each step, and here's the experiment to do for each step. The idea that we can do it in the
1706480	1711680	lab, some people say, well, we'll have created life within five years, but ask them what they
1711680	1718880	mean by life. We have a planet four billion years ago with these vent systems across the entire
1718880	1722720	surface of the planet, and we have millions of years if we wanted. I have a feeling that we're
1722720	1727920	not talking about millions of years. I have a feeling we're talking about maybe millions of
1727920	1732080	nanoseconds or picoseconds. We're talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.
1733840	1740960	But we still need to constrain those steps, but we've got a planet doing similar chemistry. You
1740960	1746480	asked about a trajectory. The trajectory is the planetary trajectory. The planet has properties.
1746480	1749920	See, it's basically got a lot of iron at the center of it. It's got a lot of electrons at the
1749920	1754640	center of it. It's more oxidized on the outside, partly because of the sun, and partly because
1754640	1760480	the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases. The planet is a battery, it's a giant battery.
1762080	1766480	We have a flow of electrons going from inside to outside in these hydrothermal vents, and that's
1766480	1772560	the same topology that a cell has. A cell is basically just a microversion of the planet.
1775360	1779840	There is a trajectory in all of that, and there's an inevitability that certain types of chemical
1779840	1786160	reaction are going to be favored over others. There's an inevitability in what happens in water,
1786160	1791840	the chemistry that happens in water. Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes and
1791840	1800080	will form insoluble structures. Nobody really understands water very well. It's another big
1800080	1805600	question for experiments on the origin of life. What do you put it in? What kind of structure do
1805600	1810880	we want to induce in this water? Because the last thing it's likely to be is just bulk water.
1811760	1814240	How fundamental is water to life, would you say?
1814240	1820960	I would say pretty fundamental. I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life to start any other
1820960	1830160	way, but water is everywhere. Water is extremely good at what it does, and carbon works in water
1830160	1835600	especially well. Carbon is everywhere. Those things together make me think probabilistically,
1835600	1841120	if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them would be carbon-based and living in water.
1841920	1847280	Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water elsewhere and some carbon,
1848000	1853680	no, just a puddle of water. Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication that life
1855600	1863840	either exists here or has once existed here? No. So it doesn't work the other way.
1865280	1870720	I think you need a living planet. You need a planet which is capable of turning over its surface. It
1870720	1877360	needs to be a planet with water. It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons from inside
1877360	1881920	to the outside. It needs to turn over its surface. It needs to make that water work and turn it into
1881920	1886160	hydrogen. So I think you need a living planet. But once you've got the living planet, I think the
1886160	1892480	rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way. So if you were to run Earth over a million times,
1893040	1901600	up to this point, maybe beyond, to the end. Let's run it to the end. What is it? How much
1901600	1907280	variety is there? You kind of spoke to this trajectory that the environment dictates
1908240	1916320	like chemically, I don't know in which other way, spiritually, like dictates kind of the
1916320	1924000	direction of this giant machine that seems chaotic, but it does seem to have order in the
1924000	1932400	steps it's taking. How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge? How often will something
1932400	1937200	like humans emerge? How much variety do you think there would be? I think at the level of bacteria,
1937920	1942800	not much variety. I think we would get, that's how many times you say you want to run it a
1942800	1947840	million times. I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.
1949360	1954160	Because I think there's some level of inevitability that a wet rocky planet will give rise through
1955200	1961040	the same processes to something very, I think this is not something I'd have thought a few years ago,
1961040	1965200	but we're working with a PhD student of mine, Stuart Harrison. He's been thinking about the
1965200	1970960	genetic code, and we've just been publishing on that. There are patterns that you can discern
1971040	1976480	in the code, or he has discerned in the code, that if you think about them in terms of we start
1976480	1980720	with CO2 and hydrogen, and that these are the first steps of biochemistry, you come up with a code
1980720	1986000	which is very similar to the code that we see. It wouldn't surprise me any longer if we found
1986000	1990400	life on Mars and it had a genetic code that was not very different to the genetic code that we have
1990400	1996160	here without it just being transferred across. There's some inevitability about the whole of
1996160	2002480	the beginnings of life in my view. That's really promising because if the basic chemistry is tightly
2002480	2010400	linked to the genetic code, that means we can interact with other life if it exists out there.
2010400	2016000	Well, that's potentially... That's really exciting if that's the case. Okay, but then bacteria...
2016000	2023920	We've got bacteria. How easy is photosynthesis? Much harder, I would say.
2024800	2031600	Let's actually go there. Let's go through the inventions. What is photosynthesis and why is
2031600	2037680	it hard? Well, there are different forms. Basically, you're taking hydrogen and you're
2037680	2041920	sticking it onto CO2 and it's powered by the sun. The question is where are you taking the hydrogen
2041920	2047600	from? And in photosynthesis that we know in plants, it's coming from water. So you're using the power
2047600	2052400	of the sun to split water, take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2, and the oxygen is a waste
2052400	2058800	product and you just throw it out, throw it away. So it's the single greatest planetary pollution
2058800	2065520	event in the whole history of the earth. The pollutant being oxygen. Yes. It also made possible
2065520	2070480	animals. You can't have large active animals without an oxygenated atmosphere, at least not
2071600	2076000	in the sense that we know on earth. So that's a really big invention in the history of earth.
2076000	2080880	Huge invention, yes. And it happened once. There's a few things that happen once on earth and you're
2080880	2085520	always stuck with this problem. Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly that it precluded
2085520	2090480	the same thing happening ever again? Or are there other reasons? And we really have to look at each
2090480	2097600	one in turn and think, why did it only happen once? In this case, it's really difficult to split
2097600	2102160	water. It requires a lot of power and that power, you're effectively separating charge across a
2102160	2107040	membrane and the way in which you do it, if it doesn't all rush back and kind of cause an explosion
2107040	2114720	right at the site, requires really careful wiring. And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right
2114720	2121040	because the plants that we see around us, they have chloroplasts. Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria
2121040	2125760	ones. Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria that can do that type of photosynthesis.
2125760	2131840	So there's plenty of opportunity. So not even many bacteria. So who invented photosynthesis?
2132080	2134960	The cyanobacteria or their ancestors. And there's not many...
2136000	2141520	No other bacteria can do what's called oxygenic photosynthesis. Lots of other bacteria can split.
2142240	2145760	You can take your hydrogen from somewhere else. You can take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling
2145760	2150800	out of a hydrothermal vent, grab your two. Hydrogens, the sulfur is the waste now.
2152000	2156000	You can do it from iron. You can take electrons. So the early oceans were probably full of iron.
2156000	2161680	You can take an electron from ferrous iron, so iron 2 plus and make it iron 3 plus,
2161680	2167600	which now precipitates as rust. And you take a proton from the acidic early ocean,
2167600	2172240	stick it there. Now you've got a hydrogen atom, stick it onto CO2. You've just done the trick.
2172240	2178480	The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron. And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.
2178480	2183280	One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis is so much better is the waste product is oxygen,
2183280	2190320	which just bubbles away. That seems like extremely unlikely. And it's extremely
2190320	2194880	essential for the evolution of complex organisms because of all the oxygen.
2196080	2202000	Yeah. And that didn't accumulate quickly either. So it's converting, what is it?
2202000	2209200	It's converting energy from the sun and the resource of water into the resource needed for
2209200	2214480	animals. Both resources needed for animals. We need to eat and we need to burn the food.
2214480	2220480	And we're eating plants, which are getting their energy from the sun, and we're burning it with
2220480	2224560	their waste product, which is the oxygen. So there's a lot of kind of circularity in that.
2224560	2234880	But without an oxygenated planet, you couldn't really have predation. You can have animals,
2234880	2238640	but you can't really have animals that go around and eat each other. You can't have ecosystems,
2238640	2244320	as we know them. Well, let's actually step back. What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells,
2244320	2249840	prokaryotes? What are each of those and how big of an invention is that?
2250960	2254800	I personally think that's the single biggest invention in the whole history of life.
2254800	2257600	Exciting. So what are they? Can you explain?
2257600	2261920	Yeah. So I mentioned bacteria and archaea. These are both prokaryotes.
2262960	2266960	They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus. If you look at them under a microscope,
2266960	2270560	you don't see much going on. If you look at them under a super resolution microscope,
2270560	2275440	then they're fantastically complex. In terms of their molecular machinery, they're amazing.
2275440	2280320	In terms of their morphological appearance under a microscope, they're really small
2281440	2285600	and really simple. The earliest life that we can physically see on the planet are
2285600	2290960	stromatolites, which are made by things like cyanobacteria and their large superstructures.
2290960	2297280	Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other and you end up with quite large structures
2297280	2302960	that you can see in the fossil record. But they never came out with animals.
2302960	2306560	They never came out with plants. They came out with multicellular things,
2306560	2310800	filamentous cyanobacteria, for example. They're just long strings of cells.
2311360	2317200	But the origin of the eukaryotic cell seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis.
2317360	2323360	So one cell gets inside another cell. I think that that's transformed the energetic possibilities
2323360	2329360	of life. So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell, which can have a much larger
2329920	2336240	nucleus with many more genes, all supported. If you think about it, you could think about it as
2336240	2340320	multi-bacterial power without the overhead. So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria
2340320	2344960	living in it. And those bacteria are providing it with the energy currency it needs. But each
2344960	2351760	bacterium has a genome of its own, which costs a fair amount of energy to express, to kind of turn
2351760	2357200	over and convert into proteins and so on. What the mitochondria did, which are these
2358240	2363760	power packs in our own cells, they were bacteria once and they threw away virtually all their
2363760	2369120	genes. They've only got a few left. So mitochondria is, like you said, is the bacteria that got inside
2369120	2374240	a cell and then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to survive inside the cell and then
2374240	2380560	kept what? So what we end up with, so it kept always a handful of genes in our own case, 37 genes.
2381440	2386880	But there's a few protists, which are single cells, things that have got as many as 70 or 80
2386880	2392800	genes. So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number. And you can think of it as a
2392800	2398720	paired down power pack where the control unit has really been kind of paired down to almost nothing.
2398720	2403760	So you're putting out the same power, but the investment in the overheads is really paired
2403760	2409680	down. That means that you can support a much larger nuclear genome. So we've gone up in the
2409680	2413840	number of genes, but also the amount of power you have to convert those genes into proteins.
2414800	2419280	We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes, but in terms of the size of genomes and
2419280	2424000	your ability to make the building blocks, make the proteins, we've gone up a hundred thousand
2424000	2431200	fold or more. So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution. And it's interesting
2431200	2436400	then that the only, the only two occasions that complex life has arisen on earth, plants and
2436400	2443120	animals, fungi, you could say are complex as well, but they don't form such complex morphology as
2443120	2449120	plants and animals. Start with a single cell. They start with an oocyte and a sperm fused together
2449120	2454080	to make as I got. So you start development with a single cell and all the cells in the organism
2454080	2459920	have identical DNA. And you switch off in the brain, you switch off these genes and you switch on
2459920	2462720	those genes and the liver, you switch off those and you switch on a different set.
2463920	2467520	And the standard evolutionary explanation for that is that you've, you know, you're
2467520	2471840	restricting conflict. You don't have a load of genetically different cells that are all fighting
2471840	2477280	each other. And so it works. The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms and they're
2477280	2482480	all genetically different. And effectively, they're incapable of that level of cooperation.
2483200	2489760	They would get in the fight. Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention
2491120	2498000	of getting this bacteria inside and becoming an engine, which the mitochondria is? Why was that?
2498000	2502080	Why do you assign it such great importance? Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty
2502080	2506800	of how was to achieve a great importance in terms of the impact they had on life?
2506880	2514080	Both. It had a huge impact on life because if that had not happened, you can be certain
2514080	2518080	that life on earth would be bacterial only. And that took a really long time to...
2518080	2522640	It took two billion years. And it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge.
2522640	2527280	So it looks as if it's genuinely difficult. And if you think about it then from just an
2527280	2534240	informational perspective, you think bacteria have got, they structure their information
2534240	2538960	differently. So a bacterial cell has a small genome, you might have 4,000 genes in it,
2538960	2544640	but a single E. coli cell has access to about 30,000 genes. Potentially, it's got a kind of
2544640	2549840	metagenome where other E. coli out there have got different gene sets and they can switch them
2549840	2556160	around between themselves. And so you can generate a huge amount of variation and they've got more...
2556160	2562640	An E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome. We own 20,000 genes or something.
2563200	2569920	So... And they've had 4 billion years of evolution to work out what can I do and what can't I do
2569920	2574240	with this metagenome. And the answer is you're stuck. You're still bacteria.
2574240	2581200	So they have explored genetic sequence space far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did
2581200	2585840	because they've had twice as long at least and they've got much larger populations.
2585840	2590640	And they never got around this problem. So why can't they? It seems as if you can't solve it
2590640	2598640	with information alone. So what's the problem? The problem is structure. If cells...
2598640	2602080	If the very first cells need an electrical charge on their membrane to grow
2602880	2607520	and in bacteria, it's the outer membrane that surrounds the cell, which is electrically charged.
2608160	2612240	You try and scale that up and you've got a fundamental design problem. You've got an
2612240	2617280	engineering problem. And there are examples of it and what we see in all these cases is what's
2617280	2621200	known as extreme polyploidy, which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies of their
2621200	2629200	complete genome, which is energetically hugely expensive and you end up with a large bacteria with
2630240	2636800	no further development. What you need is to incorporate these electrically charged power
2636800	2643200	pack units inside with their control units intact. And for them not to conflict so much
2643200	2647840	with the host cell that it all goes wrong. Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.
2647840	2654160	And then you change the topology of the cell. Now, you don't necessarily have any more DNA
2654160	2659840	than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy. But what you've got is an asymmetry. You now have a
2659840	2666640	giant nuclear genome surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes that do all the...
2666640	2671520	And they're the control units that are doing all the control of energy generation.
2672320	2675200	Could this have been done gradually or does it have to be done?
2676000	2680080	The power pack has to be all intact and ready to go and work.
2680080	2683760	I mean, it's a kind of step change in the possibilities of evolution, but it doesn't
2683760	2689360	happen overnight. It's going to still require multiple, multiple generations. So it could take
2689360	2693360	millions of years. It could take shorter time. This is another thing I would like to put the
2693360	2697520	number of steps and try and work out what's required at each step. And we are trying to do
2697520	2702160	that with sex for example. You can't have a very large genome unless you have sex at that point.
2702160	2706800	So what are the changes to go from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?
2708320	2713040	What do you need to do? Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA as if it's loose
2713040	2718560	change to fusing cells together, lining up the chromosomes, recombining across the chromosomes
2718560	2723520	and then going through two rounds of cell division to produce your gametes? All eukaryotes do it that
2723520	2730400	way. So again, why switch? What are the drivers here? So there's a lot of time, there's a lot of
2730400	2735680	evolution, but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell, what you've got is a new
2735680	2742000	design. You've got new potential that you didn't have before. So the cell living inside another cell,
2742000	2752640	that design allows for better storage of information, better use of energy, more delegation,
2752720	2758640	like a hierarchical control of the whole thing. And then somehow that leads to ability to have
2758640	2763920	multi-cell organisms. I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily, but you've
2763920	2769920	got a system where you can have a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus. You
2769920	2776000	can have a much larger genome. And that allows multicellularity, yes, because it allows you...
2776960	2785120	It's a funny thing, but to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes switched on in my brain
2785120	2789680	and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something, you've got to have all those genes
2789680	2795360	in the egg cell at the very beginning. And you've got to have a program of development
2795360	2799200	which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes and switch on those genes and you guys,
2799200	2802880	you do that. But all the genes are there at the beginning. That means you've got to have a lot
2802960	2806800	of genes in one cell and you've got to be able to maintain them. And the problem with bacteria is
2806800	2811600	they don't get close to having enough genes in one cell. So if you were to try and make a
2811600	2815680	multicellular organism from bacteria, you'd bring different types of bacteria together and hope
2815680	2820480	they'll cooperate and the reality is they don't. That's really, really tough to do. Yeah. We know
2820480	2825360	they don't because it doesn't exist. We have the data, as far as we know. I'm sure there's a few
2825360	2830480	like special ones and they get off quickly. I'd love to know some of the most fun things bacteria
2830480	2837120	have done since. I mean, they can do some pretty funky things. This is big, this is broad brush
2837120	2844160	joke that I'm talking about. Yes, generally speaking. So how was another fun invention?
2844960	2850800	Us humans seem to utilize it well, but you say it's also very important early on is sex.
2851600	2858800	So what is sex? Just asking for a friend. And when was it invented and how hard was it
2858800	2864800	to invent? Just as you were saying, and why was it invented? Why, how hard was it and when?
2865600	2869600	I have a PhD student who's been working on this and we've just published a couple of papers on
2869600	2874640	sex. Yes, yes, yes. What do you publish? Does biology? Is it biology, genetics, journals?
2875440	2880080	This is actually PNAS, which is Proceedings of the National Academy.
2880080	2887120	Broad, big pictures. Everyone's interested in sex. The job of biologist is to make sex dull.
2887440	2892240	Yes. Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it. Okay. So when was it invented?
2893120	2900240	It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago. All eukaryotes share the same basic
2900240	2905280	mechanism that you produce gametes. The gametes fuse together. So a gamete is the egg cell and
2905280	2911680	the sperm. They're not necessarily even different in size or shape. So the simplest eukaryotes produce
2911680	2915200	what are called motile gametes. They're all like sperm and they all swim around. They find
2915200	2919920	each other. They fuse together. They don't have kind of much going on there beyond that.
2919920	2927200	And then these are haploid, which is to say we all have two copies of our genome and the gametes
2927200	2931840	have only a single copy of the genome. So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,
2931840	2937520	which is to say you now have two copies of your genome. And what you do is you line them all up
2938880	2943840	and then you double everything. So now we have four copies of the complete genome.
2943920	2947600	And then we crisscross between all of these things. So we take a bit from here and stick it on there
2947600	2953840	and a bit from here and we stick it on here. That's recombination. And then we go through two rounds
2953840	2958400	of cell division. So we divide in half. So now the two daughter cells have two copies and we
2958400	2963440	divide in half again. Now we have some gametes, each of which has got a single copy of the genome.
2964400	2970880	And that's the basic ground plan for what's called meiosis and syngamy. That's basically sex.
2971520	2975120	And it happens at the level of single-celled organisms and it happens pretty much the same
2975120	2979680	way in plants and pretty much the same way in animals and so on. And it's not found in any bacteria.
2980240	2984160	They switch things around using the same machinery and they take up a bit of DNA
2984160	2988160	from the environment. They take out this bit and stick in that bit and it's the same molecular
2988160	2992640	machinery they're using to do it. So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,
2992640	2999600	this kind of imperative to find each other. What is that? Like is that? Well, you've got a few cells
2999600	3007200	together. So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria. I mean, it's kind of simple when you've
3007200	3011520	figured it out and figuring it out. This is not me. This is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.
3012960	3020080	And in effect, if you're doing lateral, you're a Nikolaicel. You've got 4,000 genes. You want to
3020080	3027680	scale up to a eukaryotic size. I want to have 20,000 genes. And I need to maintain my genome
3027680	3032720	so it doesn't get shot to pieces by mutations. And I'm going to do it by lateral gene transfer.
3032720	3038800	So I know I've got a mutation in a gene. I don't know which gene it is because I'm not sentient,
3038800	3043200	but I know I can't grow. I know all my regulation systems are saying something wrong here,
3043200	3046560	something wrong. Pick up some DNA. Pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.
3047680	3051200	If you've got a small genome, the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA from the
3051200	3056400	environment is much higher than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes. To do that, you've
3056400	3060640	effectively got to be picking up DNA all the time, all day long, and nothing else. And you're
3060640	3064320	still going to get the wrong DNA. You've got to pick up large chunks. And in the end, you've got
3064320	3077440	to align them. You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase. So there is a kind of incentive.
3078560	3082640	If you want to have a large genome, you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.
3082640	3086880	That will happen with bacteria. There's another reason why bacteria can't have a large genome.
3086880	3090320	But as soon as you give them the power pack, as soon as you give you carotid cells the power pack
3090320	3094640	that allows them to increase the size of their genome, then you face the pressure that you've
3094640	3098240	got to maintain its quality. You've got to stop it just mutating away.
3098240	3105840	What about sexual selection? So the finding, I don't like this one. I don't like this one. This
3105840	3112320	one seems all right. At which point does it become less random?
3112720	3115920	It's hard to know. Because eukaryotes just float around.
3115920	3121120	I mean, is there sexual selection in single celled eukaryotes? The probably is. It's just
3121120	3123440	that I don't know very much about it. By the time we get on to it.
3123440	3128560	If you don't hang out with the eukaryotes. Well, I do all the time, but I can't communicate with
3128560	3136480	them yet. A peacock or something. This is not quite what I work on, but the standard answer
3137280	3144880	is that it's female mate choice. She is looking for good genes. If you can have a tail that's like
3144880	3149840	this and still survive, still be alive, not actually have been taken down by the nearest
3149840	3153680	predator, then you must have got pretty good genes. Because despite this handicap,
3154560	3158160	you're able to survive. So those are like human interpretable things,
3158160	3162160	like with a peacock. But I wonder, I'm sure echos of the same thing
3162960	3170160	are there with more primitive organisms. Basically, your PR, like how you advertise
3170160	3177040	yourself that you're worthy of. So one big advertisement is the fact that you survived
3177040	3185440	it all. Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom. And this can be a cyanobacteria.
3185440	3191120	It's going to be in bacteria. So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate or something
3191120	3196720	into the ocean and everything goes green, you end up with all this algae growing there.
3198080	3202640	A viral infection or something like that can kill the entire bloom overnight.
3203200	3208480	And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight. It's that most of the cells in that
3208480	3213680	bloom kill themselves before the virus can get onto them. And it's through a form of cell death
3213680	3217680	called programmed cell death. And we do the same things. This is how we have the different,
3217920	3222000	the gaps between our fingers and so on is how we craft synapses in the brain.
3223520	3230480	It's fundamental again to multicellular life. They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.
3231200	3237600	How do they know who dies? The answer is they will often put out a toxin. And that toxin
3238240	3244400	is kind of a challenge to you. Either you can cope with the toxin or you can't. If you can cope with
3244400	3251120	it, you form a spore and you will go on to become the next generation. You form a kind of a resistance
3251120	3257600	spore. You sink down a little bit. You get out of the way. You can't be attacked by a virus if
3257600	3262400	you're a spore or at least not so easily. Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin, you pull the
3262400	3268560	plug and you trigger your death apparatus and you kill yourself. It's truly life and death
3269120	3274080	solution. Yeah. So it's really, it's a challenge. And this is a bit like sexual selection. It's not
3274480	3279520	they're all pretty much genetically identical, but they've had different life histories. So
3279520	3285440	have you had a tough day? Did you happen to get infected by this virus or did you run out of iron
3285440	3291280	or did you get a bit too much sun? Whatever it may be, if this extra stress of the toxin just
3291280	3295120	pushes you over the edge, then you have this binary choice. Either you're the next generation
3295120	3300000	or you kill yourself now using the same machinery. It's also actually exactly the way I approach
3300000	3306400	dating, but that's probably why I'm single. Okay. What about if we can step back DNA?
3307280	3313760	Just mechanism of storing information. RNA, DNA. Yeah. How big of an invention was that? That seems
3313760	3323280	to be, that seems to be fundamental to like something deep within what life is, is the ability,
3323280	3329360	as you said, to kind of store and propagate information. But then you also kind of infer
3329920	3335440	with your and your students' work that there's a deep connection between the chemistry and the
3335440	3342800	ability to have this kind of genetic information. So how big of an invention is it to have a nice
3342800	3348640	representation, a nice hard drive for info to pass on? Huge, I suspect. I mean, but
3349200	3354320	when I was talking about the code, you see the code in RNA as well. And RNA almost certainly came
3354320	3361440	first. And there's been an idea going back decades called the RNA world because RNA in theory can
3362000	3367200	copy itself and can catalyze reactions. So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.
3367760	3372640	The DNA, it's possible, is not that special. So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work,
3372640	3378240	really. And the code lies in RNA. The code lies in the interactions between RNA and amino acids.
3378240	3383680	And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example, which is just kind of a giant ribosome,
3383680	3392400	which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA. So getting to RNA, I suspect it's probably not
3392400	3399600	that hard. But getting from RNA, how do you, you know, there's multiple different types of RNA
3399600	3404640	now. How do you distinguish? This is something we're actively thinking about. How do you distinguish
3404640	3410480	between, you know, a random population of RNA? Some of them go on to become messenger RNA. This
3410480	3416800	is the transcript of the code, of the gene that you want to make. Some of them become transfer RNA,
3416800	3421680	which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid that's going to be polymerized.
3421680	3426960	Some of them become ribosomal RNA, which is the machine which is joining them all up together.
3427600	3432640	How do they discriminate themselves? And, you know, there's some kind of phase transition going on
3432640	3438400	there. I don't know. It's a difficult question. And we're now in the region of biology where
3438400	3443200	information is coming in. But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does. But the
3443200	3449520	largest genome supported by RNA are RNA viruses like HIV, for example. They're pretty small.
3450800	3456560	And so there's a limit to how complex life could be unless you come up with DNA, which
3456560	3462560	chemically is a really small change. But how easy it is to make that change? I don't really know.
3462560	3467920	As soon as you've got DNA, then you've got an amazingly stable molecule for information storage.
3468800	3473680	And you can do absolutely anything. But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was? I don't know
3473680	3480800	either. How much possibility is there for variety in ways to store information? Because it seems
3480800	3486560	to be very specific characteristics about the programming language of DNA.
3486560	3494560	Yeah. There's a lot of work going on on what's called Zeno DNA or RNA. Can we replace the bases
3494560	3500640	themselves, the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA? Can we replace the backbone? Can we replace,
3500640	3506000	for example, phosphate with arsenate? Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose with
3506000	3512800	a different sugar? And the answer is yes, you can. Within limits, there's not an infinite
3512800	3518000	space there. Arsenate doesn't really work if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate. It's
3518000	3526240	probably quite hard to replace phosphate. It's possible to do it. The question to me is why is
3526240	3531680	it this way? Is it because there was some form of selection that this is better than the other
3531680	3535520	forms and there were lots of competing forms of information storage early on and this one was
3535520	3540000	the one that worked out? Or was it kind of channeled that way, that these are the molecules that
3540000	3546080	you're dealing with and they work? And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way that we're
3546160	3554000	channeled towards ribose, phosphate, and the bases that are used. But there are 200 different
3554000	3558320	letters kicking around out there that could have been used. It's such an interesting question. If
3558320	3563040	you look at in the programming world in computer science, there's a programming language called
3563040	3568640	JavaScript, which was written super quickly. It's a giant mess, but it took over the world.
3569600	3576640	It sounds very biological. It was kind of a running joke that surely this can't be.
3577760	3582480	It's a terrible programming language. It's a giant mess. It's full of bugs. It's so easy to
3582480	3589280	write really crappy code, but it took over all of front-end development in the web browser.
3589280	3594320	If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website, it's usually running JavaScript,
3594960	3599680	and it's now taking over much of the back end, which is like the serious heavy-duty
3599680	3604800	computational stuff, and it's become super fast with the different compilation engines
3605760	3609200	that are running it. So it's like, it really took over the world. It's very possible that this
3610080	3615920	initially crappy, derided language actually takes everything over. And then the question is,
3616160	3624240	did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript, or was JavaScript just the first
3624240	3629840	programming language that ran on the browser and still sticky? The first is the sticky one,
3629840	3634400	and so it wins over anything else because it was first. I don't think that's answerable,
3634400	3642880	right? But it's good to ask that. I suppose in the lab, you can't run it with programming
3642880	3652080	languages, but in biology, you can probably do some kind of small-scale evolutionary test
3652080	3658080	to try to infer which is which. Yeah. I mean, in a way, we've got the hardware and the software
3658080	3664400	here, and the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself, and then the software, perhaps,
3664400	3668400	is more about the code. Did the code have to be this way? Could it have been a different way?
3669360	3673360	People talk about the optimization of the code, and there's some suggestion for that.
3674080	3678000	I think it's weak, actually. But you could imagine, you could come out with a million
3678000	3683600	different codes, and this would be one of the best ones. Well, we don't know this.
3684320	3689920	Well, I mean, people have tried to model it based on the effect that mutations would have.
3691120	3695520	So no, you're right. We don't know it because that's a single assumption that a mutation is
3695600	3699280	what's being selected on there, and there's other possibilities, too.
3699280	3703120	I mean, there does seem to be a resilience and a redundancy to the whole thing.
3703120	3710400	Yes. It's hard to mess up, and the way you mess it up often is likely to produce interesting
3710400	3714800	results. Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?
3715360	3720960	Yeah. Well, I mean, biology is underpinned by this kind of mess, as well. You look at the
3720960	3726480	human genome, and it's full of stuff that is really either broken or dysfunctional or was
3726480	3731600	a virus once, whatever it may be, and somehow it works, and maybe we need a lot of this mess.
3731600	3734160	We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.
3735360	3738880	So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.
3739440	3740000	Yeah.
3740000	3744320	We talked about sex. What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?
3744480	3753120	How, when was that invented? And poetic and biological ways of putting it,
3753920	3761600	how do you describe predator-prayer relationship? Is it a beautiful dance, or is it a violent atrocity?
3762960	3767680	Well, I guess it's both, isn't it? I mean, when does it start? It starts in bacteria. You see
3767680	3772800	these amazing predators. Delivibrio is one that, in Margolis, used to talk about a lot.
3773760	3778640	It's got a kind of a drill piece that drills through the wall and the membrane of the bacterium,
3778640	3783440	and then it effectively eats the bacterium from just inside the periplasmic space,
3783440	3787280	and makes copies of itself that way. So that's straight predation. There are predators among
3787280	3794400	bacteria. So predation in that, sorry to interrupt, means you murder somebody and use their body as
3794480	3798000	a resource in some way. Yeah.
3798000	3803440	But it's not parasitic in that you need them to be still alive?
3803440	3806320	No, no. I mean, predation is you kill them, really.
3806320	3806880	You murder.
3806880	3809280	The parasite is, you kind of live on them.
3810320	3815600	Okay. So, but it seems the predator is the really popular tool.
3815600	3823520	So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years before the Cambrian explosion,
3824320	3830160	there is what's known as the Ediacaran fauna, or sometimes they call Vendobionts,
3830160	3834720	which is a lovely name. And it's not obvious that they're animals at all.
3835680	3840400	They're stalked things. They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves with kind of fractal
3840400	3849760	branching patterns on them. And the thing is, they're found sometimes geologists can figure out
3849840	3854000	the environment that they were in and say, this is more than 200 meters deep because
3854000	3858560	there's no sign of any waves. There's no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.
3859440	3862800	They were more than 200 meters deep. So they're definitely not photosynthetic.
3862800	3868960	These are animals. And they're filter feeders. And we know sponges and corals and things are
3868960	3873840	filter feeding animals. They're stuck to the spot. And little bits of carbon that come their way.
3873840	3876080	They filter it out and that's what they're eating.
3876400	3882960	So no predation involved in this beyond stuff just dies anyway. And it feels like a very gentle,
3882960	3888160	rather beautiful, rather limited world, you might say. There's not a lot going on there.
3889440	3895280	And something changes. Oxygen definitely changes during this period. Other things
3895280	3899920	may have changed as well. But the next thing you really see in the fossil record is the Cambrian
3899920	3905360	explosion. And what do we see there? We're now seeing animals that we would recognize.
3905360	3911200	They've got ice. They've got claws. They've got shells. They're plainly killing things or running
3911200	3920400	away and hiding. And so we've gone from a rather gentle but limited world to a rather vicious,
3920400	3930000	unpleasant world that we recognize and which leads to kind of arms races, evolutionary arms races.
3931200	3934640	Which again is something that when we think about a nuclear arms race, we think, Jesus,
3934640	3941040	we don't want to go there. It's not done anybody any good. In some ways, maybe it does do good.
3941040	3949760	I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms. But predation as a mechanism forces organisms to
3949760	3956240	adapt change to be better to escape or to kill. If you need to eat, then you've got to eat. And
3956240	3963520	a cheetah is not going to run at that speed unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.
3963600	3970080	So it leads to much greater feats of evolution would ever have been possible without it. And in
3970080	3978320	the end, to a much more beautiful world. And so it's not all bad by any means. But the thing is,
3978320	3983280	you can't have this if you don't have an oxygenated planet because it's all in the end. It's about
3983280	3988320	how much energy can you extract from the food you eat. And if you don't have an oxygenated planet,
3988320	3994080	you can get about 10% out, not much more than that. And if you've got an oxygenated planet,
3994080	3998960	you can get about 40% out. And that means you can have instead of having one or two
3998960	4004400	trophic levels, you can have five or six trophic levels. And that means things can eat things that
4004400	4009520	eat other things and so on. And you've gone to a level of ecological complexity, which is completely
4009520	4014240	impossible in the absence of oxygen. This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote,
4014240	4020640	that for every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.
4022000	4030400	The history of life on earth, unfortunately, is that of violence, just the trillions and
4030400	4036960	trillions of multi cell organisms that were murdered in the in the struggled.
4036960	4039840	It's a sorry statement. But yes, it's basically true.
4040320	4046240	And that somehow is a catalyst from an evolutionary perspective for creativity,
4046240	4050640	for creating more and more complex organisms that are better and better at surviving.
4050640	4055120	Survival of the fittest, if you just go back to that old phrase, means death the weakest.
4056240	4061280	Now, what's fit, what's weak, these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning.
4061280	4064560	But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.
4065280	4071280	One way to die is the constraints, the scarcity of the resources in the environment.
4072000	4076640	But that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism for death
4077200	4082240	than other creatures roam about in the environment. When I say environment,
4082240	4085920	I mean like the static environment. But then there's the dynamic environment of
4086560	4089760	bigger things trying to eat you and use you for your energy.
4090480	4094480	It forces you to come up with a solution to your specific problem
4094960	4098720	that is inventive and is new and hasn't been done before.
4098720	4105920	And so it forces, I mean, literally change, literally evolution on populations,
4105920	4107280	they have to become different.
4107280	4111600	And it's interesting that humans have channeled that into more,
4112240	4115040	I mean, I guess what humans are doing is they're inventing
4115600	4119280	more productive and safe ways of doing that.
4119280	4122480	You know, this whole idea of morality and all those kinds of things,
4123280	4129840	I think they ultimately lead to competition versus violence.
4129840	4136400	Because I think violence can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.
4136400	4142400	But if you channel that into more controlled competition in the space of ideas,
4143360	4146080	in the space of approaches to life, maybe you can
4148320	4152160	be even more productive than evolution is, because evolution is very wasteful.
4152160	4156560	Like the modern murder required to really test a good idea,
4156560	4161280	genetically speaking, is just a lot. Many, many, many generations.
4161280	4165840	Morally, we cannot base society on the way that evolution works.
4165840	4167200	That's an invention, right?
4167200	4170320	But actually, in some respects, we do, which is to say,
4170320	4172880	this is how science works. We have competing hypotheses
4172880	4175280	that have to get better, otherwise they die.
4175280	4178480	It's the way that society works. In ancient Greece,
4178480	4182480	we had the Athens and Sparta and city-states,
4182480	4185280	and then we had the Renaissance and nation-states.
4185280	4187840	And universities compete with each other.
4187840	4188320	Yes.
4188320	4191680	Tremendous amount of companies competing with each other all the time.
4191680	4193440	It drives innovation.
4194960	4199040	And if we want to do it without all the death that we see in nature,
4199040	4203760	then we have to have some kind of societal level control that says,
4203760	4207200	well, there's some limits, guys, and these are what the limits are going to be.
4207200	4210880	And society as a whole has to say, right, we want to limit the amount of death here,
4210880	4212720	so you can't do this and you can't do that.
4212720	4214960	And who makes up these rules and how do we know?
4214960	4219440	It's a tough thing, but it's basically trying to find a moral basis
4219440	4222960	for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection
4222960	4226720	and keeping the innovation and the richness of it.
4227280	4231760	And I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal,
4231760	4234320	probably curve out of it, murder is illegal,
4234320	4238160	except when it's done to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.
4238160	4240160	So we still have wars.
4241680	4246400	But we are struggling with this idea that murder is a bad thing.
4247280	4252400	It's so interesting how we're channeling the best of the evolutionary imperative
4253280	4257600	and trying to get rid of the stuff that's not productive.
4258400	4260560	So trying to almost accelerate evolution,
4260560	4267280	the same kind of thing that makes evolution creative, we're trying to use that.
4267280	4268560	I think we naturally do it.
4268560	4270480	I mean, I don't think we can help ourselves do it.
4272000	4276560	Capitalism as a form is basically about competition and differential rewards.
4277200	4285120	But society, and I keep using this word moral obligation,
4286480	4289760	we cannot operate as a society if we go that way.
4289760	4295120	It's interesting that we've had problems achieving balance.
4295120	4298640	So for example, in the financial crash in 2009,
4299280	4301200	do you let banks go to the wall or not?
4301200	4302880	This is kind of question.
4302880	4304960	In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall,
4304960	4309280	and in that sense, you don't need the regulation because they just die.
4311360	4316240	Whereas if we as a society think about what's required for society as a whole,
4316240	4318400	then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall.
4319360	4325360	In which case, you then have to impose some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will
4325360	4327040	in an evolutionary manner exploit.
4328000	4332720	Yeah, we've been struggling with this kind of idea of capitalism,
4333360	4339600	the cold brutality of capitalism that seems to create so much beautiful things in this world,
4340240	4346480	and then the ideals of communism that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.
4346480	4350400	We struggle with ideas of, well, maybe we didn't do it right.
4350400	4351600	How can we do things better?
4351600	4355840	And then the ideas are the things we're playing with as opposed to people.
4355920	4358960	If a PhD student has a bad idea, we don't shoot the PhD student.
4358960	4361920	We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.
4361920	4363120	You have a very humane lamp.
4363920	4365520	Yeah, I don't know how you guys do it.
4365520	4369280	You know, the way I run things, it's always life and death.
4369280	4374560	Okay, so it is interesting about humans that there is an inner sense of morality,
4375600	4382320	which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?
4382320	4388880	If we think about the invention of early invention of sex and early invention of predation,
4390560	4394240	what was the thing invented to make humans?
4395360	4396560	What would you say?
4397040	4399120	I mean, I suppose a couple of things I'd say.
4399120	4404080	Number one is you don't have to wind the clock back very far, five, six million years or so,
4404080	4406560	and let it run forwards again.
4406560	4410240	And the chances of humans, as we know them, is not necessarily that high.
4410880	4415200	Now, you know, imagine, as an alien, you find planet Earth and it's got everything
4415200	4419280	apart from humans on it, it's an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet,
4419280	4423520	but nothing that we would recognize as extremely intelligent life,
4423520	4425680	kind of space-faring civilization.
4425680	4429600	So when we think about aliens, we're kind of after something like ourselves,
4429600	4431680	or after a space-faring civilization.
4431680	4435760	We're not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things.
4435760	4436880	Amazing though they are.
4437680	4445520	But the additional kind of evolutionary steps to go from large complex mammals, monkeys, let's say,
4447360	4452960	to humans doesn't strike me as that longer a distance.
4452960	4454400	It's all about the brain.
4454400	4457040	And where's the brain and morality coming from?
4457040	4462320	It seems to me to be all about groups, human groups and interactions between groups.
4462320	4463760	The collective intelligence of it.
4464400	4466640	Yes, the interactions really.
4466640	4471920	And there's a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas who's done a lot of really beautiful work,
4471920	4473440	I think, on this kind of question.
4473440	4477040	So I talk to him every now and then, so my view is influenced by him.
4478880	4482480	But a lot seems to depend on population density.
4483440	4486560	The more interactions you have going on between different groups,
4486560	4490320	the more transfer of information, if you like, between groups,
4490320	4493520	so people moving from one group to another group,
4493520	4495840	almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria.
4497200	4501040	The more expertise you're able to develop and maintain,
4501040	4504400	the more culturally complex your society can become.
4504400	4509200	And groups that have become detached, like on Easter Island, for example,
4509200	4513520	very often degenerate in terms of the complexity of their civilization.
4513520	4516080	Is that true for complex organisms in general?
4516080	4518560	Population density is often productive.
4519200	4519760	Really matters.
4519760	4526000	But in human terms, I don't know what the actual factors were
4526000	4528560	that were driving a large brain.
4528560	4530720	But you can talk about fire.
4530720	4532880	You can talk about tool use.
4532880	4534080	You can talk about language.
4534080	4536720	And none of them seem to correlate especially well
4536720	4542800	with the actual known trajectory of human evolution in terms of cave art and these kind of things.
4542800	4547520	That seems to work much better just with population density
4547520	4550480	and a number of interactions between different groups.
4551120	4555760	All of which is really about human interactions.
4555760	4558560	Human-human interactions and the complexity of those.
4558560	4564160	But population density is the thing that increases the number of interactions.
4564160	4566320	But then there must have been inventions
4569440	4574560	forced by that number of interactions that actually led to humans.
4574560	4581360	So like Richard Rangham talks about that it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha
4581360	4585760	male. So that's what collaboration looks like is they, when you're living together,
4585760	4594480	they don't like, our early ancestors don't like the dictatorial aspect of a single individual
4594480	4595440	at the top of a tribe.
4596000	4602720	So they learn to collaborate how to basically create a democracy of sorts,
4602720	4607200	a democracy that prevents, minimizes or lessens the amount of violence,
4607280	4614960	which essentially gives strength to the tribe and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.
4614960	4620320	I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things about humans is where all of those things.
4620320	4625280	I mean, we are deeply social as a species and we're also deeply selfish.
4625280	4628400	And it seems to me the conflict between capitalism and communism,
4628400	4631120	it's really just two aspects of human nature, both of which are.
4631120	4631760	Yeah, both.
4631760	4636080	We have both and we have a constant kind of vying between the two sides.
4636080	4641120	We really do care about other people beyond our families, beyond our immediate people.
4641120	4643920	We care about society and the society that we live in.
4644480	4648480	And you could say that's a drawing towards socialism or communism.
4648480	4650640	On the other side, we really do care about ourselves.
4650640	4654640	We really do care about our families about working for something that we gain from.
4654640	4655920	And that's the capitalist side of it.
4655920	4658000	They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature.
4658800	4663200	In terms of violence and interactions between groups,
4663280	4667120	yes, all this dynamic of if you're interacting between groups,
4667120	4670240	you can be certain that they're going to be burning each other
4670240	4673360	and all kinds of physical, violent interactions as well,
4673360	4677760	which will drive the kind of cleverness of how do you resist this?
4677760	4678800	Let's build a tower.
4678800	4682560	Let's see, what are we going to do to prevent being overrun
4682560	4684880	by those marauding gangs from over there?
4686400	4690640	And you look outside humans and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on.
4690720	4693280	And they're very, very different structures to society.
4693280	4697280	Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure and bonobos.
4699440	4702800	There's basically a female society where the males are predominantly excluded
4702800	4704640	and only brought in at the behest of the female.
4705600	4709200	We have a lot in common with both of those groups.
4709200	4711200	And there's again tension there.
4711200	4714800	And probably chimps more violent, so bonobos probably more sex.
4715360	4716560	That's another tension.
4717440	4722160	How serious do we want to be?
4722160	4723200	How much fun do we want to be?
4724080	4727840	Asking for a friend again, what do you think happened to Neanderthals?
4727840	4732880	What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals, homo sapiens?
4732880	4734080	Do you think we murdered them?
4735600	4736640	How do we murder them?
4736640	4737920	How do we out-compete them?
4739200	4741200	Or do we out-mate them?
4741200	4742000	I don't know.
4742000	4745280	I mean, I think there's unequivocal evidence that we mated with them.
4745920	4747680	We always try to mate with everything.
4747680	4748480	Yes, pretty much.
4749360	4750240	There's some interesting.
4750240	4753280	The first sequences that came along were in mitochondrial DNA.
4754400	4756960	And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.
4758480	4762080	What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA was very different
4762080	4763280	to human mitochondria.
4763280	4763840	Oh, that's so interesting.
4763840	4764960	You could do a clock on it.
4764960	4768400	And they said the divergent state was about 600,000 years ago
4768400	4770160	or something like that, so not so long ago.
4771360	4773920	And then the first full genomes were sequenced,
4773920	4775200	maybe 10 years after that.
4776000	4779520	And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.
4779520	4782240	So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.
4783040	4786880	And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.
4787760	4788320	But we don't know.
4788320	4789120	Is that possible?
4789120	4793760	So can you explain the difference between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?
4793760	4795520	I've talked before about the mitochondria,
4795520	4797360	which are the power packs in cells.
4797360	4800800	These are the paired down control units is their DNA.
4801360	4803760	So it's passed on by the mother only.
4804880	4810480	And in the egg cell, we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.
4810480	4812320	There's only 37 genes left.
4813360	4817040	And they do basically the control unit of energy production.
4817040	4818400	That's what it's doing.
4818400	4821520	It's a basic old school machine that does.
4821520	4824800	And it's got genes that were considered to be effectively trivial
4824800	4828640	because they did a very narrowly defined job.
4828640	4831920	But they're not trivial in the sense that that narrowly defined job is about
4832640	4834320	everything that is being alive.
4836960	4838080	So they're much easier to sequence.
4838080	4839680	You've got many more copies of these things.
4839680	4841120	And you can sequence them very quickly.
4842000	4846240	But the problem is because they go down only the maternal line from mother to daughter,
4846240	4849520	your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.
4849520	4853680	Doesn't matter any kids we have, they get their mother's mitochondrial DNA.
4854800	4858800	Except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.
4859760	4862240	And so it tells a different story.
4862240	4865760	And it's not a story which is easy to reconcile always.
4866800	4871360	And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least is that there was one way
4872480	4877440	traffic of genes probably going from humans into Neanderthals rather than the other way around.
4878000	4879760	Why did the Neanderthals disappear?
4879760	4880720	I don't know.
4880720	4886400	I mean, I suspect that they were probably less violent, less clever,
4887360	4891520	less populace, less willing to fight.
4891520	4892400	I don't know.
4892400	4895760	I mean, I think I already drove them to extinction at the margins of Europe.
4897120	4900880	And it's interesting how much if we ran earth over and over again,
4901440	4907360	how many of these branches of intelligent beings that have figured out some kind of
4909600	4913680	how to leverage collective intelligence, which ones of them emerge,
4913680	4915600	which one of them succeed?
4915600	4917040	Is it the more violent ones?
4917760	4921040	Is it the more isolated ones?
4921040	4923840	You know, like what dynamics result to more productivity?
4923840	4925440	And I suppose we'll never know.
4926320	4930640	The more complex the organism, the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.
4930640	4930960	Yes.
4932080	4934240	And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.
4935200	4937520	Yeah, the truth might be very painful.
4938160	4942720	What about if we actually step back a couple of interesting things that we humans do?
4944640	4947920	One is object manipulation and movement.
4948800	4951120	And of course, movement was something that was done.
4951920	4955280	That was another big invention, being able to move around the environment.
4956320	4960960	And the other one is this sensory mechanism, how we sense the environment.
4960960	4963760	One of the coolest, high definition ones is vision.
4965280	4969680	How big are those inventions in the history of life on earth?
4970640	4976560	Vision, movement, again, extremely important, going back to the origin of animals,
4976560	4980400	the Cambrian explosion where suddenly you're seeing eyes in the fossil record.
4981760	4986800	It's not necessarily, again, lots of people historically have said what use is half an eye.
4988080	4997120	You can go in a series of steps from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue
4997200	4999360	to an eyeball with a lens and so on.
5000320	5003280	If you assume no more, then I don't remember this.
5003280	5008080	This was a specific model that I have in mind, but it was one percent change or half a percent
5008080	5009360	change for each generation.
5009360	5011440	How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?
5011440	5012880	And the answer is half a million years.
5013920	5015520	It doesn't have to take long.
5015520	5016800	That's not how evolution works.
5016800	5018560	That's not an answer to the question.
5018560	5024000	It just shows you can reconstruct the steps and you can work out roughly how it can work.
5024560	5028000	So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye.
5029280	5032000	But once you have one, then there's no way to hide.
5032000	5035040	And again, we're back to predator-prey relationships.
5035040	5038240	We're back to all the benefits that being able to see brings you.
5038240	5042560	And if you think philosophically what bats are doing with eco-location and so on,
5043360	5044160	I have no idea.
5044160	5047920	But I suspect that they form an image of the world in pretty much the same way that we do.
5047920	5050080	It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.
5050080	5055600	So I suppose the other thing about sight, there are single-celled organisms that have got
5056240	5061520	a lens and a retina and a cornea and so on.
5061520	5064720	Basically, they've got a camera tied by in a single cell.
5064720	5065680	They don't have a brain.
5067440	5072480	What they understand about their world is impossible to say, but they're capable of coming
5072480	5074800	out with the same structures to do so.
5074880	5080800	So I suppose, then, is that once you've got things like eyes, then you have a big driving
5080800	5083760	pressure on the central nervous system to figure out what it all means.
5084320	5088160	And we come around to your other point about manipulation, sensory input and so on, about
5090720	5094960	you have a huge requirement to understand what your environment is and what it means
5094960	5098000	and how it reacts and where you should run away and where you should stay put.
5099120	5102960	Actually, on that point, I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman,
5103920	5115040	who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution, to say that there's not necessarily a
5115920	5122160	strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.
5123200	5130080	So objective reality, that our perception actually is very different from what's objectively real.
5130080	5137520	We're living inside an illusion and we're basically the entire set of species on earth,
5137520	5141920	I think, I guess, are competing in a space that's an illusion that's distinct from,
5141920	5146160	that's far away from physical reality as it is defined by physics.
5146160	5148720	I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble.
5148720	5152960	I mean, we have a sensory input, which is a fraction of what we could have a sensory input on,
5154000	5158160	and we interpret it in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive.
5158160	5163600	So yes, it's an illusion in that sense, but the tree is physically there,
5163600	5169760	and if you walk into that tree, it's not purely a delusion of some physical reality to it.
5170320	5177040	So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is, but because it's just a slice,
5177040	5178720	you're missing a big picture.
5178720	5182400	But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily need to be a slice,
5182960	5188320	it could be a complete fabrication that's just consistent amongst the species,
5188320	5194560	which is an interesting, or at least it's a humbling realization that our perception
5195760	5199840	is limited and our cognitive abilities are limited.
5200480	5204880	And at least to me, it's argument from evolution.
5204880	5208720	I don't know how much, how strong that is as an argument,
5209520	5214320	but I do think that life can exist in the mind.
5215920	5216480	Yes.
5216480	5219520	In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game,
5219520	5225760	and you can have a vibrant life inside that place, and that place is not real in some sense,
5225760	5228880	but you can still have a vibrant, all the same forces of evolution,
5228880	5233360	all the same competition, the dynamics of between humans you can have,
5233920	5242800	but I don't know if, I don't know if there's evidence for that being the thing that happened on
5242800	5245040	Earth. It seems that Earth...
5245040	5249360	I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny that you could have exactly the world that you
5249360	5256400	talk about, and it would be very difficult to, you know, the idea in Matrix movies and so on,
5256400	5263920	that the whole world is completely a construction, and we're fundamentally deluded.
5263920	5270000	It's difficult to say that's impossible or couldn't happen, and certainly we construct
5270000	5273840	in our minds what the outside world is, but we do it on input and that input,
5274800	5280240	I would hesitate to say it's not real, because it's precisely how we do understand the world.
5280880	5286000	We have eyes, but if you keep someone, apparently this kind of thing happens,
5286000	5290560	someone kept in a dark room for five years or something like that, and they never see properly
5290560	5298000	again, because the neural wiring that underpins how we interpret vision never developed,
5298720	5303360	you know, you need, when you watch a child develop, it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the
5303360	5310320	table and it hurts, and now you've got two inputs, you've got one pain from this sharp edge, and
5310320	5314240	number two, you've touched it and realized it's there, it's a sharp edge, and you've got the
5314240	5318320	visual input, and you put the three things together and think, I don't want to walk into a table again,
5318320	5324240	so you're learning, and it's a limited reality, but it's a true reality, and if you don't learn
5324240	5327760	that properly, then you will get eaten, you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive,
5328880	5335840	and same if you're in some kind of, let's say, computer construction of reality,
5335840	5342640	I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws that this is what reality is inside this,
5343520	5347440	then you play by those laws. Yeah, well, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent,
5347440	5352480	so just like you said in the lab, the interesting thing about the simulation question,
5352480	5358080	yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation, but also, yes, it's possible to do
5358080	5363040	these kinds of experiments in the lab now, more and more, to me, the interesting question is,
5363760	5369840	how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be for us to not be able to tell the difference?
5370480	5380000	A more interesting question to me is, how realistic or interesting does a virtual reality world need
5380000	5386160	to be in order for us to want to stay there forever, or much longer than physical reality,
5386160	5394080	prefer that place, and also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs, but prefer it in a deep,
5394160	5399920	meaningful way, in a way we enjoy life. I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix,
5399920	5406400	I imagine that it's possible to delude the mind sufficiently that you genuinely,
5406400	5411520	in that way, do think that you are interacting with the real world when, in fact, the whole
5411520	5418640	thing's a simulation. How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that? Well, it needs to
5419360	5426720	convince you that all your sensory input is correct and accurate and joins up and makes sense. Now,
5426720	5431600	that sensory input is not something that we're born with, we're born with a sense of touch,
5431600	5435040	we're born with eyes and so on, but we don't know how to use them, we don't know what to make of them.
5435680	5441840	We go around, we bump into trees, we cry a lot, we're in pain a lot, we're basically
5441840	5447520	booting up the system so that it can make head a tail of the sensory input that it's getting,
5447520	5451280	and that sensory input is not just a one-way flux of things, it's also you have to walk into
5451280	5455920	things, you have to hear things, you have to put it together. Now, if you've got just babies
5456960	5462480	in the matrix who are slotted into this, I don't think they have that kind of sensory input,
5462480	5467840	I don't think they would have any way to make sense of New York as a world that they're part of,
5468400	5472640	the brain is just not developed in that way. Well, I can't make sense of New York in this
5472640	5478000	physical reality either, but yeah, I mean, but you said pain and the walking into things, well,
5478000	5483760	you can create a pain signal, and as long as it's consistent that certain things result in pain,
5483760	5488400	you can start to construct a reality, there are some, maybe, maybe you disagree with this,
5488400	5495200	but I think we are born almost with a desire to be convinced by our reality,
5495760	5500160	like a desire to make sense of our reality. Oh, I'm sure we are, yes.
5500160	5505040	So there's an imperative, so whatever that reality is given to us, like the table hurts,
5505040	5513120	fire is hot, I think we want to be deluded in a sense that we want to make a simple,
5513120	5520800	like Einstein simple theory of the thing around us, we want that simplicity. And so maybe the
5520800	5525760	hunger for the simplicity is the thing that could be used to construct a pretty dumb simulation
5526400	5530640	that tricks us. So maybe tricking humans doesn't require building a universe.
5531440	5535840	No, I don't, I mean, this is not what I work on, so I don't know how close to it we are,
5535840	5541920	but I agree with you that, yeah, I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do,
5541920	5547600	but is it possible in principle? I think it would be very difficult,
5548400	5554800	but I don't see why in principle it wouldn't be possible, and I agree with you that we try to
5554800	5558640	understand the world, we try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have, and we try to come
5558640	5566480	out with a hypothesis that explains what's going on. I think though, that we have huge input from
5567120	5572240	the social context that we're in, we don't do it by ourselves, we don't kind of blunder around in a
5572240	5578080	universe by ourselves and understand the whole thing, we're told by the people around us,
5578080	5581840	what things are and what they do, and you know, languages coming in here and so on. So
5582800	5586480	it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation to simulate all of that.
5588240	5594080	Yeah, simulate all of that, including the social construct, the thing, the spread of ideas and
5594880	5598560	the exchange of ideas, I don't know, but those questions are really important to understand
5598560	5604080	as we become more and more digital creatures. It seems like the next step of evolution is us
5604080	5609920	becoming partial, all the same mechanisms we've talked about are becoming more and more plugged
5610240	5617520	into the machine. We're becoming cyborgs, and there's an interesting interplay between wires
5617520	5626080	and biology, you know, zeros and ones and the biological systems, and I don't think you can just,
5627120	5631360	I don't think we'll have the luxury to see humans as disjoint from the technology we've
5631360	5640480	created for much longer. We are an organism that's... Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, but
5642320	5649280	we come really with this to consciousness and is there a distinction there? Because what you're
5649280	5654160	saying, the natural end point says we are indistinguishable, that if you are capable of building
5654800	5662880	an AI which is sufficiently close and similar, that we merge with it, then to all intents and
5662880	5671680	purposes, that AI is conscious as we know it. And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view.
5674960	5682160	And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book, because 10 years ago, I wrote a chapter
5682720	5688480	in a book called Life Ascending about consciousness, and the subtitle of life ascending was the 10
5688480	5692240	great inventions of evolution, and I couldn't possibly write a book with a subtitle like
5692240	5697920	that that did not include consciousness, and specifically consciousness as one of the great
5697920	5703760	inventions. And it was in part because I was just curious to know more, and I read more for that
5703760	5708320	chapter. I never worked on it, but I've always... How can anyone not be interested in the question?
5709280	5715200	And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows, and B, there are two main
5715920	5722160	schools of thought out there with a big skew in distribution. One of them says,
5722160	5728080	oh, it's a property of matter. It's an unknown law of physics, panpsychism, everything is conscious,
5728080	5732320	the sun is conscious, it's just a matter of... Or a rock is conscious, it's just a matter of
5732320	5738240	how much. And I find that very unpersuasive. I can't say that it's wrong, it's just that
5738880	5743280	I think we somehow can tell the difference between something that's living and something that's not.
5744960	5751200	And then the other end is it's an emergent property of a very complex central nervous system.
5752640	5759200	And I never quite understand what people mean by words like emergence. I mean,
5759280	5767680	there are genuine examples, but I think we very often tend to use it to plaster over ignorance.
5768880	5775760	As a biochemist, the question for me then was, okay, it's a concoction of a central nervous
5775760	5783760	system. A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling, to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of
5783760	5790720	love, or anger, whatever it may be. So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms in the
5790720	5796800	central nervous system? Which bit of the wiring gives rise to... And I've never seen anyone answer
5796800	5802800	that question in a way that makes sense to me. And that's an important question to answer.
5803600	5807360	I think if we want to understand consciousness, that's the only question to answer, because
5808320	5814080	certainly an AI is capable of out thinking and it's only a matter of time. Maybe it's already
5814080	5821200	happened. In terms of just information processing and computational skill, I don't think we have any
5821200	5828480	problem in designing a mind which is at least the equal of the human mind. But in terms of
5828480	5833440	what we value the most as humans, which is to say our feelings, our emotions, our
5834320	5842880	sense of what the world is in a very personal way, that's, I think, means as much or more to
5842880	5848800	people than their information processing. And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will
5848800	5854400	become conscious, because I think it's the property of life. Well, let's talk about it more. You're
5854400	5860320	an incredible writer. One of my favorite writers. So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,
5860400	5866480	What You Write About Consciousness. I think therefore I am, said Descartes, is one of the
5866480	5873360	most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I exactly? And artificial intelligence can think
5873360	5880720	too, by definition, and therefore is. Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle
5880720	5888480	of anything resembling human emotions of love or hate, fear and joy of spiritual yearnings
5888480	5896400	for oneness or oblivion or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don't know
5896400	5902240	what emotions are, as you were saying. What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a
5902240	5907200	discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all? This is the hard problem of
5907200	5914080	consciousness, the seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self.
5914080	5918640	We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system
5918640	5924000	could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence. But we can't answer in principle
5924000	5930160	whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy. What is the quantum
5930160	5941840	of solace? Speaking to the question of emergence, you know, there's just technical, there's an
5941840	5949920	excellent paper on this recently about the kind of phase transition emergence of performance in
5949920	5956560	neural networks on the problem of NLP, natural language processing. So language models, there
5956560	5964720	seems to be this question of size. At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size
5964720	5970640	of the neural network. So the question is sort of somewhat of a technical question that you can
5970640	5976320	philosophize over. The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to
5976320	5982160	be able to form the kind of representations that can capture a language and therefore be able to,
5983680	5988480	not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of
5988480	5995280	problems in language, like be able to have a conversation. And there seems to be not a gradual
5995360	6001120	increase, but a phase transition. And they're trying to construct the science of where that is,
6001120	6005840	like what is the good size of a neural network? And why does such a phase transition happen?
6005840	6015520	Anyway, that sort of points to emergence that there could be stages where a thing goes from being,
6016400	6025680	you're a very intelligent toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away and looks out
6027200	6032080	the window, sighing, having an existential crisis. I was thinking of Marvin, the paranoid
6032080	6041520	android. Well, no, Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky. So easily programmed.
6041840	6047680	Easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis. You're almost basically, what is it, notes from
6047680	6055360	underground, but just constantly complaining about life. No, they're capturing the full
6056240	6060800	roller coaster of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss, the connection,
6062240	6069040	the empathy and all that kind of stuff. And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression,
6069040	6074320	all that kind of stuff. They're capturing all of that and be able to experience it deeply.
6074320	6079200	Like it's the most important thing you could possibly experience today. The highest highs,
6079200	6086640	the lowest lows, this is it. My life will be over. I cannot possibly go on that feeling,
6086640	6093680	and then like after a nap, you're feeling amazing. That might be something that emerges.
6093680	6098240	So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?
6102560	6105120	First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?
6105120	6110080	But we do know that that's actually true for many people much of the time. Maybe I'd be depressed
6110080	6115120	if you have an app and you do, in fact, feel better. Oh, you are actually asking the technical
6115120	6121680	question there. So there's a biological answer to that. And so the question is whether AI needs
6121680	6127280	to have the same kind of attachments to its body, bodily function, preservation
6128560	6136080	of the brain's successful function, self-preservation essentially, in some deep biological sense.
6137040	6141600	I mean, to my mind, it comes back around to the problem we were talking about before,
6141600	6147360	about simulations and sensory input and learning what all of this stuff means.
6148320	6155760	And life and death, that biology, unlike society, has a death penalty over everything.
6156320	6163280	And natural selection works on that death penalty, that if you make this decision wrongly,
6164080	6172880	you die. And the next generation is represented by beings that made a slightly different decision
6173600	6178400	on balance. And that is something that's intrinsically
6181040	6186960	difficult to simulate in all its richness, I would say. So what is...
6189120	6198160	Death in all its richness, our relationship with death, or the whole of it. So when you say
6198160	6205520	richness, of course, there's a lot in that, which is hard to simulate. What's part of the
6205520	6211920	richness that's hard to simulate? I suppose the complexity of the environment and your position
6212960	6218000	position of an organism in that environment, in the full richness of that environment over its
6218000	6224160	entire life, over multiple generations, with changes in gene sequence over those generations,
6224160	6228240	so slight changes in the makeup of those individuals over generations.
6228240	6237280	But if you take it back to the level of single cells, which I do in the book, and ask how does a
6237280	6244000	single cell, in effect, know it exists as an unit, as an entity? I mean, no, in inverted commas,
6244000	6250080	obviously, it doesn't know anything. But it acts as a unit, and it acts with astonishing
6250800	6258720	precision as a unit. And I had suggested that that's linked to the electrical fields on the
6258720	6263760	membranes themselves, and that they give some indication of how am I doing in relation to my
6263760	6270800	environment as a kind of real-time feedback on the world. And this is something physical,
6272000	6277200	which can be selected over generations, that if you get this wrong,
6278160	6286560	it's linked with this set of circumstances that I've just, as an individual, I have a moment
6286560	6293440	of blind panic and run. As a bacterium or something, you have some electrical discharge that says
6293440	6299040	blind panic, and it runs, whatever it may be. And you associate over generations, multiple
6299040	6307040	generations, that this electrical phase that I'm in now is associated with a response like that.
6307360	6313760	And it's easy to see how feelings come in through the back door, almost, with that kind of
6316720	6322000	giving real-time feedback on your position in the world in relation to how am I doing.
6322000	6327680	And then you complexify the system, and yes, I have no problem with a phase transition.
6327840	6340560	And can all of this be done purely by the language, by the issues with how the system
6340560	6347680	understands itself? Maybe it can, I honestly don't know. But the philosophers for a long time have
6347680	6354880	talked about the possibility that you can have a zombie intelligence, and that there are no
6354880	6361280	feelings there, but everything else is the same. I mean, I have to throw this back to you, really.
6361280	6366880	How do you deal with a zombie intelligence? So, first of all, I can see that from a biologist
6366880	6373760	perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being, the entirety of
6373760	6379280	the history of four billion years, that in some deep sense, integrated the human being into this
6379280	6386800	environment, and that dance of the organism and the environment, you could see how emotions arise
6386800	6392720	from that, and then emotions are deeply connected and creating a human experience, and from that,
6392720	6400320	you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it, yeah. But from a perspective of an intelligent
6400320	6408160	organism that's already here, like a baby that learns, it doesn't need to learn how to be a
6408160	6414240	collection of cells or how to do all the things he needs to do. The basic function of a baby,
6414240	6419520	as it learns, is to interact with this environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit
6419520	6427040	in to this social society. And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.
6427040	6434880	To cry, well, to convince the humans to protect it, or to discipline it, to teach it, whatever.
6434880	6442000	I mean, we've developed a bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us,
6442000	6447840	to educate us, to teach us about the world. Also, we've constructed the world in such a way
6447840	6452400	that it's safe enough for us to survive in, and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable
6452400	6457280	lessons, like the tables are still hard with corners, so it can still run into them. It hurts
6457280	6464160	like hell. So AI needs to solve that problem, not the problem of constructing this super complex
6464160	6474000	organism that leads up to run the whole, to make an apple pie, to build the whole universe,
6474000	6480080	you need to build the whole universe. I think the zombie question is something
6481680	6491120	I would leave to the philosophers, because, and I will also leave to them the definition of love
6491120	6497920	and what happens between two human beings when there's a magic that just grabs them,
6498480	6502880	like nothing else matters in the world, and somehow you've been searching for this feeling,
6502880	6509440	this moment, this person, your whole life. That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun
6509440	6514960	with that one, and also say that that's just, you can have a biological explanation, you can have
6514960	6521120	all kinds of, it's all fake, it's actually, I'm Rand, we'll say it's all selfish, there's a lot
6521120	6524720	of different interpretations, I'll leave it to the philosophers. The point is the feeling,
6525760	6534320	sure as hell feels very real, and if my toaster makes me feel like it's the only toaster in the
6534320	6541360	world, and when I leave and I miss the toaster, and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster,
6541360	6547680	and my life is meaningful, and joyful, and the friends I have around me get a better version
6547680	6553280	of me, because that toaster exists. That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster.
6553280	6555280	Is that psychologically different to having a dog?
6556000	6556400	No, no.
6556400	6561200	Because, I mean, most people would dispute whether we can say a dog, I would say a dog is
6561200	6564400	undoubtedly conscious, but some people would say it doesn't.
6564400	6568800	But there's degrees of consciousness and so on, but people are definitely much more uncomfortable
6568800	6574960	saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog, and there's still a deep connection,
6574960	6580000	and you could say our relationship with the dog has more to do with anthropomorphism,
6580000	6582320	like we kind of project the human being onto it.
6582320	6582880	Maybe.
6582880	6585760	We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.
6585760	6591840	Yes, but you can look into the dog's eyes and you can see that it's sad that it's delighted
6591840	6594720	to see you again. I don't have a dog, by the way, I don't know, it's not that I'm a dog.
6594960	6598800	Dogs are actually incredibly good at using their eyes to do just that.
6599440	6604880	They are. Now, I don't imagine that a dog is remotely as close to being intelligent as an AI
6605840	6611920	intelligence, but it's certainly capable of communicating emotionally with us.
6611920	6616480	But here's what I would venture to say, we tend to think because AI plays chess well,
6617120	6620960	and is able to fold proteins now well, that it's intelligent.
6620960	6625760	I would argue that in order to communicate with humans, in order to have emotional intelligence,
6625760	6628880	it actually requires another order of magnitude of intelligence.
6628880	6632320	It's not easy to be flawed.
6634400	6641920	Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same as the full complexity of human-to-human interaction.
6641920	6648320	That's actually, we humans just take for granted the things we're really good at.
6649120	6652000	Non-stop people tell me how shitty people are at driving.
6652720	6655680	No, humans are incredible at driving.
6656480	6661360	Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation, we're incredible at this.
6662640	6667200	People tend to discount the things we all just take for granted.
6667200	6673680	And one of those things that they discount is our ability, the dance of conversation and
6673680	6678320	interaction with each other, the ability to morph ideas together,
6678320	6681840	the ability to get angry at each other, and then to miss each other,
6681840	6687600	like to create attention that makes life fun and difficult and challenging in a way that's
6687600	6693440	meaningful. That is a skill that's learned, and AI would need to solve that problem.
6693440	6699920	I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is AI cannot become meaningfully
6700160	6706960	emotional, let's say, until it experiences some kind of internal conflict that is unable to reconcile
6706960	6714000	these various aspects of reality or its reality with a decision to make.
6714640	6719440	And then it feels sad necessarily because it doesn't know what to do.
6720560	6723600	I certainly can't dispute that. That may very well be how it works.
6723600	6725760	I think the only way to find out is to do it.
6726080	6730000	To build it, yeah, and leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.
6731200	6735360	The point is, the robot will be sitting there alone having an internal conflict,
6735360	6739280	an existential crisis, and that's required for it to have a deep,
6739280	6743920	meaningful connection with another human being. Now, does it actually feel that? I don't know.
6743920	6748960	But I'd like to throw something else at you, which troubles me on reading it.
6749520	6756240	Noah Harar is book 21, Lessons for the 21st Century, and he's written about this kind of
6756240	6760560	thing on various occasions. And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.
6761520	6767200	And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm and do it better than humans.
6767200	6771520	So there will be AI better at writing music that we appreciate, the Mozart ever called,
6771520	6776400	or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on. Because biochemistry is a algorithmic,
6776400	6779520	and all you need to do is figure out which bits of the algorithm to play
6779520	6786160	to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things. And as a biochemist, I find that argument
6789600	6795280	close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable. I don't like the sound of it. That's just my
6795280	6800080	reaction as a human being. You might like the sound of it because that says that AI is capable of the
6800160	6806960	same kind of emotional feelings about the world as we are, because the whole thing is an algorithm
6806960	6812880	and you can program an algorithm. And there you are. He then has a peculiar final chapter
6813440	6819280	where he talks about consciousness in rather separate terms. And he's talking about meditating
6819280	6822880	and so on and getting in touch with his inner consciousness. I don't meditate. I don't know
6822880	6829920	anything about that. But he wrote in very different terms about it, as if somehow it's a way out of
6829920	6837840	the algorithm. Now, it seems to me that consciousness, in that sense, is capable of scuppering the
6837840	6843360	algorithm. I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops and so on, it is undoubtedly
6843360	6849200	algorithmic. But in terms of what we decide to do, it can be much more
6849680	6860080	based on an emotion. We can just think, I don't care. I can't resolve this complex situation.
6860080	6865040	I'm going to do that. And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency, which is the
6865040	6869840	currency of feelings and something where we don't have very much personal control over.
6869840	6876240	And then it comes back around to you. And what are you trying to get at with AI? Do we need to
6876240	6882880	have some system which is capable of overriding a rational decision which cannot be made because
6882880	6888400	there's too much conflicting information by effectively an emotional, judgmental decision
6888400	6892800	that just says, do this and see what happens? That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.
6893360	6898080	Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a higher level process.
6898960	6906800	I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.
6907360	6914800	There's a lot of things that, the moment you say it, it's irrefutable,
6914800	6921680	but it simplifies and in the process loses something fundamental. So for example,
6922400	6929840	calling a universe and an information processing system, sure, yes. You can make that. It's a
6929840	6941040	computer that's performing computations, but you're missing the process of the entropy somehow
6941040	6947360	leading to pockets of complexity that creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex
6947360	6951920	and they're like machines. And then those machines are through the process of evolution
6951920	6957280	are constructing even further complexity. Like in calling the universe information
6958080	6963920	processing machine, you're, you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult
6963920	6968960	is to create them. So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult
6968960	6976160	is it to create a software system that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect.
6976240	6983040	I think we're, that is going to take so long. I can't, I mean, that's going to be centuries from
6983040	6988880	now to be able to reconstruct the human. Now what I would venture to say, to get some of the magic
6988880	6994560	of a human being with what we're saying with the emotions and the interactions and like,
6994560	6999520	like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things that will come much sooner,
6999520	7004160	but that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm of biochemistry.
7004160	7010480	Yes, but the toaster is making you happy. Yes. It's not about whether you make the toaster happy.
7011760	7017920	No, it has to be. It has to be. It has to be. The toaster has to be able to leave me.
7017920	7020480	Yes, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case is very intelligent.
7020480	7025680	Yeah, the toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me. That's essential.
7026320	7031360	Yeah. That's essential for my being able to miss the toaster. If the toaster is just my servant,
7032240	7039760	that's not or a provider of like services like tells me the weather makes toast.
7040400	7045840	That's not going to deep connection. It has to have internal conflict. You write about life
7045840	7052960	and death. It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality and the finiteness of its existence.
7053680	7057920	And that life is for its temporary and therefore needs to be more selective.
7058000	7063840	One of the most moving moments in the movies from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in
7063840	7074160	2001, where that was the death of a sentient being and Hal knew it. So I think we all kind of know
7075280	7082720	that a sufficiently intelligent being is going to have some form of consciousness,
7082720	7087840	but whether it would be like biological consciousness, I just don't know. And if you're
7087840	7091760	thinking about how do we bring together, I mean, obviously we're going to interact
7093520	7103680	more closely with AI, but are we really is a dog really like a toaster? Or is there really some
7103680	7110880	kind of difference there? You're talking about biochemistry is algorithmic, but it's not single
7110880	7115200	algorithm and it's very complex, of course it is. So it may be that there's that there are again
7115200	7121040	conflicts in the circuits of biochemistry, but I have a feeling that the level of complexity of
7121600	7126560	the total biochemical system at the level of a single cell is less complex than the level of
7126560	7135280	neural networking in the human brain or in an AI. Well, I guess I assumed that we were including
7135280	7141120	the brain in the biochemistry algorithm, because you have to- I would see that as a higher level
7141120	7145760	of organization of neural networks, they're all using the same biochemical wiring within themselves.
7146320	7153120	Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons, it's the immune system, it's the whole package.
7153920	7160240	I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm that runs an intelligent biological system, you have to
7160240	7165120	include the whole damn thing. And it's pretty fascinating that it comes from an embryo.
7168960	7176240	I mean, if you can, what is a human being? Because it's just some code and then you build.
7176240	7180640	And then that DNA doesn't just tell you what to build, but how to build it.
7182960	7185520	I mean, the thing is impressive. And the question is how
7186320	7191280	difficult is it to reverse engineer the whole shebang?
7192880	7193600	Very difficult.
7194480	7195440	I would say it's-
7199600	7206480	Don't want to say impossible, but it's much easier to build a human than to reverse engineer,
7207920	7214080	to build a fake human, human-like thing, than to reverse engineer the entirety of the process of
7214080	7220080	the evolution of her. I'm not sure if we are capable of reverse engineering the whole thing.
7221600	7226480	If the human mind is capable of doing that. I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I wasn't trying.
7228000	7232000	But I know I can't understand the whole problem. I'm just trying to understand
7232000	7237200	the rudimentary outlines of the problem. There's another aspect though,
7237200	7241600	you're talking about developing from a single cell to the human mind and all the
7242480	7246240	part system subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.
7248960	7255520	This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine, with Michael Levin. But
7258400	7263440	so little is known about- you talk about reverse engineers. So little is known about
7263440	7268480	the developmental pathways that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.
7269440	7274800	And a lot of it seems to depend on the same electrical interactions
7274800	7278400	that I was talking about happening at the level of single cells and its interaction
7278400	7282720	with the environment. There's a whole electrical field side to biology
7283440	7289520	that is not yet written into any of the textbooks, which is about how does an embryo develop into
7289520	7294160	or a single cell develop into these complex systems? What defines the head? What defines
7294160	7298720	the immune system? What defines the brain and so on? That really is written in a language that
7298720	7303840	we're only just beginning to understand and frankly biologists, most biologists, are still very reluctant
7303840	7311600	to even get themselves tangled up in questions like electrical fields influencing development.
7311600	7316320	It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists and it should not be because this is the 21st
7316320	7322000	century biology. This is where it's going. But we're not going to reverse engineer a human being,
7322000	7326960	or the mind, or any of these subsystems until we understand how this developmental process is,
7326960	7333840	how electricity and biology really works. And if it is linked with feelings and with
7333840	7339600	consciousness and so on, that's the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try. But I think
7339600	7347840	that's where the answer lies. So you think it's possible that the key to things like consciousness
7348480	7354000	are some of the more tricky aspects of cognition might lie in that early development,
7354560	7360240	the interaction of electricity and biology, electrical fields.
7360240	7364640	But we already know the EEG and so on is telling us a lot about brain function,
7364640	7368880	but we don't know which cells, which parts of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG. We
7368880	7374320	don't know the basics. The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks, we know it's multiple
7374320	7379600	cells, hundreds or thousands of cells involved in it. And we assume that it's to do with depolarization
7380560	7385840	during action potentials and so on. But the mitochondria which are in there have much
7385840	7389840	more membranes than the plasma membrane of the neuron. And there's a much greater membrane
7389840	7395120	potential. And it's formed in parallel, very often parallel Christi, which are capable of
7396160	7402800	reinforcing a field and generating fields over longer distances. And nobody knows if that plays
7402800	7407920	a role in consciousness or not. There's reasons to argue that it could, but frankly, we simply do
7407920	7413920	not know. And it's not taken into consideration. You look at the structure of the mitochondrial
7413920	7421600	membranes in the brains of simple things like josophila, the fruit fly, and they have amazing
7421600	7428000	structures. You can see lots of little rectangular things all lined up in amazing patterns.
7428000	7431040	What are they doing? Why are they like that? We haven't the first clue.
7432000	7438800	What do you think about organoids and brain organoids? So in a lab, trying to study the
7438800	7446960	development of these in the Petru dish development of organs, do you think that's promising? Do you
7446960	7451360	have to look at the whole systems? I've never done anything like that. I don't know much about it.
7451360	7456720	The people who I've talked to who do work on it say amazing things can happen. And a bit of a
7456720	7462560	brain drone in a dish is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings or even memories of its
7462560	7469120	former brain. Again, I have a feeling that until we understand how to control the electrical
7469120	7474240	fields that control development, we're not going to understand how to turn an organoid into a real
7474240	7482400	functional system. But how do we get that understanding? It's so incredibly difficult. I mean, you would
7483360	7487280	I mean, one promising direction. I'd love to get your opinion on this. I don't know if you're
7487280	7492640	familiar with the work of Deep Mind and Alpha Fold with protein folding and so on. Do you think
7492640	7499760	it's possible that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology, trying to basically
7499760	7508560	simulate and model the behavior of trivial biological systems as they become complex
7508560	7515680	biological systems? I'm sure it will. The interesting thing to me about protein folding
7516400	7521680	is that for a long time, my understanding is not what I work on. So I may have got this wrong. But
7521680	7529200	my understanding is that you take the sequence of a protein and you try to fold it. And there are
7529200	7533840	multiple ways in which you can fold and to come up with the correct confirmation is not a very
7533840	7538160	easy thing because you're doing it from first principles from a string of letters, which specify
7538160	7545040	the string of amino acids. But what actually happens is when a protein is coming out of a ribosome,
7545680	7550080	it's coming out of a charged tunnel and it's in a very specific environment, which is going to
7550080	7553600	force this to go there now and then this one to go there and this one to come like that. And so
7553600	7558320	you're forcing a specific conformational set of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.
7558320	7563120	So by the time it's fully emerged, it's already got its shape and that shape depended on
7563120	7571120	the immediate environment that it was emerging into one letter, one amino acid at a time.
7571840	7578720	And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way. And if that's correct,
7578720	7582720	then that's very characteristic of science, which is to say it asks very often the wrong
7582720	7586800	question and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses on something having never
7586800	7590880	thought to actually think, well, what is biology doing? And biology is giving you a charged
7590880	7597200	electrical environment that forces you to be this way. Now, did deep mind come up through
7597200	7602560	patterns with some answer that was like that? I've got absolutely no idea. It ought to be
7602560	7607920	possible to deduce that from the shapes of proteins. It would require much greater
7610400	7615040	skill than the human mind has. But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on,
7615040	7618880	let's look at this exit tunnel and try and work out what shape is this protein going to take.
7619120	7623120	We can figure that out. That's really interesting about the exit tunnel. But sometimes we get lucky
7623120	7631760	and just like in science, the simplified view or the static view will actually solve the problem
7631760	7637280	for us. So in this case, it's very possible that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping to
7637280	7643680	our structure without considering how it unraveled, so without considering the tunnel.
7643760	7649680	And so that seems to be the case in this situation where the cool thing about proteins,
7649680	7652560	all the different shapes they can possibly take, it actually seems to take
7653360	7658560	very specific unique shapes given the sequence. That's forced on you by an exit tunnel. So the
7658560	7664320	problem is actually much simpler than you thought. And then there's a whole army of proteins that
7665440	7671760	which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins. And they're only used when
7672720	7676960	there's some presumably issue with how it came out of the exit tunnel and you want to do it
7676960	7681760	differently to that. So very often the chaperone proteins will go there and will influence the
7681760	7689280	way in which it falls. So there's two ways of doing it. Either you can look at the structures and
7689280	7693680	the sequences of all the proteins and you can apply an immense mind to it and figure out what
7693680	7697840	the patterns are and figure out what how or you can look at the actual situation where it is and
7697840	7701520	say, well, hang on, it was actually quite simple. It's got a charged environment and then you fall
7701520	7705360	it's forced to come out this way. And then the question will be, well, do different ribosomes
7705360	7709520	have different charged environments for what happens if a chaperone, you're asking a different
7709520	7714160	set of questions to come to the same answer in a way which is telling you a much simpler story
7714160	7719920	and explains why it is rather than saying it could be, this is one in a billion different
7719920	7723360	possible conformational states that this protein could have. You're saying, well, it has this one
7723360	7730560	because that was the only one it could take given its setting. Well, yeah, I mean, currently humans
7730560	7735440	are very good at that kind of first principles thinking of stepping back. But I think AI is
7735440	7741440	really good at, you know, collect a huge amount of data and a huge amount of data of observation of
7741440	7746080	planets and figure out that Earth is not at the center of the universe that there's actually a
7746080	7751760	sun were orbiting the sun. But then you can as a human being ask, well, how did how do solar
7751760	7758800	systems come to be? How do what are the different forces that are required to make this kind of
7758800	7763760	pattern emerge? And then you start to invent things like gravity, what I mean, obviously,
7766560	7772720	I mixed up the ordering of gravity wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets, but
7774320	7779680	we are able to think about those big picture things as human beings. AI is just very good to
7779680	7788000	infer simple models from a huge amount of data. And the question is with biology, you know, we
7788000	7793840	kind of go back and forth to how we solve biology. Listen, protein folding was thought to be
7793840	7799360	impossible to solve. And there's a lot of brilliant PhD students that worked one protein at a time
7799360	7805440	trying to figure out the structure. And the fact that I was able to do that. Oh, I'm not knocking
7805440	7811920	it at all. But I think that people have been asking the wrong question. But then as the people
7812000	7820240	start to ask better and bigger questions, the AI kind of enters the chat and says,
7820880	7824480	I'll help you out with that. Can I give you another example of my own work?
7827840	7835280	The risk of getting a disease as we get older. There are genetic aspects to it. You know, if
7835280	7840720	you spend your whole life overeating and smoking and whatever, that's a whole separate question.
7841440	7846640	But there's a genetic side to the risk. And we know a few genes that increase your risk of
7846640	7851920	certain things. And for probably 20 years now, people have been doing what's called GWAS, which is
7852640	7859280	genome-wide association studies. So you've effectively scanned the entire genome for any
7860240	7864800	single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is to say a single letter change in one place
7864800	7869520	that has a higher association of being linked with a particular disease or not. And you can
7869520	7876800	come out with thousands of these things across the genome. And if you add them all up and try and
7876800	7884400	say, well, so do they add up to explain the known genetic risk of this disease? And the known genetic
7884400	7891280	risk often comes from twin studies. And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy, there's a 40
7891280	7896800	or 50% risk that the other twin, identical twin, will also get epilepsy. Therefore, the genetic
7896800	7905280	factor is about 50%. And so the gene similarities that you see should account for 50% of that known
7905280	7912160	risk. Very often it accounts for less than a tenth of the known risk. And there's two possible
7912160	7916480	explanations. And there's one which people tend to do, which is to say, ah, well, we don't have
7916480	7921360	enough statistical power. If we maybe there's maybe there's a million, we've only found a thousand of
7921360	7925040	them. But if we find the other million, they're weakly related, but there's a huge number of them.
7925040	7929120	And so we'll, we'll, we'll account for that whole risk. Maybe there's, you know, maybe there's a
7929120	7935840	billion of them. So, so that's one way. The other way is to say, well, hang on a minute, you're
7935840	7940640	missing a system here. That system is the mitochondrial DNA, which people tend to dismiss
7940640	7949200	because it's small and it's not, it doesn't change very much. But a few single letter changes in
7949200	7954240	that mitochondrial DNA, it, it controls some really basic processes. It controls
7954880	7959600	not only all the energy that we need to live and to move around and do everything we do,
7959600	7967280	but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks to, you know, to, to, to make new cells
7967280	7973280	and cancer cells very often kind of take over the mitochondria and rewire them so that instead of
7973280	7977200	using them for making energy, they're effectively using them as precursors for the building blocks
7977200	7981920	with biosynthesis. You need to make new amino acids, new nucleotides for DNA. You want to make
7981920	7987840	new lipids to make your membranes and so on. So they kind of rewire metabolism. Now the problem is
7988720	7992640	that we've got all these interactions between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus
7993280	7998160	that are overlooked completely because people throw away, literally throw away the mitochondrial
7998160	8003360	genes. And we can see in fruit flies that they interact and produce big differences in risk.
8004320	8013920	So you can set, you can set AI onto this question of exactly what, you know, how many of these
8013920	8018960	base changes there are. And this is one possible solution that maybe there are a million of them,
8018960	8022480	and it does account for the greatest part of the risk. Or the other one is they aren't,
8022480	8026960	that it's just not there. That actually the risk lies in something you weren't even looking at.
8026960	8032160	And this is where human intuition is very important. And just this feeling that, well,
8032320	8036560	I'm working on this and I think it's important and I'm bloody minded about it. And in the end,
8036560	8041920	some people are right. It turns out that it was important. Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody
8041920	8049680	minded? And that hang on a minute, you might be missing a whole other system here that's much
8049680	8060160	bigger. That's the moment of discovery of scientific revolution. I'm giving up on saying AI
8060160	8066240	can't do something. I've said enough times about enough things. I think there's been a lot of
8066240	8072960	progress. And instead, I'm excited by the possibility of AI helping humans. But at the same time,
8072960	8081440	just like I said, we seem to dismiss the power of humans. Like we're so limited in so many ways
8081520	8092400	that we kind of, in what we feel like dumb ways, like we're not strong, where we're kind of,
8094400	8099440	our attention, our memory is limited, our ability to focus on things is limited
8100240	8105360	in our own perception of what limited is. But that actually, there's an incredible computer
8105360	8110960	behind the whole thing that makes this whole system work, our ability to interact with the
8110960	8116640	environment, to reason about the environment. There's magic there. And I am hopeful that AI
8116640	8121760	can capture some of that same magic. But that magic is not going to look like deep blue playing
8121760	8126400	chess. It's going to be more interesting. But I don't think it's going to look like
8126400	8130240	pattern finding either. I mean, that's essentially what you're telling me. It does very well at
8130240	8135520	the moment. And my point is, it works very well where you're looking for the right pattern.
8136000	8141840	But we are storytelling animals. And the hypothesis is a story. It's a testable story.
8143040	8149040	But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown and it's a new story, basically. And it says,
8149680	8154160	this leads to this leads to that. It's a causal set of storytelling.
8154880	8158560	It's also possible that the leap into the unknown has a pattern of its own.
8158560	8161760	Yes, it is. And it's possible that it's learnable.
8162400	8171760	I'm sure it is. There's a nice book by Arthur Kersler on the nature of creativity. And he
8171760	8175760	likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off in a completely unexpected direction and says
8175760	8181680	that this is the basis of human creativity, that some creative switch of direction to an
8181680	8187600	unexpected place is similar to a joke. I'm not saying that's how it works, but it's a nice idea
8187600	8194080	and there must be some truth in it. And it's one of these, most of the stories we tell are probably
8194080	8198560	the wrong story and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful. And we definitely don't
8198560	8205360	do as well at seeing patterns in things. But some of the most enjoyable human aspects is finding a
8205360	8210800	new story that goes to an unexpected place. And these are all aspects of what being human means
8210800	8216480	to me. And maybe these are all things that AI figures out for itself, or maybe they're just
8216480	8223360	aspects of it. But I just have the feeling sometimes that the people who are trying to
8224160	8232000	understand what we are like, if we wish to craft an AI system, which is somehow human-like,
8232640	8240240	that we don't have a firm enough grasp of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.
8241200	8247840	But we get a better, better understanding of that. I agree with you completely. We try to build a thing
8247840	8254560	and then we go, hang on in a minute. There's another system here and that's actually the attempt to build
8254560	8260480	AI that's human-like, is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings. The funny thing
8260480	8264800	that I recently talked to Magnus Carlson, widely considered to be the greatest chess player of all
8264800	8270800	time, and he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.
8271440	8279280	And he had a funny comment. He has a kind of dry sense of humor, but he was extremely impressed
8279280	8285600	when he first saw AlphaZero play. And he said that it did a lot of things that could easily be
8285600	8293600	mistaken for creativity. So he, as a typical human, refused to give the system
8294880	8299440	sort of its due, because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people
8300640	8307440	are extremely impressed by, not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play. So one
8307520	8316320	of the things that it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces. So in chess, that
8316320	8323200	means you basically take a few steps back and it takes a step forward. You give away pieces
8323200	8331760	for some future reward. And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess. You take big risks,
8332480	8341680	that for us humans, those risks are especially painful because you have a fog of uncertainty
8341680	8346720	before you. So to take a risk now, based on intuition, if I think this is the right risk to
8346720	8352400	take, but there's so many possibilities that that's where it takes guts. That's where art is,
8352400	8359760	that's that danger. And then AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks
8360320	8364880	and does them even greater degree. But of course, it does it from a,
8366640	8374720	well, you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns. But
8375680	8380480	boy, when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see in
8380480	8387120	creativity. We see creative play on the chessboard. But the chessboard is very limited. And the
8387120	8393360	question is, as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics,
8394080	8402000	in programming, and then venturing biology, psychology, and expand into more and more
8402000	8409040	complex systems? I was, I used to go running when I was a boy and fell running, which is to say
8409040	8414000	running up and down mountains. And I was never particularly great at it. But there were some
8414000	8421040	people who were amazingly fast, especially at running down. And I realized in trying to do this,
8421040	8426480	that there's, there's only really two, two ways, there's three possible ways of doing it. And
8426480	8431600	there's only two that work, either you go extremely slowly and carefully. And you figure out, okay,
8431600	8436320	there's a stone, I'll put my foot on this stone. And then there's another, there's a muddy puddle
8436320	8440960	and we're void. And, you know, it's slow, it's laborious, you figure it out step by step.
8441920	8446400	Or you can just go incredibly fast. And you don't think about it at all. The entire conscious mind
8446400	8450480	is shut out of it. And it's probably the same, playing table tennis or something. There's something
8450480	8454640	in the mind, which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations about exactly that.
8454640	8459280	And it's amazing, you can run that astonishing speed down a hillside with no idea how you did it at
8459280	8463280	all. And then you panic, when you think, I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this,
8463280	8466800	I've got to think about where I'm going to put my foot. So you slow down a bit and try to bring
8466880	8472400	those conscious mind in. And then you do, you crash, you can't, you cannot think consciously
8472400	8479680	while running downhill. So it's amazing. It's amazing how many calculations the mind is able
8479680	8484720	to make. And now the problem with playing chess or something, if you're able to make all of those
8484720	8491200	subconscious kind of forward calculations about what is the likely outcome of this move now,
8492160	8496480	in the way that we can by running down a hillside or something, you know, it's partly about what
8496480	8501040	we have adapted to do. It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in running fast
8501040	8506400	downhill is something that we'd better be bloody good at otherwise we're going to be eaten. Whereas
8507680	8513360	trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves into the future is not something we've ever been called
8513360	8518320	on to do. Two or three, four moves into the future is quite enough for most of us most of the time.
8519040	8529280	Yeah. Yeah. So the, yeah, just solving chess may not, we may not be as far towards solving the
8529280	8538560	problem of downhill running as we might think just because we solve chess. Still, it's beautiful to
8538560	8547920	see creativity. Humans create machines that are able to create art and art on the chess board and
8548000	8555760	art otherwise. Who knows how far that takes us. So I mentioned Andre Carpathia earlier. Him and I
8555760	8561280	are big fans of yours. If you're taking votes, his suggestion was you should write your next book on
8561280	8570320	the Fermi Paradox. So let me ask you on the topic of alien life. Since we've been talking about life
8570320	8575680	and we're a kind of aliens. How many alien civilizations are out there? Do you think?
8578080	8584480	Well, the universe is very big. So some, but not as many as most people would like to think is my
8584480	8594560	view because the idea that there is a trajectory going from simple cellular life like bacteria
8594560	8600480	all the way through to humans. It seems to me there's some big gaps along that way that the
8600480	8606320	eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is
8606320	8613200	another. Another interesting gap is a long gap from the origin of the eukaryotic cell to the
8613200	8620480	first animals. That was about a billion years, maybe more than that. A long delay in where
8620480	8624720	no oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. So from the first appearance of oxygen in the
8624720	8630080	Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals to respire, it was close to two billion years.
8630960	8637040	Why so long? It seems to be planetary factors. It seems to be geology as much as anything else.
8637040	8643280	And we don't really know what was going on. So the idea that there's a kind of an inevitable
8644160	8653120	march towards complexity and sentient life, I don't think is right. It doesn't, not to say,
8653120	8656880	it's not going to happen, but I think it's not going to happen often.
8657520	8662560	So if you think of earth, given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,
8665200	8670240	do you have a sense that life, complex life, intelligent life happen really quickly on earth
8670240	8677440	or really long? So just to get a sense of, are you more sort of saying that it's very
8677440	8684240	unlikely to get the kind of conditions required to create humans? Or is it even if you have the
8684320	8689440	condition it's just statistically difficult? I think the, I mean, the problem, the single
8689440	8693200	great problem at the center of all of that to my mind is the origin of the eukaryotic cell,
8693200	8697520	which happened once and without eukaryotes, nothing else would have happened. And that is
8697520	8702400	something that- That's because you're saying it's super important, the eukaryotes, but-
8702400	8707040	I'm saying tantamount to saying that it is impossible to build something as complex as
8707040	8712240	a human being from bacterial cells. Totally agree and some deep fundamental way. But it's just
8712240	8716880	like a one cell going inside another. Is that so difficult to get to work right?
8718320	8725680	Well, again, it happened once. And if you think about, if you think about, I mean,
8725680	8730400	I'm in a minority view in this position, most biologists probably wouldn't agree with me anyway.
8730400	8735600	But if you think about the starting point, we've got a simple cell. It's an archaeal cell,
8735600	8740000	we can be fairly sure about that. So it looks a lot like a bacterium, but it's in fact from this
8740000	8746080	other domain of life. So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell. That means it doesn't have anything.
8746080	8751440	It doesn't have a nucleus. It doesn't really have complex endomembrane. It has a little bit of stuff,
8751440	8760480	but not that much. And it takes up an endosymbiont. So what happens next? And the answer is basically
8760480	8768560	everything to do with complexity. To me, there's a beautiful paradox here. Plants and animals and
8768560	8776720	fungi all have exactly the same type of cell. But they all have really different ways of living.
8776720	8784720	So a plant cell is photosynthetic. They started out as algae in the oceans and so on. So think of
8784720	8793280	algal blooms, single cell things. The basic cell structure that it's built from is exactly the same
8793280	8797280	with a couple of small differences. It's got chloroplasts as well. It's got a vacuole. It's
8797360	8801280	got a cell wall. But that's about it. Pretty much everything else is exactly the same in a plant
8801280	8807920	cell and an animal cell. And yet the ways of life are completely different. So this cell structure
8807920	8812320	did not evolve in response to different ways of life, different environments. I'm in the ocean
8812320	8817680	doing photosynthesis. I'm on land running around as part of an animal. I'm a fungus in the soil,
8819040	8825760	spending out long kind of shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium. So they all have the same
8825760	8832480	underlying cell structure. Why? Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation to the internal
8832480	8838080	environment, to having these pesky endosymbionts that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.
8838080	8841280	Now, in one way, you could see that as a really good thing because it may be that
8841280	8844960	there's some inevitability to this process. As soon as you've got endosymbionts, you're more or
8844960	8849200	less bound to go in that direction. Or it could be that there's a huge fluke about it and it's
8849200	8854320	almost certain to go wrong in just about every case possible, that the conflict will lead to
8854400	8859680	effectively war leading to death and extinction. And it simply doesn't work out. So maybe it
8859680	8863040	happened millions of times and it went wrong every time. Or maybe it only happened once
8864000	8868560	and it worked out because it was inevitable. And actually, we simply do not know enough now
8868560	8871600	to say which of those two possibilities is true, but both of them are a bit grim.
8872160	8877520	But you're leaning towards, we just got really lucky in that one leap.
8878400	8882960	Like we got, so do you have a sense that our galaxy, for example, has just
8884560	8887680	maybe millions of planets with bacteria living on it?
8887680	8892480	I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets with bacteria living on it practically.
8893520	8899360	I mean, there's probably what five to 10 planets per star of which I would hope that at least one
8899360	8906320	would have bacteria on. So I expect bacteria to be very common. I simply can't put a number
8906320	8909840	otherwise. I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere. It's not that I think we're living
8909840	8912560	in a completely empty universe. That's so fascinating.
8912560	8916400	But I think that it's not going to happen inevitably and there's something,
8917440	8923360	that's not the only problem with complex life on Earth. I mentioned oxygen and animals and so on
8923360	8928400	as well. And even humans, we came along very late. You go back five million years and would
8928400	8933120	be that impressed if we came across a planet full of giraffes? I mean, you'd think, hey,
8933200	8936880	there's life here. There's a nice planet to colonize or something. We wouldn't think,
8936880	8939280	oh, let's try and have a conversation with this giraffe.
8940240	8947760	Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think. I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting
8947760	8952800	from an alien perspective or how they would notice. I'll talk to you about cities too,
8952800	8956400	because that's an interesting perspective of how to look at human civilization.
8956960	8961680	But your sense, I mean, of course you don't know, but it's an interesting
8963360	8967440	world. It's an interesting galaxy. It's an interesting universe to live in.
8967440	8978160	That's just like every sun, like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.
8978800	8987920	Imagine that world. And the galaxy maybe has just a handful, if not one,
8988800	8996080	intelligence civilization. That's a wild world. I didn't even think about that world. There's a
8996080	9003120	kind of thought that one of the reasons it would be so exciting to find life on Mars or Titan or
9003120	9011600	whatever is like, if it's life is elsewhere, then surely, statistically, that life, no matter how
9011600	9020320	unlikely, eukaryos, multi-cell organisms, sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult?
9020320	9027520	I mean, photosynthesis is figuring out some machinery that involves the chemistry and the
9027520	9032800	environment to allow the building up of complex organisms. Surely that would arise.
9033520	9038560	But man, I don't know how I would feel about just bacteria everywhere.
9038560	9042240	Well, it would be depressing if it was true. I suppose depressing.
9042240	9045920	Always natural. I don't know what's more depressing, bacteria everywhere, nothing
9045920	9052320	everywhere. Yes, either of them are chilling. But whether it's chilling or not, I don't think
9052320	9059200	should force us to change our view about whether it's real or not. And what I'm saying may or may
9059200	9065520	not be true. So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars? It sounds like you would be less
9065520	9070560	excited than some others because you're like, wow. What I would be most interested in is how
9070560	9074080	similar to life on Earth it would be. It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem because
9075680	9084080	the likelihood of life having gone to and fro between Mars and the Earth is quite, I wouldn't
9084160	9091280	say high, but it's not low. It's quite feasible. And so if we found life on Mars and it had very
9091280	9096400	similar genetic code, but it was slightly different, most people would interpret that immediately as
9096400	9100880	evidence that there'd been transit one way or the other and that it was a common origin of life on
9100880	9104640	Mars or on the Earth. And it went one way or the other way. The other way to see that question,
9104640	9109360	though, would be to say, well, actually, the beginnings of life lie in deterministic chemistry
9109360	9115440	and thermodynamics, starting with the most likely abundant materials, CO2 and water and
9115440	9121840	a wet rocky planet. And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning. And we'll, I won't say inevitably,
9121840	9126000	but potentially almost inevitably come up with a genetic code, which is not very far away from
9126000	9131840	the genetic code that we already have. So we see subtle differences in the genetic code. What does
9131840	9137040	it mean? It could be very difficult to interpret. Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference
9137040	9142080	or something that truly originated? I think if the stereochemistry was different,
9142880	9150080	we have sugars, for example, that are the L form or the D form. And we have D sugars and
9150080	9158880	alumino acids right across all of life. But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer and
9158880	9164080	the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly possible to
9164080	9169920	use one or the other one. And the same would almost only go for, and I think George Church
9170960	9177120	has been trying to make life based on the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly
9177120	9182960	possible to do and it will work. And if we were to find life on Mars that was using the opposite
9182960	9188720	stereoisomer, that would be unequivocal evidence that life had started independently there.
9188720	9193920	So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa or something like that,
9193920	9198880	where it's less likely that we shared. And it's harsher conditions, so there's going to be weird
9198880	9205600	or kind of life. I wouldn't count on that because life started in deep sea hydrothermal vents.
9205600	9210880	It's a little harsh. That's pretty harsh. Yeah. So Titan is different. Europa is probably quite
9210880	9215360	similar to Earth in the sense that we're dealing with an ocean, some acidic ocean there,
9215680	9221440	as the early Earth would have been. And it almost only has hydrothermal systems, same with Enceladus.
9221440	9226400	We can tell that from these plumes coming from the surface through the ice. We know there's a
9226400	9231840	liquid ocean and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is. For Titan, we're dealing with
9231840	9235200	liquid methane and things like that. So that would really, if there really is life there,
9235200	9239440	it would really have to be very, very different to anything that we know on Earth.
9240400	9244000	So the hard leap, the hardest leap, the most important leap is from
9245360	9256160	prokaryotes to eukaryotes. What's the second, if we're ranking? You gave a lot of emphasis on
9256160	9262320	photosynthesis. Yeah. And that would be my second one, I think. But it's not so much. I mean,
9262320	9268640	photosynthesis is part of the problem. It's a difficult thing to do. Again, we know it happened
9268720	9279120	once. We don't know why it happened once. But the fact that it was kind of taken on board
9279120	9286160	completely by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts and did very well in completely
9286160	9290400	different environments and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest that there's no
9291920	9296560	problem with exploring. You could have a separate origin that explored this whole domain over there
9296560	9302800	that the bacteria had never gone into. So that kind of says that the reason that it only happened
9302800	9308560	once is probably because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult. But then it happened
9309120	9315680	at least 2.2 billion years ago, right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago,
9315680	9319440	when there are some people say there are whiffs of oxygen, there's just kind of traces in the
9319440	9323520	fossil in the geochemical record that say maybe there was a bit of oxygen then,
9323520	9327760	that's really disputed. Some people say it goes all the way back 4 billion years ago
9327760	9333040	and that it was the common ancestor of life on earth was photosynthetic. So immediately you've
9333040	9339120	got groups of people who disagree over a 2 billion year period of time about when it started.
9340720	9347120	But well, let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal, that's 2.2 billion years ago,
9347120	9351360	through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion when oxygen levels definitely got
9351360	9357520	close to modern levels, which was around about 550 million years ago. So we've gone more than
9357520	9364480	one and a half billion years where the earth was in stasis, nothing much changed,
9364480	9370800	as known as the boring billion, in fact. Probably stuff was, that was when Eukaryotes arose somewhere
9370800	9378480	in there, but it's... So this idea that the world is constantly changing, that we're constantly
9378480	9384640	evolving, that we're moving up some ramp is a very human idea. But in reality, there are
9388880	9396160	tipping points to a new stable equilibrium, where the cells that are producing oxygen are
9396160	9401040	precisely counterbalanced by the cells that are consuming that oxygen, which is why it's 21%
9401040	9406320	now and has been that way for hundreds of millions of years. We have a very precise balance.
9406320	9411200	You go through a tipping point and you don't know where the next stable state's going to be,
9411200	9416880	but it can be a long way from here. And so if we change the world with global warming,
9416880	9421520	there will be a tipping point. The question is where and when, and what's the next stable state?
9421520	9427360	It may be uninhabitable to us. It'll be habitable to life, for sure. But there may be something
9427360	9433600	like the Permian extinction, where 95% of species go extinct. And there's a 5 to 10 million year gap,
9433600	9438640	and then life recovers, but without humans. And the question statistically, well, without humans,
9438640	9443840	but statistically, does that ultimately lead to greater complexity, more interesting life?
9445040	9450560	Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE, there was a tipping point,
9450560	9454640	which led to a long-term stable state that was equivalent to the Black Sea today,
9454640	9461200	which is to say oxygenated at the very surface and stagnant sterile, not sterile, but sulfurous,
9461200	9468400	lower down. And that was stable, certainly around the continental margins for more than
9468400	9472800	a billion years. It was not a state that led to progression in an obvious way.
9475120	9479520	Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution, like what leads to stable states
9479920	9489520	and how often are evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment?
9490960	9496000	So maybe other planets are able to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures,
9496000	9500080	whatever, some kind of pressure that say you're screwed unless you get your shit together in
9500080	9508320	the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of pressure. It seems like Earth, like the boring
9508320	9513760	building might be explained in two ways. One is super difficult to take any kind of next step,
9514560	9518800	and the second way it could be explained is there's no reason to take the next step.
9518800	9523600	No, I think there is no reason, but at the end of it, there was a snowball Earth.
9525040	9532880	So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale where the sea was frozen at the equator,
9533840	9540160	and that forced change in one way or another. It's not long after that,
9540160	9543760	a hundred million years, perhaps after that, so not a short time, but this is when we begin
9543760	9548720	to see animals. There was a shift again, another tipping point that led to catastrophic change,
9548720	9554880	that led to a take off then. We don't really know why, but one of the reasons why that I discuss in
9554880	9562640	the book is about sulfate being washed into the oceans, which sounds incredibly parochial.
9563360	9571680	But what the data is showing, we can track roughly how oxygen was going into the atmosphere from
9574000	9579120	carbon isotopes. So there's two main isotopes of carbon that we need to think about here.
9579120	9584400	One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12, and then 1% of carbon is carbon 13,
9584400	9588560	which is a stable isotope, and then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive,
9588640	9597120	it's trivial in amount. So carbon 13 is 1%, and life and enzymes generally, you can think of
9597120	9602400	carbon atoms as little balls bouncing around, ping-pong balls bouncing around. Carbon 12 moves
9602400	9607200	a little bit faster than carbon 13 because it's lighter, and it's more likely to encounter an
9607200	9613040	enzyme, and so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter. And so organic matter is enriched,
9613040	9618080	and this is just an observation, it's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent compared to carbon
9618080	9624640	13 relative to what you would expect if it was just equal. And if you then bury organic matter,
9625520	9632640	as coal or oil or whatever it may be, then it's no longer oxidized. So some oxygen remains left
9632640	9637680	over in the atmosphere, and that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere. And you can work
9637680	9641280	out historically how much oxygen there must have been in the atmosphere by how much
9642240	9645600	carbon was being buried, and you think, well, how can we possibly know how much carbon was
9645600	9650000	being buried? And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12, what you're leaving behind
9650000	9654560	is more carbon 13 in the oceans, and that precipitates out in limestone. So you can look
9654560	9659600	at limestones over these ages and work out what's the carbon 13 signal, and that gives you a kind
9659600	9665440	of a feedback on what the oxygen content. Right before the Cambrian explosion, there was what's
9665440	9670800	called a negative isotope anomaly excursion, which is basically the carbon 13 goes down by a
9670800	9677120	massive amount and then back up again 10 million years later. And what that seems to be saying
9677120	9687200	is the amount of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing, which is to say, it was being
9687200	9693600	oxidized. And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen. And that should,
9693600	9699520	so a big carbon 13 signal says the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,
9699520	9704160	which means there's much more carbon 12 being taken out and being oxidized. Sorry,
9704160	9709280	this is getting too complex. Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.
9709280	9713600	If you calculate the amount of oxygen based on the assumption that all this carbon 12 that's
9713600	9717600	being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen, the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere
9717600	9723120	gets stripped out. There is none left. And yet the rest of the geological indicators say, no,
9723120	9728960	there's oxygen in the atmosphere. So it's kind of a paradox. And the only way to explain this
9728960	9733520	paradox just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air, how much stuff is in the oceans
9733520	9740080	and so on is to assume that what oxygen was not the oxygen, it was sulfate. Sulfate was being
9740080	9745760	washed into the oceans. It's used as an electron acceptor by sulfate reducing bacteria just as
9745760	9750160	we use oxygen as an electron acceptor. So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.
9751200	9756800	Bacteria did. Yeah. So these are bacteria. So they're
9756880	9762320	oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate, passing the electrons on to sulfate.
9762880	9768400	That reacts with iron to form iron pyrides or fools gold, sinks down to the bottom, gets
9768400	9774400	buried out of the system. And this can account for the mass balance. So why does it matter?
9775040	9781040	It matters because what it says is there was a chance event, tectonically there was a lot of
9781040	9788880	sulfate sitting on land as some kind of mineral. So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are
9788880	9797520	evaporitic. And because there happened to be some continental collisions, mountain building,
9797520	9801760	the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain and happened to get washed into the ocean.
9803600	9806880	Yeah. So I wonder how many happy accidents like that are possible.
9806880	9812160	Statistically, it's really hard. Maybe you can roll that in statistically. This is the course
9812160	9817200	of life on earth. Without all that sulfate being raised up, this Cambrian explosion almost
9817200	9821760	certainly would not have happened. And then we wouldn't have had animals and so on and so on.
9823760	9831040	This kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion. So let me actually say in several
9831040	9840320	ways, folks who challenge the validity of the theory of evolution will give us an example.
9840320	9844960	No, I'm not. We'll study in this, but we'll give us an example of the Cambrian explosion as like,
9844960	9854640	this thing is weird. Oh, it is weird. So by the question I would have is what's the biggest mystery
9855280	9861840	or gap in understanding about evolution? Is it the Cambrian explosion? And if so, how do we,
9861840	9868640	what's our best understanding of how to explain? First of all, what is it? In my understanding,
9868640	9873120	in the short amount of time, maybe 10 million years, 100 million years, something like that,
9873120	9880240	a huge number of animals, a variety, diversity of animals were created. Anyway, there's like
9880240	9884080	five questions in there. Is that the biggest mystery? No, I don't think it's a particularly
9884080	9890000	big mystery really anymore. I mean, there are still mysteries about why then,
9890640	9895120	and I've just said sulfate being washed into the oceans is one, it needs oxygen and oxygen
9895120	9902400	levels rose around that time. So probably before that, they weren't high enough for animals.
9902400	9907280	What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.
9907360	9913040	We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races and we're seeing
9915440	9921600	we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed. And so I talked about the boring
9921600	9926800	billion, nothing happens for one and a half, one billion years, one and a half billion years.
9928960	9934400	The assumption, and this is completely wrong, this assumption is then that evolution works
9934400	9940640	really slowly and that you need billions of years to affect some small change and then another
9940640	9945920	billion years to do something. And it's completely wrong. Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it
9945920	9951280	stays that way for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years. And Stephen Jay Gould used
9951280	9955360	to argue this, he called it punctuated equilibrium, but he was doing it to do with animals and to do
9955360	9960320	with the last 500 million years or so, where it's much less obvious than if you think about the
9960320	9965920	entire planetary history. And then you realize that the first two billion years was bacteria only,
9965920	9970400	you have the origin of life, two billion years of just bacteria, oxygenic photosynthesis
9970400	9976000	arising here, then you have a global catastrophe, snowball earths and great oxidation event and
9976000	9980400	then another billion years of nothing happening and then some period of upheavals and then another
9980400	9984720	snowball earth and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion. This is long periods of stasis
9985280	9990720	where the world is in a stable state and it's not geared towards increasing complexity, it's
9990720	9996880	just everything is in balance. And only when you have a catastrophic level of global problem like
9996880	10000960	a snowball earth, it forces everything out of balance and there's a tipping point and you
10000960	10009280	end up somewhere else. Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong. It can be incredibly fast.
10010160	10015600	And I mentioned earlier on, in theory, it would take half a million years to invent an eye,
10015600	10023520	for example, from a light sensitive spot. It doesn't take long to convert one kind of tube
10023520	10029120	into a tube with nobles on it, into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms and then one
10029120	10034720	end is ahead with it, it starts out as a swelling. It's not difficult intellectually to understand
10034720	10041760	how these things can happen. It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly, but we're used to
10042640	10048160	human time scales. And what we need to talk about is generations of things that live for a year
10048160	10054640	in the ocean. And then a million years is a million generations and the amount of change that
10054640	10059440	you can do, you can affect in that period of time is enormous. And we're dealing with large
10059440	10066160	populations of things where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes. And so again, as soon as
10066160	10073280	you throw in the competition of predators and prey and you're ramping up the scale of evolution,
10073280	10078080	it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly when the environment allows it to happen.
10078080	10082240	So I don't think there's a big mystery. There's lots of details that need to be filled in.
10082800	10086320	I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.
10090400	10095040	The big mystery in biology is consciousness. Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.
10100800	10110560	I mean, you said biology, not psychology. Because from a biology perspective, it seems like
10110560	10117120	intelligence and consciousness all are the same, like weird, like all the brain stuff.
10117120	10123280	I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult, I suppose. I mean, I see it as a
10123280	10129360	form of computing and I don't know much about computing. So you don't know much about consciousness
10129360	10138320	either. So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see that consciousness you do know
10138320	10144720	a lot about as a human being. No, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring of a brain
10145280	10154880	as a series of, in pretty much the same way as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry
10154880	10161680	of it. The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings, as we were talking
10161680	10168800	about earlier on. Yeah, I just, I think, I think we oversimplify intelligence. I think the dance,
10168800	10178880	the magic of reasoning is as interesting as the magic of feeling. We tend to think of reasoning
10178880	10188160	as like very, running a very simplistic algorithm. I think reasoning is the interplay between memory,
10188160	10192080	whatever the hell's going on, the unconscious mind, all of that.
10192240	10199280	I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all. Obviously, it's extraordinarily
10199280	10205440	exquisitely complex, but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.
10206320	10213360	Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah, there's a big cloak of mystery around
10213360	10218400	consciousness. I mean, let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.
10219360	10226640	Classical physics is logical, and you can understand that the kind of language we're
10226640	10230320	dealing with, it's almost at the human level, we're dealing with stars and things that we
10230320	10235600	can see. And when you get to quantum mechanics and things, it's practically impossible for
10235600	10241760	the human mind to compute what just happened there. Yeah, I mean, that is the same. It's like,
10243040	10248000	you understand mathematically the notes of a musical composition, that's intelligence.
10248560	10258000	Why makes you feel a certain way? That is much harder to understand. Yeah, that's really,
10259200	10265600	but it was interesting framing that that's a mystery at the core of biology. I wonder
10266240	10272000	who solves consciousness. I tend to think consciousness will be solved by the engineer,
10272240	10281280	meaning the person who builds it, who keeps trying to build the thing versus biology,
10281280	10290240	such a complicated system. I feel like the building blocks of consciousness from a biological
10290240	10296640	perspective are like, that's like the final creation of a human being. So you have to
10296640	10302880	understand the whole damn thing. You said electrical fields, but like electrical fields plus
10302880	10310000	plus everything at the whole shebang. I mean, trying to agree. I mean, my feeling is from
10310000	10314000	my meagre knowledge of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough is usually comes
10314000	10319520	through from a field that was not related to it. So if anyone is not going to be a biologist who
10319520	10326400	solves consciousness, just because biologists are too embedded in the nature of the problem.
10326400	10329520	And then nobody's going to believe you when you've done it because nobody's going to be able to
10329520	10336880	prove that this AI is in fact conscious and sad in any case, and any more than you can prove
10336880	10343520	that a dog is conscious and sad. So it tells you that it is in good language and you must believe
10343520	10350720	it. But I think most people will accept if faced with that, that that's what it is. All of this
10351600	10354240	probability of complex life.
10358400	10361520	In one way, I think why it matters is that
10364160	10370640	my expectation, I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years or so if we survive at all
10370640	10376640	that AI will increasingly dominate and pretty much anything that we put out into space going
10376720	10383280	looking for other well for the universe for what's out there will be AI won't be won't be us we
10383280	10388080	won't be doing that or when we do it'll be on a much more limited scale. I suppose the same would
10388080	10394800	apply to any alien civilization. So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there,
10394800	10399840	we should be looking for AI out there. But then we face the problem
10400080	10408240	that I don't see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.
10409280	10412160	You can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.
10413520	10418560	And if the principles that govern the evolution of life on earth apply to other planets as well,
10419440	10426320	and I think a lot of them would, then the likelihood of ending up with a human like
10426320	10432000	civilization capable of giving rise to AI in the first place is massively limited.
10432000	10436720	Once you've done it once, perhaps it takes over the universe and maybe there's no issue.
10436720	10442480	But it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked that you're not going to just turn a
10442480	10447520	sterile planet into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics first.
10448480	10454880	You have to run the evolutionary computation with the organics to create AI.
10454880	10459360	How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid of an intelligent designer?
10459920	10465040	The origin of AI is going to have to be in the chemistry of a planet.
10467120	10473520	But that's not a limiting factor, right? So let me ask the Fermi Paradox question.
10475040	10480720	Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful world of
10481280	10488640	just billions of planets with bacteria on it and very few intelligent civilizations.
10488640	10496320	And yet there's a few out there. Why haven't we at scale seen them visit us?
10497440	10500640	What's your sense? Is it because they don't exist?
10501840	10505680	Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe at the right time. That's the simplest
10505680	10511440	answer for it. Is that the one you find the most compelling? Or is there some other explanation?
10513360	10517920	I find that, you know, it's not that I find it more compelling. It's that I find more probable.
10518880	10522720	And I find all of them, I mean, there's a lot of hand waving in this, we just don't know.
10523760	10529200	So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth to what might happen somewhere else.
10529840	10535360	And it gives to my mind a bit of a pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere and only occasional
10535360	10541040	intelligent life. And, you know, running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else that
10541040	10545520	you would necessarily be any more excited about making contact with than you would be making
10545520	10553200	contact with them on Earth. So, so I think the chances are pretty limited. And the chances of
10553200	10558160	us surviving is pretty limited too. And the way we're going on at the moment, the likelihood
10558160	10564240	of us not making ourselves extinct within the next few hundred years, possibly within the next
10564240	10571520	50 or 100 years, seems quite small. I hope we can do better than that. So maybe the only thing
10571520	10575840	that will survive from humanity will be AI. And maybe AI, once it exists, and once it's capable
10575840	10582720	of effectively copying itself and cutting humans out of the loop, then maybe that will take over
10582720	10587920	the universe. I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness to the way you described that. But isn't
10587920	10597680	that also potentially beautiful that that's the next step of life? I suppose, from your
10597680	10600800	perspective, as long as it carries the flame of consciousness somehow.
10600800	10604480	I think yes, there can be some beauty to it being the next step of life. And I don't know if
10604480	10611120	consciousness matters or not from that point of view, to be honest with you. But there's
10611200	10617840	some sadness, yes, probably, because I think it comes down to the selfishness that we were
10617840	10625440	talking about earlier on. I am an individual with a desire not to be kind of displaced from life.
10625440	10632720	I want to stay alive. I want to be here. So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would
10632720	10639520	feel is that we will just be wiped out. So there will be potential conflicts between AI and humans
10639600	10642960	and that AI will win because it's a lot smarter.
10644800	10650800	Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs if consciousness is just an intermediate stage
10651920	10659600	between bacteria and AI. I would see bacteria as being potentially a primitive form of
10659600	10666000	consciousness. The whole of life on earth, to my mind, is capable of some form of feelings
10666000	10669840	in response to the environment. That's not to say it's intelligent, though it's got its own
10670400	10676080	algorithms for intelligence, but nothing comparable with us. I think it's beautiful what a planet,
10676080	10680880	what a sterile planet can come up with. It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this
10680880	10687680	stuff that we see around us and that either we or whatever we produce is capable of destroying
10687680	10698080	all of that. It is a sad thought, but it's also hugely pessimistic. I'd like to think that we're
10698080	10702560	capable of giving rise to something which is at least as good if not better than us as AI.
10703520	10710800	Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing that is able to propagate throughout the
10710800	10717360	universe more efficiently than humans can or extensions of humans, some merger with AI and
10717360	10725520	humans. Where does that come from? Bioengineering of the human body to extend its life somehow
10726640	10732480	to carry that flame of consciousness and that personality and the beautiful tension that's
10732480	10738400	within all of us carry that through to multiple planets, to multiple solar systems all out there
10738400	10745440	in the universe. I mean, that's a beautiful vision. Whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans
10745680	10753280	can. That's an exciting possibility and especially meeting other alien civilizations in that same
10753280	10757200	kind of way. Do you think aliens have consciousness? If they're organic.
10758000	10763280	Organic connected to consciousness. I mean, I think any system which is going to bootstrap
10763280	10771040	itself up from planetary origins, let me finish this and then I come onto something else,
10771040	10776480	but from planetary origins is going to face similar constraints and those constraints are
10776480	10781600	going to be addressed in similar basic engineering ways and I think it will be cellular and I think
10781600	10787040	it will have electrical charges and I think it will have to be selected in populations over time
10787040	10791520	and all of these things will tend to give rise to the same processes as the simplest fix to a
10791520	10796800	difficult problem. So I would expect it to be conscious. Yes, and I would expect it to resemble
10796800	10804000	life on earth in many ways. When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16, I remember reading a book by
10804000	10811200	Fred Hoyle called The Black Cloud, which I was budding biologists at the time and this was the
10811200	10815120	first time I'd come across someone that really challenging the heart of biology and saying,
10816080	10822160	you are far too parochial. You're thinking about life as carbon-based. Here's a life form which is
10823120	10833120	interstellar dust on a solar system scale and it's a novel, but I felt enormously challenged
10833120	10842240	by that novel because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was, how narrow-minded I
10842240	10846480	was being and here was a great physicist with a completely different conception of what life could
10846480	10854480	be. And since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways and I'm reluctant to say the attacks
10854480	10861760	make more sense to me than the original story, which is to say, even in terms of information
10861760	10866000	processing, if you're on that scale and there's a limit of the speed of how quickly can something
10866000	10876480	think if you're needing to broadcast across the solar system, it's going to be slow. It's not
10876480	10881760	going to hold a conversation with you on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining,
10881760	10886720	or at least not by any easy way of doing it, assuming that the speed of light is a limit.
10888240	10894480	And then again, you really can't. This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago and I
10894480	10900240	do think he's right. There is no other way to generate this level of complexity than natural
10900240	10905680	selection. Nothing else can do it. You need populations and you need selection in populations
10905680	10915360	and a kind of an isolated interstellar cloud. Again, there's unlimited time and maybe there's
10915360	10922560	no problems with distance, but you need to have a certain frequency of generational time
10923120	10930240	to generate a serious level of complexity. And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.
10931280	10936240	Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution is a really powerful tool here on
10936240	10941120	Earth, but there could be other mechanisms. So whenever I don't know if you're familiar with
10941760	10949120	cellular automata, but complex systems that have really simple components and seemingly
10949120	10954480	move based on simple rules when they're taken as a whole, really interesting complexity emerges.
10955520	10959840	I don't know what the pressures on that are. It's not really selection, but
10959840	10964240	interesting complexity seems to emerge. And that's not well understood exactly.
10965440	10971840	I think there's a difference between complexity and evolution. So some of the work we're doing on
10971840	10979360	the origin of life is thinking about how does, well, how do genes arise? How does information
10979360	10985040	arise in biology? And thinking about it from the point of view of reacting CO2 with hydrogen,
10985040	10989120	what do you get? Well, what you're going to get is carboxylic acids and amino acids. It's
10989120	10995520	quite hard to make nucleotides. And it's possible to make them and it's been done and it's been
10995520	11001040	done following this pathway as well. But you make trace amounts. And so the next question, assuming
11001040	11005200	that this is the right way of seeing the question, which maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is,
11005840	11010880	is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides then? How do you become more complex and better
11011760	11016880	becoming a nucleotide generating machine? And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,
11017680	11022960	some form of autocatalysis. So that can work. And we know it happens in biology. If this
11022960	11029520	nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation, then you're going to increase the rate of flux
11029520	11033120	through the whole system and you're going to effectively steepen the driving force to make
11033120	11041520	more nucleotides. And this can be inherited because there are forms of membrane heredity that you
11041520	11047040	can have. And there are, effectively, you can, if a cell divides in two and it's got a lot of stuff
11047040	11052640	inside it and that stuff is basically bound as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,
11053600	11059040	then it will inevitably regenerate itself. And so you can develop greater complexity.
11060400	11065120	But everything that I've said depends on the underlying rules of thermodynamics. There is
11065120	11071600	no evolvability about that. It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,
11072160	11076720	assuming that you're able to increase the driving force through the system. You will
11076720	11081040	generate more of the same, you'll expand on what you can do, but you'll never get anything different
11081120	11087520	than that. And it's only when you introduce information into that as a gene, as a kind of
11088160	11094480	small stretch of RNA, which can be random stretch, then you get real evolvability,
11094480	11098400	then you get biology as we know it, but you also have selection as we know it.
11099600	11102640	Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.
11102880	11109680	That's the kind of memory of the system. So it's not, yeah, at the local level,
11109680	11114560	it's propagation of copying yourself and changing and improving your adaptability
11114560	11122720	to the environment. But if you look at earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory. That's the key
11122720	11131040	feature of it. In what way? It remembers the stuff it tries. Like if you were to describe
11131120	11136240	earth, I think evolution is something that we experience
11138560	11144320	as individual organisms. That's how the individual organisms interact with each other.
11144320	11150320	There's a natural selection. But when you look at earth as an organism in its entirety,
11153120	11155120	how would you describe it? I mean,
11155120	11162240	well, not as an organism. I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely. And James Lovelock originally
11162240	11168160	put Gaia out as an organism that had somehow evolved. And he was immediately attacked by
11168160	11175200	lots of people. And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat because that was more of a poetic
11175200	11183280	vision than the science. The science is now called earth systems science. And it's really about how
11183280	11187840	does the world kind of regulate itself so it remains within the limits which are hospitable
11187840	11195360	to life. And it does it amazingly well. And it is working at a planetary level of kind of
11195360	11201280	integration of regulation. But it's not evolving by natural selection. And it can't because there's
11201280	11206800	only one of it. And so it can change over time, but it's not evolving. All the evolution is
11206800	11211520	happening in the parts of the system. Yeah, but it's a self-sustaining organism.
11212000	11213680	No, it's sustained by the sun.
11215200	11221280	Right. So I mean, you don't think it's possible to see earth as its own organism?
11222320	11226800	I think it's poetic and beautiful. And I often refer to the earth as a living planet.
11227440	11232320	But it's not in biological terms, an organism. No.
11233680	11240480	If aliens were to visit earth, what would they notice? What would be the basic
11240560	11242080	unit of light they would notice?
11242960	11247200	Trees, probably. I mean, it's green. It's green and blue. I think that's the first thing you'd
11247200	11251920	notice is it stands out from space as being different to any of the other planets.
11251920	11255120	So it would notice the trees at first, because the green...
11255120	11257040	Well, I would notice the green, yes.
11257040	11261680	Yeah. And then probably notice to figure out the photosynthesis.
11261680	11263920	Probably notice cities a second, I suspect.
11264880	11265920	Yeah. First.
11265920	11269040	They arrived at night, they noticed cities first, that's for sure.
11269040	11275200	It depends the time. You write quite beautifully in Transformers once again.
11275200	11277280	I think you open the book in this way. I don't remember.
11278000	11284160	From space describing earth, it's such an interesting idea of what earth is.
11285520	11292160	You also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless,
11292160	11293920	which is a beautifully poetic thing.
11294560	11301280	You open Transformers with from space, it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating the
11301280	11306960	blue-green colors of the living earth. It is crisscrossed by regular patterns and convergent
11306960	11313760	striations. There's a central amorphous density where these scratches seem lighter.
11314400	11320160	This, quote, growth does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines,
11320240	11323360	and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.
11323920	11328480	Across the globe, there are thousands of them, varying in shape and detail,
11328480	11332560	but all of them gray, angular, and organic, spreading.
11333680	11335600	Yet at night, they light up.
11336560	11339680	Glowing up the dark sky, suddenly beautiful.
11339680	11343920	Perhaps these cankers on the landscape are in some sense living.
11343920	11349440	There's a controlled flow of energy, there must be information and some form of metabolism,
11349440	11355840	some turnover of materials. Are they alive? No, of course not. They are cities.
11357120	11360000	So is there some sense that cities are living beings?
11360880	11363840	You think aliens would think of them as living beings?
11363840	11366080	Well, it would be easy to see it that way, wouldn't it?
11368640	11372160	It wakes up at night. They wake up at night.
11372160	11374560	Strictly nocturnal, yes.
11375120	11378960	I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough to get here would understand
11378960	11381520	that they're not living beings.
11382560	11391600	My reason for saying that is that we tend to think of biology in terms of information and
11391600	11397520	forget about cells. I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell as a city and the
11397520	11402960	energy flow through the city and the energy flow through cells and the turnover of materials.
11403040	11409200	An interesting thing about cities is that they're not really exactly governed by anybody.
11411200	11415680	There are regulations and systems and whatever else, but it's pretty loose.
11418320	11421600	They have their own life, their own way of developing over time.
11423440	11425040	And in that sense, they're quite biological.
11426640	11432480	There was a plan after the Great Fire of London, Christopher Wren was making plans
11432480	11438720	not only for St Paul's Cathedral, but also to rebuild in large Parisian-type boulevards,
11438720	11442880	a large part of the area of central London that was burned.
11443920	11447280	It never happened because they didn't have enough money, I think.
11447280	11449840	But it's interesting what was in the plan. There were all these boulevards,
11450720	11455280	but there were no pubs and no coffee houses or anything like that.
11456160	11462080	The reality was London just kind of grew up in a set of jumbled streets.
11462160	11465360	It was the coffee houses and the pubs where all the business of the city of London was
11465360	11468880	being done and that was where the real life of the city was. And no one had planned it.
11468880	11472560	The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.
11472560	11476240	And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned, it's not controlled by the genes
11476240	11479600	in the nucleus and the way that we might like to think that it is, but it's kind of
11480240	11484640	evolved entity that has the same kind of flux, the same animation, the same life.
11484640	11491200	So I think it's a beautiful analogy, but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.
11491200	11497280	See, I disagree with you. I disagree with you. I think you are so steeped.
11498000	11506080	And actually the entirety of science, the history of science is steeped in a biological
11506080	11512160	framework of thinking about what is life. And not just biological, it's very human-centric too.
11512960	11521760	That the human organism is the epitome of life on earth. I don't know. I think there is some
11521760	11528080	deep fundamental way in which a city is a living being in the same way that a human-
11528080	11534720	It doesn't give rise to an offspring city. It doesn't work by natural selection,
11534720	11541840	it works by, if anything, memes it works by. It's kind of copying itself conceptually as a
11541840	11549920	mode of being. So I mean, maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms that are really essential to
11549920	11555840	life on earth. Maybe it's much more important about the collective aspect of human nature,
11555840	11561600	the collective intelligence than the individual intelligence. Maybe the collective humanity
11561600	11568720	is the organism. And the thing that defines the collective intelligence of humanity is the ideas
11569600	11575840	and maybe the way that manifests itself is cities, maybe or societies or geographically
11575840	11580960	constrained societies or nations and all that kind of stuff. I mean, from an alien perspective,
11580960	11587520	it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing, not from a place of ignorance.
11587600	11593360	What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works. I mean, I don't have any problem with what you're
11593360	11602320	saying, really, except that it's not possible without the humans, we went from a hunter-gatherer
11602320	11609120	type economy, if you like, without cities. And as soon as we get into human evolution
11609120	11614640	and culture and society and so on, then yes, there are other forms of evolution,
11615520	11621600	other forms of change, but cities don't directly propagate themselves. They propagate themselves
11621600	11626080	through human societies and human societies only exist because humans as individuals propagate
11626080	11631680	themselves. So there's a hierarchy there and without the humans in the first place,
11631680	11638720	none of the rest of it exists. So do you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit on which
11638800	11642160	evolution can operate? I think it's a really important thing, yes.
11643040	11649520	Yeah. And we don't have any other better ideas than evolution for how to create one.
11649520	11654560	I never came across a better idea than evolution. I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.
11656080	11661360	You mentioned, oh, that's no automator and so on. And I don't think specifically about that,
11661360	11665280	but I have thought about it in terms of selective units at the origin of life and
11665280	11670320	the difference between evolvability and complexity or just increasing complexity,
11670320	11678400	but within very narrowly defined limits. The great thing about genes and about selection
11678400	11682480	is it just knocks down all those limits. It gives you a world of information in the end,
11682480	11688800	which is limited only by the biophysical reality of what kind of an organism you are,
11688800	11694640	what kind of a planet you live on and so on. And cities and all these other forms that look alive
11694640	11700800	and could be described as alive because they can't propagate themselves, can only exist as the
11700800	11708320	product of something that did propagate itself. Yeah. I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth
11708320	11714800	to that kind of way of looking at things, but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud
11716720	11722800	among us. I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this because I can't say that my world
11722800	11728800	view is particularly uplifting, but in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not,
11728800	11736480	science is about what's reality, what's out there, why is it this way? And I think there's beauty
11736480	11744000	in that too. There's beauty in darkness. You write about life and death sort of at the biological
11744000	11751680	level. Does the question of suicide, why live, does the question of why the human mind is capable
11751760	11762320	of depression, are you able to introspect that from a place of biology? Why are minds, why we humans
11762320	11774480	can go to such dark places? Why can we commit suicide? Why can we go suffer, suffer period,
11774480	11781360	but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness of going to a dark place that depression can take
11781360	11791280	you? Is this a feature of life or is it a bug? I don't know. I mean, if it's a feature of life,
11791280	11795200	then I suppose it would have to be true of other organisms as well. And I don't know
11796480	11803200	when we were talking about dogs earlier on, and they can certainly be very sad and upset and may
11803200	11807840	mooch for days after their owner died or something like that. So I suspect in some sense it's a
11807840	11819120	feature of biology. It's probably a feature of mortality. But beyond all of that, I mean,
11819120	11825760	I guess there's two ways you could come at it. One of them would be to say, well, you can effectively
11825760	11830560	do the math and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless and that there's really no point
11830560	11836880	in me being here any longer. And maybe that's true. In the greater scheme of things, you can
11836880	11841360	justify yourself in terms of society, but society will be gone soon enough as well. And you end
11841360	11847680	up with a very bleak place just by logic. In some sense, it's surprising that we can find any meaning
11847680	11853280	at all. Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in, that we have transient joy. But with
11853280	11858880	transient joy, we have transient misery as well. And sometimes with everything in biology,
11860640	11865760	getting the regulation right is practically impossible. You will always have a bell-shaped
11865760	11870960	curve where some people, unfortunately, are at the joy end and some people are at the misery end.
11870960	11878000	And that's the way brains are wired. And I doubt there's ever an escape from that. It's the same
11878000	11883280	with sex and everything else as well. We're dealing with it. You can't regulate it. So
11885120	11887280	anything goes. It's all part of biology.
11887520	11900320	Amen to that. Let me on writing in your book, Power Sex and Suicide. First of all,
11900320	11906240	can I just read off the books you've written? If there's any better titles and topics to be
11906240	11910080	covered, I don't know what they are. It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write
11910080	11915280	next. I hope there's things you write next. So you first, you wrote Oxygen, the molecule that
11915280	11920560	made the world, as we've talked about, this idea of the role of oxygen in life on earth.
11920560	11928400	Then wait for it. Power Sex Suicide, mitochondria and the meaning of life. Then life ascending,
11928400	11933680	the 10 great inventions of evolution. The vital question, the first book I've read of yours,
11933680	11939040	the vital question, why is life the way it is? And the new book, Transformer,
11939040	11947440	The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death. In Power Sex and Suicide, you write about writing,
11947440	11952720	or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing. You write,
11953520	11959520	in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision
11959520	11966720	to the guide's entry on the earth, which originally read harmless. By the way, I would also, as a
11966800	11972160	side quest, as a side question, would like to ask you what would be your summary of what earth is.
11973600	11980560	You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down by the guide to read mostly harmless. I
11980560	11987280	suspect that too many new additions suffer a similar fate, if not through absurd editing decisions,
11987280	11993200	at least through a lack of meaningful change in content. As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed
11993200	11999200	since the first edition of Power Sex, Suicide was published. And I am resisting the temptation
11999200	12005760	to make any lame revisions. Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his arguments in
12005760	12011280	the origin of species through his multiple revisions, in which he dealt with criticisms
12011280	12017120	and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction. I prefer my original to speak for
12017200	12023760	itself, even if it turns out to be wrong. Let me ask the question about writing,
12024640	12029280	both your students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant
12029280	12036880	writings on science and humanity I've ever read. What's the process of writing? How do you advise
12036960	12048720	other humans? If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you and just young anybody and give
12048720	12053840	advice about how to write and how to write well about these big topics, what would you say?
12055600	12063520	I suppose there's a couple of points. One of them is what's the story? What do I want to know?
12063520	12070720	What do I want to convey? Why does it matter to anybody? And very often the biggest,
12070720	12078960	most interesting questions, the childlike questions are the one that actually everybody
12078960	12084960	wants to ask, but then quite do it in case they look stupid. And one of the nice things about
12084960	12089200	being in science is the longer you're in, the more you realize that everybody doesn't know the
12089200	12096000	answer to these questions and it's not so stupid to ask them after all. So trying to
12097200	12104560	ask the questions that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16, when I was really
12104560	12112480	hungry to know about the world and didn't know very much about it and wanted to go to the edge
12112480	12120960	of what we know, but be helped to get there. I don't want to be too much terminology and so I
12120960	12129520	want someone to keep a clean eye on what the question is. Beyond that, I've wondered a lot
12129520	12136640	about who am I writing for? And that was in the end, the only answer I had was myself at the age
12136640	12145040	of 15 or 16. Because even if you're, you just don't know who's reading but also where are they
12145040	12152320	reading it? Are they reading it in the bath or in bed or on the metro or listening to an audio
12152320	12159920	book? Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages because you read three pages at a time
12159920	12165920	or are you really irritated by that? You're going to get criticism from people who are
12165920	12169440	irritated by what you're doing and you don't know who they are or what you're going to do
12169440	12174960	that's going to irritate people. And in the end, all you can do is just try and please yourself.
12176560	12182720	And that means, well, what are these big fun, fascinating, big questions? And what do we know
12182720	12190000	about it? And can I convey that? And I kind of learned in trying to write, first of all,
12190960	12196320	say what we know. And I was shocked in the first couple of books how often I came up
12196320	12203920	quickly against all the stuff we don't know. And if you're trying to, I've realised later on in
12204640	12210960	supervising various physicists and mathematicians who are PhD students and their maths is way
12210960	12216080	beyond what I can do. But the process of trying to work out what are we actually going to model
12216080	12219200	here? What's going into this equation? It's a very similar one to writing. What am I going to
12219760	12225040	put on a page? What's the simplest possible way I can encapsulate this idea so that I now
12225040	12230160	have it as a unit that I can kind of see how it interacts with the other units? And you realise
12230160	12234160	that, well, if this is like that and this is like this, then that can't be true.
12236960	12241840	So you end up navigating your own path through this landscape. And that can be thrilling because
12241840	12247200	you don't know where it's going. And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons my books have
12247200	12251440	worked for people because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride that I don't know where
12251440	12257280	it's going either. So finding the simplest possible way to explain the things we know
12257280	12261520	and the simplest possible way to explain the things we don't know and the tension between those two
12261520	12269520	and that's where the story emerges. What about the edit? Do you find yourself to the point of this
12270480	12277200	editing doll to most harmless? To arrive at simplicity, do you find
12278160	12282560	the edit is productive or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?
12283120	12289040	No, I usually find, I think I'm perhaps a better editor than I am a writer. I write and rewrite
12289040	12293760	and rewrite and rewrite. Put a bunch of crap on the page first and then see where the edit where it
12293920	12299040	takes. Yeah. But then there's the professional editors who come along as well. And I mean,
12299840	12306000	in Transformer, the editor came back to me after I'd sent him two months after I sent the
12306000	12311120	first edition, he'd read the whole thing and he said, the first two chapters prevent a formidable
12311120	12317200	hurdle to the general reader. Go and do something about it. And it was the last thing I really
12317200	12322000	wanted to do. Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech. Yeah, well, this was an email. But
12323840	12330160	I thought about it in, you know, the bottom line is he was right. And so I put the whole thing aside
12330160	12334720	for about two months. It's been the summer. This would have been, I guess, last summer.
12335920	12340560	And then turned to it with full attention in about September or something and rewrote those
12340560	12345920	chapters almost from scratch. I kept some of the material, but it took me a long time to process
12345920	12350240	it to work out what needs to change. Where does it need to change? I wasn't writing in this time.
12350240	12354320	How am I going to tell this story better so it's more accessible and interesting? And in the end,
12355040	12360400	I think it's still difficult. It's still biochemistry. But as he ended up saying,
12360400	12365920	now he's got a barreling energy to it. And because he'd told me the truth the first time,
12365920	12370400	I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth the second time as well and was delighted.
12372320	12379280	Could you give advice to young people in general? Folks in high school, folks in college,
12379280	12382960	how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on. Now you've done that in the space of
12382960	12392320	biology and expanded out. How can they have a career they can be proud of or have a life
12392320	12401920	they can be proud of? Gosh, that's a big question. I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom that you can
12402480	12408800	impart to young people. So the only advice that I actually ever give to my students
12410480	12417920	is follow what you're interested in. Because they're often worried that if they make this
12417920	12421600	decision now and do this course instead of that course, then they're going to restrict
12421600	12428800	their career opportunities. And there isn't a career path in science. It's not, I mean,
12428880	12435040	there is, but there isn't. There's a lot of competition. There's a lot of death symbolically.
12436320	12444640	So who survives? The people who survive are the people who care enough to still do it. And they're
12444640	12452320	very often the people who don't worry too much about the future and are able to live in the present.
12452320	12457280	Because if you do a PhD, you've competed hard to get onto the PhD, then you have to compete hard
12457280	12463840	to get a post-doc job. And you have the next one maybe on another continent. And it's only two
12463840	12470560	years anyway. And there's no guarantee you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.
12471840	12476960	And there's always the next step to compete. If you get a faculty position, you get a tenure.
12476960	12481200	And with tenure, you go full professor and full professor, then you go to some kind of whatever
12481200	12485120	the discipline is. There's an award. If you're in physics, you're always competing for the
12485760	12489120	there's different awards. And then eventually you're all competing to,
12490080	12493760	I mean, there's always a competition. So there is no happiness. Happiness does not lie.
12493760	12497840	If you're looking into the future, yes. And if what you're caring about is a career, then
12499200	12506720	it's probably not the one for you. If you can put that aside, and I've also worked in industry
12506720	12510800	for a brief period and I was made redundant twice. So I know that
12511520	12516400	it's, you know, there's no guarantee that you've got a career that way either.
12518960	12525200	So live in the moment and try and enjoy what you're doing. And that means really go to the
12527600	12531680	go to the themes that you're most interested in and try and follow them as well as you can.
12531680	12537440	And that tends to pay back in surprising ways. I don't know if you've found this as well,
12537440	12546240	but I found that people will help you often. If they see some light shining in the eye,
12547440	12553840	you're excited about their subject. And, you know, just want to talk about it.
12554640	12559040	And they know that their friend in California has got a job coming up. They'll say,
12559040	12564880	go for this, this guy's all right. You know, they'll use the network to help you out
12564880	12569360	if you really care. And you're not going to have a job two years down the line. But if what you
12569360	12573440	really care about is what you're doing now, then it doesn't matter if you have a job in two years
12573440	12580320	time or not. It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye. And so that's the only
12580320	12586960	advice I can give. And most people probably drop out through that system because the fight is just
12586960	12591760	not worth it for them. Yeah, when you have the light in your eye, when you have the excitement
12591760	12596000	for the thing, what happens is you start to surround yourself with others that are interested
12596000	12600160	in that same thing that also have the light. If you really are rigorous about this, because
12600960	12607600	I think it does take, it doesn't, it takes effort to make... Oh, you've got to be obsessive.
12607600	12612080	But if you're doing what you really love doing, then it's not work anymore is what you do.
12612080	12616240	Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself with other people that are obsessed about the
12616240	12620400	same thing because depending on... Oh, that takes some work as well, yes. And look.
12620400	12626640	Finding the right mentors, the collaborators, because I think one of the problem with
12627520	12634560	the PhD process is people are not careful enough in picking their mentors. Those are people,
12635520	12641040	mentors and colleagues and so on, those are people are going to define the direction of your life,
12641040	12647200	the how much you love a thing, the power of just like the few little conversations you have
12648160	12654960	in the hallway, it's incredible. So you have to be a little bit careful in that. Sometimes you
12654960	12665120	just get randomly almost assigned, really pursue, I suppose, the subject as much as you pursue the
12665120	12669360	people that do that subject. So like both, the whole dance of it. They kind of go together really.
12669360	12675280	Yeah, they do. They really do. But take that part seriously. And probably in the way you're
12675280	12683200	describing it, careful how you define success because... You'll never find happiness in success.
12683200	12687120	I know there's a lovely quote from Robert Lewis Stevenson, I think, who said,
12687120	12693840	nothing in life is so disenchanting as attainment. Yeah, so I mean, in some sense,
12694720	12702480	the true definition of success is getting to do today what you really enjoy doing,
12702480	12708880	just what fills you with joy. And that's ultimately success. Success isn't the thing
12708880	12716560	beyond the horizon, the big trophy, the financials. I think it's as close as we can get to happiness.
12716560	12721520	That's not to say you're full of joy all the time, but it's as close as we can get to a sustained
12721520	12725840	human happiness is by getting some fulfillment from what you're doing on a daily basis. And if
12725840	12733440	what you're looking for is the world giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize or a
12733440	12741200	fellowship or whatever it is, then I've known people like this who they eat away by the
12742640	12748560	anger of the kind of caustic resentment that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.
12749760	12753520	And the other way, if you put too much value into those kinds of prizes and you win them,
12754160	12758320	I've gotten a chance to see that it also,
12761200	12765840	the more, quote unquote, successful you are in that sense, the more you run the danger of
12768560	12774720	growing ego so big that you don't get to actually enjoy the beauty of this life,
12774720	12780400	you start to believe that you figured it all out, as opposed to I think what ultimately the most
12780400	12785600	fun thing is is being curious about everything around you, being constantly surprised, and
12785600	12790800	these little moments of discovery of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.
12790800	12794640	And I think the bigger your ego grows, the more you start to take yourself seriously,
12794640	12802640	the less you're able to enjoy that. Oh man, I couldn't agree more. So the summary from harmless
12802640	12808160	to mostly harmless in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, how would you try to summarize
12809120	12817120	earth? And if you were given, if you had to summarize the whole thing in a couple of sentences,
12817120	12825280	and maybe throw in meaning of life in there, like why, why, why, maybe is that a defining
12825280	12832800	thing about humans that we care about the meaning of the whole thing? I wonder if that should be
12832880	12839280	part of the, these creatures seem to be very lost. Yes, I'm always asking why. I mean,
12839280	12847280	that's my defining question is why people used to make a joke. I have a small scar on my forehead
12847280	12852720	from a climbing accident years ago. And the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock and he
12852720	12858160	shouted something, he shouted below, I think, meaning that the rock was coming down. And I
12858160	12864400	hadn't caught what he said. So I looked up and it smashed straight on my forehead. And everybody
12864400	12873280	around me took the piss saying he looked up to ask why. Yeah, but that's a human imperative.
12873280	12879120	That's part of what it means to be human. Look up to the sky and ask why. And ask why.
12879760	12883040	So your question, define the earth.
12887840	12890880	I'm not sure I can do that. I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.
12893440	12895360	I wouldn't like to say mostly living, but perhaps.
12896560	12900880	Mostly living. Well, it's interesting because like if you were to write
12900880	12910400	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I suppose, say our idea we talked about the bacteria is the
12910400	12918560	most prominent form of life throughout the galaxy and the universe. I suppose the earth would be
12918560	12925520	kind of unique and would require abundance in that case. Yeah, it's profligate, it's rich,
12925520	12932240	it's enormously living. So how would you describe that it's not bacteria? It's
12935200	12941200	eukaryotic. Yeah, well, I mean, that's the technical term, but it is basically.
12945040	12950000	Yeah, and then. How would I describe that? I've actually really struggled with that term,
12950720	12956240	because the word, I mean, there's few words quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off
12956240	12961200	immediately. You start using words like that and they'll leave the room. Krebs cycle is another
12961200	12968800	one that gets people to leave the room. So I've tried to think, is there another word for eukaryotic
12968800	12974480	that I can use? And really the only word that I've been able to use is complex cells,
12975440	12982480	complex life and so on. And that word, it serves one immediate purpose, which is to convey
12983200	12990800	an impression. But then it means so many different things just everybody that actually
12990800	12997600	is lost immediately. And so it's kind of. Well, that's unnoticeable from the perspective of other
12997600	13002800	planets. That is the noticeable face transition of complexity is the eukaryotic.
13005280	13008400	What about the harmless and the mostly harmless? Is that kind of?
13010160	13018160	Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale. I don't think that humanity is in any danger of
13018160	13023200	disturbing the universe at the moment. At the moment, which is why the mostly,
13023920	13029440	we don't know, depends what you want us up to. Depends how many rockets. I think it's
13029440	13036240	it'll be still even then a while. I think before, before we disturb the fabric of time and space.
13036240	13041280	Was the aforementioned Andre Carpathia, I think he summarized earth as
13043440	13051120	as a system where you hammer it with a bunch of photons. The input is like photons and the output
13051120	13057840	is rockets. Well, that's the hell of a lot of photons before there was a rocket.
13060000	13063920	You know, maybe maybe in the span of the universe, it's not, it's not that much time.
13064560	13069680	And so, and I do wonder, you know, what the future is, whether we're just in the early
13069680	13075200	beginnings of this earth, which is important when you try to summarize it, or we're at the end,
13076160	13082800	where humans have finally gained the ability to destroy the entirety of this beautiful project
13082800	13088560	we've got going on, that with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses, with all those kinds of
13088560	13094000	things. Or just inadvertently through global warming and pollution and so on. We're quite
13094000	13098160	capable of that. I mean, we just need to pass a tipping point. I mean, I think we're more likely
13098160	13103200	to do it inadvertently than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time. But
13105200	13113280	my fear is, is we just don't know where the tipping points are. And we will, we kind of think
13113280	13118320	we're smart enough to fix the problem quickly if we really need to. I think that's the overriding
13118320	13124000	assumption that we're all right for now. Maybe in 20 years time, it's going to be a calamitous
13124000	13127200	problem. And then we'll really need to put some serious mental power into fixing it
13128400	13134480	without seriously worrying that perhaps that is too late. And that however brilliant we are,
13135360	13142240	it's, we miss the boat. And just walk off the cliff. I don't know. I have optimism in humans
13142240	13148720	being clever descendants. Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem. But it's an urgent
13148720	13155280	problem. And we need to fix it pretty sharpish. And I do have doubts about whether politically
13155280	13161600	we are capable of coming together enough to not just in any one country, but around the planet
13162320	13167680	to, I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will? Do we have the vision to
13168640	13174800	accomplish it? That's what makes this whole ride fun. I don't know. Not only do we not
13174800	13179920	know if we can handle the crises before us, we don't even know all the crises that are going to
13179920	13186880	be before us in the next 20 years. The ones I think that will most likely challenge us
13186880	13191280	in the 21st century are the ones we don't even expect. People didn't expect World War II.
13191760	13192880	At the end of World War I.
13194400	13199600	Well, some people did, but not at the end of World War I, but by the late 1920s,
13199600	13203920	I think people were beginning to worry about it. Yeah, no, there's always people worrying about
13203920	13208800	everything. So if you focus on the thing that people worry about, because there's a million
13208800	13214160	things people worry about and 99.9999% of them don't come to be. Of course, the people that
13214160	13219520	turn out to be right, they'll say, I knew all along, but that's not an accurate way of knowing
13219520	13224800	what you could have predicted. I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it, but nobody
13224800	13229360	thought you could have another World War, the war to end all wars. Why would you have another war?
13229920	13236080	And the idea of nuclear weapons, just technologically, is a very difficult thing to
13236080	13241840	anticipate to create a weapon that just jumps, orders the magnitude, and destructive capability.
13242400	13246720	And of course, we can intuit all the things like engineered viruses,
13246720	13254800	nanobots, artificial intelligence, yes, all the different complicated global effects of
13254800	13259120	global warming. So how that changes the allocation of resources, the flow of energy,
13259120	13264320	the tension between countries, the military conflict between countries, the reallocation
13264320	13271040	of power, then looking at the role of China in this whole thing with Russia and growing influence
13271120	13278000	of Africa and the weird dynamics of Europe, and then America falling apart through the political
13278000	13283840	division fueled by recommender systems through Twitter and Facebook. The whole beautiful mess
13284400	13289840	is just fun. And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers, incredible scientists,
13289840	13295440	incredible human beings that while everyone is bickering and so on online for the fun of it on
13295440	13299600	the weekends, they're actually trying to build solutions. And those are the people that will
13299600	13304480	create something beautiful, at least I have, you know, that's the process of evolution. It's,
13305520	13313440	there was, it all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism that went out from the events
13314000	13322320	and was the parent to all of us. And for that guy or lady or both, I guess, is a big thank you.
13322320	13327520	And I can't wait to what happens next. And I'm glad there's incredible humans writing and studying
13327600	13332160	it like you are. Nick, it's a huge honor that you were talking to me. This is fantastic. This is
13332160	13341840	really amazing. I can't wait to read what you write next. Thank you for existing. And thank you
13341840	13347680	for talking today. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Lane. To support
13347680	13352800	this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some
13352800	13360080	words from Steve Jobs. I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the
13360080	13368960	intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning. Thank you for listening. I hope to
13368960	13379520	see you next time.
