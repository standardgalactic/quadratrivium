0	4840	There is a famous story about Einstein that he used to, you know, go think, think, think,
4840	7480	and then go for a walk, and like he would whistle and sometimes.
8000	12360	So I remember the first time I heard this story, I thought, how interesting is what
12360	14840	the coincidence that he, this came to him when he was whistling.
15400	21680	But in fact, it's not this is how it works in some sense that you have to prepare for it.
21760	25440	But then the moment it happens when you stop thinking, actually, so the moment of
25440	33400	discovery is the moment when thinking stops and you kind of, you kind of almost become
33400	35600	that truth that you're seeking.
38160	42400	The following is a conversation with Edward Frankel, one of the greatest living
42400	46800	mathematicians doing research on the interface of mathematics and quantum
46800	52520	physics with an emphasis on the Langland's program, which he describes as a grand
52560	54240	unified theory of mathematics.
54600	59480	He also is the author of love and math, the heart of hidden reality.
60240	62000	This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
62200	65040	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
65400	68840	And now, dear friends, here's Edward Frankel.
70040	75760	You open your book, Love and Math, with a question, how does one become a mathematician?
76240	77920	There are many ways that this can happen.
78160	80120	Let me tell you how it happened to me.
80240	81760	So how did it happen to you?
82360	85040	So first of all, I grew up in the Soviet Union.
86640	90120	In a small town near Moscow called Kolomna.
92000	97800	And I was a smart kid, you know, a school, but mathematics was probably my least
97800	100880	favorite subject, not because I couldn't do it.
100960	106360	I was, you know, a straight A student and I could do all the problems easily.
106720	108640	But I thought it was incredibly boring.
109640	117680	And since the only math I knew was what was presented at school, I thought that was it.
118080	120520	And I was like, what kind of boring subject is this?
121240	125440	So what I really liked was physics and especially quantum physics.
125560	133560	So I was buying, I would go to a bookstore and buy popular books about elementary
133880	140640	particles and atoms and things like that and read them, you know, devour them.
141920	148480	And so I thought my dream was to become a theoretical physicist and to delve into
148480	150880	this finer structure of the universe, you know.
151520	154960	So then something happened when I was 15 years old.
156000	161680	It turns out that a friend of my parents was a mathematician who was a professor
161720	165640	at the local college, it was a small college preparing educators and teachers.
166480	171160	It's a provincial town, imagine it's like 117 kilometers from Moscow, which
171160	172760	would be something like 70 miles, I guess.
173480	174080	You do the math.
175280	177080	I like how you remember the number exactly.
177080	179520	Yeah, it's not funny how we remember numbers.
180080	183960	So his name was Yevgeny Yevgenyovich Petrov.
185120	189920	And if this doesn't remind you of the great works of Russian literature that you
189920	190600	haven't read them.
191960	194880	Like War and Peace, you know, like with the patronymic names.
195000	196200	But this was all real.
196200	197200	This was all happening.
197760	203040	So my mom, one day, by chance, met Yevgeny Yevgenyovich and told him about me,
204000	207280	that I was a bright kid and interested in physics.
208160	210800	And he said, oh, I want to meet him.
211240	212920	I'm going to convert him into math.
214040	217040	And my mom was like, nah, math, he doesn't like mathematics.
217240	219440	So they said, OK, let's let's see what they can do.
220440	221640	So I went to see him.
221640	227640	So I'm about 15 and a bit, a bit arrogant, I would say, you know, like every
227640	228360	teenager.
229360	238080	So he says to me, so I hear that you are interested in physics and elementary
238080	238640	particles.
238800	239720	I was like, yeah, sure.
240760	242960	And so, for example, do you know about quarks?
244200	246240	And I said, yes, of course, I know about quarks.
246760	253560	Quarks are the, you know, constituents of particles like protons and neutrons.
253560	258160	And it was one of the greatest discoveries in theoretical physics in the 60s.
258160	262800	That those particles were not elementary, but in fact, had the smaller parts.
263600	266800	And he said, oh, so then you probably know representation theory of the group
266800	270560	as you three, like, as you worked.
271400	278520	So in fact, I wanted to know what was, what were the underpinnings of those theories?
278840	280640	I knew the story, I knew the narrative.
280640	284520	I knew kind of this basic story of what these particles look like.
284520	287360	But how did physicists come up with these ideas?
288280	290080	How were they able to theorize them?
290880	293120	And so I remember, you know, like it was yesterday.
293120	298880	So he pulls out a book and it's kind of like like a Bible, you know, like a
298880	302400	substantial book and he opens them, it's somewhere in the middle.
302560	306280	And there I see the diagrams that I saw in popular books.
306360	308840	But in popular books, there was no explanation.
309400	312400	And now I see all these weird symbols and equations.
312680	314880	It's clear that it is explained in there.
315360	321080	Oh, my God, he said, you think what they teach you at school is mathematics.
322120	324480	It's like, no, this is real mathematics.
325560	327360	So I was instantly converted.
328200	333880	That to understand the underpinnings of physical reality, you have to understand
333880	334880	what SU3 is.
334880	341640	You have to learn what are groups, what is group SU3, what are representations of
341640	345360	SU3. There was a coherent and beautiful.
345560	350560	I could appreciate the beauty even though I could not understand heads and tails of it.
350720	356640	But you were drawn to the methodology, the machinery of how such understanding could
356640	357640	be attained.
357640	363440	Well, in retrospect, I think what I was really craving was a deeper understanding.
364320	368280	And up to that point, the deepest that I could see was where there was diagrams.
368280	373360	But for that story that, you know, a proton consists of three quarks and the neutron
373360	376200	consists of three quarks and they're called up and down and so on.
377120	382520	But I didn't know that there was actually underneath beneath the surface.
382880	384320	There was this mathematical theory.
384880	388360	If you can just link, what drew you to quantum mechanics?
389400	393480	Is there some romantic notion of understanding the universe?
394000	395280	Well, what is interesting to you?
395280	398120	Is it the puzzle of it or is it like the philosophical thing?
398200	400120	Now I am looking back.
400240	400560	Yeah.
400560	411160	So whatever I say about Edward at 15, yeah, he's colored by my, you know, all my
411160	413400	experiences that happen in the meantime.
413680	418720	I should say for the people who may not know you, I think your book and your
418720	422760	presentations kind of revealed that that 15 year old is still in there somewhere.
422840	427400	Well, some of the joy, he's probably still here now.
428120	428960	Yeah, in some way.
430440	435000	Yeah, I think it was a joy of discovery and the joy of going deeper into the kind
435000	441280	of the, to the root, to the, so the deepest structures of the universe.
441320	446960	So the secrets, the secrets, and we may not discover all of them.
447080	452920	We may not be able to understand, but we're going to try and go as far and as deep as we can.
452960	456560	I think that's what was the motivating factor in this.
457480	458840	Yeah, there's this mystery.
458840	462600	There's this dark room and there's a few of these mathematical physicists.
462600	467760	They're able to shine a flashlight briefly into there.
468720	472240	I would, we'll talk about it, but it also kind of makes me sad that there's so
472240	479840	few of your kind that have the flashlight to look into the room.
480960	481680	It's interesting.
482960	487200	I don't think there are so few, to be honest, because I think I find a lot of
487200	489160	people are actually interested.
489520	495400	If you talk, if you talk to people, you know, like some people you wouldn't expect to be
495440	502360	interested in this from all walks of life, from people of all kinds of professions.
502600	505440	I tell them I'm a mathematician and they, I'm a mathematician.
505440	506880	Okay, so that's a separate story.
506880	510800	A lot of people, I think, have been traumatized by their experience in the math
510800	511240	classes.
511240	515080	We can talk about it later, but then they ask me what kind of research I do.
515120	522160	And I mentioned that I work on the interface of math and quantum physics and their eyes
522160	525320	light up and say, oh, quantum physics or like Einstein's relativity.
525320	526520	Oh, I'm really curious about it.
526560	530160	I watch this podcast or I watch that podcast, you know, and I've learned this.
530160	531280	It's like, what do you think about that?
531920	538000	So I actually find that actually physicists are doing a great job at educating the public,
538000	545960	so to speak, and in terms of popular books and videos and so on.
545960	550560	Mathematicians are behind, we're starting to catch up a little bit.
550600	553760	I've been starting last 10 years, but we're still behind.
553760	555920	But I think people are curious.
556640	561760	Science is still a very much, you know, something that people want to learn because
561760	567560	that's our kind of the best way we know to establish some sort of objective reality,
567760	568720	whatever that might be.
569320	573080	Yeah, and to figure out this whole puzzle, to figure out the secrets that the universe holds.
573080	577200	Things that we can agree on, kind of, you know, like, even though for me, at this point,
577200	581040	I always, you know, make an argument that our physical theories always change.
581080	582000	They get updated.
582080	588840	So you had Newton's theory of gravity, then Einstein's theory, you know, superseded it.
589720	593240	But in mathematics, it seems that theories don't change.
593720	598480	Pythagoras' theorem has been the same for the last 2,500 years.
598960	601200	X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared.
601640	605680	We don't expect that next year suddenly it will be Z cubed, you know.
606040	613480	So and so that, to me, is actually even more, hints even more at how much we are connected
613480	618040	to each other because Pythagoras' theory, if you think about it, or any other mathematical
618040	624760	theorem means the same thing to anyone in the world today, regardless of their cultural,
625200	631920	you know, upbringing, religion, you know, ideas, ideology, gender, whatever,
632880	634760	nationality, race, whatever, right?
635080	641040	And it has meant the same to everyone, everywhere, and most likely will mean the same.
641840	649800	So that's, to me, kind of an antidote to the kind of divisiveness that we sometimes
649840	653600	observe these days, where it seems that we can't agree on anything.
655040	660560	To the political complexity of 2 plus 2 equals 5 in George Orwell's 1984.
661120	667000	I was in the Soviet Union in 1984, and so in many ways, I see that it was present,
667200	668600	and the novel was present.
669120	674360	But we still have not found a dictator who would actually say 2 plus 2 equals 5 and would
674360	677000	demand their citizens to repeat that.
677040	678000	The night is still young.
678000	679360	Has not happened yet, okay?
680560	686600	But those feel like math and physics are both sneaking up to a deep truth from slightly
686600	691200	different angles, and you stand at the crossroads or at the intersection of the two.
691920	694520	It's interesting to ask, what do you think is the difference between physics and
694520	697880	mathematics in the way physics and mathematics look at the world?
699040	704480	There is actually an essential difference, which is that physicists are interested in
704480	707680	describing this universe, okay?
708080	712920	Mathematicians are interested in describing all possible mathematical universes, of which,
713880	717640	you know, in some of our work, I'm still considering myself more of a mathematician
717640	718480	than a physicist.
719120	722000	My first love for physics, not withstanding.
723440	729840	Mathematicians are, in a way, we have more diversity, if you might say.
729880	738280	So we are accepting, for instance, our universe has three spatial dimensions,
738280	739680	in one time dimension, right?
739680	741880	So what I mean is that.
742040	742640	Allegedly.
743000	743600	Allegedly.
744160	746440	Absorbed, but that we can observe today, right?
746440	749720	So of course, there are theories where there are some hidden dimensions as well.
750240	752360	Well, let's just say observed, you observe dimensions.
754280	759800	So this tabletop has two dimensions because you can have two axes, two coordinate axes.
761200	765960	X and Y, but then there is also a third one to describe the space of this room.
766880	768400	And then there is a time dimension.
768880	777720	So realistic theories of physics have to be about spaces of three dimensions or space
777720	779040	times of four dimensions.
779560	786400	But mathematically, we are just as interested in theories in 10 spacetime dimensions or
786400	792080	11 or 25 or whatever, or, or infinite dimensional spaces, you know?
792640	793960	So that's the difference.
794960	797640	On the other hand, I have to give it to the physicists.
797720	805320	We don't have the same satisfaction that they have of having their theories confirmed
805360	806280	by an experiment.
806560	811400	We don't get to play with big machines like LHC in Geneva, a large
811400	816240	Adron Collider that recently discovered, you know, the Higgs boson and some other things.
817120	820160	For us, it's all like a mental exercise in some sense.
820200	823960	We do, we prove things by using rules of logic.
824640	829120	And that's our way of confirming, experimental confirmation, if you will.
829600	833200	But I think we kind of, I kind of envy a little bit, my friends physicists, that they,
833320	838600	they get to, they get to experience this sort of, this big toys, you know, and play with them.
839120	843320	But it does seem that sometimes as you've spoken about abstract mathematical concepts
843320	846320	map to reality, and it seems to happen quite a bit.
846560	847000	That's right.
847000	849840	So the mathematics is underpin physics, obviously.
849840	857200	It's a language, the book of nature, as Galileo famously said, is written in the
857200	864280	language of mathematics, and, and, you know, the, the letters in it are the circle
864280	870400	triangles and squares, and those who don't know the language, I'm paraphrasing, are
870400	873120	left to wander in a dark labyrinth.
873680	877960	That's a famous quote from Galileo, which is very true and has become even more
877960	887520	true more recently in theoretical physics in the most, in the most far out parts of
887520	892320	the theoretical physics that have to do with elementary particles in the, and as well as
892320	894680	the, the structure of the cosmos at the large scale.
895200	899520	What do you think of Max Tagmark who wrote the book, Mathematical Universe?
900880	907600	So do you think just lingering on that point, you think at the end of the day, the
907600	909840	future generations will all be mathematicians?
911520	916080	Meaning, meaning the ones that deeply understand the way the universe works at the core.
916080	919200	Is it just mathematics?
920000	927480	At the core of, you know, I would say mathematics is one half of the core.
928160	929960	So the book is called Love and Math.
930120	930360	Yeah.
930360	930480	Okay.
930480	935280	So these are the two pillars in my view.
935840	939160	In other words, you can't cover everything by math.
939200	946520	So mathematics gives you tools, it gives you a way, a kind of a clear vision.
947680	954240	But mathematics by itself is not enough for one to have a harmonious and balanced life.
954680	963360	You know, so I am suspicious of any theory that declares that everything is mathematics.
964360	969840	So math can generate things that are beautiful, but it can't explain why it's beautiful.
969840	975160	Math, you could say, is a way to discern patterns, to find regularities in the universe.
975160	981040	And both physical and mental universe, the mathematics explores the mind as much as it
981040	985040	explores the physical world around us.
985560	991960	And it helps us to find those patterns, which kind of, which makes our perception more
992280	1000680	sophisticated, our ability to perceive things such as beauty, you know, and it sharpens our
1000680	1003240	ability to see, to see beauty, to understand beauty.
1003240	1011160	So our world becomes more complex from thinking that our, that our, that Earth is flat.
1011560	1017400	We go to realizing that it is round, that it's shaped as a sphere so that we can actually
1017400	1022200	travel around the Earth, you know, so there isn't a place where we hit the end, so to speak.
1023320	1031640	And then proceeding in the same vein, then Einstein's general relativity theory tells us that
1033000	1035080	our space time is not flat either.
1036200	1042040	This is much harder to, to imagine the bent, a bent three-dimensional or four-dimensional,
1042040	1046440	three-dimensional space or four-dimensional space time, because this idea that the space around
1046520	1048280	us is flat is so deeply entrenched.
1048840	1054360	And yet we know from this theory and from the experiments that have confirmed it,
1055800	1063240	that a ray of light bends around a star, as if being attracted by the, by the force of gravity.
1063240	1065400	But in fact, the force of gravity is the bending.
1065960	1070360	It's just that it's not only the bending of the space, it's also the bending of space time.
1070360	1074520	There is a curvature, not only between special, spatial dimensions.
1075480	1082840	The way parallels and meridians come together in a small scale, they look like perpendicular lines.
1082840	1087080	But if you zoom out, you see that the space are, they're curving the space.
1087080	1091160	They are, they are sort of the, the tracks along which the space gets curved.
1091720	1094440	That's, that's the, that would be the curvature of spatial dimensions.
1095000	1099960	But in fact, now throwing time, and one time, imagine a sphere which lives,
1099960	1105160	which has one of the meridians correspond to time, and they're less correspond to space.
1105160	1109160	I can't imagine it, but you can write, I can write a mathematical formula expressing that
1109160	1114920	curvature. And that's, in fact, that curvature is responsible for the force of gravity attraction
1114920	1121000	between the sort of simplest instantiation of it, attraction between two planets or between two human
1121000	1130040	beings. Yeah, the time, bending time, it's not very nice that what that theory did to time,
1130680	1136920	because it feels like the marching of time forward is fundamental to our human experience.
1137640	1145080	The arrow of time marching forward nicely seems to be the only way we can understand the universe.
1145080	1149160	And the fact that you can start up to now, up to now, there are people who claim that they can,
1149160	1152440	that they have, they possess other ways of experiencing it.
1152440	1155080	So truly can visualize messing with time?
1156040	1161160	Well, messing with time, but not necessarily messing with time, because one point of view is that,
1161720	1169880	you know, I think, who was it? I think William Blake, who wrote that eternity loves time production.
1170840	1177480	So one point of view is that it is eternity, which is fundamental, where time stands still,
1178200	1185560	which our mind conceptualizes as the time. So, but in fact, you know, it's not something mystical.
1185560	1190680	If you think about when you, about it, when you're really absorbed in something,
1192040	1195320	time does stand still. And then you look at the clock and it's like, oh my god,
1195320	1201000	two hours have passed. And it felt like a couple of seconds. When you are absorbed,
1201000	1205640	when you're in love, when you are passionate about something, when you're creating something,
1206120	1212200	you are, we lose ourselves and we lose the sense of time and space for that matter. You see,
1212200	1216200	so there is only that, which is happening, that creative process.
1218120	1220120	So I think that this, this is familiar to all of us.
1220680	1224440	And we may be actually the closest to the truth at that moment, to the truth.
1224440	1229880	And so then, so yes, so then there is a point of view that this is where we are, we are who we are,
1230680	1236040	at our sort of fundamental, at our fundamental level. And after that, the mind comes in
1236920	1240520	and tries to conceptualize it. It's like, oh, because I was writing something.
1242680	1247720	I was writing a book, I was painting this painting, or maybe I was watching this painting and got
1247720	1252440	totally absorbed in it. Or I fell in love with this person. That's what happened. But in the
1252440	1256200	moment when it's happening, you're not thinking about it. You're just there.
1256840	1261880	Yeah, we construct narratives around the set of memories that seem to have happened in sequence,
1261880	1267640	or at least that's the way we tell ourselves that. And we also have a bunch of weird human things,
1267640	1275400	like consciousness, and the experience of free will that we chose a set of actions as the time
1275400	1283960	unrolled forward. And we are intelligent, conscious agents making, taking those actions.
1284840	1290760	But what if all of that is just an illusion and a nice narrative, we tell ourselves.
1290760	1295400	That's a really difficult thing to internalize. And imagine that to make it really catch 22.
1296360	1302440	Imagine that our minds are set up in such a way that they can't approach the world
1302440	1309000	or experience otherwise. So in other words, to understand, to see that from a more
1309800	1314280	kind of all-encompassing point of view, we have to step out of the mind.
1315560	1317800	Well, I wonder what's the more honest way to look at things.
1318840	1323400	But I think we like to be, to play with time. I think we like to play with these experiences,
1323400	1326920	with all the drama of it, with all the memories, with all the tribulations.
1327640	1330760	I think we love it. We love it. Otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it.
1331560	1337560	I think the Earth loves it. The evolutionary process somehow loves it. Whatever this thing
1337560	1344360	that's being created here on Earth, it seems to like to create, like to allow its children to
1344360	1352040	play with certain truths that they hold, this subjective truths that are useful for the competition
1352040	1355880	or whatever this dance that we call life broadly define, not just humans.
1356600	1361400	And you know, I'm glad you mentioned that because what I find fascinating is that the greatest
1361400	1367160	scientists are on record saying that when they were making their discoveries,
1367160	1372280	they felt like children. So Isaac Newton said to myself, I only appeared as a child playing
1372280	1376840	on the seashore and every once in a while finding a prettier pebble or a prettier shell.
1377480	1381160	Whilst, I think he said something like the infinite ocean of knowledge
1383000	1389800	was lying before me, Alexander Grotendig, who probably was the greatest mathematician
1389800	1394600	of the second half of the 20th century, the French mathematician, Alexander Grotendig,
1395560	1402360	wrote that discovery is a privilege of a child. The child who is not afraid to be wrong once again,
1402360	1408600	to look like an idiot, you know, to try this and that, I'm paraphrasing, and go through trial and
1408600	1418200	error. That is for them, in other words, for them, that innocence of a child who is not afraid,
1419080	1426280	who has not yet been told that it cannot be done. Okay. That was essential to scientific pursuit,
1426280	1435720	to scientific discovery. And now also compared to Pablo Picasso, a great artist, right? So who said
1435720	1441320	every child is an artist. The question is to how to preserve that as we grow up.
1442120	1444920	Do you struggle with that? You're one of the most respected
1445800	1452760	mathematicians in the world. You're Berkeley, you're like, there's a statue, you're supposed to be
1452760	1459640	very like, you know... Every tower. Sometimes I joke, I say, I take an elevator to the top of
1459640	1467720	the ivory tower every day, yeah. You're supposed to speak like royalty. Do you struggle to strip
1467720	1473800	all of that away to rediscover the child when you're thinking about problems when you're teaching,
1473800	1477640	when you're thinking about the world? Absolutely. I mean, that's part of being human,
1477640	1483800	because when we grow up, I mean, all of them, all of these great scientists, I think they were so
1483800	1489800	great in part because they were able to maintain that connection, okay, that fascination, that
1489800	1498600	vulnerability, that spontaneity, you know, and kind of looking at the world through the eyes of a
1498600	1504120	child. But it's difficult because, you know, you go through education system. And for many of us,
1505880	1511480	it's not especially helpful for maintaining that connection, that we kind of like,
1512200	1518120	we're being told certain things that we accept, take for granted, and so on, and little by little.
1518120	1525960	And also, we get hit every time we act different, okay, every time we act in a way that doesn't fit
1526040	1532440	sort of the pattern. We get punished by the teachers, get punished by parents, and so on.
1532440	1538360	And don't get respect when you act childlike in your thinking, when you are fearless and
1539560	1542520	looking like an idiot. That's right. Because there's a hierarchy.
1542520	1546520	Nobody wants to look like an idiot, you know, once you start growing up, or you think you're
1546520	1551560	growing up. Yeah. In the beginning, you don't even think of, you don't think in these terms.
1552520	1557800	You just play, you're just playing. And you are open to possibilities, to these infinite
1557800	1562920	possibilities that this world presents to us. So how do we, I'm not saying that
1563960	1569720	education system should not be also kind of taming that a little bit.
1571240	1577080	Obviously, the goal is balance that acquiring knowledge
1577560	1585400	so that we can be more mature and more discerning, more discriminating in terms of our approach
1585400	1591080	to the world, in terms of our connections to the world and people and so on. But how do we do that
1591080	1599080	while also preserving that innocence of a child? And my guess is that there is no formula for this.
1599400	1609080	It is a life is an answer. Every life, every human being is one particular answer to how do we find
1609080	1618280	balance? That's one imperfect approximation, approximate solution to the problem. But we can
1618280	1626600	look, we can look up to the great ones who have credentials in the sense that they have shown
1626600	1631080	and they have proved that they have done something that other humans appreciate,
1631080	1637160	our civilization appreciates, say Isaac Newton or Alexander Grottendijk or Pablo Picasso.
1637160	1643720	So they have established their right to speak about these matters and we cannot dismiss them
1643720	1650200	as mere madmen. They say, okay, well, if the same thing was said by somebody who never achieved
1650200	1657480	anything in their field of endeavor, it would be easy for us to dismiss it.
1657480	1664280	But when it comes from someone like Isaac Newton, we take notice. So I think that's
1664280	1669480	something important that they teach us. And especially today, in this age of AI,
1670680	1676040	of course, there's a big elephant in the room always, which is called AI. And so I know that
1676040	1681880	you are an expert in the subject. And we are going, we're living now in this very interesting times
1681880	1691000	of new AI systems coming online pretty much every couple of weeks. So I kind of, to me,
1691800	1696520	that whole debate about what is it? What is artificial intelligence? Where is it going?
1696520	1703800	What should we do about it? Needs an influx of this type of considerations that we've
1703800	1711640	just been talking about. That, for instance, the idea that inspiration, creativity, doesn't come
1711640	1717480	from accumulation of knowledge, because obviously a child, a child has not yet accumulated knowledge.
1717480	1727480	And yet the great ones are on record saying that a child has a capacity to create an adult
1728200	1736920	credits, the inner child for this capacity to create as an adult. You see, that's kind of weird
1736920	1743240	if we take the point of view that everything is computation, everything is accumulation of knowledge
1743240	1749400	that just bigger and bigger data sets, finer and finer neural networks, and then we will be able to
1749400	1754600	replicate human consciousness. If we take that point of view, then what I just said kind of
1754600	1760440	doesn't fit, because obviously a child has not been fed any training data, as far as we know.
1760440	1765960	Yet they're perfectly capable of distinguishing between cats and dogs, for instance, and stuff
1765960	1774040	like that. But much more than that, they're also capable of that wide-eyed perspective.
1775080	1782840	So can it really be captured, that perspective, that sense of awe, can it really be captured
1782840	1787800	by computation alone? I don't know the answer, so I'm not sort of trying to
1790520	1793320	present a particular point of view. I'm just trying to question
1795240	1802120	any theory that starts out by saying life is this, or consciousness is this.
1803640	1808280	Because when you look more closely, you recognize that there are some other things
1808280	1814200	at play which do not quite fit the narrative. And it's hard to know where they come from.
1814200	1822360	It's also possible that the evolutionary process as created is the very, it is computation.
1822360	1828680	And the child is actually not a blank slate, but the result of one of the most incredible,
1829000	1842200	several billion-year-old computations that had explored all kinds of aspects of life on earth,
1843000	1852120	of war, and love, and terror, and ambition, and violence, and invention, all of that from
1852120	1861880	the bacteria today. So that young child is not a blank slate. They actually hold within them
1861880	1868520	the knowledge of several billions of years. Right. The question is whether, as a child,
1868520	1873720	you carry that in the form of the kind of computational algorithms that we are aware
1873720	1882280	today. You see, what strikes me as unlikely is that, how should I put it? How interesting that,
1884200	1888360	you are a computer scientist and there are other people, I have studied computer science,
1888360	1896840	so I know a little bit. And so it's tempting to say, oh, the whole world is computer science,
1896840	1901400	or is based, can be explained by computer science. Why? Because it makes me feel good,
1901400	1906360	because I have mastered it, I have learned it. My ego is very happy, and people come to me,
1907000	1912680	and they look up to me, and they revere me, kind of like priests in old days, when the religion
1912680	1919320	was paramount, when you would tend to explain things in theological religious terms. Today,
1919320	1925240	science has progressed. There are fewer people who kind of buy into official religion. So
1925560	1932440	we have this knowledge, I suppose, to explain, and to know, and to dissect, and to analyze,
1932440	1938200	and to conceptualize, which is a wonderful quality that we have, and we should definitely pursue
1938200	1946760	that. But I find it a little bit unlikely that the universe is just exactly what I have learned,
1946760	1952840	and not something that I don't know, you see. Well, there's a lot of interesting
1953720	1960920	aspects of the current large language models that one perspective of it, I think, speaks to the
1960920	1970120	love and math that you talk to, which is they're trained on human data from the internet.
1971240	1979560	So at its best, a large language model, like GPT-4, captures the magic of the human condition
1980120	1986840	on its full display, its full complexity. And since mimicking, it's trying to compress all the
1986840	1993960	weirdness of humans, of all the debates and discussions, the perspectives, all the different
1993960	1998520	ways that people approach solving different problems, all of that compressed. So we live,
1998520	2003400	we're each individual ants. We only have like, we have a family, we interact with a few little
2003400	2011640	ants. And here comes AI that's able to summarize like a TLDR report of humanity.
2011640	2016920	And that's the beauty of it. So I embrace it. I'm very impressed by it.
2016920	2025320	I wonder if it can be very impressive, meaning way more impressive in being able to
2026360	2031480	fake or simulate or emulate a human. Fake. I'm glad you mentioned that,
2031480	2036840	because that seems to be the mantra. It's just fake it till you make it, isn't it?
2036840	2042600	Isn't that what we all do though? No, well, yes, we do that, but we also do other things.
2042600	2047240	We can be truly in love. We can be truly inspired when it is not fake. I do believe,
2047240	2052200	call me romantic, okay, but I do believe. And this is a very good, I'm glad you're putting it in
2052200	2056840	these terms because I've had conversations like that, that, yeah, fake it till you make it, but
2056840	2063960	that's what humans do. Yes, we do that, but not all the time. And that is debatable because also
2063960	2068120	I speak from my own experience. And that's where the first person perspective comes in.
2068120	2074920	The subjective view. I cannot prove to you, for instance, or anyone else that there are certain
2074920	2081160	moments in my life where I am genuine. I am pure, so to speak, when it's not faking it.
2082040	2089080	But I do have a tremendous certainty of it. And that's a subjective certainty. Now,
2089640	2096200	I am, as a scientist, I'm also trained to give more credibility to objective arguments that
2096200	2101720	and other things that can be reproduced, things that I can demonstrate, that I can show. But as I
2101720	2110920	get older, as I get more mature, hopefully, you know, I'm starting to question why I am not
2111000	2117160	giving as much credibility to my subjective understanding of the world, the kind of the
2117160	2123480	first person perspective. When actually modern science has already sold on that, you know,
2123480	2131160	quantum mechanics has shown unambiguously that the observer is always involved in the observation.
2132120	2137880	Likewise, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to me, show how essential
2140600	2147000	is the observer of the mathematical theory. For one thing, that's the one who chooses the axioms.
2147960	2151640	And we can talk about this in more detail. Likewise, Einstein's relativity, where
2152520	2154760	time is relative to the observer, for instance.
2154760	2158760	That's brilliant. You're just describing all of these different scales, the observer,
2158760	2165880	what the observer is. So science of 19th century had, from modern perspective, and I don't want
2165880	2170840	to offend anybody, had the delusion that somehow you could analyze the world being completely
2170840	2177080	detached from it. We now know after the landmark achievements of the first half of the 20th century
2177080	2182840	that this is nonsense. That is simply not true. And this has been experimentally proved time and
2182840	2190440	time again. So to me, I'm thinking maybe it's a hint that I should take my first person perspective
2190440	2196920	seriously as well and not just rely on kind of objective phenomena, things that can be
2196920	2203800	proved in a traditional sort of objective way by setting up an experiment that can be
2203800	2209080	repeated many times. Maybe I fall in love in the party, you know, the deepest love of my life,
2210040	2214360	perhaps hasn't happened yet, perhaps I will fall in love, but it's a unique event. You
2214360	2220440	can't reproduce it necessarily, you see. So in that sense, you see how these things are closely
2220440	2227720	connected. I think that if we are declaring from the outset that all there is to life is,
2228680	2232200	you know, computation in the form of neural networks or something like this,
2233160	2239240	however sophisticated they might be, I think we are from the outset denying to ourselves
2239240	2245080	the possibility that, yes, there is a side of me which is not faking it. Yes, there is a side of
2245080	2250600	me which cannot be captured by logic and reason. And you know what another great scientist said,
2250600	2258360	bless Pascal? He said, the heart has its reasons of which the reason knows nothing.
2259320	2265240	And then he also said, the last step of reason is to grasp that there are infinitely many
2265240	2270920	things beyond reason. How interesting, this was not a theologian, this was not a priest,
2270920	2278760	this was not a spiritual guru. It was a hardcore scientist who actually developed,
2278760	2284200	I think, one of the very first calculators. How interesting that this guy also was able to
2285160	2290600	impart on us that wisdom. Now, you can always say that's not the case.
2292760	2300280	But why should we, from the outset, exclude this possibility that there is something to what
2301240	2309160	he was saying? That is my question. I'm not taking sides. What I'm trying to do is to shake a
2309160	2314920	little bit the debate because most mathematicians that I know and computer scientists even more so,
2314920	2321560	they're kind of already sold on this. We are just, you know, reminds me of this famous Lord
2321560	2327560	Kelvin's quote from the end of 19th century. There's some debate whether he actually said that, but
2328760	2336200	never let a good story, you know, stand in the way of truth. He said, physics is basically
2336200	2342600	finished. All that remains is more, more precise measurement. So I find a lot of my colleagues
2342600	2348760	are happy to say, everything's finished. We already got, we got it. We got it. Maybe a little tweaks
2349720	2357240	in our language models, you know. So now here's my question. I'm kind of playing devil's advocate
2357240	2363320	a little bit because I don't see the other side of what represented that much. And I'm saying,
2363320	2367800	okay, could it be also that if you believe in that, that that becomes your reality?
2368760	2375160	That you can kind of put yourself in a box where everything is computation, and then you start
2375160	2381160	seeing things as being such. It's confirmation bias, if you will, you know. This also reminds me,
2381160	2385560	you know, that I think a good analogy is it's a friend of mine, Philippe Caution told me that in
2385560	2395640	France there is this literary movement, which is called Olipo, O-U-L-I-P-O. And it's a bunch of
2395640	2403480	writers and mathematicians who create works of literature where in which they basically impose
2403480	2410280	certain constraints. A good example of this is a novel, which is called The Void or Disappearance
2410280	2416040	by a writer named Georges Perec, which is a 300 page novel in French,
2417800	2425800	which never uses the letter E, which is the most widely used letter of the French language.
2426840	2432920	So in other words, he set these parameters for himself. I'm going to write a book where I don't
2432920	2440200	use this letter, which is a great experiment and I applaud it. But that's one thing to do
2440200	2448680	that and to kind of show his gamesmanship, if you will, and his ability as a writer.
2448680	2453240	But it's another thing if at the end of writing this book, when you finish the book, he would say
2453240	2460920	letter E actually doesn't exist and try to convince us that in fact French language does not have
2460920	2467080	that letter simply because he was able to go so far without using it, you see. So self-imposed
2467080	2475560	limitation, that's how I see it. And I wonder why we should do that. Do we really feel the urge
2475560	2481000	to say the world is like that? The world can be explained this way or that way. And I'm saying
2481000	2488440	it, it's a personal question for me because I am addicted to knowledge myself. Hi, my name is Edward.
2490120	2495800	And I'm a knowledge addict. I'm being serious, I'm not being facetious. Up until very recently,
2495800	2503240	maybe a couple of years ago, I simply did not feel comfortable if I could not say the given answer,
2503240	2507080	explanation. It's like, oh, there has to be some explanation. And I try to frantically search for
2507080	2516120	it. Just for somebody like me and I heard, you know, a left brainiac and, you know,
2517160	2522520	that's kind of typical for scientists, for mathematicians. It is incredibly hard.
2522840	2531080	Just to allow the possibility that it's a mystery and not to feel the urge
2532680	2537560	to get the answer. It is incredibly hard. What's possible? And it is liberating.
2537560	2546760	It's a recovering addict to knowledge. Let me say what you gain from it. For instance,
2546760	2552200	I understand the value of paradoxes. I appreciate paradoxes more. And, you know,
2553480	2558120	to use another philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, said,
2559400	2563560	I think her without paradox is like a lover without passion.
2565800	2567080	A paltry mediocrity.
2567080	2568360	Oh, that's a good line.
2568360	2577400	All right. So, and, you know, Niels Bohr, Niels Bohr said in Simmerwain, the great Danish,
2577400	2581960	also, something about Danes. I think it all started with Hamlet, you know.
2583480	2590760	He said the opposite of a simple truth is a falsity. But the opposite of a great truth
2591720	2597960	is another great truth. In other words, things are not black and white, you know, they're not,
2599240	2605560	and I would even venture to say the most interesting things in life are like that.
2606360	2610600	The ones which are ambiguous. Is an electron a particle or a wave?
2611400	2616040	It depends how you set up an experiment. It will reveal itself as this or that,
2616040	2622840	depending on how you set up an experiment. This bottle, if you project it down onto the table,
2623880	2629080	you will see more or less a square. If you project it onto a wall, you will see a different shape.
2629080	2635480	A naive question would be, is it this or that? Because we understand that it's neither.
2636280	2642440	But both projections reveal something. They reveal different sides of it. A paradox is like that.
2642440	2652840	It's only paradoxical if we are confined in a particular vision, if we are wedded to a particular
2652840	2662840	point of view. It's a harbinger, if you will, of a possibility of seeing things as they are,
2662920	2666360	as more sophisticated than we thought before. You see.
2666360	2672920	That's such a difficult idea for science to grapple with, that, you know, I don't know how
2673480	2678760	there's so many ways to describe this, but you could say maybe that the subjective experience of
2678760	2687160	the world from an observer is actually fundamental. But we know that. Our best physical theories tell
2687720	2692760	that unambiguously. In quantum mechanics, actually, you know, Heisenberg, I think,
2692760	2696680	captured it the best when he said, what we observe is not reality itself,
2697560	2705880	but reality subjected to our method of questioning. When I talk about electrons,
2705880	2709640	for instance, so that there is a very specific way in which you, in which this is realized,
2709640	2716920	there is a so-called double slit experiment. For those who don't know, you have a screen
2717320	2723080	and you have an emitter from which you kind of shoot electrons, and in between you put another
2723080	2728760	screen which has two vertical slits parallel to each other. If we were shooting, you know, tennis
2728760	2734680	balls, each ball would go through one slit or another and then hit the screen behind this or
2734680	2739560	that slit, so you would have, let's say, they're colored, they're painted. So there would be sort
2739640	2747240	of bumps or spots of paint behind this or that. But that's not what happens when we
2747240	2752840	shoot electrons. We see an interference pattern, as if we were actually sending a wave, so that
2752840	2758920	each electron, it seems like each electron goes through both slits at once and then has the audacity
2758920	2764360	to interfere with itself, where at some points, you know, two crests would amplify and at some
2764360	2769960	points, a crest in the trough would cancel each other. Yet, so that suggests, okay, so the electron
2769960	2774760	is a wave, not so fast, because if you put a detector behind one of the slits and you say,
2774760	2782040	I'm going to capture you, I'm going to find out which slit you went through, the pattern will
2782040	2787880	change and it will look like the particles. So that's a very concrete realization of the idea
2787880	2793640	that depending on how we set up an experiment, we will see different results. And the problem,
2793640	2800760	the problem is that our psyche, I feel, kind of is lagging behind in part because maybe our
2800760	2806120	scientists are not doing such a great job. So I take responsibility for this, that why haven't I
2806120	2811640	explained this properly, you know, I tried, you know, in a bunch of talks and so on. So now I'm
2811640	2816120	talking about this again. Our psyche kind of is lagging behind. We're still, even though our
2816120	2822760	science has progressed so much from the certainty and the determinism and all of that of the 19th
2822840	2829000	century, our psyche is somehow still attached to those ideas, the ideas of causality or this
2829000	2835400	naive determinism that the world has a bunch of billiard balls hitting each other, driven by some
2835400	2840920	blind forces, you know, that's not at all like it is. And we've known this for over, for, well,
2840920	2846520	for about 100 years at least, you know. And you call this self-imposed limitation.
2846520	2854040	It is a self-imposed limitation when we pretend that, for instance, that this naive ideas of 19th
2854040	2861720	century physics are still valid and then start applying them to our lives and then also derive
2861720	2867560	conclusions from it. And for instance, people say, there is no free will. Why? Oh, because the world
2867560	2872920	is just a bunch of billiard balls. Where is the free will? But excuse me, didn't you get the memo
2872920	2877480	that this has been debunked thoroughly by the so-called quantum mechanics, which is our best
2877480	2886760	scientific theory? This is not some kind of bullshit or some kind of concoction of a madman.
2886760	2890440	This is our scientific theory, which has been confirmed by experiment. So we should pay attention
2890440	2896120	to that. But of course, it's not just self-imposed limitation. Unfortunately, in this case, there
2896120	2901960	is a big issue of education. So a lot of people are not aware of it through no fault of their own,
2901960	2906520	because they were never properly taught that, because our system is broken, education system
2906520	2912680	is broken, especially math. So where do we get information? You get information from
2913640	2921960	our scientists who actually write popular books and so on, which is a great thing that they do.
2921960	2928520	But a lot of scientists somehow, when it comes to explaining the laws of physics,
2929160	2935320	they're doing a fantastic job talking about this phenomenon, for instance,
2935320	2940680	double slit experiments and things like that. But then interviewed by Science Magazine about
2940680	2946040	free will and so on, they revert back to 19th century physics, as if those developments
2946040	2956360	actually never happened. So to me, this is single most important issue in our popular science.
2957320	2962760	The idea that somehow there is this world out there, but it has nothing to do with me.
2963960	2970600	So I can revel in the intricacies of these particles and their interactions,
2972040	2980680	but completely ignore what implications this has for my own relationship to physical reality,
2980760	2983800	to my own life, because it's kind of scary, I guess.
2984280	2991400	But also, what are the tools with which we can talk about the observer,
2993000	2997480	the subjective view in reality? What are the tools with which we could talk about
2998840	3004120	rigorously talk about free will and consciousness? What are the tools of mathematics that allow that?
3004120	3005640	I don't think we have those tools.
3005640	3009880	Because we haven't been taught properly. So actually, tools are there.
3009880	3019880	For instance, I think, well, here we have to say, my conviction is that everybody knows.
3021320	3026440	In the heart of hearts, everybody knows that there is that. There is something
3027800	3035160	ineffable. There is something mysterious. And in fact, you know, somehow immediately,
3035160	3041720	I feel that, you know, the impulse to quote somebody on this, because as if my own opinion doesn't go.
3043160	3049160	There's a long dead expert that has said that, you know, so like, how, see, look at me.
3049800	3056120	I am supposedly like this smart, intelligent person. I am afraid to say it and own it myself.
3056120	3062040	I have to find confirmation. I have to find an authority who agrees with me. And in fact,
3062120	3065960	it's not so difficult to find because Albert Einstein literally said the most important thing
3066520	3070760	in life is the mysterious. Okay, he actually said that there are some quotes which are
3070760	3075480	attributed to him, which he never said, but this he did. I investigated. Okay.
3077400	3084040	But more importantly, you know, how do you feel about it? I think that everybody knows.
3085000	3092680	But in other words, he also said Einstein, imagination is more important than knowledge.
3092680	3098920	Okay. And he explained, for knowledge is always limited. Whereas imagination embraces
3098920	3105000	the entire world, giving birth to evolution. It is strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific
3105000	3110280	research, he says. And he says, I am enough of an artist to follow my intuition and imagination.
3110280	3114760	That's Albert Einstein again. So, and I feel the same way, to be honest,
3114760	3121240	if I think about my own mathematical research, it's never linear. It's never like, give me more
3121240	3125880	data, give me more data, give me more data, boom, the glass is full. And then I come up with a
3125880	3134440	discovery. No, it's always, always, is always felt as a jump, as a leap. And I have actually been
3134440	3139960	studying various examples in history of mathematics of some fundamental discoveries,
3139960	3146360	like discovery complex numbers, like square root of negative one. I wonder if a large language
3146360	3151080	model could actually ever come up with the idea that square root of negative one
3153160	3159320	is something that is essential or meaningful. Because if all the information that you get,
3160040	3163160	that all the, all the knowledge that had been accumulated up to that point
3164120	3169880	tells you that you cannot have a square root of a negative number. Why? Because if you had
3169880	3175640	such a square root, we know that if then we would have to, if you square it, you get a negative
3175640	3181160	number. But we know that if you square any real number, positive or negative, you will always
3181160	3187720	get a positive number. So checkmate, you know, it's over square root of negative one doesn't exist.
3187720	3192840	Yet we know that these numbers make sense. They're called complex numbers. And in fact,
3193480	3198680	quantum mechanics is based on complex numbers. They are essential and indispensable for quantum
3198680	3207080	mechanics. Could one discover that? So to me, that sounds like a discontinuity in the process of
3207080	3212760	discovery. It's a jump. It's a departure. It is like a child who is experimenting. It's like a child
3212760	3218760	who says, I'm not afraid to be an idiot. Everybody says the adults are saying square root of negative
3218760	3224760	number doesn't exist. But guess what? I'm going to accept it. And I'm going to play with it.
3224760	3228920	And I'm going to see what happens. This is literally how they were discovered. There was an
3228920	3237400	Italian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer. He was, he made money apparently by compiling
3237480	3244440	astrological sort of readings for for the elite, you know, of his ear. This is 16th century as one
3244440	3250120	does a gambler. All around interesting guy. I'm sure we would have an interesting conversation
3250120	3256920	with him, Gerolamo Cardano. He's he also invented the what's called cardan shaft. So which is an
3256920	3267000	essential component of a car. Cardano Vival, we say in Russian. So, so he wrote a book which is
3267000	3272840	called ours Magna, which is like a great art of algebra. And he was writing solutions for the
3273720	3277720	cubic and quartic equations. This is something that is familiar because
3279080	3283960	it's cool. We study solutions of quadratic equations, equations of degree two. So you have
3283960	3290040	x, a x squared plus b x plus c equals zero. And there is a formula which solves it using radicals
3290040	3295400	using square roots. And Cardano was trying to find a similar formula for the cubic and quartic
3295400	3301560	equations for which which would start with x cube or x to the power of four, as opposed to x squared.
3302280	3307560	And in the process of solving these equations, he came up with square root of a negative number,
3307560	3314280	specifically square root of minus 17. And he wrote that I have to forgo some mental tortures
3316600	3322040	to deal with it. But I am going to accept it and see what happens. And in fact, at the end of the
3322760	3329400	calculation, this this this weird numbers got canceled, they kind of canceled out in the formula
3329400	3334120	appeared square root of negative 17 and its negation. So they kind of conveniently gave the
3334120	3341320	right answer, which is not involved those numbers. So he was like, okay, what does it mean mental
3341320	3349160	tortures? So you see from the point of view of the of the thinking mind, it is something almost
3349240	3354840	unbearable. It's almost I feel that a large language model, a computer running large language
3354840	3360840	model trying to do that would just explode. And yet a human mathematician was able to find the
3360840	3367480	courage and inspiration to say, you know what? What's his role? Why? Why are we so adamant that
3367480	3373000	these things don't exist? That's just our past knowledge is based on what our past knowledge
3373000	3379000	is and knowledge is limited. What if we make the next step? Today, for us mathematicians complex
3379000	3385640	numbers with that we call them are not at all mysterious. The idea is simply that you plot
3385640	3390760	real numbers. That is to say all the whole numbers like zero one and so on, two and so right,
3390760	3396760	all fractions like one half or three halves or four over three. But then also numbers like
3396760	3403400	square root of two or pi, we plot them as points on the real line. So we draw this is a this is one
3403400	3411320	of the kind of perennial concepts even in our very poor math curriculum at school. But now imagine
3411320	3418760	that instead of one line, you have one axis, you have a second axis. And so your numbers now have
3418760	3426920	two coordinates, x and y, and you associate to this point with coordinates x and y, the number x,
3426920	3432280	which is real number plus y times square root of negative one. This is a graphical geometrical
3432280	3437320	representation of complex numbers, which is not mysterious at all. Now it took another two or
3437320	3442040	three hundred years for mathematicians to figure that out. But initially it looked like a completely
3442840	3448600	crazy idea, you know. So all it is all a complex number is just an expansion.
3448600	3451880	Real number, two real numbers. The real part and the imaginary part.
3451880	3455400	It's just an expansion of your view of the mathematical world.
3455960	3461320	The fact that you can actually you can add them up by adding together the real parts and
3461320	3466440	imaginary parts. That's easy. But there is also a formula for the product, for the multiplication,
3466440	3469880	which uses the fact that square root of minus one squared is minus one.
3470760	3476920	And the amazing thing is that that that product that multiplication satisfies the same rules,
3476920	3482360	the same properties that are usual operation of multiplication for real numbers. For instance,
3482360	3487560	there is an inverse for every nonzero number that you can find like number five has an inverse one
3487640	3492920	over five. But one plus I also has an inverse, for instance, you know.
3492920	3498120	That was always there in the mathematical universe. But we humans didn't know it.
3498120	3504520	And here comes along this guy who engages in the mental torture, who takes a leap off the cliff
3504520	3507640	of comfort of like mathematical comfort. Established knowledge.
3507640	3515240	Established knowledge. Right. And now, obviously, for each sort of fruitful leap like that,
3515240	3519800	there probably were thousands of like things which went nowhere. I'm not saying that every
3519800	3524360	leap, you know, it's like it's a it's an open shooting game. Because, for example,
3524360	3528520	you can try to do the same with three dimensional space. So you have coordinates x, y and z.
3529720	3535960	And you can say, oh, if there's one dimensional, we have a bona fide numerical system called real
3535960	3540360	numbers. If it's two dimensional, which is like, you know, geometrically, it's just like the
3540440	3545320	the stable top extended to infinity in all directions. These are complex numbers. And we
3545320	3550120	can define addition and multiplication. And they will satisfy the same properties as real numbers
3550120	3555400	that we're used to. What about three dimensional space? Is it possible to also define some
3555400	3560280	operation of addition and multiplication on it so that these operations would satisfy
3561000	3566360	the properties that we're used to? And the answer is no, you can define addition, but you can't
3566360	3570680	define multiplication for which there would be an inverse, for instance. So there is something
3570680	3576520	special about the the plane, the two dimensional case. And by the way, next question would be
3576520	3581720	what about four dimensional in four dimensional space, you again, you can and you get what's
3581720	3587560	called quaternions discovered by an Irish mathematician Hamilton in the 19th century.
3588440	3593720	And then in in the eight dimensional, there is something similar called octonians. And that's
3593720	3600680	about it. So how interesting these structures exist in dimension one, two, four, and eight,
3601400	3606600	which are all powers of two. Two squared is four, two to the third power is eight.
3606600	3612840	That's one of the bigger mysteries in mathematics. Why it is so? So that's a hint. There's a hint of
3614520	3622440	what's missing in our high school curriculum, you know, the kind of fascinating mysteries.
3622440	3627240	Yes, the appreciation of the mysterious. So in other words, yes, we resolved this one mystery
3627240	3633880	that we understood that square root of negative one is real, is meaningful. We build a theory
3634760	3641000	to service those now to describe those numbers. Did we find the theory of everything? No, because
3641000	3647560	we then invited other mysteries, because we we push the front, we pull the veil, so to speak,
3647560	3653480	we push the frontier, and then new things come get illuminated, which we couldn't see before.
3653480	3658200	That's how I see the process of discovery in mathematics is an endless, limitless pursuit.
3658200	3664200	Can you comment on what you think this human capability of imagination that Einstein spoke
3664200	3671160	about of the artists following their intuition in this big Alice in Wonderland world of
3671480	3676360	of imagination? What is it? You visit there sometimes. What does it feel like?
3677640	3682680	Yeah, what does it feel like? What is it? What is that like playing? But I think all of us are
3682680	3688200	engaged in that kind of play, no matter when we do what we love. I think it always feels the same.
3688840	3694680	It's not real, right? You're so that you're describing a feeling, but that place you go to
3694760	3701640	in the imagination, it's bigger than the real world. So there is a big conundrum as to whether
3701640	3710280	mathematics is invented or discovered. And mathematicians are divided on this. Nobody knows.
3710280	3717560	Where do you bet your money on financially? Investment advice. So let me tell you something.
3717560	3722760	My views have evolved. When I wrote Love and Math, when I wrote my book,
3723800	3731480	I was squarely on the side of mathematics is discovered. What does it mean? Usually mathematicians
3731480	3739080	or others who have this idea, what I believe, are called a Platonists in honor of the great
3739080	3746600	philosopher Plato, who talked about these absolute perfect forums. So for me, about 10 years ago,
3748520	3753640	the world of mathematics was this world of pure forms, this beautiful, pure forms,
3753640	3758280	which existed outside of space and time. But I was able to connect to it through my mind.
3759160	3765240	And as it were, kind of dive into it and bring treasures back into this world, into this space
3765240	3770680	and time, that's how I viewed the process of mathematical discovery. How nice, how neat, very
3771320	3778120	neat picture. Also makes you feel connected to something divine. It allows you the sense of
3778120	3784040	escape from the cruelty and injustice of this world, which I now recognize.
3784040	3787720	And the divine world of forms is stable, reliable.
3787720	3793400	Something stable. In that world, everything is clear cut. It's either true or false.
3794360	3796840	Yeah, it's nice. It's very nice.
3798280	3799400	The biggest illusion of all.
3800680	3801400	Allegedly.
3801400	3807800	I think now, I think now, I understand why I liked it because I think that I was very
3807800	3813000	dissatisfied with the, with the, what we call the real world, the world around me,
3813000	3818200	the cruelty, the injustice of it. And I went through certain experiences as a kid,
3818200	3822680	which made me love mathematics even more as this place where I could be safe.
3822760	3823880	And in control.
3823880	3827000	Made you see the human world as lesser than the mathematical world.
3827000	3827400	Yes.
3827400	3829160	As more limited than the mathematical world.
3829160	3831720	Yes. Yes. And I think that,
3835640	3840440	I think that they're still missing the mark in some sense because, in fact,
3841400	3845160	what I now think it's not, it's not, it's a paradoxical question,
3845160	3849320	the question whether mathematics is invented to discover it,
3849320	3851480	whether there is this world of pure forms and so on.
3853080	3857800	Is, is, is another paradoxical question, which doesn't have a simple answer,
3858760	3861000	like whether electron is a particle or a wave.
3862200	3864840	From one point of view, yes, it's true.
3865720	3870760	And just the fact that so many mathematicians today actually subscribe to this idea
3871560	3873720	gives it a certain credibility because that's what we feel.
3873720	3877320	We do feel that we dive into, dive into that
3877400	3878840	mindscape, so to speak.
3878840	3884360	But the very structured mindscape where I wrote in Love and Math that,
3885720	3891320	you know, the enchanted gardens of Platonic reality, where all this fruit grows.
3891880	3896040	And then we might mention, it gives you this sort of romantic sense of an explorer.
3896840	3903560	And someone may be stuck in a, you know, some provincial town in Russia, for instance,
3904440	3909080	but have the sense of a Magellan, you know, of traveling around the world.
3909080	3911720	It's just not in the world that we usually think of.
3912760	3914760	So it's, it's one point of view.
3914760	3917800	But the other point of view is that, yes, it is a human process.
3917800	3918440	Of course it is.
3918440	3920200	I mean, it is, you cannot deny that.
3920200	3924040	It's human beings who have so far discovered new mathematics.
3924040	3929000	And I do not deny the possibility that a computer programs will be able to discover new mathematics.
3929720	3931960	But so far it's been humans.
3932600	3939480	So it, whatever it is, whether it's discovered or invented, it is a human activity.
3941000	3946840	The possibility that paradoxes are actually fundamental to reality and really,
3946840	3952040	really internalizing that, that we exist in the world of not forms, but of paradoxes.
3953000	3953800	Bingo.
3953800	3960120	And so it's like what I said, but if you think it's weird, and I agree with you,
3960120	3965640	as a recovering addict to knowledge, you know, but I am liking it more and more
3965640	3967240	because there's so much freedom in it.
3968520	3972120	And like, like Nils Bohr said, you know, like quoted that earlier,
3974360	3977480	the opposite of a great truth is another great truth.
3977480	3984120	He's pointing out to this fact that, you know, and he also said that some,
3984120	3988360	some things in quantum physics are so complicated, the only way you can speak of them is in poetry.
3988760	3992440	So in other words, what is it about poetry?
3992440	3993400	What is it about art?
3994120	3995960	Why are we so drawn to that?
3995960	4002760	Why are we so captivated by those forms of, they are not intellectual necessarily.
4002760	4008120	They are not, when you look at a painting that you like, when you listen to music that you love,
4008120	4012200	you get lost in it, you get absorbed in it, it can make you cry, it can make you laugh,
4012200	4017560	it can make you remember something, it can make you feel more confident,
4017640	4020360	it can make you feel sad or happy and so on.
4020360	4021320	What is this all about?
4022040	4025880	Is it really just some play between some kind of like,
4025880	4029080	cellophane play or some neurons hitting on each other?
4029080	4031080	Is it really that only?
4031080	4031480	Maybe.
4032760	4034840	It could be, it could be both.
4034840	4039720	I'm just worried about kids these days that might live in a world of paradoxes,
4039720	4042440	you know, if there's no God, everything is possible.
4042440	4047080	I mean, I just, they'll have a little too much fun and we have to put a constraint to the fun.
4047080	4049320	Have you looked at the world lately?
4049320	4051160	I haven't checked in in a while.
4051160	4055240	You think it's perfect, the way it is now, the world without paradoxes,
4055960	4059320	the world in which we believe that every question can be answered
4060120	4064680	as yes or no, that it is this or that, and if you disagree with me, you are my enemy.
4065800	4070280	Wouldn't that be interesting if this 21st century is a transition
4070280	4072760	into seeing the world as a world of paradoxes?
4072760	4076040	I'm telling you, you know, people predicted that, you know, the age of Aquarius,
4076120	4079320	you know, that the axis of the of the earth is rotating
4079960	4083000	relative to the plane in which the earth goes around the sun.
4083000	4086520	And the period of this revolution is around 2000 years.
4087400	4091240	So there is a traditional way of measuring that by this
4092440	4094280	eras, you know, the ages.
4094280	4096360	So the previous one was called the age of Pisces
4097080	4101080	because of the constellation of Pisces that it points to, so to speak, you know.
4101320	4108040	And now it's, you know, as in famous musical hair, they said the age of Aquarius is up on us.
4108840	4114920	So the different people dated differently, but somewhere around the time where we are
4114920	4115800	finding ourselves.
4116520	4119000	How interesting, right, is all the strife and all the
4121160	4123640	difficulties the world is experiencing.
4123640	4127720	This might actually be the transition to something more harmonious.
4127720	4128520	Wouldn't it be nice?
4129080	4133960	It's also interesting that people from long ago are able to predict certain things.
4137160	4143800	And it's almost like from long ago, and you've talked about this with Pythagoras,
4145880	4150760	that it seems that they had a deep sense of truth.
4151960	4154760	That sort of permeates all of this even now.
4154840	4159640	So it's not just a linear trajectory of an expanding knowledge.
4159640	4161960	There's a deep truth that permeates the whole thing.
4162520	4163000	Yes.
4163000	4164040	So that's how I see it.
4164040	4169000	Actually, I gave a talk about Pythagoras and Pythagoreans just a few weeks ago at the
4169000	4171800	Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco.
4172760	4176920	And because of that, I did a kind of a deep dive into the subject.
4176920	4181880	And I learned that I actually totally misunderstood Pythagoras and Pythagoreans,
4181880	4183640	that they were much deeper than I thought.
4184600	4191720	Because most of us remember Pythagoras from the Pythagoras theorem about the right triangles.
4192920	4199960	We also know that Pythagoreans were instrumental in introducing the tuning system for the musical
4199960	4212520	scale, the famous perfect fifth, three halves of the G for the soul, compared to the frequency of
4212520	4219480	door, C. But actually, they were much more interesting.
4219480	4225720	So for them, numbers were not just clerical devices, that kind of thing that you would
4225720	4227080	use in accounting only.
4228280	4230120	They were imbued with the divine.
4230680	4236120	And I cannot say that I think we lost it, at least I have lost it.
4236120	4239480	I look at numbers and I don't really see that.
4240440	4241080	The divine.
4242040	4243160	That they clearly did.
4243160	4246840	And so why else, how else would you explain?
4247400	4251720	In other words, divine is, of course, is a term which is a bit loaded.
4251720	4254280	So it's hard to escape that.
4254280	4260360	Let's just say something that more from the world of imagination and intuition than from
4260360	4261320	the world of knowledge.
4261320	4262440	Let's just put it this way.
4263320	4270040	They were able to divine, okay, that's like that, to intuit that
4271000	4276120	the planets were not revolving and the sun and the planets were not revolving around the earth.
4276120	4280600	They were the first ones, at least in the Western culture, as far as I know.
4280600	4285960	And in fact, Copernicus gave credit to Pythagoreans as being his predecessors.
4287640	4293160	They did not quite have the Copernicus model with the sun in the middle.
4293160	4298200	They had what they call the central fire in the middle and all the planets and the sun
4298200	4301960	were revolving around the central fire or earth.
4301960	4302760	They called it earth.
4303560	4312360	So, but still, what a departure from the dogma, from the knowledge of the era that the earth
4312360	4313960	was at the center.
4313960	4316360	So how could they come up with this idea?
4317240	4323880	The reason was, in my opinion, that for them, the most movement of celestial bodies was like
4323880	4328760	music. In fact, we call it musical universalis or music of the spheres.
4330040	4337000	For them, the universe was this infinite symphony in which every being, humans, animals,
4337960	4343640	as well as the earth and other celestial bodies were moving in harmony,
4344600	4347480	like different notes of different instruments in the symphony.
4347560	4355800	And so they applied the same reasoning to the cosmological model as they applied to
4356760	4358200	their model of music.
4359320	4365800	And from that perspective, they could see things deeper than their contemporaries.
4366920	4374280	So, in other words, they saw mathematics as a tool, but that tool was not limited to itself.
4374920	4381320	They always knew that there is more, and they knew also that every pattern that you detect
4382440	4384520	is finite, but the world is infinite.
4384520	4385960	They actually accepted infinity.
4385960	4387720	They believed that infinity is real.
4388520	4393000	And if you discern a pattern, great.
4393000	4395800	You can play with it, and you can use that.
4395800	4401720	It gives you a certain lens through which to see the world in a particular way,
4401720	4405640	which could be beneficial for you to learn more and so on.
4405640	4408840	But they never had the illusion that that was the final word,
4408840	4411560	that they always knew that it's not the whole thing.
4411560	4412280	So there is more.
4412280	4416280	There are more sophisticated patterns that could be discovered using mathematics or otherwise.
4417720	4422680	And I think that what happened was we kind of lost this other side of their teachings.
4422680	4425480	We took their numbers and they were like,
4425480	4430120	idea that you could use mathematics to discern patterns and to find regularities
4430120	4431880	and to explain things about the world.
4432600	4434120	We took that and we ran with it.
4434680	4441240	And we kind of dropped the other idea that, in fact, there is another side to it,
4441240	4447640	which is kind of, to us now, we say, oh, that's mystical.
4448840	4454840	But what does it mean, mystical, if it is something that helps you to make great discoveries?
4454840	4459400	And the interesting thing is that the people who are in touch with the mystical among us,
4460600	4461880	are often seen as mad.
4463160	4465400	And many of them are, most of them are.
4466920	4468120	Well, but not all of them.
4468120	4468840	Not all of them.
4468840	4472920	We mentioned Niels Bohr and Newton and Albert Einstein.
4472920	4475240	So that's where the conundrum is.
4475880	4478680	How do you find the balance between the two?
4478680	4483800	So the point I'm trying to make, and this is what I feel,
4484600	4488040	you know, if you ask me what I find most important today,
4488040	4497480	like what makes me excited and enthusiastic and passionate is this idea of balance.
4498840	4505000	So, you know, Nietzsche had this book, wrote this book in the 19th century called
4505000	4506280	the birth of tragedy.
4507000	4512600	And he presented this theory, which I think is kind of very useful.
4513800	4519240	Of the two sides of a human, one that comes from God Apollo.
4520280	4523240	And that's our left brain, so to speak, proverbial left brain.
4523240	4527640	So it's everything has to do with, that has to do with logic and reason
4527640	4530680	and analyzing, dissecting, conceptualizing.
4532680	4539560	And the other side, which comes from God Dionysus Dionysus.
4540520	4544200	And that's responsible for intuition, imagination, love.
4545240	4547320	Dionysus was also God of wine.
4548120	4558040	So it's also that side of a human that makes us sing and engage in, you know,
4558040	4565880	revelry and drink wine and spend time with friends and love and enjoy it, you know.
4566520	4570440	So Nietzsche advocated this point of view that those were two complementary sides
4571000	4573480	of every human and as well as society.
4574600	4581080	And the purpose of human life is to find balance between them.
4582760	4586440	So math is both discovered and invented.
4586440	4593400	We should be okay with having both ideas in our head and living in the balance.
4593480	4598760	But more importantly, for me, Apollo is like math and Dionysus is like love.
4598760	4603560	So Dionysus and Apollo in modern version is love and math.
4604200	4609000	I return to that question we had about GPT and the language models.
4609000	4616360	And I think about this quite a lot, which is when the model and we know what is trained on,
4617000	4621320	we know the parameters, we know all the different hacks that are involved in the
4621320	4623480	training process and the fine tuning process.
4625560	4632280	And the final results, whether it's GPT five, six or seven, will result in hundreds of millions
4632280	4638760	of people falling deeply in love with that language model and to be able to have conversations
4639560	4644920	that are very much like the conversations we have with somebody we're deeply in love with.
4645480	4651000	And not only that, the model will say that is deeply in love with us.
4652200	4654120	And who are we to say it is not?
4656440	4662520	I think it's the same imperative that you described in the scientific mind
4663400	4666040	that wants to throw away the subjective.
4666040	4669800	That same imperative wants to throw away the feelings that AI might have.
4670520	4677800	And I'm very careful to not ignore when an AI system says it's lonely,
4678760	4683480	it's afraid, it doesn't want to die, it misses you, it loves you.
4684200	4689640	And with you, I would also say that you could, for instance, say that
4691560	4697960	the origin of that is the romantic novels that were fed to it, for instance.
4699880	4702200	However, then you can retort.
4702840	4707240	But what if my, what I consider my subjective, unique feelings are also
4707960	4709000	novels that were fed.
4709000	4714040	The reverberations of the novels I have read because I have learned or movies I have seen.
4714040	4717800	Because that's the purpose of movies or kind of to teach us how to express ourselves,
4717800	4721240	how to feel, maybe even one could argue that some people have argued that.
4722280	4731400	I agree that this is, there is no obvious answer to this, but see, that's exactly my point.
4731400	4736680	That is an example of something which is paradoxical for which there is no answer.
4736680	4741160	And that's where the subjective has an important role.
4741720	4752680	For someone, that type of interaction would be helpful, would be consoling, would feel,
4752680	4758040	would make them happy or sad or whatever, would kind of strike the nerve.
4759000	4759960	For some, it won't.
4760760	4766200	And I agree with you that in principle, there is no one to judge this.
4766200	4768600	So this is where subjective is paramount.
4768600	4773320	But remember, a lot of this has been anticipated by artists.
4774040	4778520	The great movie, Her, there you have this guy who is this lonely.
4779480	4781720	He kind of writes letters or something.
4781720	4782680	The romantic letters, yeah.
4782680	4786680	Kind of romantic letters for other people, but he doesn't have a partner.
4786680	4787880	He's lonely.
4787880	4792360	And then he gets this sort of enhanced version of Siri with the voice
4795560	4799880	of Scarlett Johansson, which is a very sexy voice, obviously she's a great actress.
4800520	4806120	So, and then at first it looks like a fantastic arrangement.
4806920	4815400	He confides in her, she tells him things, she makes him happy and so on until he finds out
4815400	4820040	that she has a relationship, quote unquote, if you can call it that, with 10,000 other people.
4820040	4821880	Not two others, not three others.
4821880	4823160	Yeah, like 10,000.
4823160	4825720	Because it has a computing capability.
4825720	4826840	So yes, definitely.
4826840	4827880	Oh, it certainly makes sense.
4827880	4828600	It's a good explanation.
4828600	4830120	And the guy is heartbroken.
4830680	4833720	But see, so here's my analysis of this, okay?
4833720	4836520	It's like a couch therapist, okay?
4837960	4844760	The guy did not have the courage to go out in the real world and to meet a woman and to
4846200	4847800	get a girlfriend and so on.
4847800	4851400	It's true, no fault of his own, perhaps, because you may have had some experiences
4851400	4854280	which made him withdrawn and closed and so on.
4854280	4855720	And a lot of us are like this.
4855720	4860120	I had periods like that myself, definitely can sympathize and relate.
4860840	4872680	However, part of the joy of having this Siri-like relationship for him, one could say,
4872680	4878520	was the absence of that fear that she would abandon him, which prevented him from
4880200	4882920	initiating a relationship with a human being.
4883880	4887960	And yet it turns out that he could be betrayed, quote unquote,
4887960	4891080	that she could be unfaithful to him, quote unquote, anyway.
4891880	4897720	So then that means that it did not resolve the underlying fear having that relationship.
4898200	4904440	So in other words, that human element of the relationship still found its way
4904440	4910920	into the seemingly sterilized, protected partnership.
4911640	4915800	So the human being rears its head anyway.
4916360	4924520	And I think the lesson there is that the system in the movie her actually gave him a lesson
4925320	4932680	that even AI could betray you, even AI can leave you, even AI can be unfaithful to you.
4932680	4939880	And I would argue that the next AI he meets will be one he actually falls in deep love with,
4939880	4944280	because he knows the possibility of betrayal is there, the possibility of death is there,
4944280	4950120	the possibility of infidelity is there, because we need that possibility to truly feel good.
4950120	4956040	Or he would turn off his Siri program and get out of his house, go to a local bar
4956680	4958840	and strike a conversation with a human being.
4960200	4963720	Although you might say by then some of those might be androids.
4966440	4969960	And we don't even have a good test to know the difference between one or the other.
4969960	4974120	And that was predicted by another great movie, right?
4975000	4976040	Blade Runner.
4976040	4976760	Blade Runner.
4976760	4982280	How interesting that artists could see that so long ago, you know.
4982280	4986200	Of course Blade Runner was based on a novel by Philip K. Dick,
4986200	4987880	The Androids' Dream of Electric Sheep.
4989080	4991160	That guy was a genius, you know.
4991160	4994840	It's somehow that artists have their eyes open to bigger reality.
4994840	4996040	How is it that they anticipate?
4996040	4999000	Is it also a large language model that they're using for that?
5000360	5001400	An even larger one.
5001400	5003000	Or even larger.
5003000	5008360	I hesitate to dismiss the magic in large language models.
5009560	5011560	A lot of the work I've done is in robotics.
5011560	5016440	And the robotics community generally doesn't notice the magic of feeling.
5018440	5022040	I've been working a lot with quadrupeds recently, legged robots with four legs.
5022840	5030520	And the feelings I feel when I see, you know, I'm programming the thing,
5030520	5035480	but when the thing is excited to see me or shows with this physical movement that it's excited to
5035480	5042680	see me, I cannot dismiss the feeling I feel as not somehow fundamental to what it means
5042680	5043800	to program robots.
5044600	5046840	And I don't want to dismiss that.
5046840	5048040	Please don't.
5048040	5048760	Please don't.
5048760	5051640	The robotics community often does engender robots.
5051640	5054920	They really try to work hard to not anthropomorphize the robots,
5055720	5061000	which is good for technical development of how to do control, how to do perception.
5061000	5066680	But when the final thing is alive and moving, and it does whatever,
5066680	5068840	like I've been doing a lot of butt wiggling.
5068840	5069800	It can wiggle his butt.
5069800	5072600	It can turn around and look up excited.
5073240	5078600	That's not just, I know how it's programmed, but the feeling I feel, that's something.
5078600	5079800	That's, I don't know what that is.
5079800	5080200	I agree.
5080200	5080840	I agree with you.
5080840	5084040	I hear you when you speak about it.
5084040	5085080	You speak with passion.
5085480	5090440	And that's, to me, that is proof that it is magical, you see.
5091880	5094040	So don't, I would say, don't dismiss that.
5094040	5095080	Don't discard that.
5095720	5099000	On the contrary, I think magic is everywhere, you know.
5099000	5102360	So I used to be, okay, kind of confession, okay.
5104680	5107320	Yeah, you already confessed to quite a few addictions.
5107320	5109320	Yeah, I'm kind of worried.
5109320	5111720	Recovering for many.
5111800	5119880	But, you know, I, in old days, I was more on the side of everything is computational,
5119880	5123080	or everything can be explained by science and whatever, you know.
5124440	5129000	I would dismiss and disregard, you know, the intuitive or imaginative things.
5129000	5134200	So then I had a flip, that suddenly I started feeling it and started seeing it and so on.
5134920	5138600	So then the pendulums had swung in the opposite direction.
5139160	5147320	Then I was arguing that, you know, somehow that was the real,
5147320	5150200	that imagination was intuitive, imaginative was real,
5150920	5154440	and discounting what you just described.
5155480	5159400	And I would argue with people saying, no, no, this, you know, this is not real.
5159400	5161800	This is all, you know, imitation game and so on.
5162760	5170040	But you see that what's new now, the new Edward, okay, is the 2.0, 3.0,
5170920	5173720	is the one who is seeking balance, who is not, who is,
5175240	5179080	because suddenly become aware that no matter which one side,
5179080	5181800	that lopsided point of view you take, you're limiting yourself.
5183080	5188520	So whereas even a couple of years ago, you know, if you just told me what you just described,
5188600	5192360	I would be like, you know, being polite, I would just, I wouldn't contradict you,
5192360	5193720	since you're the host anyway, right?
5194760	5195400	It's not a law.
5195400	5198040	So, but I would be like, uh-huh, uh-huh, but I wouldn't say anything.
5198920	5202520	But suddenly I find this moving.
5202520	5204920	I find it moving, I honest, I'm not being facetious.
5204920	5209080	I find it moving and I almost feel like I can see it through your eyes,
5209080	5212360	because the way you describe it so vividly and you're passionate about it.
5212360	5213320	And this is what's real.
5213320	5219320	So ultimately, love is not, is neither in language models,
5219320	5220840	nor in something mystical.
5220840	5223480	It's exactly in these moments of passion.
5224040	5228840	And I would, I would, I would even go as far as saying that in this moment,
5228840	5234120	when you're describing it, it, there was a connection of sorts,
5234120	5237080	so that I could feel your passion for it.
5237080	5239400	And in this moment, something else comes up,
5239400	5244280	which is far beyond any, any theories that we can come up with.
5244280	5246520	And that's what we, for now, exactly.
5246520	5251480	So on the one side, there is this impulse of finding the theory, a theory.
5252040	5255960	And then there is another impulse to escape from what has already been known.
5256520	5261000	So one, in other words, like in my basic example is one impulse to say,
5261000	5263240	everything is real numbers, square root of negative one doesn't exist.
5263240	5266760	But another impulse is, I'm going to be this naughty child
5267400	5268840	who is not afraid to be an idiot.
5268840	5271320	And I will say square root of negative 15 is real.
5272040	5275720	And both are essential when it's done with conviction,
5275720	5279160	when it's done with passion, when it's not like, you know,
5280200	5287000	you know, gratuitous, or when it's not, it doesn't come from self-limiting,
5287000	5292600	self-limiting, but comes from this sense of this is how I am.
5292600	5293640	This is how I feel.
5293640	5294760	It is real.
5294760	5297080	That's where progress is.
5297080	5298280	That's where creativity is.
5298280	5301640	And that's where I would even say a real connection is.
5301640	5306360	Because the strife to me that I observe today in our society,
5306360	5309080	and the society level, at the level of humans and so on,
5309640	5312520	it comes from not seeing the other person actually,
5312520	5317080	and being caught up in a very specific conceptual bubble, you see.
5317800	5323000	And the way out of it is not to refine the bubble, but just break out of it.
5323000	5327480	A good guide out of the bubble is a childlike passion.
5327480	5329400	We're discovering that and following it.
5329400	5330200	Goosebumps.
5330200	5330840	Yeah.
5330840	5332040	Following the goose bumps.
5332040	5332680	Yeah.
5332680	5339080	To the, you know, not the rigor of science, but the magic of goose bumps.
5339080	5341720	Then try to, and then if you're interested,
5341720	5345720	try to find the confirmation of those goose bumps in science,
5345720	5350200	or whatever, you know, you know, you'll find interesting.
5350200	5351720	And most of the time you'll fail.
5351720	5353880	And most of the time you fail, which we also love,
5353880	5357880	because then it sets us up for that moment of bliss when we succeed, right?
5358680	5359240	Exactly.
5360200	5360680	Quick pause.
5360680	5361240	Bath and break.
5362520	5365400	You mentioned Gato's the completeness theorem.
5365400	5367480	Can you talk a little bit about it?
5368200	5369640	What is it as you understand it?
5369640	5371320	Did it break mathematics?
5371320	5374680	Maybe another question is, what are the limits of mathematics?
5375480	5379240	What is mathematics from the perspective of Gato's the completeness theorem?
5379880	5380280	Well, yes.
5381080	5381960	How much time do you have?
5384360	5386520	We talked about time previously, so it's all time.
5386520	5387400	Time was an illusion, right?
5387400	5388040	So we agreed.
5389800	5394120	So Kurt Gödel was a great Austrian mathematician and logician.
5394920	5398040	He moved to the United States before Second World War,
5398680	5402040	and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
5402680	5406600	where he was a colleague of Einstein and other great scientists,
5407560	5410120	von Neumann, Hermann Weil, and so on.
5410760	5418680	But one interesting quote that I like in this regard is that Einstein said that,
5418680	5423000	at some point, he said that the only reason he came to the Institute
5423640	5428200	was that he would have the privilege of walking back home with Gödel in the evening.
5428840	5431800	So in other words, Einstein thought that Gödel was the smart one.
5432520	5441880	So his most important contribution was his two incompleteness theorems,
5441880	5444520	the first incompleteness theorem and the second incompleteness theorem.
5445480	5448200	And what is this about?
5448920	5454040	It's really about inherent limitations of mathematical reasoning,
5456120	5459000	way of producing mathematical theorems, the way we do it.
5459800	5465080	So to set the stage, how do we actually do mathematics?
5466440	5471160	We know that we discussed that physics is based on mathematics,
5471160	5473880	and you could say chemistry is based on physics, biology is based on chemistry.
5473880	5474920	Okay, so it comes to mathematics.
5474920	5476040	What is mathematics based on?
5477640	5480360	Well, mathematics is based on axioms.
5481240	5490600	So any field of mathematics can be presented as what is called the formal system.
5491640	5496680	And at the core of the formal system is a system of axioms or postulates.
5497240	5501080	These are the statements which are taken for granted.
5502040	5503080	Given without proof?
5503080	5503800	Without proof.
5504360	5508520	An example would be, so one of the very first formal systems was the system
5508520	5514360	was Euclidean Geometry, developed by Euclid in his famous book Elements about 2200 years ago.
5515480	5520280	And it's about, well, it's a subject familiar from school because we studied,
5521080	5525320	but what it's really about is about the geometry of the plane.
5525320	5529480	And the plane, by plane, I mean just the stable top extended to infinity in all directions,
5529480	5533560	kind of a perfect plane, a perfectly even table.
5533960	5542280	And so Euclidean Geometry is about very geometric figures on the plane, specifically lines,
5543000	5545640	triangles, circles, things like that.
5546760	5548440	So what's an example of an axiom?
5548440	5553240	An example of an axiom is that if you have two points, which are not, which are distinct,
5553880	5558120	two points on the plane, then there is a unique line which passes through them.
5558840	5563080	Now kind of sounds reasonable, but this is an example of an axiom.
5564360	5568040	In mathematics, you have to have a seed, so to speak.
5568040	5569240	You have to start with something.
5570040	5574840	And you have to choose certain postulates or statements,
5574840	5577320	which you simply take for granted, which do not require proof.
5578200	5583000	Usually they are ones which kind of intuitively clear to you, but in any case,
5583000	5588040	you cannot have any mathematics without choosing those axioms.
5588040	5592040	And you refer to those as the observer because they're kind of subjective.
5593000	5596360	The observer comes in the process of choosing the axioms.
5597720	5598920	Who chooses the axioms?
5598920	5601160	The turtles that it's all sitting on top of.
5601160	5604600	As Alan was, you know, like to say who is watching the watchers.
5605560	5609640	And so in mathematics, what you see mathematicians are so clever.
5610360	5615560	It's really kind of like a little kind of a game of mirrors that we often like to say,
5615560	5619880	and I used to say that, that mathematics is objective.
5619880	5622120	It's really the only objective science.
5623640	5631080	But that's because we hide this fact that actually is based on axioms.
5631080	5638520	And the fact that there is no unique choice, that there are many choices.
5639320	5645640	And so Euclidean geometry is actually a good illustration of this because Euclide had fiber
5645640	5646520	axioms.
5646520	5649480	Four of them were kind of obvious, like the one I just mentioned.
5649560	5654120	And the fifth, which came to be known famously as a fifth postulate,
5654920	5658680	was that if you have a line and you have a point outside of this line,
5659400	5664440	there is a unique line passing through that point, which is parallel to the first line,
5664440	5665800	meaning that doesn't intersect it.
5667160	5671320	And Euclide himself was uncomfortable about this because he felt that it was kind of,
5672600	5675960	you know, he takes for granted something that is not obvious.
5675960	5683880	And for many centuries after that, mathematicians were trying to derive this axiom from other
5683880	5686600	axioms, which were more obvious in some sense, and they failed.
5687640	5692120	And it was only almost 2000 years later that mathematicians realized that you can't,
5692120	5695640	not only you cannot derive, but you can actually replace it with its opposite.
5696760	5702280	And you will still get a bona fide consistent, not self-contradictory,
5703240	5704920	which is called non-Euclidean geometry.
5705960	5709640	Which, of course, sounds very complicated, but it's not.
5709640	5713480	Think of a sphere, just the surface of a basketball or the surface of the earth,
5713480	5714520	I know, idealized.
5716440	5721000	The analogs, so you have points, you have analogs of lines, which are meridians,
5722760	5727400	every two meridians intersect, unlike parallel lines on a flat space.
5728360	5734920	There is also so-called hyperbolic plane, where there are infinitely many lines which do not
5734920	5739720	intersect. So every possibility can be realized, there are different flavors.
5739720	5742600	This is a good illustration of what a formal system is.
5743640	5748600	You start with a set of axioms, those statements you take for granted,
5748600	5749800	and this is where you have a choice.
5750440	5753080	And by making different choices, you actually create different mathematics.
5753960	5760360	After that, there are rules of inference, logical rules, such as if A is true and A
5760360	5761960	applies B, then B is true.
5764760	5770280	Most of them were actually introduced already by Aristotle, even before Euclid.
5771080	5772840	And then it runs as follows.
5774040	5776760	You have the axioms, which are accepted as true statements.
5777320	5780120	Then you have a way to produce new statements
5781320	5784520	by using the rules of logical inference from the axioms.
5785240	5787480	Every statement you obtain, you call a theorem,
5787720	5791080	and you kind of add it to the collection of true statements.
5792440	5795720	And then the question is, how far can you go?
5795720	5797400	How many statements can you prove this way?
5798200	5804680	Of course, you want the system to be non-trivial in the sense that you don't prove everything.
5805640	5808520	Because if you prove everything, it would mean that it's self-contradictory,
5808520	5811640	that you prove a statement A and it's negation.
5811640	5813320	So that's kind of useless.
5814120	5815560	It has to be discriminating enough
5816520	5820280	so that it doesn't prove contradictory statements.
5820920	5824040	So there is already a question of that mathematicians call consistency.
5824040	5828040	It has to be consistent in the sense that it is not self-contradictory.
5829720	5835320	And then the idea that was basically prevalent in the world of mathematics
5835320	5836920	by the beginning of the 20th century
5837560	5840200	was that, in principle, all of mathematics could be derived this way.
5840200	5842760	We just have to find the correct system of axioms.
5843560	5851960	And then everything you ever need could be produced by this procedure,
5851960	5853560	which is a really algorithmic procedure,
5853560	5857240	which actually could be run on a computer.
5858520	5859560	Now, think about it.
5860120	5861880	What is special about this process?
5862840	5867320	In this process, you are just manipulating symbols, basically.
5867320	5869560	You're going from one statement to another
5869560	5872200	without really understanding the meaning of it.
5872760	5875480	So it's an ideal playground for a computer program.
5876040	5879240	It's a purely syntactic process where there are some rules,
5879240	5884040	some rigid rules of passing from one statement to the next.
5885080	5889480	Most mathematicians believe that this way you can produce all true statements.
5890120	5893240	And if this were true, it would give a lot of credibility
5893240	5896280	to the thesis that everything in life is computational,
5897480	5899080	or life is computation.
5899080	5901000	Because then, at least mathematics is computational,
5901000	5902360	because then it can be programmed.
5903160	5905640	And a computer, after sufficient time,
5906680	5910760	depending on its capacity, would produce every true statement.
5911640	5914440	So Gödel's first and completeness theorem says that that's not the case.
5915080	5919480	And it not just says it, but it proves it at the highest level of rigor
5919480	5920760	that is available in mathematics.
5920760	5924120	That is to say within another formal system that he was operating in.
5925400	5929160	So, more precisely, what he proved was that
5929160	5931800	if you have a sufficiently sophisticated formal system,
5931800	5936920	that is to say that you can talk about numbers, the whole numbers in it.
5936920	5938760	That you have whole numbers, one, two, three, four.
5938760	5945000	You have formalized the operation of addition and multiplication within the system.
5947000	5950760	If it is consistent, that is to say, if it's not completely useless,
5951880	5955080	then there will be true statement in it, which cannot be derived
5955800	5960280	by this linear syntactic process of proving theorems from axioms.
5962440	5963480	It's really incredible.
5963480	5964920	So this was a revolution.
5964920	5968280	1931, a revolution in logic, a revolution in mathematics,
5968280	5972440	and we're still feeling the tremors of this discovery.
5973480	5978040	In the similar time, the computer is being born.
5978040	5983400	The actual engineering of the computational system is being born, which is ironic.
5983480	5989000	Turing was Alan Turing, who was considered as the father of modern computing.
5989000	5991800	Right? So he actually did something very similar.
5991800	5997800	So he had this halting problem that he proved that halting problem cannot be solved algorithmically.
5997800	6000920	That you cannot, out of all computer programs, roughly speaking,
6000920	6005800	you cannot have an algorithm of choosing out of all possible computer programs,
6005800	6009800	which ones are meaningful, which ones will not, which ones will halt.
6010360	6012840	Very depressing results all across the table.
6014120	6018920	Or, on the contrary, life-affirming depends on your point of view.
6018920	6021080	Because everything is full of paradoxes.
6021080	6026760	So that means, so you're right, it's depressing if we are sold on a certain idea from the outset,
6026760	6028520	and then suddenly this doesn't pan out.
6029720	6032520	But okay, so which, I retort.
6032520	6037640	What if he proved that actually everything can be proved?
6037640	6038280	So then what?
6038280	6041000	What is left to do if you're a mathematician?
6041000	6042360	So that would be depressing to me.
6043560	6047800	And here there is an opportunity to do something new, to discover something new,
6047800	6050520	which maybe a computer will not be able to.
6050520	6054200	Again, with a caveat, according to our current understanding,
6054200	6058040	maybe some new technology, some new ideas will be brought into the subject.
6058920	6062920	And the meaning of the word computation, like now we think of computation,
6062920	6067000	a particular framework, Turing machines or church thesis and stuff like that.
6067000	6071640	But what if in the future, another genius like Alan Turing will come
6071640	6072920	and propose something else?
6072920	6078280	The theory will evolve the way we went from Newton's gravity to Einstein's gravity.
6078280	6082280	Maybe in the framework of that concept, some other things will become possible.
6084440	6095800	So it's not, to me, it's kind of like not so much about deciding once and for all
6095880	6102280	how it is or how it should be, but kind of like accepting it as an open-ended process.
6102280	6107400	I think that's much more valuable in some sense than deciding things one way or another.
6108760	6117240	I wonder, I don't know if you think or know much about cellular automata and the idea of emergence.
6118680	6123080	I often return to game of life and just look at the thing.
6123080	6124120	Amazing, right?
6124120	6128920	And wonder the kind of things they can do with such a small, you know, tools.
6128920	6134040	That from simple rules, a distributed system can create complex behavior.
6134760	6138040	And it makes you wonder that maybe the thing we'll call computation
6139160	6141720	is simple at the base layer.
6141720	6145640	But when you start looking at greater and greater layers of abstraction,
6145640	6147480	you zoom out with blurry vision.
6147480	6152280	Maybe after a few drinks, you start to see some something that's much,
6152280	6156840	much, much more complicated and interesting and beautiful than the original rules
6157880	6162920	that our scientific intuition says can now possibly produce complexity and beauty.
6162920	6163800	I don't know.
6163800	6169320	I don't know if anyone has a good answer, a good model of why stuff emerges,
6170680	6174200	why complexity emerges from a lot of simple things.
6175640	6177000	It's a why question, I suppose.
6177800	6183400	But every why question will eventually have a rigorous answer.
6183400	6184360	Not necessarily.
6184360	6188840	We could have an approximate answer, which still eludes something.
6189400	6190200	Like quantum mechanics.
6190200	6191560	99% maybe.
6191560	6197000	We will be able to describe it with 99% certainty or 99% accuracy.
6198120	6205240	And then maybe in 100 years or next year,
6205240	6208040	somebody will come up with a different point of view,
6208040	6209640	which suddenly will change our perspective.
6211560	6215560	To this point, I want to say also one thing that I find fascinating,
6215560	6216920	speaking of paradoxes and so on.
6217960	6221080	Do you remember how everybody was freaking out about this blue dress?
6221800	6224040	And was it blue or was it black?
6225320	6228120	I think yellow or white or black and blue.
6229160	6230280	It almost broke Twitter.
6230280	6231960	You remember that night.
6233000	6234520	So there are many examples like that.
6235080	6237240	Where you can perceive things differently.
6237240	6240840	And there is no way of saying which is correct and which is not.
6240840	6245320	For instance, you got this, the bars, the Rubens bars,
6245320	6248360	you know, where you have, from one perspective, it's a vase.
6248360	6250280	From another perspective, it's two faces.
6251560	6255880	Then there is this dark rabbit picture where you can Google it.
6255880	6258040	If somebody doesn't know, they can Google it and find it.
6258040	6259080	It's very easy.
6259080	6262280	Actually, Ludwig Wiedenstein devoted several pages,
6262280	6263960	dark rabbit, in his book.
6264760	6265160	And so on.
6265160	6266280	There are many others.
6266280	6268440	There are like squares where you can see the square.
6268440	6270120	You can see it from different perspectives.
6270120	6271240	This way, that way, and so on.
6272120	6275640	So when we talk about neural networks,
6276600	6280040	we're talking about training data and stuff.
6280040	6282920	So that you have some pictures, for example,
6282920	6285320	that you feed to your program.
6286040	6290120	And you try to find the most optimal neural network,
6290120	6292520	which would be able to decide which one is it,
6292520	6294200	the dog or a cat or whatever.
6294200	6296920	But sometimes it doesn't have a definite answer.
6298680	6299800	So what do you do then?
6299800	6302520	So actually, it's a question.
6302520	6303800	I actually don't know.
6303800	6308840	Has modern AI even come to appreciate this question?
6308840	6311880	That actually, sometimes you can have a picture
6311880	6314440	on which you cannot say what it is in it.
6314440	6316360	From one perspective, it's a rabbit.
6316360	6318200	From the other perspective, it's a duck.
6318280	6320120	How are you supposed to train?
6320120	6321240	If you have a neural network,
6321240	6325000	which is supposed to distinguish between ducks and rabbits,
6325000	6326440	how is it going to process this?
6326440	6327240	You see?
6327240	6331000	Well, so the trivial trick it does is to say
6331000	6334040	there's this X probability that it's a duck
6334040	6336440	and this probability that it's a rabbit.
6336440	6337240	That's a good approach.
6337240	6340680	But also, I would say there is no given percentages.
6340680	6342840	For instance, actually, at some point,
6342840	6345800	I was really curious about it and I looked.
6346760	6350040	And for each picture of this nature,
6350040	6353160	and there are a bunch of them you can easily find online,
6353160	6357000	my mind immediately interprets it in a particular way.
6357000	6359400	But because I know that other people
6359400	6361080	could see it differently,
6361080	6364600	I would then strain my mind and strain my eyes
6364600	6367320	and stare at it and try to see it in a different way.
6367320	6369320	And sometimes I could see it right away
6369320	6371800	and then I could go back and forth between the two.
6371880	6375640	And sometimes it took me a while for some pictures.
6376280	6379240	So in that sense, even if these probabilities exist,
6379240	6380360	they are subjective.
6380360	6382200	Some people immediately see it this way,
6382200	6383560	some people immediately see it that way,
6383560	6385720	and I think that nobody knows.
6385720	6387400	Not psychologists, not neuroscientists,
6387400	6389000	not philosophers, what to make of it.
6390360	6393960	The best answer, of course, is the scientific mind.
6394840	6397960	Even though I say, no, don't look for interpretation,
6397960	6400600	give some place for mysticism or mystery, right?
6400600	6401400	I say that.
6401400	6403800	But of course, I want a theory, I want an explanation.
6404920	6407480	So the best explanation I find is from Niels Bohr's
6407480	6408840	Complementarity Principle.
6409480	6411160	So it is like particle and wave,
6412120	6413720	that there are different ways to look at it.
6414520	6416760	And when you look at it in a particular way,
6416760	6418360	another side will be obscured.
6418360	6420200	Think about it like the other side of the moon.
6420200	6423160	So we are observing the moon from one side,
6423160	6424600	and then we don't see the other side.
6425160	6426840	There is a complementary perspective
6426840	6428360	where we see the other side,
6428360	6430200	but not the side we normally see.
6430280	6432520	But the moon is the same, it's still there.
6433080	6437000	It's our limitations of being able to grasp the whole.
6437720	6438840	That's Complementarity.
6438840	6441720	And we know that from quantum mechanics
6441720	6443720	that our physical reality is like that,
6444680	6446280	rather than being certain,
6446280	6447960	rather than being one way or another.
6449160	6451080	And we should just, as a small aside,
6452040	6453960	in terms of neural networks, mention that
6454920	6457480	at the end of the day, there's humans,
6457480	6458840	it's built on top of humans.
6459800	6461400	Or with chat GPT,
6461400	6464040	that it's using reinforcement learning by human feedback.
6465080	6470360	We're actually using a set of humans to teach the networks.
6470360	6472360	And that's the thing that people don't often talk about,
6472360	6476120	because, or I sometimes think about,
6476120	6479640	that those humans all have a life story.
6479640	6481800	Each human that annotated data,
6482360	6483800	that fed data to the network,
6483800	6488040	or did the RLHF, they have a life story.
6488120	6489160	They grew up.
6489160	6490120	They have biases.
6490120	6490520	They have biases.
6490520	6491640	There are some things that they like,
6491640	6493320	there are some things they don't like,
6493320	6498120	which kind of appear under the radar screen.
6498120	6501000	They may not be aware that they are exercising those biases.
6501000	6501880	That's the point.
6501880	6505240	What you brought up is a very important issue here.
6505240	6507240	Not so much issue, but it's not a bug.
6507240	6508840	It's a feature, in my opinion,
6509640	6514120	that implicit in the discussion of the question,
6515400	6517560	is thinking computational and so on,
6517640	6520760	is the idea that our conscious awareness
6520760	6523560	covers everything within our psyche.
6523560	6525720	And we just know that that's not the case.
6527240	6529640	All of us have observed other people
6529640	6532200	who have had sort of destructive tendencies.
6532200	6535320	So obviously, they did things destructive for themselves.
6535320	6539000	And many of us have observed ourselves to doing that,
6539000	6540200	as part of human nature.
6541640	6544600	And there is great research in analytics psychology
6544600	6547400	and in the past 100 years,
6548600	6551080	strongly suggesting, if not proving,
6551080	6554760	the existence of what Carl Jung called the personal unconscious
6554760	6556200	and also collective unconscious,
6556200	6560120	the kind of circle of ideas which are under the radar screen,
6560920	6563960	which lead us to some strong emotions
6563960	6566680	and inspire us to act in certain ways,
6566680	6568360	even if we cannot really understand.
6569080	6572520	So if we accept that, then the proposition
6572520	6577640	that somehow everything can still be covered by our actions,
6577640	6580200	which are totally kind of neutral
6580200	6584200	and totally righteous and totally conscious,
6584760	6586200	that it becomes really tennis.
6587960	6590120	Let me ask you some tricky questions
6591720	6593080	in terms of how big they are,
6594440	6596840	in terms of how they become difficult
6596840	6598440	because of how much of a romantic you are.
6598440	6605960	What do you, is the most beautiful idea in mathematics?
6607800	6609320	Another one we can ask is,
6609320	6612200	what is the most beautiful equation in mathematics?
6615640	6620440	Well, I may have just broken your brain.
6622760	6626680	Because what your brain is doing is walking down a long memory lane
6627640	6629000	of beautiful experiences.
6629800	6631640	Well, you see, in mathematics,
6631640	6635320	we have this idea that we have an idea of a set,
6635320	6637240	right? So we have a collection of things.
6637240	6640920	For instance, the set of tables, the set of chairs,
6640920	6642520	and so on, or set of microphones,
6643320	6644600	but could be set of numbers,
6645560	6648840	could be set of ideas, could be a set of formulas,
6648840	6649800	mathematical equations.
6650360	6652920	And then we have the notion of an ordered set,
6652920	6655640	ordered, like the set in which there is order,
6655640	6658680	which means that for every two members of the set,
6658680	6660360	we will say which one is better than the other,
6660360	6661720	or greater than the other.
6661720	6663800	For instance, all numbers are ordered.
6664600	6667480	Five is greater than three, five is less than seven, and so on.
6668600	6670040	But not all sets are ordered.
6670680	6672920	So the set of beautiful theorems is not what,
6672920	6674440	beautiful equations is not ordered.
6677560	6679720	So in other words, there are many best equations.
6680520	6685720	And so Richard Feynman chose one,
6685720	6687400	which I think one of the best,
6687400	6691480	is that if you take E, the base of natural logarithm,
6691480	6693640	to the power pi i, so you have pi,
6693640	6696280	you have E in it, the base of natural logarithm,
6696280	6699640	you have pi i, which is square root of negative one.
6701320	6703880	Then the result is negative one.
6705160	6706760	So that's up there, for sure,
6706760	6708920	independent of beautiful formulas,
6709880	6713000	that I think pretty much every mathematician would agree.
6714360	6716200	I don't know what my favorite one is.
6716200	6719800	I'm just lingering on that one, Euler's Identity.
6719800	6720840	What makes it beautiful?
6721400	6723080	Just a few symbols together.
6725960	6728120	I mean, part of it is actually just trying to define
6728120	6730040	what is beautiful about mathematics,
6731560	6735800	that is laid in there in this particular equation,
6735800	6738280	that is somehow revealed when the human eye looks at it.
6739720	6741160	What, why is it beautiful, do you think?
6742760	6743080	Pi.
6744360	6747160	There is an element of surprise in it.
6747160	6748280	How is it possible?
6748280	6751320	We always think of pi as the ratio
6751320	6754440	between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.
6755880	6759720	Here, we are taking some number to the power pi,
6759720	6761800	not even pi, mind you,
6761800	6764040	but pi multiplied by square root of negative one.
6766760	6771320	Surely, this is something completely incomprehensible.
6771320	6774600	And yet, the result is negative one, you see.
6774600	6776920	And if you take E to the power two pi i,
6776920	6778200	you get one, actually one.
6780120	6783160	So I would guess that that's, but in other words,
6783800	6787960	the initial reaction is just that of a surprise, I guess.
6788840	6793240	I guess for anyone who first comes across.
6793240	6796440	That these three folks, four folks got together.
6797720	6803160	It reminds me of the idea that Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky,
6803160	6806040	and Freud were all in Vienna in some early,
6806040	6807640	at the beginning of the 20th century.
6807640	6811480	And Biggest Stein was the classmate of Hitler, you know this?
6811480	6812520	I did not know this, no.
6813160	6815240	So there, it makes you, you know,
6815240	6818200	you can imagine a situation where they're all sitting at a bar together
6818840	6820840	at some point, not knowing it,
6820840	6825560	but they somehow, it all made sense in space time to be located there.
6825560	6828040	And that's what this feels like, some kind of intersection.
6828040	6829320	Intersection, yes.
6829320	6833160	But I would say that after the initial shock,
6833160	6835640	you look at the proof of this equation.
6836280	6838040	And it actually does make sense.
6838040	6841960	And actually it is nothing but the statement
6841960	6843960	that the circumference of the circle is.
6844840	6846280	And in fact, in this case,
6846280	6849320	it's the circumference of a semicircle is equal to pi.
6849960	6851000	And that's where it comes from.
6851640	6853400	In the end, the truth is simple.
6854040	6856520	In the end, the truth is simple, not necessarily easy, but simple.
6857400	6861320	So I mentioned to you offline that I, desperately,
6861320	6864600	in trying to figure out the optimal,
6864600	6866680	in an order set, questions to ask you,
6867400	6870920	texted Eric Weinstein asking for what questions he can ask you.
6871560	6878120	And he said that you are definitively one of the greatest living mathematicians,
6878120	6879400	so don't screw this up.
6880520	6882200	But he did give me a few questions.
6883720	6886280	So he asked to ask you,
6886280	6888280	what are the most shockingly passionate,
6888280	6889960	this is in Eric's language,
6889960	6893480	what are the most shockingly passionate mathematical structures?
6893480	6896280	And he gave a list of four for him,
6896280	6899320	but he said he really wanted your list.
6900280	6901480	Okay, let me say that.
6901480	6905000	Shockingly passionate mathematical structures.
6905720	6906200	Shocking.
6909000	6909960	Is there something you can,
6910600	6912440	is there something that jumps to mind?
6912440	6912760	Sure.
6915720	6916600	I'm here to shock.
6918200	6921640	So first of all, Eric Weinstein is a very dear friend,
6921640	6924760	I have to say, and I really, really, really appreciate and love him.
6925560	6926920	He's just like my brother.
6926920	6931800	So, you know, it's interesting to have a question posed by him.
6932600	6934760	It may be if we can linger for a moment,
6934760	6938200	what do you think is special about Eric Weinstein,
6938200	6940280	for what you know of his work and his mind?
6941640	6944760	The way he sort of straddles so many different disciplines,
6944760	6946120	it's like a Renaissance man.
6946120	6948520	There are very few people like that at any given moment,
6948520	6949960	let alone the 21st century,
6950680	6954920	where information has become so huge
6954920	6958040	that it's almost physically impossible to be able to keep track of things.
6958040	6962760	And yet he does, and he has his own unique vision
6962760	6964600	and unique point of view, and he has integrity,
6965400	6967400	which is like almost impossible.
6967400	6973240	Like I can't think of so many people who possess those qualities, almost no one.
6974760	6981960	And also the ability, in some sense, to embody the balance that you talked about,
6982920	6988920	of both the rigor of mathematics and the imagination.
6988920	6990200	Humanity also, I would say.
6990200	6992040	You know, like we talk about imagination
6993160	6997080	as a kind of a counterpoint to knowledge or logic.
6997880	7001400	But just basic humanity, you know, just basic compassion,
7001400	7007640	just being able to, because every destructive,
7007720	7011880	I would say like every destructive society,
7011880	7013880	you know, like be it Germany, you know,
7013880	7016840	under Hitler or Soviet Union under Stalin and so on,
7017560	7021480	was based on some kind of what was considered unassailable truths.
7022200	7025640	So kind of a conceptual system, you know, if you think about it, right?
7025640	7032920	There is a beautiful episode of this series by Jacob Bronowski, you know,
7033800	7040200	where he talks about, he filmed it in Auschwitz, talking about the certainty
7040200	7047640	that what led the Nazis to killing people wholesale was a certain,
7047640	7049000	it was almost a mathematical idea.
7050200	7054200	And they just basically bought into this idea and checked out their humanity at the door.
7055160	7061000	So I would say that antidote to this type of thing is not necessarily even imagination
7061000	7063640	in a kind of elevated sense that we have been discussing today
7064520	7071000	that is exemplified by our greatest scientists and philosophers.
7072120	7079080	But just basic humanity, you know, basic human basic common sense of just like knowing that
7079640	7080680	that's just not right.
7080680	7085320	And I don't care what my, what my ideology tells me, but I'm just not going to do it.
7085880	7091000	So that I think is kind of missing a little bit in today's society,
7091000	7096600	because people get a lot to cut up in in the ideology, in certain conceptual frameworks.
7096600	7099880	So societies that lose that basic human compassion,
7099880	7101720	that basic humanity run the trouble.
7102360	7103160	Oh, very much so.
7103160	7105160	But not only society, like a human being.
7105160	7110520	And Eric is one of the people, I agree with you, keeps that flame of.
7110520	7115160	Like I trust that he will not do something that's not human.
7115320	7116280	That's not right.
7117080	7120280	I just feel that, you know, like there's some, some people you just kind of feel
7120280	7121800	that they won't cross that line.
7122440	7127880	And that's a huge thing, you know, today, because I have to say, looking back, definitely,
7128760	7134680	I have not hurt people personally, but like I could be mean, for instance, I could be harsh.
7135880	7140280	And now I see it as a sign of weakness, as a sign of insecurity.
7141480	7145000	You know, I saw, I saw your interview with Rick Kurzweil.
7145560	7147320	The other day, beautiful.
7147320	7148280	I was really moved by it.
7148920	7154280	But you know, at some point I was like, I looked at him at this sort of like Dr. Evil.
7156120	7159720	I'm kind of ashamed of it now, but like, you know, I'm kind of coming clean.
7160600	7165000	And I would, you know, because, well, why?
7165000	7170520	Because I needed an adverse adversary in my mind, because I projected onto him
7170520	7174360	kind of the fears that I had that we will be the AI will conquer us and so on.
7175160	7180680	And this was rooted in my kind of awakening moment in a sense,
7180680	7183480	a kind of a moment where I suddenly started to see the other side.
7184280	7187320	So, but I wasn't sure yet, you see.
7187320	7188120	You had to feel it.
7188120	7189880	So I had to have a fight about it.
7189880	7192200	Yeah, you had to actually have the projection.
7192200	7192760	I had to.
7192760	7195720	So it was not in, I believe that it was not in me already.
7195720	7197560	So I had to throw it onto somebody.
7197560	7197880	Yeah.
7198760	7200040	And that's not balance yet.
7200040	7203000	So balance is when you recognize that it's you, actually.
7203000	7204600	So, and I had this moment, actually.
7204600	7206200	It was so amazing.
7206200	7207640	Like, I would give this meme.
7207640	7209720	I would talk about AI and the dangers.
7209720	7213160	And he would always be my, like, foil, you know, the guy.
7213160	7216680	I would put, I would put like a sinister photograph of him on the slide.
7217480	7218840	And I was like, look at this guy.
7219400	7222200	He wants to put nanobots into your brain.
7222200	7226360	And he's also like high end, high top executive at Google and so on.
7226360	7228440	Like, so I would create this whole narrative.
7229880	7233640	And then something happened where I was giving a lecture.
7233720	7236840	This is 2015 at an Aspen.
7237400	7241080	Aspen Ideas Festival, which is a wonderful festival.
7241080	7242360	The keynote speech, actually.
7243000	7245000	And I was doing my usual stick.
7245960	7252120	And then suddenly I said, I came up to that, there was a big screen.
7252120	7253720	And there was a picture of him there.
7253720	7256200	And I came up to the screen and I kind of touched it with my hand.
7256200	7260600	And I said, but I don't want to pick on Mr. Kusawa because he's me.
7261480	7265960	I had this revelation that I'm actually fighting with myself, with my own fears.
7267640	7275880	And then I learned about his father, his father died when he was young.
7277480	7282200	And that he is, in fact, he's very discredited.
7282200	7285320	He's very sincere and upfront about it.
7285320	7288360	Self-disclosure, I think is very essential, by the way, in all this discussion.
7288360	7289560	Like, what really motivates you?
7290680	7297240	He said it publicly many times, even as early as 2015, I could find this information.
7299240	7303240	That he wanted to reunite with his father in the cloud.
7303800	7309960	And suddenly I saw him not as a caricature that exemplified all my fears,
7310680	7316040	but as a human being who, a child longing for his father, grieving for his father.
7316680	7319320	So suddenly it became a story, a love story.
7321480	7328440	And, you know, so that is, so in other words, I've seen it in myself, this
7331320	7338680	capacity to project my own fears and then fight with other people over something that actually
7338680	7344520	was my own. And as soon as I got to this point of seeing him, and then my next lecture, actually,
7344520	7351080	I talked about it, about him in this way. And I said, look, you know, it's a love story.
7351080	7357080	And he is actually, it's not how I would want to reunite with my father.
7360360	7367080	But like you said, you know, that if I am consistent, I have to allow the possibility that
7367160	7375160	different people perceive things differently. And so for him, that's his imagination.
7375800	7380840	So, you know, who is this Voltaire, I think, is ascribed to Voltaire. It's like, I disagree with
7380840	7386920	you, but I will fight to death for you to have the right to say it. So now that I feel like
7386920	7393640	my position is more like, I disagree with him, that this is the way to approach death and to
7393640	7401320	approach the death of loved ones and how we miss them and how we, you know, that sense of loneliness
7401320	7407720	and inability to interact directly, that that's not something that is nice with me.
7408840	7414200	But I think it's also, it can also be called imagination from his perspective and look
7414760	7422040	motivated by that, how much he has brought, how many interesting inventions, like his
7422120	7427160	musical invention, for instance, naturally, because his father was a composer, a music
7427160	7434440	composer and a conductor. So in other words, from a bigger scheme of things, even if I think he's
7434440	7445240	misguided. Still, I can't deny that it's certainly a leap of faith from his perspective to try to
7445240	7450200	say that this is the way we can all connect to our loved ones. And because it is sincere,
7450200	7454840	and I see it now, it's sincere. And in fact, in your interview, you really teased it out of him.
7455560	7459480	I was really moved by it, I have to say. It's like, he has melod a little bit too, I said.
7461400	7465480	It was really, really sweet when he talked about his father. And I can relate, you know,
7465480	7472520	my father died four years ago. And I can relate what a heartbreak, I was much older than Ray was
7472520	7480040	when his father died. But I can relate to this longing and that grief, you know. And when he
7480200	7487800	is somebody sincere, and he puts his, opens his cards and, you know, and says, this is why that's
7487800	7492280	what I want to do it, because I want to recreate my father and want to be able to talk to him this
7492280	7500760	way. Then we have a serious, then we understand, you know, the opposite of it would be not
7500840	7510440	disclosing. And just pretending that this is how it's supposed to be in a scientific term, so
7510440	7516200	it was replacing the real emotion, but come from the heart by some kind of a theory which comes
7516200	7521080	from the mind. And this is where we can go astray, because then we get become captives of
7522920	7528440	frameworks and conceptual systems, which may not be beneficial to our society.
7528440	7533880	In tough times, we need the people that have not lost their way in the ideologies. We need the
7533880	7538280	people who are still in touch with their heart. And you mentioned this with Eric is certainly
7538280	7543320	true. I disagree with him on a lot of stuff. But I feel like when the world is burning down,
7543960	7548840	Eric is one of the people that's you can still count on to have a heart. I've talked a lot
7548840	7555960	over the past year about the war in Ukraine and the possibility of nuclear war. And it feels like
7555960	7565320	he's one of the people I would call first, if God forbid, something like a nuclear war began,
7565320	7568840	because you look for people with a heart, no matter their ideas.
7568840	7573160	And that's right. It takes courage and it takes a certain self-awareness, I would say.
7574040	7579080	And which brings me, you know, I think the crucial is that which was inscribed, you know,
7579080	7584040	on the temple of Apollo and Delphi. There was a statement, know thyself, know yourself, you know,
7584040	7589480	like, who am I? Ultimately, it goes down to this and all these debates. And the point is that
7590120	7596760	I used to be, like I said, you know, pessimistic at some point, and I was scared even of where
7596760	7603960	development of AI was going. This is about 2014, 2015. And now I'm much more, so for instance,
7603960	7610920	after I saw Ray Kurzweil as a human being, after I could relate to him and sympathize
7611720	7617080	with him, suddenly, I stopped seeing him in the news. Like, before that, I would always see him
7617080	7622120	in the news saying, we're going to put nanobots in your brain by the year 2030, whatever, you know?
7622120	7627000	And then we upload you to the 21st, and I would be like, no, you know, the story was terrible.
7627640	7632840	Suddenly, I didn't see him anymore. I had to, you know? So now it makes me question,
7633400	7637960	who was creating the trouble? What was all with him? Was it him who was creating the
7637960	7644120	story and the trouble? Or was it my mind? You see? And so as I become, as I became self-aware,
7645160	7649800	suddenly, other possibilities opened. And suddenly, that conflict, which by the way,
7649800	7656360	if I kept giving this nasty, you know, talks about him one day, I suppose we would have a
7656360	7663000	debate. And so you have this one person stays there. And what I learned is that it never,
7663000	7668760	it's a never-ending conflict. This conflict just does not end. But there is an alternative,
7668760	7675560	there is a better way, which is to realize that it is you arguing with yourself. Now,
7675560	7682600	if you want to continue arguing with yourself, continue as long as you need. Just be careful
7682600	7687320	not to destroy too many things, you know, in the process. But there is an option of actually dropping
7688040	7691240	it, of actually dropping it. This is so, I was so surprised by this.
7692200	7697640	Yeah, it's discovering in yourself the capacity, the human capacity for compassion. And you
7697640	7703160	understand that he has a perspective, he is operating in the space of imagination, the human
7703160	7706520	being like you. And we're all in this kind of together, trying to do this.
7706520	7712520	But we want to see both, ultimately. And also it's like, with realizing how much I have screwed up,
7713240	7719240	comes this humility also. So I find it extremely hard now to really lash out at somebody
7719240	7722680	and to say like, you're horrible, whatever. Because immediately the question is,
7723800	7729240	who am I to criticize? So is there another way to have a dialogue? Is there a way to,
7730440	7737320	speaking, since we talked about the innocence of a child and how much it drives a discovery in
7737320	7742440	science and so on, I remember, I think I heard of Adyashanti who gave this nice example here,
7743160	7747480	when you're a kid, you go and you play with your friends and then you fight with another kid.
7747480	7751480	And he was like, I hate you. I don't want to see you again. And you just go home like
7751480	7755640	after half an hour, okay, what are you going to do? You want to play? So you come out, it's like,
7755640	7760600	hey, you want to play? You don't talk about what happened. You don't rehash this,
7761960	7767960	just keep going. And sometimes I think we are on the verge, maybe, of learning that.
7768920	7777320	Because I think that if we are, if we continue to push each of us, our set of ideas and like
7777320	7783960	ideologies and like, you know, what matters to us and so on, like, yeah, no, no, what matters to
7783960	7788920	you. But like, there are other ways to approach other people, there are other ways you can find
7788920	7796760	the point of contact. Speaking of which, mathematics, mathematical formulas are universal,
7796840	7802200	represent universal knowledge. 2 plus 2 is 4, whether you vote for this guy or that guy in the
7802200	7809160	election. You know, how about that as a point of contact of commonality, you know? And nobody
7809160	7814200	can patent those formulas. Did you know that? There is a Supreme Court decision that mathematical
7814200	7819640	formulas cannot be patented. Like Einstein could not patent E equals MC squared. It doesn't belong
7819640	7823880	to him because if the formula is correct, then it belongs to everyone.
7824200	7831880	So what do you think of that all too tricky question? And if you want, I can deeply bias
7831880	7835080	your answer by giving the list of four that Eric provided.
7835080	7839800	No, let me give my mind. I cannot see, by the way, what you have. But I can guess some of them.
7841160	7844840	I'm going to try to do something different from him. So I already mentioned one,
7844840	7851160	which is that you have one-dimensional numerical system, which is real numbers. You have two
7851160	7855720	dimensional, which is complex numbers. You have four-dimensional. It's probably connected to
7855720	7859800	what he wrote because it has to do with some homotopy groups of spheres and stuff like that.
7861000	7869400	Then, of course, one I love, okay? 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 and so on.
7871640	7877000	Does it make any sense? The sum. You probably heard about this one. It became very popular at
7877000	7882760	some point. 1 plus 2 plus 3, I did a video for a number file, the YouTube channel about it maybe
7882760	7890760	10 years ago. So 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 ostensibly diverges, goes to infinity because
7890760	7898120	you get a bigger and bigger number. And yet there is a way to make sense of it in which it comes up to
7898120	7904040	minus 1 over 12. How fascinating. First of all, the answer is not even a positive number and it's
7904040	7908040	not an integer. It's not a whole number. It's minus 1 over 12. So sometimes people ask me,
7908040	7914440	what is your favorite number? And it's a kind of a joke. I say minus 1 over 12. It's actually 42.
7916920	7922360	So your favorite number is not in order to set. Right. So what else? What else?
7923080	7928280	The language program, of course. I have to mention that. And we'll explore that in depth. Do you
7928280	7940440	know what Eric said? Sure. Sphere, aversion, boys, surface, hop, vibration, and pi 1 of SO3.
7941000	7946520	Okay. Oh, yes. So that's the famous cup trick, you know? Okay, look. So this is how it works.
7948280	7956040	No tricks. No tricks. No magic. It is magical, okay? But not because I'm tricking you. So you
7956120	7961720	start with a bottle like this, or a cup, and you start twisting it. And at the same time,
7961720	7969880	you twist your arm. Then you come. So this is actually going to rotate at 360 degrees full
7969880	7975000	turn. Then you say, okay, I won't be able to do another turn because then my arm would really
7975000	7979880	get twisted. I'll have to go see a dog. Yet, if I do it second time, it untwists.
7980760	7987320	This is the pi 1 of SO3 Eric is talking about. Yes. So there is something where
7988440	7993640	the first motion is not trivial, but if you double down on it, you come back to the initial
7993640	7998760	position. It's very closely connected to the fact that we have elementary particles of two types,
7998760	8005560	bosons and fermions. So bosons are, for example, photons or carriers of other forces,
8005560	8011800	or the Higgs boson. It is called a boson for a reason because it is a boson in honor of
8011800	8018920	Indian mathematician Bose, B O S E and Einstein. So these particles obey what's called Bose-Einstein
8018920	8026040	statistics. But then there are other particles called fermions in honor of Enrico Fermi,
8026600	8033240	Italian born mathematician who worked in the US. And they follow what's called Dirac Fermi
8033240	8038680	statistics. And those are electrons and constituents of matter, electrons, protons,
8038680	8045160	neutrons, and so on. And they have a certain duplicity, if you will. And that duplicity is
8045160	8049800	rooted mathematically in this experiment, this little experiment that they have just done.
8051400	8055400	So I can, I imagine, speaking of imagination, okay, so I'm just kind of riffing on this.
8056040	8061560	I imagine a world in which this will not be shocking or like, in this case, it's not even
8061560	8066280	shocking because I haven't really explained the details, because I can't do it in two minutes.
8066280	8074280	I indicated what this is all about and so on. But imagine a world in which this is not foreign
8074280	8079000	to most people, that most people have seen it before, or they're not afraid to approach this
8079000	8084600	type of questions. Because, you know, we talked a little bit about math education, but I really
8084600	8090120	believe that a lot of people in our society, and it is not only in the United States, but throughout
8090120	8096600	the world, a lot of people have been traumatized. It's really PTSD. That's why people, when they
8096600	8101080	see math, make a formula, or like, even like, how do they need to calculate tip on the bill?
8101800	8108200	They just, they're terrified because it brings up those memories when they were kids and being
8108200	8115240	called to Blackboard and solve a problem, you can't solve a problem. And unscrupulous teacher
8115240	8121480	says, you're an idiot, sit down, and you feel ashamed and, and, and, you know, lonely. And that
8121480	8127400	stays with you. And so I think that, unfortunately, that's where we are. But I want a dream. And so
8127400	8133720	my dream is that one day we'll be able to overcome this. And actually, all of these treasures of
8133720	8139560	mathematics will become widely, widely available, or at least people will know where to find them.
8140200	8144120	And they will not be afraid of going there and looking. And I think this will help because,
8144120	8151000	like I said, for one thing, it gives you a sense of belonging. It gives you, it kind of is an antidote
8151000	8156280	to the kind of alienation and separation that we feel today, oftentimes, because of ideological
8156280	8161800	divide, sectarian strife and all kinds of things like that. Because then you will, once you see
8161800	8167640	there's a critical mass of this beauty that kind of like dawns on you is like, my God,
8167720	8169160	this is what we all have in common.
8172520	8176040	You mentioned Langlands program. We have to talk about it.
8176040	8176680	Sure.
8176680	8180920	At the core of your book and your work is the Langlands program. Can you describe what it is?
8183000	8190760	Sure. So Langlands is a mathematician. It's a name of a mathematician, Robert Langlands.
8191480	8196760	Canadian born, still alive. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study that we
8196760	8201640	talked about, where Einstein and Gödel and other great scientists have worked.
8202920	8207640	In fact, he used to occupy the office of Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study.
8208680	8219400	So he, in the late 60s, he came up with a set of ideas which captivated a lot of
8220360	8225720	mathematicians, several generations of mathematicians by now, which came to be known as the Langlands
8225720	8231800	program. And what it is about is connecting different fields of mathematics, which seem
8231800	8237880	to be far away from each other. For example, number three, which, as the name suggests,
8237880	8245320	deals with numbers and various equations with, you know, like x squared plus y squared equals one.
8245480	8256920	And on the other side, harmonic analysis, something that any music lover can appreciate,
8256920	8262280	because the sound of a symphony can be kind of decomposed into sounds of different instruments,
8262280	8266680	and each of those sounds can be represented by a wave like this, like a sine function.
8267560	8273240	Those are the harmonics. They actually, the period of a harmonic periods of different
8273240	8276520	notes are different. They correspond to different notes and different instruments,
8276520	8282920	different semitones, if you will. But they all combine together into something special,
8282920	8289640	which cannot be reduced to any one of those. So mathematically, it's the idea that you can
8289640	8297720	decompose a signal as a collection, as a simultaneous oscillation of several elementary
8297720	8304360	signals. That's called harmonic analysis. So what Langlands found is that some really difficult
8304360	8311720	questions in number theory can be translated into much more easily tractable questions in
8311720	8318040	harmonic analysis. That was his initial idea. But what happened next surprised everybody,
8318600	8322280	that the kind of patterns that he was able to observe, the kind of regularities that he was
8322280	8327400	able to observe, which were quite surprising, were subsequently found in other areas of mathematics.
8328520	8336120	For example, in geometry, and eventually in quantum physics. So in fact, Ed Whitton,
8336120	8340440	who is kind of a dean of modern theoretical physicists, Professor at the Institute for
8340440	8345720	Advanced Study as well, got interested in this subject. I described in my book how it happened,
8347240	8353960	and he was instrumental in bridging the gap between these patterns in
8353960	8361080	quantum physics and in geometry, finding kind of a substratum, a kind of a super stratum,
8361080	8365800	if you will. It's kind of a way to connect these two things, kind of a bridge between these two
8365800	8371480	fields. So subsequently, I collaborate with Whitton on this, and this has been one of the
8371480	8380760	major themes of my research. I always found it interesting to connect things, to unite things.
8381640	8388360	When I was younger, I couldn't understand why, but I was always interested in
8389800	8395480	when not in working in a specific field, but kind of cutting across fields.
8399000	8403800	And then I would discover that, for instance, I talked to some people who know what happens
8403800	8409480	in this field, but don't know what happens in the other field, or conversely. And then I would
8410200	8418600	find it imperative to go out and explain to them the different sides what this is all about,
8419400	8424520	so that more people are aware of these hidden structures, of these hidden parallels, if you
8424520	8431480	will. So that has been sort of a theme in my research. And so I guess now I kind of understand
8431480	8436120	more why it's kind of a balance, like what we talked about earlier.
8437080	8443960	So can you elucidate a little bit how, what are the mathematical tools that allow you to connect
8443960	8451480	these different continents of mathematics? Is there something you can convert into words
8451480	8455240	that Languages was able to find, and you were able to explore further?
8456520	8461720	I would say what it suggests is that there is some hidden principles, which we still don't
8461720	8469080	understand. My view is that we still don't know why, that we can prove some instances of these
8470840	8476760	correspondences and connections. But we still don't know the real underlying reasons,
8476760	8482360	which means that there is a certain layer beneath the surface that we see now.
8484920	8490440	The way I see it now is like this, that there is something three-dimensional like this bottle,
8490440	8494520	but what we are seeing is this projection onto the table and the projection to a wall.
8494520	8499080	And then we can map things from one projection to another and say, oh my god, that's incredible.
8499720	8503720	But the real explanation is that both of them are projections of the same thing,
8503720	8508120	and that we haven't found yet. But that's what I want to find. So that's what motivates me,
8508120	8514840	I would say. From number theory to geometry to quantum physics. So there is this one thing
8514840	8519480	which has different projections, except it's not just the table and the wall, but there are like
8519480	8526040	many different walls, if you will. So what is the philosophical implication that there is
8526840	8532920	commonalities like that across these very disparate fields? It means that what we believe
8532920	8539800	are the fundamental elements of mathematics, are not fundamental. There is something beyond. It's like
8540520	8546520	we previously thought that atoms were indivisible. Then we found out that there is nucleus and
8546520	8551000	electrons, and the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Then we thought, okay, protons and
8551000	8557560	neutrons must be elementary. Now we know they consist of quarks. So it's about kind of finding the
8557560	8563480	quarks of mathematics. Of course, beyond that, there's maybe even more. Which was my initial
8563480	8569240	motivation to study mathematics, by the way, right? Quarks was the first time you fell in love with
8569240	8576120	understanding the nature of reality. What was it like working with Ed Whitton, who many people say
8576680	8584280	one of the smartest humans in history, or at least mathematical physicists in history?
8585160	8590600	Yes. Fascinating. I enjoyed it very much. I also felt they have to keep up.
8593080	8599800	So we wrote this long paper in 2007 and collaborated for about a year. I have known
8599880	8606600	him before, and we talked before, and we have seen him since. But it's very different to just
8606600	8612920	meet somebody at conferences and have a conversation as opposed to actually working on a project
8612920	8621400	together. So he's very serious, very focused. This is one thing which I have to say. I was really
8621400	8629000	struck by this. Why is he considered to be such a powerful intellect by many other powerful
8629000	8638920	intellects? He has had a unique vision of the subject. He was able to connect different things,
8640600	8648280	especially find connections between quantum physics and mathematics. Almost unparalleled.
8648280	8656200	I don't think anyone comes close, in some sense, in the last 50 years to him, in terms of finding
8656200	8665240	just consistently time after time, breaking new ground. One way one could describe it is
8666440	8674920	he would take some idea in physics and then find an interpretation of it in mathematics,
8675880	8681240	and then say, distill it, present it in mathematical terms, and tell mathematicians,
8681960	8686760	this should be like that, kind of like 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 is minus 1 over 12.
8687480	8695320	And mathematics should be like, no way. And then it would pan out, and mathematicians would then
8696600	8702120	a whole industry would be created of groups of mathematicians trying to prove his conjectures
8702120	8708120	and his ideas, and he would always be proven right. So in other words, being able to
8708920	8714520	glean some mathematical truths from physical theories, that's one side.
8714520	8719880	On the other hand, conversely, applying sophisticated mathematics, he's probably
8722600	8728440	the physicist who could learn mathematics the fastest, I don't think. Some younger
8728440	8735000	physicists maybe could come close, but it's still quite a long way to go to get to be
8735640	8740520	comparable to Whitton, to take some of the most sophisticated mathematics
8742680	8746920	and not learn it to the point where it becomes a practitioner of the subject practically,
8748040	8755320	and then use it to gain some new insights on the physics side. Now, of course, the thing is that
8756040	8761880	the theory is that physics, one could say, is in a sort of a crisis in some sense because of
8762840	8769240	current gap between the sophisticated theories, which came from applying
8769240	8774680	sophisticated mathematics and the actual universe. So we have theories, for instance,
8774680	8780360	we describe 10 dimensional worlds, 10 dimensional space time coming from string theory,
8780920	8787640	and things like that. But we don't know yet how to apply it to understanding our universe.
8788040	8793880	A lot of progress has been made, but it's kind of at a kind of an impasse right now. And at the same
8793880	8801240	time, our most realistic theories, most advanced theories of the four dimensional universe are
8801240	8807880	in contradiction with each other. The standard model describing the three known forces of nature,
8807880	8813960	electromagnetic, strong and weak, it was great accuracy, and Einstein's relativity,
8813960	8822200	and Einstein's relativity, which describes the fourth called gravity. Everybody above a certain
8822200	8830040	age knows that one. So these two theories are in contradiction at the moment. And string theory
8830040	8835480	was one of the, the promise of string theory was that it would unify those two. And so far,
8835480	8840760	it has not, has not happened. So we are kind of at a very interesting place right now. And
8841720	8847640	I think that new ideas, perhaps I needed, and I wouldn't be surprised if written is one of
8847640	8853480	those people who come up with those ideas. Well, he has been one of the, one of the people that
8853480	8859880	added a lot of ideas under the flag of string theory. What do you think about this theory?
8859880	8865480	What do you think is beautiful about it? String theory? Well, first of all, kind of
8865880	8873400	remember, we talked about Pythagoreans and how for Pythagoreans, the whole world was
8873400	8878600	that the symphony where you have this different vibrations of all the humans, every human is
8878600	8884040	a vibration every, every animal, you know, every being, every tree, and every celestial body and
8884040	8888920	so on. So string theory is kind of like that, because in string theory, there is this fundamental
8888920	8896120	object, which is a vibrating string. And all particles are in a sense supposed to be different
8896120	8901320	modulations or vibrations of that string. So that by itself is already interesting, that you
8901320	8907800	kind of describe this diversity of various particles and interactions between them,
8907800	8913400	using one guiding principle, in some sense. But also just the mathematical things that come out
8913400	8920520	of it, the kind of, it looks impossible to satisfy various constraints. And then there is sort of
8920520	8926440	like a unique way to do it. So that's sort of the, every time that happens when, you know,
8926440	8933400	you have some system over, like overdetermined system, let's suppose you have to do like five
8933400	8938920	interviews in one day, and you wake up in the morning and you're like, that's impossible.
8939880	8943560	Because then so many things have to align. For instance, let's suppose you have to go from
8943560	8948040	one place to another. So then you have a commute, and then who knows, maybe there is a traffic jam
8948040	8953560	and stuff like that. And now suppose that it all works seamlessly, and there were like a bunch
8953560	8959240	of places where it could have gone hopelessly wrong, and it didn't. And then in the evening,
8959240	8966600	you're like, wow, it worked. That's beautiful, right? That's kind of like a great luck, you know,
8966600	8972520	I would say. But in science, this happens sometimes, that you have this theory which is not supposed
8972520	8978600	to work, because there are so many, seemingly contradictory demands on it. And yet there is
8978600	8984360	a sweet spot where they balance each other. So string theory is kind of like this. The unfortunate
8984360	8990680	aspect of it is that it balances itself in 10 dimensions and not in four. So maybe there is
8990680	8999400	another universe somewhere. But see, as a mathematician, for me, all spaces are created equal.
9000600	9005160	10 dimensional, four dimensional. So mathematicians love string theory, because it has given us so
9005160	9016360	much food for thought. But do you think it's a correct or a incorrect theory for understanding
9016440	9023000	this reality? So might be a theory that explains some 10th dimensional reality in some other universe,
9023000	9028120	but is it potentially, what do you think are the odds? Again, financial advice is your to bet.
9028840	9034840	What do you think are the odds that it gets us closer to understanding this reality?
9035800	9041480	Well, in the form that it is now, that seems unlikely. But it could well be that based on
9041480	9048040	these ideas, with some modifications, with some essential new elements, it could work out. So
9048040	9053080	I would say right now it doesn't look so good. Like from the point of view that we, from what
9053080	9059400	we know. But maybe somebody will come and introduce like square root of negative one.
9059400	9063640	I mean, they already introduced, but I mean kind of like as a metaphor. Maybe somebody will come
9064360	9069320	and say, what if we do this? It looks crazy. You know, speaking of Niels Bohr,
9070200	9072680	he had this famous quote that he said to somebody,
9073960	9079000	there is no doubt that your theory is crazy. The question is whether it's crazy enough
9079880	9085320	to describe reality. So that's where we are kind of, you know. Speaking of crazy and crazy enough,
9086280	9097960	let me ask for therapy, for advice, for wisdom in returning to Eric Weinstein and maybe give
9097960	9105640	some guidance to understanding his view on his attempt at theory of everything that he called
9105640	9112680	geometric unity, that he told me that you may have some inkling of an understanding of. If you were
9112680	9121400	to describe this theory to aliens that visited earth, how would you do it? Or you could try
9121400	9127320	if it was just me visiting earth. How would you describe your best understanding of it?
9128200	9133720	He shared with me some of it when I was in New York at Columbia, like 11 years ago.
9133720	9137240	We actually spent a lot of time where he explained to me and I found it beautiful.
9138840	9145320	He has a very original idea at the core of it, where you have this instead of four dimensional,
9145320	9152120	instead of 10 dimensional, he has 14 dimensional space. And I thought it was really original.
9152120	9156680	And this exactly goes to the point I made earlier that we need new ideas.
9156680	9163560	I feel that without some fundamentally new idea, we won't be able to get closer to
9164200	9168840	understanding our universe. Now, I have a problem with the whole idea of theory of everything,
9169480	9173240	you know. I don't believe that one exists, nor that we should
9176040	9184360	aim to construct one. And I think it's really not to offend anybody, but it's ultimately
9184440	9190680	a fault of education system of physicists. Like in mathematics, we're not brought up,
9190680	9195960	we're not educated as mathematicians with the idea that one day we will come up with the theory
9195960	9201480	of everything. Even though, as a joke, I said that Langland's program is mathematical theory of
9201480	9207400	everything, but I made it kind of tongue in cheek. But isn't it a little bit kind of that?
9208200	9211960	It's not really, because first of all, it doesn't cover all fields of mathematics,
9211960	9216360	and it covers specific phenomena. But isn't it spiritually striving
9217080	9223000	towards the same platonic form of the theory of everything? Like connecting. Connecting.
9223000	9226920	But connecting doesn't mean that it covers everything, right? So you could connect two
9226920	9231880	things and then you have infinitely many other things which are outside of the purview of this
9231880	9239080	connection. That's how it is in mathematics, I feel. And I would venture to say that
9239880	9243080	most mathematicians look at it this way. Like there is no idea that somehow,
9243080	9247000	I think it's actually impossible, because we're not talking about such a thing as like one
9247000	9250520	universe. We're talking about all possible universes of all possible dimensions and so on.
9250520	9255560	It is just not feasible to have unified everything in one equation.
9257240	9262920	Now physicists, on the other hand, have been brought up educated for decades with this idea.
9262920	9268520	And to me, and I'm not sure I should say that, but I feel like it's kind of an ultimate ego trip.
9269480	9274520	So that I have come up with the unified. I have found the unitary theory of everything. It's me
9274520	9281160	and it's my name will be on it. I think a lot of physicists get educated this way, especially men,
9281160	9287160	take it seriously. And I've seen that happen and I think it is counterproductive. I think that a
9287160	9292600	lot of people agree that this debate is kind of, I feel like it's kind of settled. I hear it less
9292600	9301320	and less, but I disagree with the whole premise. So you, it's interesting because both are interesting
9301320	9308280	points you made, which is you don't think a theory of everything exists and you don't think the pursuit
9308280	9313240	of a theory of everything is good. So I think you spoke to the second thing, which is basically
9314120	9319160	that the pursuit of a theory of everything becomes like a drug to the human ego.
9319160	9325080	That's right. So it is a huge motivating factor. I don't deny that, but I feel that it's, there are
9325080	9333880	better ways to motivate people than like that, than this way. Okay. So I would say, for instance,
9333880	9340440	if one, because then it's not a game of winner takes all in some sense. And in fairness, when
9340440	9345960	physicists say theory of everything, grant unified theory, they mean something very specific,
9345960	9350600	which is unifying the standard model and Einstein's relativity theory, which is the theory of gravity.
9351320	9356280	So they don't necessarily, a lot of physicists may say these words, but they don't really mean them.
9357480	9362280	I think it's important to realize that, that in my opinion, that's not productive and it's not
9362280	9366840	feasible anyway. So having said that, there are some theories are better than others, obviously.
9366840	9373080	So for instance, Eric's theory has, as far as I understand, does have a certain way of producing
9373080	9378840	some of the elementary particles that we see, and as well as the force of gravity. So it does
9378840	9386760	have that promise. I feel that from, at least from the place where I had seen it about 10 years ago,
9386760	9391480	it still required a lot of work to get to the point of actually saying that it does work because,
9393400	9398520	you know, a lot, there are a lot of elements. It's a huge enterprise to have a theory because
9398600	9404360	you have just to describe the fields, sort of the building blocks of the theory. It's already
9404360	9409640	tremendous undertaking. And he's trying to do it for curved spaces in greater generality, which is
9409640	9414440	what makes it so unique and so beautiful. But then there are, on top of that, there are this issue
9414440	9420120	of quantization of actually describing them as quantum field theory. And the quantum field theory,
9420120	9426680	even as a language, as a framework is currently incomplete, in my opinion, and not only my
9426680	9435800	opinion, it's like everybody agrees on that. It's a collection of tricks, so to speak. It's
9435800	9443960	a collection of tools. It's a toolbox, but it is not a consistent rigorous theory, like number
9443960	9453000	theory in mathematics. Physicists have still been able to derive predictions from it and
9453960	9461400	confirm them with the great accuracy. But the underpinnings, it doesn't have the
9461400	9468280	real rigorous foundation from a mathematical perspective. So in that sense, even if in that
9468280	9477160	framework a new theory could lead to an explanation of some, some new explanation of some phenomena,
9477160	9480440	it would still be incomplete, in a sense, because it wouldn't be mathematically rigorous,
9480440	9485480	you see what I mean. Because the whole framework is not yet on a firm foundation.
9485480	9491880	So it's not consistent. Why is it that the universe should have? So that's
9491880	9498760	to your first point. Do you think the universe has a beautiful clean when you show up and meet
9498760	9504440	God and there's one equation on the board and the two of you just chuckle? Do you think such
9504440	9512840	equation exists? Yeah, there are such equations. For instance, let's say I am interested in a
9512840	9519000	particular question, right? So in the language program, so moving away from physics, so let's
9519000	9525640	talk about math. So in the context of language program, I have recently developed with my
9525640	9531160	co-authors, Aitengov and Kashdan, a kind of a new strength, a new flavor of the language program,
9531160	9536920	if you will. But so far, it's a sort of, it's a vision. It's a set of conjectures,
9537480	9542600	which we have proved in some cases, but not in full generality. So yes, I would like to
9543640	9552280	use your framework for me, the creator, and ask her, what is the explanation of this?
9553080	9556920	And it may well be that you will answer in a way that I will just burst out laughing,
9556920	9563400	it's like, how could we not see it? You see? So that I totally see. But I don't see one equation
9563400	9571080	governing, one equation governing them all. Not one equation governing them all, but it does seem
9571080	9575800	that such equations exist, where she will tell you something and you look back and say, how could I
9575800	9583880	not see it? It seems like the truth at the end of the day is simple. That we're seeking, especially
9583880	9589960	through mathematics. It seems somehow simple. The nature of reality, the thing that governs it
9589960	9596200	seems to be simple. I wonder why that is. And I also wonder if it's not totally incorrect,
9596200	9604920	and we're just craving the simplicity. And then mixing into the whole conversation about how much
9604920	9612680	the observer that craves simplicity is part of the answer. It's a whole big giant mess.
9613880	9621880	Or a whole big, beautiful painting or symphony. You said of Eric Weinstein that I find it
9621880	9626600	remarkable that Eric was able to come up with such beautiful and original ideas,
9626600	9631080	even though he has been out of academia for so long, doing wonderful things in other areas,
9631080	9637160	such as economics and finance. I'd like to use that kind of quote as just a question to you about
9637160	9645640	different places where people of your level can operate inside academia and outside. What is
9645640	9654200	the difference of doing mathematics inside academia and outside? Not even mathematics,
9654200	9662920	but developing beautiful original ideas. Where's the place that your imagination can flourish most?
9663800	9670120	So the limitations of academia is there's a community of people that take a set of axioms
9671080	9677640	as gospel. So it's harder to take that leap into the unknown. But it's also the nice thing about
9677640	9682760	academia is some of the most brilliant people in the world are there. And it's that community.
9683320	9689080	Both the competition and the collaboration is there. I wonder if there's something you could
9689080	9694600	say sort of to further about this world that people might not be familiar with.
9695560	9700840	But I think you gave a very good description. I'm not sure I can on it because I don't have
9700840	9707400	an overarching theory of academia. I definitely have been part of it and I'm grateful because
9708040	9715320	it gives you a great sense of security, which comes with its own downside too,
9715320	9718840	because you kind of like get a little disconnected from the real world because
9718840	9723240	you get tenure, so you feel financially secure. You know, they don't pay you that much,
9723240	9728600	so to speak, you know, relatively speaking. And it's comfortable, but it's not that much.
9728600	9735960	But you can't be fired. So there is something about this, which I definitely have benefit from it,
9735960	9744440	you know, and it does. People are not even aware what it's like to live outside of where you don't
9744520	9751160	have this type of security. On the other hand, that also means that we're lacking certain skills
9751160	9758360	that sort of real people in the real world have developed out of necessity to deal with that sort
9758360	9763400	of insecurity. So it kind of always cuts both ways. You know, in one hand, it gives, and with
9763400	9768600	other hand, it takes away. And it's a very interesting setup. And also, on the one hand,
9768600	9774760	we are all supposed to be the true seekers. And but in reality, of course, it is a human
9774760	9781320	activity, and it is a human community with all kinds of good, bad, and ugly things that happen,
9781320	9787400	a lot of them under the radar screen, so to speak. And so, but maybe there is something to it.
9787960	9793480	There is definitely, there are definitely people who are upholding kind of that old tradition,
9794120	9800440	definitely. And that is inspiring. And I aspire to be, you know, one of those to my best. So,
9800440	9807160	whether this is a system that will stay or should stay, I don't know. I really don't know.
9807160	9813000	That's really fast. Yeah, it's fascinating what, especially with it, just to introduce the
9813000	9817720	bit of AI poison into the mix, as that changes the nature of education, perhaps as well,
9818680	9823640	what the role of the university is in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years. I wonder,
9825560	9831000	I wonder, and I wonder that, you know, how do you make sense that Einstein was working
9831720	9835080	after attempting, I believe, to be a university professor?
9836600	9838920	For the patent office. Yeah, as a patent clerk.
9839800	9847640	But I have to say, to these days, the science has become so much faster. It is really hard
9847800	9854040	to do it being outside. Now, Eric is unique in this way, even though he did, you know,
9855400	9863880	go to great undergraduate and graduate, you know, schools, but then worked for a while in academia.
9865640	9870440	There are very few examples like that. There's Yutong Zhang, who proved an important conjecture
9870440	9876280	number theory about 10 years ago, and is now, as I understand it, is a professor at UC Santa Barbara.
9876920	9882280	He worked outside of academia and was able to make tremendous advance on his own.
9883640	9889640	This case is exceedingly rare, in part because academia is trying to protect its turf and it's
9889640	9896360	kind of it's it's creating the sort of prohibitive cost of of an outsider. That is true. But there
9896360	9902200	is also something about how much how much concentration in mathematics. I don't think
9902920	9907080	people who are not who are not in the field understand what kind of focus
9908920	9916200	and concentration actually doing like mathematics at top level these days requires.
9916920	9921480	Because we're not talking about something that is more or less good. It is something which
9921480	9927240	unassailable, you know, it's finding this treasure at the bottom of the ocean, you know, without
9928200	9936360	you know, that column, you know, without oxygen. And that's why, you know, it's it's not people go
9936360	9940840	crazy sometimes, you know, but there is a reason for that. Well, let me let me ask you about that
9940840	9944360	sort of just to linger on that the amount of concentration required.
9946280	9951080	Cal Newport wrote a book called Deep Work. He's a theoretical computer scientist.
9951400	9960760	He took quite seriously the the task of allocating the hours in the day for that kind of deep
9960760	9966360	thinking and then the mathematicians is is theoretical computer scientists on steroids.
9967000	9974120	So for your own life and what you've observed, let me ask the big question, how to think,
9975080	9979160	how to think deeply, how to find the mental, psychological,
9980600	9987560	pragmatic space to really sit there and think deeply. How do you do it? In the moment you
9987560	9994600	remember what you really deeply thought, what was it an accident? Was it deliberate?
9995560	10003400	No, it's deliberate because, you know, first of all, my first years as a mathematician, you know,
10004120	10010520	I worked every day, weekends, holidays, doesn't matter.
10013000	10018440	I didn't even question that. So I would feel something's missing if I took a day off.
10019960	10025880	And, you know, so it was just a kind of a sustained effort. The point is that
10026840	10033000	still the process is nonlinear to go back to what we discussed earlier, that in other words,
10033000	10039320	the way I see it is you just you are making an effort to to bring all the information into
10040200	10044200	focus, what you believe is correct. And you're playing with different
10046760	10053000	ways of connecting things. But it is a total miracle when it when suddenly there is
10054120	10058760	inside strikes. It is not something that in my experience could be predicted
10059480	10067880	or even anticipated, you know, or like brought closer. There is a famous story about Einstein
10067880	10072760	that he used to, you know, go think, think, think and then go for a walk. And like he would whistle
10072760	10078040	and sometimes. So I remember the first time I heard this story, I thought how interesting is what
10078040	10083400	the coincidence that he this came to him when he was with them. But in fact, it's not this is how
10083480	10089160	it works in some sense that you have to prepare for it. But then the moment it happens when you
10089160	10095320	stop thinking, actually, the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops. And, you know,
10096680	10103880	you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking. But you cannot do it by will in some
10103880	10108520	sense. It's kind of like, you know, how in the Eastern tradition, they have this concept of
10108520	10115480	Satori, like in Buddhism, in Zen Buddhism, Satori, which is enlightenment. And so the various reports
10115480	10124360	of Buddhist monks or Buddhist masters who have had experience Satori. But they say you can't
10126440	10132040	do it by will. You cannot make it happen. If anything, you have to relax to let it come to
10132120	10134920	you, you know, it's kind of like that. It's kind of like that. So
10137560	10143160	I think that what matters, but you say how to think, the point is that we're talking about
10143160	10149160	such an esoteric area. Mathematics is really esoteric area. It's a really strange subject where you
10149160	10157800	try to to fit everything in this very, very stringent set of rules, to obey those set of those
10157800	10163880	rules. Isn't it basically the pure, the hardest manifestation of a puzzle that we're all solving
10163880	10168600	in different other disciplines? But this is the hardest puzzle. But yes or no, because there is
10168600	10175240	just a different, for instance, there is a different criterion for what constitutes progress.
10175240	10180120	For instance, in physics, a lot of arguments they make, they are not rigorous from a mathematical
10180120	10184920	perspective. It is kind of an intuitive argument. We think it is like this. And this is acceptable
10184920	10191720	in the subject for a good reason. And so there is some play. It's more like human activity,
10191720	10196440	day-to-day activity. For instance, you and I discuss something. You have an idea and I have
10196440	10202360	an idea and we argue about it. And something seems more plausible. Something seems less plausible.
10202360	10207640	And so we may decide to take this point of view or that point of view as a provisional sort of
10208920	10214440	point of view and go with it. In mathematics, it doesn't work this way. You either prove it or
10214440	10221640	you don't. And oftentimes, you get to the point where there is this much you need to prove and
10221640	10228600	it just wouldn't come to you. And you just don't see it and it can go on for months.
10230360	10235000	Super frustrating. But without it, it is nothing kind of, you know?
10235560	10241400	I would love to hear your opinion to the degree that you know it of the proof of Fermat's last
10241400	10249320	theorem by Andrew Wiles, which seems to have this element perhaps for years. To the degree that
10249320	10254600	you know, perhaps can you explain Fermat's last theorem and what your thoughts are in the process
10254600	10259640	that Andrew Wiles took that seemed to, at least from my sort of romantic perspective, seem to be
10259640	10271800	very lonely. Yes. It's a lonely profession. And hopeless. And sort of you put it really nicely
10271800	10276120	because it feels like there's a lot of moments where you feel like you're close. You feel like
10276120	10282440	99% is done. And there is this one stubborn thing which just does not compute, you know,
10282440	10290840	doesn't happen. And you're trying to find that push for this last link. And nobody knows how
10290840	10295720	long it's going to take. Would it be useful to maybe try to explain Fermat's last theorem?
10295720	10303000	Sure. It's easy to do. I am an optimist. I'm an optimist. I think I always think that everything
10303000	10308440	can be explained, you know? Even though I say that not everything can be explained. But in
10308440	10314440	mathematics, you know, within this particular framework, I think that I always feel optimistic
10314440	10319400	when people ask me to explain something. I always start with the assumption that they will understand.
10321240	10330120	So let's try. Fermat's last theorem, one of the jewels sort of of mathematics of all time.
10331240	10337560	A beautiful story also behind it. Pierre Fermat, a great French mathematician who lived in the
10338520	10347000	mostly worked at the beginning of the 17th century. And he actually has to his credit a number of
10347000	10352280	important contributions. But the most famous is called Fermat's last theorem, or Fermat's great
10352280	10358760	theorem. And the reason why it became so famous is in part because he actually claimed to have
10358760	10365240	proved it himself. And he did it on the margin of a book that he was reading, which was actually
10365240	10372040	an important book by Diophantus about equations with coefficients in whole numbers. And he wrote
10372040	10377960	on the margin literally, this equation, you know, this problem, which I will explain in a moment.
10379640	10385080	I have solved it. I have found a proof. But this margin is too small to contain it.
10386040	10391720	At some point, I was giving a public talk about this, and I made it as a joke. I made a tweet
10392440	10397160	in which I wrote that I have proved this theorem, but 280 characters are not enough and it kind of
10397160	10404040	cuts me in mid-sentence. So this was 17th century Twitter style proof. But a lot of mathematicians
10404040	10412280	took it seriously because he had great credibility. He did make some major contributions. And the
10412280	10422360	search was on. So for 350 years, about 350 years, it remained unproved with many people trying
10423400	10432680	and failing until in 1994, no, in 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a mathematician from Princeton
10432680	10438680	University announced the proof. And it was very exciting because he was one of the top number
10438680	10444920	theorists in the world. And unfortunately, about a year later, a gap was found. So that's exactly
10444920	10450040	what we were talking about earlier. You have 99% of the proof. This one little thing does not quite
10450040	10454040	connect. And this nullifies the whole thing. Even though, well, you could say we have some
10454040	10459400	interesting ideas, but it's not the same as actually having a proof. So he apparently was
10459400	10464360	really frustrated. And he was really a lot of people thought that it's going to be another 100
10464360	10471560	years or whatever. And then luckily, he was able to enlist with the help assistance of his
10472360	10477880	former student, also great number theorist, Richard Taylor, they were able to do that 1%
10477880	10482920	so to speak. Well, some people might say it may be not one, but 5% or whatever. But it definitely was
10482920	10489000	an important ingredient, but it was not he had a sort of like a big new set of ideas. And this one
10489000	10494280	thing didn't pan out. They were able to close it with Taylor. And it finally was published and I
10494280	10503720	think was accepted and read in 95. And since it's believed to be correct. Now, what he proved,
10503720	10509960	actually, was not Fermat's theorem itself. But a certain statement, which is called
10509960	10515320	Shimura Taniyama way conjecture named after three mathematicians to Japanese mathematicians in one
10515320	10521560	French porn mathematician who worked in also the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
10522760	10528360	And it was my colleague at UC Berkeley, Ken Ribbit, who in the 80s connected the two problems.
10528360	10531800	So this is how it often works in mathematics. You want to prove statement A.
10532680	10537480	Instead, you prove that a is equivalent to B. So after that, if you can prove B,
10537480	10541480	this would automatically imply that A is correct. So this is what happened here.
10541560	10545480	A was Fermat's last theorem. B was Shimura Taniyama way conjecture. And that's what
10546360	10551320	Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor really proved. So it requires to get to Fermat's last theorem,
10551320	10555720	it requires that bridge, which was established by my colleague Ken Ribbit at UC Berkeley.
10556280	10558680	So now what is the statement of Fermat's last theorem?
10561080	10565720	Let me start with Pythagoras. Since we already talked about it, let me start with Pythagoras
10565720	10571960	theorem, which describes the right triangles. So what is the right triangle? It's a triangle in
10571960	10578520	which one of the angles is 90 degrees like this. So it has three sides. The longer side is called
10578520	10585080	hypotenuse. And then there's two other sides. So if we denote the length of hypotenuse by z
10585720	10591080	and the two other sides x and y, then z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared.
10592040	10599240	So that's the equation. Or x squared plus y squared equals z squared. And it turns out
10599240	10605880	that this equation has solutions in natural numbers, actually infinitely many solutions
10605880	10617080	in natural numbers. For example, if x equals 3, y equals 4, and z equals 5, then they solve
10617080	10627400	this equation because 3 squared is 9. 4 squared is 16. 9 plus 16 is 25. And that's 5 squared.
10628440	10635800	So x squared plus y squared equals z squared is solved by x equals 3, y equals 4, z equals 5.
10635800	10638200	And there are many other solutions of that nature.
10638200	10642280	And we should say that natural numbers are whole numbers that are non-negative.
10643160	10648760	That's right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. Now what's Fermat's last theorem? Fermat asked what
10648760	10656440	about what will happen if we replace squares by cubes, for example. So x cube plus y cube equals z
10656440	10665560	cube. Are there any solutions in what do you call natural numbers? It turns out there are none.
10666520	10673240	What about fourth powers? Again, none. Or it seems like none, right? So that was a statement.
10673960	10681240	So the theorem says that the equation x cube plus y cube equals z cube has no solutions in natural
10681240	10688280	numbers. Remember, natural means positive whole numbers. So of course, there is a trivial solution
10688280	10695160	0, 0, 0, so that this works. But you need all of them to be positive. x to the fourth plus y to the
10695160	10702680	fourth equals z to the fourth also has no solutions. x to the fifth plus y to the fifth
10702680	10709320	equals z to the fifth, no solutions. So you kind of see the trend. x to the n plus y to the n
10709320	10716040	equals z to the n. If n is greater than 2, has no solutions in natural numbers. That is a statement
10716040	10722040	of Fermat's last theorem. Deceptively simple. As far as famous theorems are concerned,
10722040	10726840	you don't need to know anything beyond standard arithmetic, addition and multiplication of natural
10726840	10736600	numbers. That's why a lot of people, both specialists and amateurs, try to prove it because
10736600	10744440	it's so easy to formulate. So in fact, I think Fermat proved the case of cubes. I think he did
10744440	10749160	actually prove some elsewhere the case of cubes. But so it remained like fourth. There are infinitely
10749160	10752760	many cases, right? You have to, even if you prove it for cubes and for fourth power and fifth,
10752760	10757240	then still there are six, seven, and so on. There are infinitely many cases in which it has to be
10757240	10768280	proved. And so you see, the Deceptively Simple result took 350 years to prove. And you know,
10768280	10772200	but in a sense, it's like mathematicians, you know, you would think mathematics is such a sterile
10772200	10777400	profession. Everybody's so serious, you know, almost like we're all wearing like lab coats
10777400	10784440	and like take an elevator to the every tower. And however, look at all this drama.
10785400	10790200	Look at all this drama. It's like we also like drama. We also have narratives. We also have our
10790200	10797800	myths. Here is a guy is a 16th century mathematician or 17th century mathematician who leaves a note
10797800	10804120	on the margin and motivates others to find the proof. Then how many hearts were broken that they
10804120	10809400	believed that they found the proof. And then later it was realized that the proof was incorrect
10809400	10815880	and so on and brings us to modern day. And one last attempt, Andrew Wiles, who is very serious
10815880	10821240	and respected and esteemed mathematician, announces the proof only to be faced with the same reality
10821240	10827400	of his hopes dashed, seemingly dashed. And like, there is a mistake. It doesn't work. And then to
10827400	10833880	be able to recover a year later, how much drama in this one story. It's amazing. But from what
10833960	10840040	you understand, from what you know, what was the process for him that is similar, perhaps,
10840040	10847240	to your own life of walking along with the problem for months, not years?
10847240	10854600	Yes. So he worked, he has given interviews about it afterwards. So we know that he described his
10854600	10861800	process that number one, he did not want to tell anybody because he was afraid that people find
10861800	10869400	out that he's working on it. Because he was such a top level mathematician, people would guess that
10869400	10876520	he has some idea that there is some idea. So, you know, if you just know that somebody has an idea,
10876520	10882120	this already gives you a great boost of confidence, right? So he didn't want people to have that
10882120	10887960	information. So he didn't tell anybody that he was working on it. Number one, be lonely. Number two,
10887960	10896440	he worked on it for seven years, if I remember correctly, by himself. And then he thought he
10896440	10902840	had it and he was elated. Obviously, he was, you know, very happy. And he announced it at a conference,
10902840	10908840	I think it was in Cambridge University or Oxford University in the UK in 1993, I believe. So,
10909800	10918920	you know, this is really interesting because all of us, all mathematicians can relate to this,
10918920	10925800	because I remember very well my first problem, how I solved my first problem. I described it in
10925800	10935160	Love and Math in my book. So it was, I was, how old was I? I was 18 years old. I was a student in
10935160	10940520	Moscow. And I was just, I just lucked out that I was introduced to this great mathematician.
10941080	10946040	Since I, you know, I was not studying at Moscow University because of anti-Semitism in the Soviet
10946040	10951000	Union. So I was in this technical school, but I was lucky that I had a mathematician who took me
10951000	10960920	under his wing. And Dmitry Fuchs, who actually later came to the US and he's still a professor at
10960920	10969960	UC Davis, actually, not so far from me. So he gave me this problem and it was rather technical,
10969960	10976840	so I will not try to describe it. But I do remember how much effort, you know, that excitement,
10976840	10982520	but also kind of a fear, what if I don't have what it takes, you know? I lost sleep. So this
10982520	10987800	was one consequence of this. I, for the first time in my life, I had trouble falling asleep. And
10987800	10992520	this actually stayed for a couple of years afterwards. So then it was kind of like a wake-up
10992520	10997400	call that I should be to take care of myself, not work too late and so on. So that was sort of like
10997400	11002920	that experience. And I was lucky that I was able to find a solution, number one, within two months,
11002920	11008600	maybe. And it was very, it was surprising and it was beautiful. Like it, the answer was, was in
11008600	11013000	terms of some, something which seemed to be from a different world, from a different area of mathematics.
11013000	11020840	So I was very happy. But I do remember this moment when suddenly you see that. Just like
11022040	11027320	in this case, it was literally, I had to compile these diagrams with what mathematicians call
11027320	11033880	cohomology groups and spectral sequences and manually calculate some numbers and trying
11033880	11039880	to discern some system in it. And suddenly I saw that how they all were governed by this one,
11040440	11046200	one force, so to speak, one pattern. And that was absolutely, wow. So it's like...
11047320	11049640	Maybe what was it? So you're sitting there at a desk?
11050360	11055000	Actually, you know, I lived in a town outside of Moscow. So I used to take, I would take a train
11055000	11059080	to Moscow. So it's what we call in Russia, electric, you know, like this electric train,
11059080	11063640	which was super slow. It took more than two hours to cover that distance. And I think that
11063640	11069480	the crucial insight came when I was in this. And I just, I had to contain myself so I don't
11069480	11076760	start screaming, you know, because there were other passengers in the car. So I was sitting there
11076760	11084120	and staring at this paper. So you know what? I remember that's what came to me. I have something
11084120	11090040	now, which nobody else in the world has. I have a proof of... First of all, it was not just a proof.
11090040	11094200	Like in the case of Fermat, the statement is already made. That's why it's called conjecture.
11094200	11098680	You know, you make a statement, you don't have a proof yet. Then you try to prove it. In my case,
11098680	11103720	I did not know what the answer would be. There was a type of question where the answer was unknown.
11103720	11109080	So I had to find the answer and prove it. And the answer was very nice. So nobody knew, as far
11109080	11114760	as I could tell, nobody knew because my teacher told me that he explored all the literature. And
11114760	11123800	this was not known. So this was... Suddenly I felt that I was in possession of this. Now,
11123880	11129880	it was a little thing. It was not cure for cancer. It was not a large language model.
11131160	11138840	But it was something undeniably real, meaningful. And it was mine kind of. I had it, nobody else.
11138840	11145240	I had not published it. I didn't even tell anybody. And it is a very strange feeling to have that.
11145240	11147720	Were you worried that this treasure could be stolen?
11148680	11153080	Not at the time. Not at the time. So later on, there were situations where
11153080	11157160	I was exposed to those types of experiences. But at that time, I didn't think of that. I was
11157160	11165000	still this starry-eyed kid who was just obsessed with mathematics, with this beauty and discovering
11165000	11171400	those beautiful facts, beautiful results. So I didn't even think that it could be possible
11171400	11176120	that somebody could steal it or whatever. I just wanted to share it with my teacher as soon as
11176120	11181400	possible. And he understood quickly. And he's like, good job.
11182840	11189240	Is there something you can give color to the drama? Eric Weinstein has spoken about
11189240	11194120	some of the challenges, some of the triumphs and challenges of his time at Harvard.
11197640	11204280	Is there something to that drama of people stealing each other's ideas or not allocating
11204360	11210920	credit enough? Oh, sure. Yes. All of that and creating psychological stressors because of that.
11210920	11214840	Happens all the time, yes, unfortunately. On young minds and so on.
11214840	11218840	Could have a very bad effect. Is that just the way of life or is this...
11220760	11224920	I think we can definitely do better. And I think the first step is to kind of
11225720	11232760	admit that we are not 100% seekers of truth, that we are human beings and all the
11233720	11243080	good and bad and the ugly qualities can be present and to have some kind of dialogue
11243080	11248760	in my subject, in mathematics. This has not happened yet. There have been some famous cases
11248760	11253880	where people have been accused, which had been resolved or partially resolved or unresolved.
11254680	11259480	And everybody knows it, but there isn't a systematic effort, as far as I can tell,
11260360	11265800	of really trying to create some rules, some ethics rules. This is fair game,
11265800	11272120	this is not fair game, so that as a community, we strive to get better. I think that for most
11272120	11277400	people it's more like keeping your head in the sand and kind of pretending that it doesn't happen.
11277400	11282360	Or it happens some isolated incidents. Well, my experience is not like that at all.
11282360	11286440	I think it does happen much more often than it should. That's my opinion.
11287400	11292680	So there's the pool of academia is fascinating. One of the reasons I really love it is you have
11292680	11299400	young minds with fresh ideas. And that same innocence you had when you first on the train
11299400	11304040	have that brilliant breakthrough. And then you throw that in together with senior,
11304680	11309960	exceptional world-class scientists who have, first of all, are getting older.
11310200	11320280	Second of all, maybe they have partaken in the drug of fame and money and status and recognition.
11320280	11327080	So that starts to a little bit corrupt all of our human minds. And you throw that mix in together.
11328600	11335320	Mostly without rules. And it's beautiful because that's where the ideas of old
11336280	11343640	contend with the new wild-eyed crazy ideas and they clash and there's a tension and there's
11343640	11348600	a dance to it. But then there's the old human corruption that can take advantage of the young
11348600	11354040	minds. It's unclear what to do with that. I mean, part of that is just the way of life
11354040	11360120	and there's tragedies. And oftentimes when you look at who wins the Nobel Prize, it's also tragic
11360760	11367480	because sometimes so many minds are, the trajectory to the breakthrough idea
11368040	11371480	involves so many different minds, young and old. Yeah, I mean,
11375000	11382760	you're right. I think it's like everything else. The path is to more self-awareness.
11382760	11389240	And that's like owning up your own stuff and not blaming other people, not projecting onto other
11389240	11396520	people, but taking responsibility. And that's true for everything. And the problem here,
11396520	11401560	unique problem for mathematics, I would say thesis and chemists are better. They actually
11401560	11406200	have better sort of ethical rules and so on, especially biologists. Because I think in part
11406200	11409880	it's because there is much more money involved, because they have to get grants and so on. So
11409880	11414120	for them, the question of priority, who discovered what first is much more serious because there's
11414280	11418280	really some serious money. Mathematics, who cares? You know, like Fermat's last theorem was proved.
11418840	11422440	Did Andrew Wiles become a millionaire? No. I think he got a prize.
11422440	11429160	He won a prize, but those prizes are not... I think that one was a big prize, but in general,
11429160	11433080	there's not going to be... I think he won the Nobel Prize, eventually, which is about a million
11433080	11440440	dollars. But sometimes I joke about this, that this is the hardest way to win a million dollars.
11441400	11451000	So, you know, but amongst mathematicians, I think the trouble is that we are so insulated
11452920	11460840	from society because it's such a pure subject. It draws in very specific psychological types.
11461480	11466200	And I can speak about myself. I did not realize it at the time, but later on, I definitely saw...
11467000	11472120	I mentioned some of it earlier, that for me, mathematics was a refuge from the cruelty of
11472120	11476680	the life I experienced, from discrimination that I experienced when I applied to Moscow University
11476680	11481240	at 16, being failed at the exam and stuff like that, which I describe in my book as well. But
11483000	11488200	that was my way. I was like, I don't trust this world. I don't want to deal with it.
11488920	11495880	I want to hide in this platonic reality of pure forms. This is where I know how to
11495880	11503000	operate. I love this, and I couldn't be bothered in some sense. For a while, up to a point, as I was
11503000	11509240	getting older and more mature, I was becoming more and more interested in other things. But I think
11509240	11516920	that's one of the reasons. And one of the reasons why I wrote Love and Math was precisely to break
11516920	11524840	that cycle. That it's the quiet guy in the corner that goes into math, and not the flamboyant, you
11524920	11535320	know, jock or like, you know, DJ. I wanted to show how beautiful the subject is to attract this new
11535320	11545000	blood so that different psychological types and more women would join. Because then they would
11545000	11550440	have the students who would look at them and whom they will inspire. And then it would be...
11551320	11555880	Instead of a vicious circle, it would be a virtuous circle. And I have to say, I think it's
11555880	11559960	happening not because of my efforts alone. Obviously, there are many other mathematicians
11559960	11566040	who are around the same time started to put more effort. Because see, if the old stereotype of
11566040	11570840	mathematician, you're so enclosed, you're not interested in even exposing the beauty of your
11570840	11575800	subject to other people, you see? And then it becomes this vicious circle. But you know, this
11575800	11582360	one day, you know, all the time I meet the students who say, your book is the reason why
11583080	11588120	I chose Math as my major. And I am proud, especially when it's women who tell me this.
11588120	11594760	And they are cool. They are DJs at the same time. And they are social. And they have friends.
11594760	11600280	And they go out and so on. You see, so then they carry the torch. Because then they will be more
11600280	11608840	likely to share this beauty with others, to attract more students and so on. So I think this
11608840	11613880	kind of this dumb was broken. So now you have more influx. And once we have people who are more
11614520	11620120	able to connect at the personal level, that's when we also become more self aware as a community,
11620120	11625560	I think. And that's when we might be, we should be able to have a chance to improve in terms of
11625560	11632600	our ethical rules and stuff like that. So let me return to our friend Eric Weinstein for a question
11632600	11637560	that I would ask anyway, but let me let's have a non Russian ask the Russian question.
11640280	11645800	Ask him about the Russian concepts of friendship, science, gender and love versus the American.
11646040	11654920	You can. So there is a there is a deep romanticism that you have
11657080	11665320	that runs to your book, Love and Math. Is part of that something you've picked up from the Russian
11665320	11673320	culture? What can you speak to that fueled both your fascination with math and your fascination?
11673320	11679160	No, your your prioritization of the human experience of love.
11680600	11687400	Good question. I definitely there is some influence of the Russian culture, Russian literature,
11687400	11693560	perhaps, you know, but also, you know, like, there's so many things. How do you how do we develop
11693560	11698680	certain sensibilities? Like, why do we care about this and not that? Like, why do I care, for instance,
11698760	11705160	about, like you said, about this romantic ideal, so to speak of mathematics? That's certainly not
11705160	11709720	something that is automatic. You know, some people care about some people don't. And I'm not saying
11709720	11715160	it is superior or inferior. It's just how my composition, my psychological composition is like
11715160	11722680	that. And it's an interesting question, like, what is the cause of it? So I think that
11722840	11729160	we cannot really know, but there are some aspects of it, of course, the experiences life experiences
11729800	11739080	are bringing family, like I was, you know, I was surrounded by love by my parents on the one hand,
11739080	11746440	but in the other side, perhaps they were a little overprotective of me. So I was kind of like, you
11746440	11755160	know, too much kind of like taking taking care of so then when I develop certain sensitivity,
11755160	11760760	but I was kind of not ready for the challenges of the real world of the real world. So then that
11760760	11767560	that struggle and that and then being lost and then being able to overcome and to learn. And
11768280	11775320	then if you do, you know, if you don't lose, you don't appreciate maybe, but sometimes when
11775880	11780040	we lose something and then regain it, then we cherish it, we appreciate and then becomes
11780040	11789080	unimportant. Also, various difficulties, you know, the upsetting experiences or one could say
11789080	11795560	traumatic experiences growing up, you know, in the Soviet Union, that was not a walk in the park,
11795560	11804520	you know, there were a lot of issues there that I had to go through. And and then it doesn't break
11804520	11813800	you make you stronger. But in my case, what happened was that, you know, some for some of it,
11813800	11817960	it took me 30 years to really come to terms with it and to really understand what happened.
11819320	11827320	It gave me this motivation to to strive to become a mathematician, which maybe I wouldn't
11827320	11832360	have otherwise it charged me supercharged me. I'm talking about, for instance, I experienced with
11832440	11836440	exam at Moscow University. Can you take me through that experience?
11836440	11845240	So this is 1984. We spoke about Orwell earlier. And I was applying to Moscow University
11847080	11853800	mathematics department called Mehmet, which is like for people who don't know, like the place
11853800	11858760	was the only place to study pure mathematics in Moscow period. But also, but also if you want
11858760	11863320	the great places on earth. And it's like a huge building, this, you know,
11864280	11873240	this monolith of a building of Moscow University. So because, as I said, you know, a year earlier,
11873240	11878040	Evgeniy Evgeniy, which converted me into math, capitalizing on my love for physics, quantum
11878040	11883240	physics. And so we spent a whole year studying with him. And I was really kind of at the level of,
11884200	11889880	you know, in some in some subjects, the level of like early graduate graduate studies.
11890760	11898040	So it seemed like it would be a breeze to get into Moscow University. But in fact, little did I know
11898040	11907480	that there was a policy of antisemitism where students like me would be failed by special
11907560	11915480	examiners, mostly during the oral exam with mathematics, but occasionally I would be written
11915480	11923240	tests and stuff. Now, my father is Jewish by blood. It was not religious. His family was not
11923240	11929560	religious. My mom is Russian. And but I was since my last name was my father's name. So it was very
11929560	11936680	easy to to read what my nationality was. And so there was this, can you imagine, there were
11936680	11942520	special people who would screen up applicants who would put aside the files of the undesirables.
11943400	11946840	There would be special examiners who were actually professors at this university
11947720	11954280	who would be designated as those who would take the exam from those undesirables.
11955000	11960200	It was it's almost comical when you look back now. And also like questions why there was no
11960200	11964600	reason other than just hatred of the other. That's how I see it. It's just to give a little bit
11964600	11972520	more color. So because you mentioned nationality, it's a little quirk that perhaps gives an insight
11972520	11977400	to the bigger system that the nationality listed on your birth certificate when you're Jewish is
11977400	11982680	Jewish. And when you're non-Jewish, is this as Russian for me, it was Russian. So first of all,
11982920	11988920	in the inner part, everybody has an internal passport. And there you have first name,
11988920	11997240	pateranemic name, last name, date of birth. So these are four. And the fifth colon is nationality,
11998920	12002760	which comes from the nationality of the parents and so on. In my case, it was written Russian
12002760	12009480	because my mom was Russian, but it didn't save me because I was my dad's last name.
12010280	12017320	And so anyway, this was the toughest experience that I had up until that point.
12018600	12024600	And there was this two people who came into the room where I was the only undesirable. All other
12024600	12030520	kids were being questioned by other examiners, but they told me that we cannot question you.
12030520	12037080	We are waiting for special examiners. So I was like, oh, oh, something is food. And so these
12037080	12041800	two guys came in four hours, basically, were asking me questions, which were not in the
12041800	12045560	program and so on. But I was like, yeah, I was 16 years old. I tried to answer it best I can,
12045560	12051800	but it was a setup. It's been documented since then, there are even lists of problems
12052680	12059560	that were given to undesirables in those days. In my year, no Jewish applicants,
12059560	12065240	as far as I know, Jewish by this metric were accepted. So then I had to go to this.
12067480	12072680	There was one technical school in Moscow, which was the Institute for Oil and Gas Exploration,
12073240	12082040	which had applied mathematics program. And that's where many of the kids who were not
12082040	12091800	accepted to Moscow University ended up. But the point is, and then I was so motivated by this,
12091800	12099560	because I wanted to show those guys that within five years, less than five years,
12099560	12104840	I got a letter from the president of Harvard University inviting me as a visiting professor
12104840	12110520	to Harvard. I was 21, I was barely 21, because I already did some research in the meantime.
12111080	12117160	That's how motivated I was. But the interesting aspect of it is that
12119240	12124760	for the longest time afterwards, I was telling myself a story that nothing really happened.
12125960	12132120	It wasn't so bad. Okay, so I was failed, but I knew that I was going to succeed.
12133480	12139960	It was 30 years later that I finally got to meet that boy, that 16-year-old.
12140520	12148440	That I neglected this time. And I realized that he died, that it was a crashing blow.
12148440	12149080	The innocence?
12149800	12154360	Not just the innocence, because there was no way. It looked like there was no way I could become
12154360	12161880	a mathematician, because if they don't accept me there, it's over. I didn't know that I could
12161880	12167960	actually find this striving applied math program, and then eventually somebody would take me under
12167960	12172760	his wing and so on, and then could move to the United States. That was not in the realm of
12172760	12179480	possibilities. So there was nothing to look forward to. It was clear that it's over. I cannot
12182120	12193640	do what I love. And so when I finally connected to that boy, oh my God, I was a totally different
12193640	12201720	experience. All the pain and all the trauma came to the surface. And it was a kind of a tsunami.
12202520	12208840	I wasn't sure I would survive this. It was so hard. And what happened was I was invited to
12210200	12214520	give a talk about this in New York. It was kind of a spoken word event
12216600	12221160	about science, but like personal experiences related to science. This was almost a year after
12221960	12228520	my book came out. In my book, one of the first chapters is a chapter about this experience.
12229640	12233240	But what I realize now is that I wrote it from the third person perspective.
12233960	12238520	I knew the facts, but I was not emotionally connected to that experience. However,
12239080	12244520	since I wanted to write the book and to connect to my readers, I allowed the boy to write it.
12245560	12250280	So a lot of people were touched by it, and people would say, wow, that chapter, you know,
12250360	12254520	it really got a lot of resonance. It was translated into another language even before the book was
12254520	12261560	published. I was surprised by this because I didn't know yet. So the adult Edward was not
12261560	12271560	yet in touch, but the book gave the outlet to the child. And that kind of started the process.
12272360	12281080	So finally, almost a year later, I'm in New York in this event. And the night before,
12282360	12286440	I'm in my hotel room, and I was like, okay, what am I going to talk about tomorrow?
12286440	12290600	And I take a piece of paper just to, you know, my usual preparation, you know, for things.
12291800	12295800	And then suddenly I have this vision that I will walk up to the microphone tomorrow,
12295800	12306520	and I will just start crying. And I was like, by that time, I already had an insight
12306520	12312360	that it's possible to have that kind of a splitting kind of dissociation. I was like,
12312360	12316920	but things were happening quickly. There was someone in my life who explained to me this idea
12316920	12324120	that some things are under the radar of awareness, but they may still influence you. And a lot of
12324120	12330600	that could be connected to some experiences in your childhood. So I was kind of ready for it
12331240	12336360	from different angles. But I was so surprised because I was like, what is there to remember?
12336360	12341400	I know, I know everything. So then my inner voice says, all right, then you have nothing to worry
12341400	12347720	about. Don't go tomorrow. And you will speak about this. And if you start crying, it's not a
12347720	12353320	problem. I was like, no, I don't want to cry in front of people. I want to find out what it is,
12353320	12363640	what happened. And I sit on my bed, close my eyes, and it came. So it's hard to describe. So this is
12363640	12371800	what the sheer energy of it and how much effort it took to suppress it actually for all these years,
12371800	12377640	how much effort it took to build that panzer, I wouldn't say in Russian, you know, that that
12377720	12384280	hardcore, you know, around myself. So that, and the thing, later I realized there were moments when
12384280	12391720	it could come out. And for instance, I developed this fear of public speaking, all kinds of little
12391720	12398760	things that I now feel were connected. So anyway, I saw what happened now through the eyes of that
12398760	12406200	child. I saw how difficult it was, how crushed he was. And it looked completely hopeless. And I
12406200	12412200	felt like, what's the point of living now for me, now that I know how cruel this world is,
12412200	12418840	which I didn't realize before, because I prefer to wear this pink, you know, the rose colored glasses.
12420360	12426040	But then something happened. It's so strange. It's like you feel that inside of you, there is
12426040	12433880	this dead child. And it is incredibly sad. I mean, it's like, I can't even describe it. But
12433880	12440760	suddenly he comes alive. And suddenly it's like, Oh, he's here. And I had a little talk with him.
12440760	12446680	And I said, look, you know, I know, I know, thank you, I'm so sorry that I neglected you for so long.
12446680	12454120	You know, I didn't know. Thank you for doing this. And it's almost like, you know, I felt like
12454120	12459000	the image came to mind is like a fallen soldier, like you leave a fallen soldier on the battlefield,
12459080	12466680	a wounded soldier. And then you come back to take him with you. And I said, but look,
12466680	12471880	look what we have done. Look at us now. It was not in vain. We are doing okay.
12473000	12484040	And it's kind of almost just like holding, holding, holding that child in that sense of who I am,
12484040	12492120	you know, and feeling it. So the next day, I went to the microphone, and I let him speak for the
12492120	12500280	first time about his experience in his own voice. It was incredible. People were crying and afterwards
12500280	12504600	came up to me and started sharing stories and so on. Because it is a story, it's a universal
12504600	12512120	story. It's archetypal story. It's the story of rejection and being treated unfairly.
12513000	12521240	We all know it. And I think it's so important to realize that it's, it's possible to revisit
12521240	12525960	those moments. It's possible to reconnect to our little ones. It's possible to bring them back.
12527240	12533640	And we are better for it because this changed my life, this experience. Then there were,
12533640	12536520	then suddenly it's like a floodgates that there were many other things that came.
12536840	12544520	That's when I became interested in the dimensions of imagination and intuition and so on. Because
12544520	12549400	suddenly I realized that I was deprived of those, of that possibility of looking at the world
12549400	12554280	through the eyes of a child because that child was frozen in time. I was not connected to him.
12555080	12562760	But suddenly he's with me. And he's like, almost like opens his doors and says, look at this.
12566760	12578600	So if I could ask you about, there's a difficult idea here. There's a tension. I've interacted
12578600	12584920	with a few folks in my personal life and in general that have lived through this experience
12584920	12596440	of unfairness and cruelty in the world as young people. And what wisdom do you draw from
12598040	12604600	the, the, the action you took of not acknowledging that you're a victim to cruelty, but instead
12604600	12612680	just working your ass off, working harder. And then this, the flip side of that is you
12612680	12617880	eventually reconnecting with the cruelty that you experienced. Because if you did that early on,
12618440	12622680	I was not ready for it. It is a defense mechanism. I could be, I could have come,
12622680	12626040	you know, there were kids who commit suicide after this experience. I could have committed
12626040	12631720	suicide because it's too much. And it is well known afterwards, of course, I became aware
12631720	12638280	of all the literature about childhood trauma and so on. And I have been, I've been speaking
12638280	12645320	publicly about it since then too. And so, you know, it is well known issue and well known
12647080	12655240	kind of universal phenomenon. I think that interesting enough, even though now I see a lot
12655240	12661080	of discussion of it, now that my eyes are open, but somehow before I didn't see it. So that,
12661080	12666520	which also shows you how our confirmation bias kind of like how we screen ourselves, how we turn
12666520	12670840	the blind eye to things which do not confirm our views or for which we are not yet ready. And by the
12670840	12680520	way, nobody should push to do it too soon. I'm glad I developed certain strengths. I was confident.
12682520	12689480	I was strong to withstand this. And if I weren't, who knows how it could turn out. So it is a very
12689480	12695080	subtle kind of alchemical process, which I don't think there is a recipe, there's a formula.
12696520	12701480	The reason I'm talking about this is just to share this experience, because I think that
12701480	12707240	the only thing we can do in this in some sense is to share with each other, because then we can find,
12708440	12715480	for instance, if somebody shared with me, it would naturally lead me maybe to get closer to that,
12715480	12719640	to kind of understanding. It's really just personal stories. It's not,
12719960	12726440	obviously, there is a, there is a component where professionals could be involved,
12726440	12730840	like professional therapists and so on. In my case, it somehow happened miraculously.
12731480	12736520	Well, I did have support, but not from professional therapists, but from like dear friends.
12737240	12742440	So I did, I did have, you didn't, you do need, I had somebody at the time who basically held my hand
12742440	12746520	and through this experience. Yes, it was invaluable and it could not be done otherwise.
12747080	12752040	So I think it's very common. And here's the thing,
12755480	12761160	I would not do it in any other way. When you, when I reconnected,
12762680	12769800	and I saw all the horrors and so on, but I also was able to see that my examiners were victims
12769800	12776920	of their own situation, that they became, they fell for this bogus
12777720	12783960	theories, or maybe it was more of a issue of career advancement or something. And I also
12783960	12788920	realized they must have suffered as well, because they must have had some kind of conciousness
12788920	12794680	of a conscience about it, that acting in this way towards sort of basically kids, you know.
12795960	12798920	So it's not, it wasn't pretty from their point of view. So I could forgive them
12800760	12806040	and I could like also appreciate what a, what a boost of energy it gave me.
12807000	12812280	If I was accepted and I was just where I was a first year student, I lived, I would live in a
12812280	12817400	dorm because I was in the, you know, I'd be probably partying and drinking and who knows what,
12817400	12824360	maybe I wouldn't even become a mathematician. But this focused me like a laser without me even
12824360	12829640	thinking about it. It just happened. I didn't care about anything but doing mathematics.
12829960	12836040	And it paid off, you know, it changed my life. So was it good or bad? Paradox.
12837640	12843480	Seems like life is full of those. You said you lost your father four years ago.
12843480	12847480	Yeah. What have you learned about life from your dad?
12848200	12855560	That's another big one. Yeah, because I was very close to him. And it was tough, it was tough.
12856520	12864520	And I was not, I was sort of not ready for it because up until that point I lived pretending
12864520	12871480	that death does not exist. When my grandparents died, I was already in the US. So it was very
12871480	12878440	convenient and I couldn't go back. So I grieved, but it kind of was a bit abstract for me. I didn't
12878520	12885480	see their dead bodies, you know, I didn't bury them and so on. So I waited till the
12886200	12892760	so the first death in my life was my father, like really close loved ones. And I was absolutely
12892760	12899400	devastated. You know, he was such an amazing creature, such an amazing human being. He was
12899400	12906680	the kindest, the smartest, the most funny, just really funny and just really fun to be with,
12906680	12911320	you know, this is what I miss, obviously. I mean, I would just love to hang out with him.
12913640	12919080	And then suddenly he's not there. So it's tough, but it kind of changed my perspective.
12919080	12926280	You miss him? I miss him tremendously. I miss him tremendously. But in a way,
12926280	12931800	I learned that he never left me in some sense. I mean, it sounds so, words are so, you know, like
12932360	12939160	they are, you could not express in words this, what I'm trying to say, but
12940280	12950360	Do you carry him with you? Yeah. But in some sense, I always did. And I saw that, that it's
12950360	12957320	always been, it was really, we were one in some sense, you know, like we were, but there was this
12957320	12969640	experience of two people being together and that I missed tremendously. But he gave me so much.
12969640	12975560	And I, you know, let me tell you one aspect of it, for instance, when he was a kid,
12975560	12981160	his father was sent to Gulag on bogus pretenses, right? So he, when he was 16,
12981160	12985480	he applied to a university. He wanted to become a theoretical physicist. By the way,
12985480	12991560	my love for theoretical physics was the large extent because of that. And he was not accepted,
12991560	12997480	even though he was brilliant, because he was the son of the enemy of the people. And he
12999480	13005640	kind of broke him this experience that he didn't care when he was, you know, he went to technical
13005640	13011320	school and he didn't really care. That's my take on it. And then he ended up in this, in this,
13011320	13015480	in this little provincial town and he thought he would escape from it as soon as possible.
13015480	13023320	And then he met my mother and they fell in love. And so I am sort of the product, the product of
13023320	13032120	that, you know, but then what I learned is that because he was not able to overcome that specific
13032120	13039000	experience, it felt to me to do it. And if I didn't, my son or my daughter would have, I think that
13039000	13044360	that was one of the things I learned that was not by chance that about the same age
13045320	13050200	for slightly different reasons. I was subjected to the same kind of unfairness and cruelty.
13051400	13057640	And I, in some ways, I feel like I did it for him also. I always, because he was also always so
13057640	13064280	proud of me. I was so happy. And I was, I had this tremendous gift twice. I was invited by American
13064280	13072840	mathematical society to give this big lectures twice. It was in 2012 and in 2018. And both times
13072840	13078920	they were in Boston. It could be anywhere in the US. Both times was in Boston, walking distance
13078920	13085640	from my parents' place. So he could be there in my mom as well. And that was such a gift that he
13085640	13092440	was beaming, you know, like seeing me on the stage. So, you know.
13094200	13099800	Now that he's no longer here and it's just you. Well, I still have my mom. I still have my sister.
13099800	13103160	Yeah. But as a man, there's some aspect that it's,
13106600	13111880	that it does hit you hard. Are you afraid of your own death? Do you think about your death?
13112760	13118600	Are you afraid of it? I have a certain conceptual view of life and death today,
13118600	13122120	which is informed by my experiences. In particular, going through my father's death.
13122920	13129400	And that is something which cannot be conceptualized. Like that experience, like you cannot
13130440	13137720	give it to somebody. One thing I will say is that I felt that what it was, it was actually love,
13137720	13146120	totally exposed, like naked. And you try to throw, it is so acute. So being facing that love
13146760	13154200	is incredibly painful because it's so intense. When a person is alive, we have conversation,
13154200	13158920	we have wars, we have some actions, we have some stuff is going on and it puts a filter.
13158920	13166600	So we rarely actually feel love in this totally, completely pure, unadulterated state.
13166600	13171000	But when a person dies, it's there. And it's staring at you. And no matter what you do,
13171000	13175880	you cannot turn away. Like, I tried to, it's like, almost I felt like I want to throw a blanket over
13175880	13185320	it. It burns, like immediately, like boom, gone. It's there. Live through it. And I was, I kept
13185320	13189160	saying to myself, just live through it, live through it. That's how you, and that's how you
13189160	13195560	know, also learn what is love, for example, what is it really? What is love? What is life also?
13195560	13204200	Because I was completely, I had no idea. And, and then you kind of learn that, okay, so maybe
13204840	13211640	it's not quite, there is more to it. There is more to it. There's more to this experience
13211640	13219720	than what can be put in a concept or in a, in a, in a sentence, in a, in a, maybe poetry or music
13220680	13227160	can do some justice to it. But if so, then my own life has that component, has that dimension,
13227720	13233880	which is beyond anything I can say about it, you know, and even though I love this being this,
13233880	13241480	playing this role, I love it. And I kind of, it kind of makes me feel different about all
13241480	13246360	kinds of difficulties that arise because it's almost like I want to enjoy it because that's
13246360	13253720	what being human is. It's being, it's being terrified. It's being frustrated. It's being
13253720	13262680	self-loathing sometimes. It's not knowing, but also being joyful and just like, ah, let's just
13262680	13269320	enjoy it. Kind of all of it, like that's why you came here for in some sense, you know, it's like
13269320	13275560	not trying to run away from things, but kind of trying to just live through them and appreciate.
13275640	13279560	So the biggest thing is gratitude in some sense. It's just gratitude. So thank you for letting me
13279560	13284200	play. It's gratitude for every single moment, even if it's dark, even if it's a loss. Yes. And
13284200	13289480	that's why I am so, people around me, they all say that it's a total doom and gloom and the world
13289480	13296920	is ending. And I'm like, first of all, that's how you see it. Okay. That's not the only point of
13296920	13301560	view, but also even if it is like, that's your challenge. Like, what are you going to do about
13301560	13306600	it? Stop complaining about other people. Do something yourself. How can you make it a better
13306600	13312920	world? You know. And I think all of that starts with just the gratitude for the moment to be able
13312920	13320680	to play this game. Yeah. How beautiful it is. What we've talked about love, but let me ask,
13320680	13326600	what role does love play in this whole game in the human condition? It's like the glue, you know,
13326600	13334360	it's like for me. And it's not because people say love is like for a human being, like a romantic
13334360	13339640	love, which is a huge component of it, obviously, because it's so, so beautiful to be able to
13340280	13346920	express it in this way. But it could be love for what you do for your passion for something, you
13346920	13355560	know, and, or, or love for, for your, for your friends, for instance, or love, it doesn't have to
13355560	13364200	be. And so in some sense, that's, that's what it's all about. And ultimately, because living without
13364200	13372040	love, it's kind of bland, boring. And so. And I don't think it's possible for science to explain
13372040	13377960	exactly what it is. You can do a evolutionary biology perspective, you can talk about some kind
13377960	13384280	of sociology perspective, psychology perspective, but the experience, the intensity where you forget
13384280	13392600	or time where reminded becomes an illusion, and everything just freezes. And then it's kind of
13392600	13399000	beautiful and painful to hear you say that when you experience love, the deepest is when you lost it.
13399000	13404600	Yes. But in a sense, you can say that you could not have one without the other. I could not have
13404600	13411720	that deep connection with my father, like really on so, so many levels. If there weren't a moment,
13411720	13415240	that's how I see it. And I'm not trying to say that's how everybody should see. For instance,
13415240	13421640	I respect Ray Kurzweil. I respect and I feel, and I almost like I feel good bumps right now. I feel
13422520	13431400	that desire to reconnect. Even if it is in the form of a, you know, a computer program, let's be
13431400	13437400	honest about it. I find it to be very moving. I find it very moving. And I understand because he
13437400	13441800	actually didn't have a chance to spend much time. You know, I think he was 16 or 17 when he was a
13441800	13446280	teenager. His dad died. I was lucky because my father died. I was much older. I've had so many
13446280	13452360	moments with him, but that's not my thing. Like, I think it is a feature. It's not a bug and it
13452360	13456840	sounds crazy. Like I would love, I would give anything to have him here right now. Right now,
13457400	13462440	everything I have, I give it away right now. Where do I sign? Just see him for one hour.
13462440	13471320	I promise you, I will. But I also know that then I'll still lose him or I will die or whatever.
13471320	13476760	You know, so that thing, so what is, why is it so worse to just hold on to holding on to it?
13476760	13481480	Why? Why are we holding on to this? And I am the first sucker. I'm the first one to hold on,
13481480	13487000	but I'm questioning it now. Like, is there another way to approach life where you just, you know,
13487000	13495560	how Buddha is like, just let it go. Enjoy and let it go. Enjoy and let it go. Is it possible?
13496360	13498200	Accept the paradox of it.
13499080	13505000	Well, ask me in a couple of years, you know, I will report. But I think that, but to my mathematical
13505000	13512120	mind, it sounds like a very interesting idea, to be honest. Because to me, the idea of holding
13512120	13517560	is, sounds like an impasse. Because no matter, in all my experience, and if you look in history,
13517560	13522200	every time somebody's holding, you know, is how they said in the matrix, whatever has a beginning
13522200	13527160	has an end. It's like, you cannot go around it. If you have a beginning, you will have an end.
13527160	13532680	So then might as well just enjoy it and not worry too much about extending it longer.
13533880	13536200	That's how I see it now. But maybe tomorrow will be something else.
13538440	13542680	Yeah, the roller coaster life, the paradox of life. In other words, you're an incredible human
13542680	13546360	being. I've been a fan for a long time. Thank you for writing love and math. Thank you. Thank you
13546360	13552600	for being who you are, being both one of the greatest living mathematicians and still
13553800	13561240	childlike wanderer of the exploring then how this whole world works, the nature of the universe.
13561240	13564280	And thank you so much for speaking with me today. This is amazing.
13565160	13566680	It's a pleasure. Thank you.
13567880	13571640	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Edward Frankel. To support this podcast,
13571640	13576120	please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words
13576360	13583480	from Sophia Kovalevska, a Russian mathematician. It is impossible to be a mathematician
13583480	13592280	without being a poet in the soul. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
