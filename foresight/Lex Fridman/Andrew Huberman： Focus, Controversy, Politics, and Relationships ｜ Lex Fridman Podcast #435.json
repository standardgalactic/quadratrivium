{"text": " Hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure. Can you read the quote once more? Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman his fifth time on the podcast He is the host of the Huberman lab podcast and is an amazing scientist teacher human being and Someone i'm grateful to be able to call a close friend Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now called protocols and operating manual for the human body This is the lex freeman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends Here's andrew Huberman You think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting? Definitely I mean I came up within and then on the periphery of skateboard culture And for the record, I was not a great skateboarder I always have to say that because skateboarders are relentless If you call something you didn't do or whatever I mean, I could do a few things and I loved the community And I still have a lot of friends in that community jim feebo at deluxe. You can look him up He's kind of the man behind the whole scene. I know tony hawk, dany whale these guys I got to see them come up and get big and stay big in many cases start huge companies like Danny and calling the case our dc Some people have a long life and something some don't but one thing I observed and learned a lot from in skateboarding At the level of observing the skateboarders and then the ones that started companies and then what I also observed in science and still observe is You do it for a while You do it at the highest possible level for you and then at some point You pivot and you start supporting the young talent coming in In fact, the greatest scientists people like richard axl Catherine do lock There are many other labs in neuroscience carl diceroth They're not just known for doing great science. They're known for Mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs and I think in podcasting I am very fortunate. I got in in a fairly early wave not the earliest wave But thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave And I'll continue to go as long as it feels right and I feel like I'm doing good in the world and providing good But I'm already starting to scout talent My company that I started with rob more psychom media A couple other guys in there too. Mike play back our photographer ian macky chris ray martin fobes We are a company that produces podcasts right now. That's huberman lab podcast But we're launching a new podcast perform a dr. Andy galpin Nice And we want to do more of that kind of thing finding a really great talent highly qualified people credential people and I've got A new kind of obsession with scouring the internet Looking for the young talent in science in health and related fields And so will there be a final episode of the hlp Yeah, I mean bullet buster cancer Aside, you know someday they'll be the very last and thank you for your interest in science And i'll clip out Yeah, I love the idea of walking weight and not be dramatic about it Right when it feels right you can leave and you can come back whenever the fuck you want, right? John steward did this well with the daily show I think that was during the 2016 election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away Dave chappelle for different Reasons walked away disappeared came back gave away so much money Didn't care and then came back and was doing like stand-up in the park in the middle of nowhere Genius you have habib who undefeated walks away at the very top of of a sport. Is he coming back? No It's the least we don't know. Yeah, right. You don't know. I don't know if he bears everywhere or words Yeah, I think you know, it's um, it's always a call, you know, you know the last Few years have been tremendous growth. We launched in january 2021 and even this last year 2024 has been huge growth you know in all sorts of ways it's been wild and We have some short form content planned That's 30 minute shorter episodes that really distill down the critical elements. We're also Thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting so there's always the thought and the discussion but when it comes to like when to hang up your cleats, you know, it's like There just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in Then focusing on self and so there will come a time for that And I think it's critical. I mean, again, I saw this in skateboarding like danny And callin and danny's brother daemon started dc with ken block the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago rally car driver and They eventually sold it. I think to quicksilver or something like that, but They're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas but they brought in the next You know on the next line of amazing riders for the plan b thing, you know, paul rodriguez for skateboarders They know who this is now in science There are scientists like fine men for instance. I don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring So there are scientists who are phenomenal Like beyond world class, right multi-generational world class who don't make good mentors I'm not saying he wasn't a good mentor, but that's not what he's known for and then there are scientists who are known for being excellent scientists and and great mentors and I think there's no higher Um celebration to be had at the end of one's career if you can look back and like hey I put some really important knowledge into the world people made use of that knowledge And guess what you spawned all these other scientific offspring or sport offspring or podcast offspring I mean in some ways we look to rogan and to some of the other earlier podcasts is like they You know, they paved the way ronda patrick first science podcast out there so You know it eventually The baton passes but fortunately right now everybody's active and it and it feels really good Yeah, well you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also Uh a different kind of way where you have uh, something like uh Grisha gregory perlman the mathematician who refused to accept the fields medal So he's one of the greatest living mathematicians and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the fields medal What did he do after he left mathematics? life Private 100% I respect that he's become essentially a recluse is these photos of him Looking very broke like he could use the money. He he turned away the money. He turned away everything you know, there's there's You just have to listen to the inner voice You have to listen to yourself and make the decisions that don't make any sense for the rest of the world and make sense to you I mean bob dillon didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. Yeah. Yeah, he probably grew in no variety for that Yeah, maybe just doesn't like going in sweden, but it seemed like a big fun trip I think they do it in a nice time of years, but hey, that's his right. He earned that right I think the best artists aren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for the fame or the money They're doing it because they love the heart. Yeah, that's the the rick ruven thing. He got a verb it through Download your inner thing I don't think we've talked about this that this obsession that I have about how rick has this way of being very very still in his body But keeping his mind very active as a practice When spent some time with him in italy last june And we would tread water and his pool in the morning and listen to history of rock and roll and hundred songs Um amazing podcast by the way. It is yeah And um, and then he would spend a fair amount of time during the day, you know in this kind of meditative state Where his mind is very active body very still And then carl dice roth when he came on my podcast talked about how he forces himself to sit still and think in complete sentences late at night after his kids go to sleep and You know, there's a state of mind rapid eye movement sleep Where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active and people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more elaborate emotion filled dreams and the source of many ideas and there are other examples Einstein People described him as taking walks around the princeton campus then pausing and Would ask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a high rate um So, you know, this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about some incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of Stilling the body while keeping the mind deliberately very active Very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report, you know Great ideas coming to them in the shower while running So it can be the opposite as well where the body is very active and the and the mind is perhaps more on Kind of like a default mode network not really focusing on any one specific thing You know interesting as a there's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians have talked to they talk about sleep deprivation And going crazy hours through the night obsessively pursuing a thing And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get rest right and and we know we just did this sixth episode special series on sleep with matt walker we know that When you deprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep you get a rebound in rapid eye movement sleep You get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep And matt talks about this in the podcast and he did an episode on sleep and Creativity sleep and memory and rapid eye movement sleep comes up multiple times in that series There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep people are coming off cannabis often will suffer from Insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping they like dream like crazy Cannabis is a very controversial topic right now. Oh, yeah, I saw that what happened There's a bunch of drama around Episode you did on cannabis. Yeah, we did a episode about cannabis talked about the health Benefits and the potential risks right it's neither here nor there It depends on the person depends on the age depends on genetic background a number of other things We published that episode well over a year ago and it had no issues online so to speak And then a clip of it was put to x where you know The real action occurs as you know your favorite box Yeah, yeah, the the the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves That is x versus instagram or youtube there was Kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the cannabis research field to phds and mds Yeah, there were people on our side. There were people on our side. I mean You know the the statement that got Things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals there's a High potential for inducing psychosis with high thc containing cannabis for certain individuals not all That sparked some issues There was really a split, you know See this in different fields it There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that In my opinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university venue Especially among colleagues, but that's fine. You know, we're all grown-ups. Well for me from my perspective. It was strangely rude and it had an era of like elitism that to me Was it the source of the problem during covet that led to the distrust of science And the the popularization of disrespecting science because so many scientists spoke with an arrogance and a douche baggery That I wish we would have a little bit less of yeah, it's tough because most academics Don't understand that people outside the university system are they don't they're not familiar with like the inner workings of science and And the culture and so you have to be very careful how you present when you're a university professor And when yeah, so, you know, he came out swinging at some, you know A four letter word type language and he was obviously upset about so I simply said what I would say anywhere Which was hey look you come on the podcast. Let's chat and Why don't you give your tell me where I'm wrong and let's discuss and and Fortunately, he agreed And initially he said well, no, how can I be sure you're not going to misrepresent me and so I said we got on a Dm then an email then eventually phone call and just said hey listen like you're welcome to record the whole conversation We've never done a gotcha on my podcast and let's just get to the heart of the matter. I think this this little controversy is perfect kindling for for a really great discussion and And he had some other conditions that we worked out and and I and I felt like Cool like he's really interested although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on twitter I will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule I said it will fly you out or put you up. He said no he wants to fly himself He really wants to make sure that there's like kind of a space between um I think some of the perception of science and health podcasts in the academic community is that It's all designed to sell something. No, we run ads so it can be free to everyone else Yeah, but I think look in the end. Um, he agreed and I'm excited for the conversation It was interesting because In the wake of that little exchange There's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol in many in many cultures as Within the united states as when I say cultures. I mean demographics The united states as the as the drug of choice um There have been people highlighting the issues of potential psychosis in high thc containing and so it's Kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of on board certain elements that you know, I put forward and I think there's some controversy as to whether or not the different strains the indicas and sativas I have are biologically different, etc. So we'll get down into the weeds pun intended During that one and I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to A direct criticism online about Um scientific content in a way that really promoted like oh here the idea of inviting a particular guest And so it's great. Let's get a guest to um his expert in cannabis I I believe I could be wrong about this that he's a behavioral neuroscientist is slightly different training but look he seems highly credentialed to be fun and we You know, we welcome that kind of exchange I I'm not being diplomatic. I'm just saying like it's cool. Like he's coming on No, you you know, and he was friendly on the phone, right? Like he literally came out online and was like basically like kind of like fu Like f this and fu, but you get someone on the phone. It's like, hey, how's it going? And then like, oh, yeah Well, you know, I there was an immediate apology of like, hey, listen. I came out. Normally. I'm like not like that But online, you know, you got a different. Yeah. Okay, so it's a little bit like it's a little bit like jiu-jitsu, right? People say all sorts of things I guess but if they if you're like, all right, well Let's go then it's probably a different story You know, it's not like jiu-jitsu because the jiu-jitsu people don't talk shit because they know what the consequences are Let me let me just say on mic and off mic. You have been very respectful towards this person And I'm look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been That said to me that guy was being a dick and when you graciously politely invited him on the podcast He was still talking down to you the whole time. So I really admire and look forward to listening to you talk to him But I hope others don't do that like you are a positive humble voice Exploring all the interesting aspects of science like you want to learn if there you've got anything wrong You want to learn about it the way he was being a dick I was just Hurt a little bit not because of him but because like there's some people I really really admire Brilliant scientists that are not their best cells On twitter on x definitely. I don't understand what happens to their brain. Well, they regress They they regress and and they also are protected, you know, you know, when you remove the I mean no scientific argument should ever come to physical blows, right? But when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody, um People will throw all sorts of stones at a distance, you know an over a wall and they've got their Their wife or their husband or their boyfriend or their dog or their cat to go cuddle with them afterwards um But you get in a room and it's like, you know confrontational people In real life are are pretty rare But hopefully if they do it they're like willing to back it up with knowledge in this case, right? We're not talking about physical altercation. Yeah, he kept coming and he kept putting on conditions How do I know you want this and I was like, well, you can record the conversation How do I know you want that? Listen, we'll pay for you to come out. How do you know and eventually he just kind of relented? and um And it to his credit, you know, he's agreed to come on I mean he still has to show up But once he does, you know, we'll treat him right like we would any other guest Yeah, you treat people really well and I I just hope that people are a little bit nicer on the internet Yeah, well, you know x is an interesting one because you it thickens your skin You know to just to go on there. I mean you have to be ready to deal with sure But I can still criticize people for for being douchebags because like that's still not good inspiring behavior like especially for scientists That should be sort of symbols of Scientific thinking which requires intellectual humility Humility is a big part of that and twitter is a good place to illustrate that Yeah, eight years ago. I used to I was a student in ta then Instructor and then directed a cold spring harbour course on visual neuroscience. These are summer courses that Explore different topics and at night we would host Um, what we hoped were battles in front of the students Where you'd get two people on it, you know, would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that would first, you know Restore vision to the blind kind of arguments You know, kind of like it's kind of a silly argument because there's gonna be a combination of both, right? but You'd get these great arguments But the arguments were always couched in data and occasionally you'd get somebody would go like or would curse or something But it was the rare very um very well placed You know, um insult it wasn't you know coming out swinging Um, I think ultimately, you know twitter is a record of people's behavior That the internet is a record of people's behavior and here i'm not talking about news reports about people's behavior I'm talking about how people show up Online up is really important. You've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect and You know, you just you would hope that people would grow from that example Well, I'll tell you that the the podcasters that i'm scouting it's their energy But it's also how they treat other people how they respond to comments and um, you know We're blessed to have pretty significant reach when we put out a podcast like someone else's podcast It goes far and wide so like a skateboard team like a laboratory where you're selecting people to be in your lab You're you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and they're collegial Etiquette and etiquette is is lacking nowadays But you're in the suit and tie bringing it back bringing it back Uh, you said that your conversation with james hollis A union psychoanalyst had a big impact on you. What do you mean? james hollis is a 84 year old union psychoanalyst who's written 17 books including under Saturn shadow Which is on the healing and trauma of men the eating eden project. Excuse me, which is about relationships and creating a life I discovered james hollis in an online lecture that was recorded. I think in san diego. It's on youtube The audio is terrible called creating a life And this was somewhere in the 2011 to 2015 span I can't remember and I was on my way to europe and I called my girlfriend at the time I was like, I just found the most incredible lecture i've ever heard and I he talks about the shadow he talks about Your developmental upbringing and how you either align with or go 180 degrees off your Parents tendencies and values in certain areas. He talked about The specific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life so it's always been a dream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast and He wasn't able to travel so our team went out to dc and sat down with him we rarely do that nowadays people come to our studio and He came in he had some surgeries recently and he kind of came in with some assistance from a you know a cane and then sat down and just Just blew my mind it from start to finish He didn't miss a syllable and every sentence that he spoke was like a quotable sentence of with real potency and Actionable items. I think one of the things that was most striking To me was how he said when we take ourselves out of stimulus and response And we just force ourselves to spend some time in the quiet of our thoughts While walking or while seated or while lying down doesn't have to be meditation, but it could be that We access our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want And that if we do that practice repeatedly 10 minutes a day here 15 minutes a day there that we start to really touch into Our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take But that so often we just stay in stimulus response. We just do do do do do, which is great. We have to be productive um, but we miss those um important messages and interestingly he also Put forward this idea of what is this like get up shut up suit up. Yeah something like that like get out of bed suit up And shut up and get to work. He also has that in him kind of a Goggins type mindset So be able to turn off all this self-reflection and self analysis and just get shit done get shit done But then also take dedicated time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind and he quotes shakespeare and he quotes yung and he quotes Everybody through history with with incredible accuracy and um and in exactly the way Needed to drive home a point, but that conversation to me was one that I really felt like okay, you know If I don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason That one's in the can and I feel really great about it. It's it to me. It's the most important guest recording we've ever done um In particular because he has wisdom And while I hope he lives to be 204 Chances are he's got another what 20 30 years with us. Hopefully More but I really really wanted to capture that information and get it out there So I'm very very proud of that one um And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him young old male female whatever and you're gonna get something of value What do you think about this idea? of the shadow that uh The good the bad that we were press That hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves. That's there. You think there's like a ocean We don't have direct access to yes Yeah, young said it we have all things inside of us and we do and some people are more in touch with those than others and Some people it's repressed. I mean does that mean that we could all be You know horrible people or marvelous people Benevolent people perhaps I think that um Thankfully more often than not people lean away from the like violent and harmful parts of their their shadow, but I think spending time thinking about you know ones Shadow shadows is super important. How how else are we going to grow otherwise? you know, we have these unconscious blind spots of denial or um Repression or whatever, you know, the psychiatrists tell us But yeah, it clearly exists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do we have neural circuits for altruism um, and no one's born without these things and some people they're atrophied and some people they're hypertrophied but Looking inward and and recognizing what's there is key Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what rick rubin is accessing when he goes silent Silent body active mind That's interesting. What is it for you? What place do you go to? That generates ideas that helps you generate ideas. I have a lot of new practices around this I mean, I'm all like always exploring for protocols. I have to it's like in my nature um When when I went and spent time with rick, I I tried to adopt his practice of staying very still and just letting stuff You know come to the surface or the dystherothian way of Formulating complete sentences and while being still in the body what I I found works better is what my good friend tim armstrong Does to write music he writes music every day. He's a music producer. He's obviously a singer guitar player for rancid um, and he's helped dozens and dozens and dozens of female pop artists and punk rock artists write great songs and many of the famous songs that you've heard from other artists Tim helped them write Tim Wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night and what he does is he'll start drawing or painting So what he's done and joni mitchell talks about this too. You find some creative outlet that's like 15 degrees off center from your Main creative outlet and you do that thing. So for me, that's drawing. I like doing anatomical drawings Neuroscience based drawing drawn neurons that kind of thing and if I do that for a little while My mind starts churning on the the nervous system and biology and then I come up with Areas I'd like to explore for the podcast Ways I'd like to address certain topics right now I'm very interested in autonomic control of beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to control their pupil sizes And without changing luminance through a bio feedback mechanism um, and that gives them control over their so-called automatic autonomic nervous system And I've been looking at what the circuitry is and it's it's beautiful. So I'll draw the circuitry That we know underlies autonomic function and as I'm doing that I'm thinking Oh, like what about autonomic control and those people that supposedly can control their pupil size Then you go in and there's a paper published in nature press one of the nature journals And there's a recent paper on this like oh cool And then we talk about this and then how could this be put into a kind of a post or how could this? You know, so doing things that are about 15 degrees off center from your main thing is a great way to access I believe that the circuits for in tim's case painting goes to songwriting I think for Joni Mitchell that was also the case, right? I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting For rick. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's listening to podcasts. I don't know that that's his business. Do you have anything that you like to Focus on that allows you then an easier transition into your main creative work No, I'd really like to focus on emptiness and silence So I pick the dragon. I have to slay. So whatever the problem I have to work on and I just sit there And stare at I love how fucking linear you are And I just and if there's no if you're tired, I'll just sit I believe in the in the power of just waiting and Usually I'll stop being tired Or the energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere But there needs to be a silence and an emptiness. It's an empty room. Just me and the dragon and We wait, that's it. Like if it's a usually with programming you're thinking about a particular design like how do I design this thing To solve this problem Any cognitive enhancers? I've got it quite the gallery in front of me. Well, that's right. Yeah Should we walk through this? Yeah, this is not there's not a sales thing. It's just Um, I tend to do this bounce back and forth your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices So water all my refrigerator. I know right. There's no food in there. There's water There's element which they now have canned. Yeah, and yes, they're a podcast sponsor for both of us But that's not why I cracked one of these open. I like them provide their they're cold And that's by the way, my least favorite flavors. I was saying that's that's the reason it's still left in the fridge The cherry one is really good. The black cherry. There's an orange one Yeah, I pushed the um the sled this morning and pulled the sled for my workout at the gym And and it was hot today here in austin. So um some salt is good and then matina urba mate zero sugar full confession I helped develop this i'm a partial owner, but I love urba mate half argentine been drinking mate since i was a Little kid there's actually a photo somewhere on the internet when i'm like three sitting on my grandfather's lap sipping mate out the Gourd and then this my fun interesting. This is just a little bit of coffee With a scoop of brian johnson gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened cocoa So I put that in chocolate and I like it it just for the taste Well, actually nukes my appetite and since i'm we're not going out to dinner tonight until later. I figure that's good Yeah, brian's an interesting one, right? He's really pushing this this thing the optimization of everything Although he just heard his ankle. He posted a photo. He heard his ankle So now he's injecting bpc body protection compound 157 which many many people are taking by the way I did an episode on peptides I should just say, you know bpc 157 one of the known effects in animal models Is angiogenesis like development of new vasculature, which can be great In some context, but also if you have a tumor you don't really want to vascularize that tumor anymore So I worry about people taking bpc 157 continually but um And there's very little human data. I think there's like one study and it's a lousy one. So a lot of animal data Some of the peptides Are interesting. However, there's one that I've experimented with a little bit called pinealyn Which um, I find even if I've just taken it twice a week before sleep Then it times it seems to do something to the Circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other days when I don't take it I get unbelievably tired at that time that normally I would do the injection These are things that I'll experiment with for a couple weeks and then typically stop maybe try something else but I stay out of Things that really stimulate any of like a major hormone pathways When it comes to peptides, there's actually a really good question of how do you experiment? Like how long do you try to think to figure out if it works for you? Well, I'm very sensitive to these things. So I and I have been doing a lot of things for a long time So if I add something in it's always one thing at a time and I notice right away If it does not make me feel good like there's a lot of excitement about some of the so-called growth hormone secretogogs hypermoralin, testemoralin, sermoralin Um, I've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've Nuked my rap and eye movement sleep But given me a lot of deep sleep, which doesn't feel good to me, but other people like them I also just Generally try and avoid Taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into all sorts of issues But some people take them safely But usually after about four or five days I know if I like something or I don't and then I move on, but I am not super adventurous with these things I know people that will take cocktails of peptides with multiple things. They'll try anything That's not me and I do blood work um, but also I'm you know, I'm mainly reading papers and podcasting and um, I'm Teaching a course next spring. Stanford. I'm gonna do a big undergraduate course um, so I'm trying to develop that course and things like that so Um, I don't need to lift more weight or run further than I already do which is not that much weight or far as it is All right, you're not going to the olympics. You're not trying to no truly maximize some aspect of your performance No, and I'm not and I'm not trying to get down below whatever, you know, seven percent body fat or something I don't have those kinds of goals So hydration electrolytes caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing and then and then here's one that I think I brought out for discussion. This is a piece of Nicarat. They're not a sponsor um nicotine is an interesting compound it will raise blood pressure and it um Is probably not safe for everybody, but you know, the nicotine is gaining in popularity like crazy mainly these um Pouches that people put in the lip not we're not talking about. I'm smoking vaping dipping or snuffing you know, my interest in nicotine started this was in 2010 I was visiting columbia medical school and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist richard axl won the noble prize Co-recipient with linda buck for the um discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction Brilliant guy. He's probably in his late 70s now probably. Yeah, and he kept popping nicorette in his mouth And I was like, what's this about and he said, oh, well, this was just anecdote, right? But he said but he said this he said, oh, well, you know, it protects against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's I said it does and he goes, yeah, I don't know if he was kidding or not He's known for making jokes and then he said that when he used to smoke It really helped his focus and creativity But then he quit smoking because he went lung cancer and he found that he couldn't focus as well So he would choose nicorette. So occasionally like right now Well, each I do a half a piece, but I'm not russian So I'm a little, you know, you know, did you spot the whole thing in your mouth? So I'll do a couple milligrams every now and again And it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular, but you fast all day You're still doing one meal a day one meal a day. Yeah. Yeah, I did a nicotine pouch with Rogan at dinner And I got high. Yeah, that's a lot That's like usually six or eight milligrams I know people that get a canister of zin Take one a day pretty soon. They're taking a canister a day. So you have to be very careful. I will only allow myself two pieces of nicorette total per week And you will notice that You know in the day after you use it, you know, sometimes your your throat will feel a little bit like Like a little spasmy like you might want to cough once or twice And so, you know, if you're a singer or your podcast or something you have to do a long podcast You want to just be mindful of but yeah, you're supposed to kind of like keep it in your cheek and Now here we go, but it did make me Intensely focused in a way that was a little bit scary because um the nucleus basalis Is in the you know, basal forebrain nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out axons little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere and when you focus on one particular Topic matter or one particular area of your visual field or listening to something and focusing visually We know that there's a an elaboration of the amount of acetylcholine release there and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites there So it's a kind of an attentional modulation by acetylcholine. So you're getting in with nicotine. You're getting a Exogenous or artificial heightening of that circuitry and the time I had talk of Carlson on the podcast. He told me that apparently It helps him as he said publicly keep his Love life vibrant really it caused a visa constriction Like he literally said it makes his dick very hard. He said that publicly also Okay, well as little as I want to think about Tucker Carlson's sex life no disrespect uh the Major effect of nicotine on the vascular my understanding is that it causes vasoconstriction not vasodilation drugs like cialis to dallafill Viagra etc vasodilators they allow more blood flow Um Nicotine does the opposite less blood flow to the periphery, but provided dosages are kept low and I don't recommend people use it frequently Or at all and I don't recommend young people use it, you know, um, you know 25 and younger brain's very plastic at that time and um, and certainly smoking dipping Vaping it's nothing aren't good because you're gonna run into we were running into trouble For other reasons, but in any case, um, well and even there vaping is a controversial topic Probably safer than smoking but has its own issues and I said something like that and boy did I catch a lot of heat for that You can't say anything as a health science educator not piss somebody off You know, it just depends on where the the center of mass is and how far outside that you are For me the caffeine is the main thing And actually it's a it's a really big part of my life and one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning Oh, yeah to consume caffeine if they Experience a crash in the afternoon that this is one of the misconceptions. I um I regret maybe even discussing it for people that crash in the afternoon Oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by 60 and 90 minutes in the morning, they will offset some of that But if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep all the night before you're not gonna avoid that afternoon crash But I'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration caffeine, especially if I'm gonna work out. Here's a weird one If I exercise before 8 30 a.m Especially if I start exercising when I'm a little bit tired I get energy that lasts all day If I wait until my peak of energy, which is mid morning 10 a.m. 11 a.m. And I started exercising then I'm basically exhausted all afternoon and I don't understand why I mean it depends on the intensity of the Workout, but so I like to be done showered and Heading into work by 9 a.m. But I don't always meet that much So you're saying it doesn't affect your energy if you start out with exercising I think you can get energy and wake yourself up with exercise if you start early and it and then that fuels you all day long I think that if you wait until you're feeling at your best to train Sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing like the work we get paid for Like research podcasting, etc. Then oftentimes, you know, your your brain isn't firing as well That's interesting. I haven't really rigorously tried that wake up and just start running or this is the gioco thing And then there's this phenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise or eat Or socialize or if you bright light at a certain time of day for three to seven days in a row pretty soon There's an anticipatory circuit that gets generated. This is why anyone in theory can become a morning person to some degree or another and this is also Beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off, you know People wake up and all of a sudden it goes off It wasn't because it clicked it's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep And there's some papers that have been published in the last couple of years Nature neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math problems in their sleep simple math problems, but math problems nonetheless This does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're going to answer accurately like they might screw up the whole A cumulative probability of 20 across multiple months. All right, listen, what happened? What happened? Here's the deal A few years back. I did a four and a half hour after editing four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility The entire recording took 11 hours and At one point during the and by the way, I'm very proud of that episode There's many couples have written to me And said they now have children as a consequence of that episode and my first question is what were you doing during the episode? But in all seriousness, um, we should say that it's four and a half hours and People then they should listen to the episode. You're it's extremely technical episode Like you're not stopped dropping facts and and referencing huge number of papers. It must be exhaust I don't understand how you can possibly that's about sperm health sperma genesis. It talks about The ovulatory cycle it talks about things people can do that are that are considered Absolutely supported by science that talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental It talks about IVF. It talks about xt. It talks about Um, all of that it talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age et cetera um, but there's this one portion there in the podcast where I'm talking about the uh, probability of a successful pregnancy as a function of age and so There was a clip that was cut in which I was describing cumulative probability And by the way, we've published cumulative probability historians in many of my laboratory's papers Including one that was a nature article in 2018. So we run these all the time And yes, I know the difference between independent and cumulative probability. Okay, that's like I do um, the way the clip was cut And what I stated unfortunately combined to like a pretty great gaffe Where I say you're just adding percent I said you just adding percentages 20 20 to 120 percent and then I made us kind of Unfortunately, my humor isn't always so good and I made a joke. I said um 120 percent, but that's a different thing altogether. What I should have said was um, that's impossible You know and here here's how it actually works but then that it continues where I then described the cumulative probability histogram for um Successful pregnancy, but somewhere in the early portion. I I misstated something right. I made a math error Um, which implied I didn't understand the difference between independent and cumulative probability Which I do and it got picked up and and run and people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense And so what I did in response to it was rather than Just say everything I just said now I said I just came out online and said hey folks In an episode They did this on fertility. I made a math error Here is the formula for cumulative probability Successful pregnancy at that age. Here's the graph. Here's the you know, and I Offered it as a teaching moment in two ways one for people to understand cumulative probability It was sort of interesting to a number of people that had come out critiquing the gaffe also, um like biology and folks came out pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability So there was a lot of posturing, you know, the dog pile oftentimes people are quick to dog pile They didn't understand but a lot of people did understand some smart people out there, obviously I called my dad and he was just laughing. He goes. Oh, this is good This is like the old school way of of hammering academics. Um But the point being there was a teaching moment Um, give me an opportunity to say hey, I made a mistake. I also made a mistake in another podcast where I Did a micron to millimeter conversion and or centimeter conversion, but and we always correct these in the show note captions We correct them in the audio now um, unfortunately on youtube, it's harder to correct you can't go and edit in segments we put in the captions, but That was the one teaching moment if you make a mistake that's substantive and relate to data You you apologize and correct a mistake use this teaching moment The other one was to say, hey, you know In all the thousands of hours of content we've put out. I'm sure I've made some small errors I think I once said serotonin 1m and dopamine and you know, you're going you're you're riffing and It's a reminder to be careful To edit double check but the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections But it didn't feel good at first but ultimately, you know, I can laugh at myself about it Long ago at Berkeley when I was teeing my first Class it was a biopsychology class between 1998 or 1999 I was drawing the pituitary Gland it which is you know, it has an interior and a posterior lobe actually is a medial lobe too I have five six hundred students in that lecture hall and I drew it was chalkboard And I drew the two lobes of the pituitary and I said my back was to the audience I said, you know, and so they just sort of hang there And everyone just erupted in laughter because it looked like a scrotum with two testicles And I remember thinking like oh my god I don't think I can turn around like in face this You know and like I only got to turn around sooner or later So I turned around and we just all had a big laugh together. It was embarrassing I'll tell you one thing though. They never forgot about the two lobes of the pituitary Yeah, and you haven't forgotten about that either right. There's a high High salience for these kinds of things and it also was kind of fun to see How excited people get to see people trip It's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid like, you know Runs the opposite direction out of the blocks or something like that and and or uh, you know I recall it one world cup Match years ago a guy scored against his own team. I think they killed the guy. Do you remember that? Some South American or Central American team. Yeah, and they killed the guy But yeah, let's let's look it up. I just said World cup. Yeah, he was gunned down Andres Escobar, yeah scored against his own team in 1994 world cup in the United States Just 27 years old playing for the Colombia national team. Yeah, last name Escobar. It's a good name I think it would protect you listen, you know, so There are some gaffes that get people killed right, so you know How forgiving are we for online mistakes? You know, I said just the nature of the mistakes people were quite gracious about the the gaff and some weren't and you know, it's interesting that We As you know public health science educators You know, we'll do long podcast sometimes and and you need to be really careful. What's great is AI Allows you to check these things now more readily so that's cool and There are ways that it's now going to be more self-correcting. I mean, you know, I think There's there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool Like things are getting cleaned up. Yeah, but mistakes nevertheless will happen. Are you do you feel the pressure? of Not making mistakes. Sure I mean, you know, I try and get things right to the best of you know, to the best of my ability Um, I check with experts. It's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast A lot of times I chuckle because I'm you know at Stanford. We have some amazing scientists, but I talk to them else people elsewhere um, and it's always interesting to me how You know, I'll get divergent information And then I'll find the overlap in the Venn diagram and I have this like question Do I just stay with the overlap in the Venn diagram? They I didn't episode on oral health. I didn't know this until I researched that episode, but Oral health is critically related to heart health and brain health that there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus, you know that can make its way into other parts of the body through the mouth that Can cause serious issues. There's the idea that some forms of dementia some forms of heart disease are start in the mouth basically I talked to no fewer than four Dentists dental experts and there was a lot of convergence. I also learned that Teeth can demineralize that's the formation of cavities They can also remineralize as long as the cavity isn't too deep it can actually fill itself back in Especially if you provide the right substrates for it That saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth provided the milieu is right Things like alcohol-based mouth washes killing off some of the critical things you need This is fascinating and I put out that episode thinking oh, I'm not a dentist I'm not an oral health episode. I talked to a pediatric dentist. There's a terrific one doctor downscore stacy staci on Instagram does great content talk to some others Um And like and then I just waited for the attack. I was like here we go and it didn't come And dentists were thanking me. I was like, whoa You know That's a rare thing more often than not if I do an episode about say psilocybin or mdma You get some people liking it or adhd and the drugs for adhd We did a whole episode on the riddle and vivants adder all stuff You get people saying thank you, you know, I prescribe this to my kid and it really helps and and this and But they're Private about the fact that they do it because they get so much attack from other people so I like to find the center of mass report that Try and make it as clear as possible And then I know that there's some stuff where I'm going to catch shit What's frustrating for me is when Like I see claims that I'm like against fluoridization of water, which I'm not right Like we talked about the benefits of fluoride it builds a hyper strong bonds within the teeth I went and looked at some of the the literally the crystal struck not excuse me not the crystal structure, but the they Essentially the like micron and sub micron structure of teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds And you can also form them with things like hydroxyapatite. And why is there fluoride in water? Well, it's the best Okay You get you say some things that are interesting But then somehow it gets turned into like your against fluoridization Which I'm not or I've been accused of being against sunscreen. I wear mineral based sunscreen on my face I don't want to get skin cancer or I use a physical barrier There is a cohort of people out there that think that all sunscreens are bad. I'm not one of them I'm not what's called a sunscreen truther But then you get attacked for like if you so we're talking about there are certain sunscreens that are problematic So what and ronda patricks now starting to get vocal about this and so there are certain topics. It's interesting for which You have to listen carefully to What somebody is saying, but there's a lump or or lumping as opposed to splitting of of what health educators say And so it just seems like like with politics. There's this like urgency to just put people into a camp of Expert versus like renegade or something and it's not like that. It's just not like that. So the short answer is I really strive Really strive to get things right, but I know that I'm going to piss certain people off and you've taught me and joe's taught me and Other podcasters have taught me that like if you worry too much about it Um, then you aren't going to get the newest information out there like peptides There's very little human data unless you're talking about by lisi or the melana You know the stuff in the alpha melana site stimulating hormone stuff which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or Um, sermorellen which is for certain growth hormone deficiencies with with rare exception. There's very little human data But people are still super interested and a lot of people are taking and doing these things So you you want to get the information out do you try to Not just look at the science but research what the communities are talking with the various communities They're talking about like maybe research what the conspiracy theorists are talking about just so you know All the armies that are going to be attacking your castle Yes, so like for instance There's a community of people online that believe that like if you consume seed oils or something that like You're setting up your skin for sunburn and if you don't you know, like there's all these like Theories, but I liked so I like to know what the theories are. I like to know what the extremes are But I also like to know what the standard conversation is, but there's generally more agreement than disagreement. I think where um You know, I've been kind of bullish actually is you know, or like supplements like people go Oh supplements. Well, there's food supplements like a protein powder Just different than a vitamin and then they are compounds There are compounds that have real benefit But people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated But some of them are are vetted with for potency and for um safety with with more rigor than others You know, and it's interesting to see How people who take care of themselves And put a lot of work into that are often attacked that's been interesting Also, one of the most controversial topics nowadays is ozampic munjaro. I'm very middle of the road on this. I don't understand why the Quote-unquote health wellness community is so against these things I also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route for some people They've really helped them lose weight and yes, there can be some muscle loss and other lean lean body loss But that can be offset with resistance training. They've helped a lot of people And other people are like, no, this stuff is terrible I think the most interesting thing about ozampic munjaro is that they are glp one They're in the glp one pathway glucagon like peptide one and it was discovered in healer monsters, which is a uh Lizard basically and someone what the now the now the entomologists will dive on me It's a big big lizard looking thing that doesn't eat very often And they figured out that there's this peptide that allows it to curb its own appetite At the level of the brain and the gut And it has a lot of homology to sequence homology to what we now call glp one So I love anytime there's animal biology links to cool human biology links to a drug That's powerful that can help people with obesity and type 2 diabetes and there's evidence that can even curb some addictions um Those are newer data But I don't see is it either or in fact, I've been a little bit disappointed at the way that the um Whatever you want to call it health wellness biohacking community has like slammed on ozampic munjaro It's like they're like just get out and run and listen There are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them They get on these drugs and they can improve and then hopefully they're also doing resistance training and eating better And then you know, you're bringing all the elements together Well, why do you think the criticism has happened? Is it that ozampic became super popular? So people are misusing it or that kind of thing? No, I think what it is is that people Think if it's a pharmaceutical, it's bad. Yeah, and then or if it's a supplement It's bad depending on which camp they're in and and it wouldn't be wonderful to kind of like fill in the gap between this divide, you know um, what I would like to see in politics and in health is Um, neither right nor left, but what we can just call a league of reasonable people that looks at things on an issue by issue basis And fills in the center because I think most people are in that are I don't want to say center in a political way But I think most people are reasonable. They want to be reasonable, but that's not what sells clicks That's not what that's not what drives interest Um, but I'm a very like like I look at issue by issue person by person I don't like in group out group stuff. I never have I've got friends from all walks of life I said this another podcast and it always sounds like a like a political statement, but like the the push towards like You know polarization is it's so frustrating if there's one thing that's discouraging to me as I get older each year I'm like, wow, are we ever going to get out of this? like polarization Speaking of which, how are you going to vote for the presidential election? I'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people involved and do it. Well, what do you think the role of podcast is going to be in this year's election I would love a long-form conversations to happen with With the candidates. I think it's going to be huge. I would love trump to go on rogan I would I'm embarrassed to say this, but I would love to Honestly, we'd love to see Joe Biden go on Joe Rogan also I would imagine that both would go on but separately separately. I think it's I think a debate Joe does debates, but I think Joe at his best is one-on-one conversation really intimate Um, I I just wish that Joe Biden would actually do long-form conversations. I thought he had done it It wasn't me. I think it was on Jay Shetty's podcast. He did Jay Shetty. He did he did a few but what I mean long form. I mean Um, really long form like two three hours and more relaxed It was much more orchestrated because what happens when it's the interviews a little bit too short It becomes into this generic Political type of NBC cnn type of interview you get a set of questions and you don't get to really Feel the human Expose the human to the light in it the full we talked about the shadow the good the bad and the ugly So I think there's something magical about two three four hours But it doesn't have to be that long, but it has to have that feeling to it Where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous and you're going to be Uh Strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel but just shooting shit Which Rogan is the best by far in the world at that. I don't think people really appreciate how skilled he is at what he does And the number I mean the three or four podcasts per week plus plus the ufc announcement saying plus comedy tours and stadiums plus you know doing comedy shows in the the middle of the week plus You know husband and a father and a friend and Jiu-Jitsu the guys got like superhuman levels of output I I agree that long-form conversation is a whole other business And I think that people want and deserve to know the people that are Running for office at a in a different way and to really get to know them Well, listen, you know, I I guess you I mean, is it clear that he's going to do jail time or maybe he gets away? No, I don't think I'm because I was gonna say I mean that does that mean you're gonna be podcasting from imprisonment Yeah, we're going to back down going to Figure out how to commit a crime so I can get in prison. Please don't please though. Well, that's I'm sure they have visitors Right. That just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview. But yeah, I understand You wouldn't be able to wear that suit. You'd be wearing a different suit. That's true. Yeah Um, it's gonna be interesting and and you do I'm not just saying this because you're my friend But you would do a marvelous job. I think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and um and see what What happens? Here's one thing that I found really interesting In this whole political landscape When I'm in Los Angeles, I often get invited to these like They're not dinners, but gatherings where you know a local Um, you know, a bunch of podcasters will come together But a lot of people from the entertainment industry big agencies Big tech like big big tech many of the people have been on this podcast and They'll host a discussion or debate and what you find if you look around the room and you talk to people is that About half the people in the room Are very left leaning and very outspoken about that and they'll tell you exactly who they want to see in the When the presidential race and the other half We'll tell you that they're for the other side a lot of people that People assume are on one side of the aisle or the other Are in the exact opposite side now some people are very open about who that who they're for but it's been very interesting to see how Um when you get people one on one They're like telling you they want x candidate to win or y candidate to win and sometimes like really? I can't believe it like you like yep, and so it's what people think about um People's political lean is as often Exactly wrong and and that's been eye-opening for me And I've seen that um in university campuses too And and so it's going to be really really interesting to see what happens in in november in addition to that as you said Most people are close to the center Despite what twitter makes it seem like Most people whether they're sent a lot to center right they're kind of close to the center Yeah, I mean here's to me the most interesting question who is going to be the next big candidate in years to come Like who's that going to be right now? I don't I don't I don't see or know of that person. Who's it going to be? Yeah, the young promising candidates. We're not seeing them We're not seeing like who another way to ask that question Who would want to be? Well, that's the issue right? You know it who wants to live in this 12 hour news cycle where you're just trying to You know dunk on the other team so that nobody notices like that you're the shit that you fucked up You know like that that's not like that's not only not fun or interesting. It also is just like it's got to be psychosis inducing at some point and I think that You know god willing we're gonna you know some young guy or woman is like on this and refuses to to back down And was just like determined to be president and will make it happen But like I don't even know who the Bible candidates are Maybe you lex, you know, we should ask sagar sagar would know Yeah, yeah Maybe sagar himself Sagar's show is awesome. Yeah, he and crystal do a great thing. He's incredible Especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on things. Yeah, that's what makes it so cool. He's great He looks great in a suit looks real sexy. He's taking real good care of himself. I think he's getting married soon Congratulations sagar forgive me for not remembering your wife a future wife's name. He uh, he won my heart by giving me A biography of hitler as a president. That's what he gave you. Yeah, I gave you a hatchet With a poem and that just shows the fundamental difference with a poem inscribed in it Which was pretty damn good I realized everything we bring up on the screen is like really Depressing like the soccer player getting killed Can we bring up something happy? Uh, sure. Let's go to uh nature's metal instagram Those are pretty intense. We actually did a collaborative post on a on a shark thing. Really? Yeah, what kind of shark thing? so to generate the fear vr stimulus for my lab in 20 Was it yet 2016 we went down to guadalupe island off the coast of mexico Me and a guy named michael muller who's a very famous portrait photographer, but also takes photos of sharks and we used 360 video to build vr of great white sharks brought it back to the lab We published that study in current biology in 2017 went back down there um and That was the year that I exited the cage That you lower the cage with a crane and that year I exited the cage I had a whole mess with a air failure the day before I was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage I had no scuba on divers were out The thing got bow constricted up and I had an air failure and I had to actually share air and it was a whole mess Story for another time But the next day because I didn't want to get ptsd and it was pretty scary the next day I cage exited Um with some other divers and it turns out with these great white sharks In guadalupe the the water's very clear and you can swim toward them And then they'll they'll veer off you if you swim toward them. Otherwise, they see you as prey Well in the evening you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive and we We're hanging out fishing for a tuna. Uh, we had a one of the the crew on board had um A line in the water was fishing for tuna for dinner and a shark took the tuna off the line And it's a it's a very dramatic take and you can see the the just absolute Size of these great white sharks the the waters there are filled with them. That's the one But so this video just the neural link link was shot by matt mcdougall Who is the um head neurosurgeon at neural link there it is takes it now Believe it or not looks like it missed like it didn't get the fish it actually just cut that thing like a band saw So i'm up on the deck with matt Yeah, and so when you look at it from the side you you really get a sense of this Of the the girth of this freaking thing So as it comes up Size of that thing and they move through the water with such speed just a couple So when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered down below the surface There they're going around you're not allowed to chum the water there. Some people do it um But and then when you cage eggs sit they're like, well, what are you doing out here? And then you know they you swim toward them they veer off But what's interesting is that if you look at how they move through the water All it takes for one of these great white sharks when it sees A tuna or something it wants to eat is like two flicks of the tail And it becomes like a missile. It's just unbelievable economy of effort And ocean ramsey who is in my opinion the greatest of all cage exit shark divers this woman who dealt with enormous great white sharks She really understands their behavior when they're aggressive when they're not going to be aggressive. She and her husband Juan I believe his name is do they understand how the tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks? We were down there basically Like not understanding any of this we never should have been there and actually the air failure of the day before Plus cage eggs in the next day I told myself after coming up from the cage exit. That's it. I'm no longer taking risks with my life I want to live got back across the border Um a couple days later and I was like, that's it. I don't take risks with my life any longer But yeah, mcdougal not mcdougal shot that video and then it went quote-unquote viral through uh, nature is metal we passed them that video actually, uh I saw a video Where an instructor was explaining how to behave with a shark in the water And that you don't want to be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey And then you want to be acting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it right towards them and they'll bank off Now if you don't see them they're ambush predators You know, you're swimming in the surface and apparently if they get close you should just like guide them away by Like grabbing them and moving some people will actually roll them Um, but if they're coming in full speedy, you're not going to roll the shark But here we are back to dark stuff again. I like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that Um, you know, northern california. There were a couple actually a guy's head got taken off Um, he was swimming north of san francisco. There's been a couple of northern, uh, california That was really tragic, but most of them are in florida in australia florida The surfrider foundation shark attack map. There it is. Yeah, they have a great map. There you go So they look like they have all the scars on them. So if you if you zoom in on I mean, look at this if you go to the north america Um, look at skulls. There's there's a yeah where they're where they're deadly attacks Um, but in yeah, northern california. Sadly, this is really tragic if you zoom in on this one Um, I read about this This guy if you can click the link 50-year-old male he was in chest high water. This is just tragic. I feel so sad for him and his family you know, he's just um Three members of the party chose to go in he was you know Nine gai was in his chest high water 25 to 50 yards from shore Great breached water seized his head and that was it, you know, so it does happen. It's very infrequent um If you don't go in the ocean, it's a very very very low probability. Um, but but if it doesn't happen Six times in a row 120 chance. Yeah, who do you think wins a saltwater crocodile or a shark? Okay? I do not like saltwater crocodiles. They scare me to no end moller michael moller who dove all over the world He sent me a picture of him diving uh with Salty saltwater crocs in cuba. It was a smaller one. But goodness christ. Have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs? Yeah, um, I'm thinking that I'm thinking the the sharks are so agile. They're amazing They've head cammed one or body cammed one moving through the kelp bed And you look and it's just they're so agile moving through the water and and it's looking up at the surface like the camera's Looking at the surface and you just realize if you're out there, um, you're not In your swimming and you get hit by a by a shark you're not gonna talk shit and say that a salty has way more bite force, but according to the internet Recently data indicates that the shark has a stronger bite So I was I was assuming that a crocodile would have a a stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter But apparently a shark Yeah, and turning one of those big salties this is probably not that you know turning around It's like a battleship. I mean those sharks are unbelievable. They hit from all sorts. Oh, and they They do this thing We saw this you're out of the cage or in the cage and you and you'll look at one and you'll see its eye kind of like Looking at you. They can't really fove it But they'll look at you and you're tracking it and then you'll look down and you'll realize that one's coming at you They're they're they're ambush prayers. They're working together They're fascinating. I like I like how you know That they can't fovee You're already considering the vision system there. Yeah, it's a very permanent eyes on the very primitive eyes on the side of the head Their vision is decent enough. They're mostly obviously sensing things with their Electro sensing in the water, but also Oh faction Yeah, I spend far too much time Thinking about and learning about the the visual systems of different animals if you get me going on this like we'll be here all night See, this is what I have this my blood out too. I saw this in a store and I got it Because this is from a shark Goodness. Yeah, I can't say I ever saw one of teeth this big, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful Yeah, it's probably you know Probably your blood pressure just goes and you you don't feel feel a thing. Yeah Before we went down for the cage exit a guy in our crew pat dosos Very experienced diver asked one of the south african divers that So, you know, like what's the contingency plan if like somebody catches a bite and they were like He was like every man for himself and they're like basically saying like if somebody catches a bite like that's it Yeah, you know Anyway, I thought we were gonna bring up something happy Oh, that is happy. Well, we nature is beautiful. Yeah, what nature is beautiful. Uh, we lived But you know that there are there are happy things you brought up nature is metal. This is this is the difference between russian Yeah, americans and americans is like maybe there's actually a good time to bring up Your ayahuasca journey. I've never done ayahuasca But i'm curious about it. I'm also curious about ibogaine iboga But you told me that you did ayahuasca and That for you, it wasn't the dark scary ride that it is for everybody else. Yeah, it was an incredible experience for me I did it twice actually and have you done high dose psilocybin? Never. No, I just did small dose psilocybin a couple times So I was you know nervous about it. I was very yeah, I understand myself I've done high dose psilocybin. It's terrifying, but I've always gotten something very useful out of it So, I mean I was nervous about like whatever demons might hide in the shadow in the yungi in the shadow like I was I was nervous But I think it turns out. I don't know what the lesson is to draw from that but my experience Be boys russian It must it must be the russian thing. I mean, there's also something to the jungle There it strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there I I forgot the outside civilization exists. I forgot time because like When you don't have your phone You don't have meetings or calls or whatever you you lose the sense of time the sun comes up the sun comes down That's the the fundamental biological timer. You know every mammalian species has a short wavelength. So you think like blue uv type but like Absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone and the and it does this interesting Subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky, you've got short wavelength and long wavelength light Like when you look at a sunrise, it's got blues and yellows orange and yellows You look in the evening reds orange and and blues and in the middle of the day It's like full spectrum light now. It's always full spectrum light but because of some atmospheric Elements and because of the low solar angle you like that difference between The different wavelengths of light is is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your eye pay attention to And signal to your circadian timekeeping mechanism like we are that the core of our brain and the suprachiasmatic nucleus we are we are like Wired to be Entrained to the rising and setting of the sun like that's the biological timer which makes perfect sense because you know obviously as the planets Um as the planets spin and revolve I also wonder like how that is affected by you know in the rainforest the sun is not visible often So you're under the cover of the trees. So maybe that affects Well, there are social rhythms They're feeding rhythms sometimes in in terms of some species will signal the timing of activity of other species and um But yet getting out from the canopy is is critical Of course, even under the canopy during the daytime, there's far more photons than at night You know, there's always when i'm telling people to get sunlight in their eyes in the morning and in the evening People say there's no light no sunlight this time here. I'm like it go outside on a really overcast day It's far brighter than it is at night, right? So um, there's still lots of sunlight even if you can't see the sun as an object but I I love Time perception shifts and you mentioned that in the jungle it's linked to the rising and setting of the sun You also mentioned that on ayahuasca you zoomed out from from the earth These are like to me the most interesting aspects of having a human brain as opposed to another brain Of course, only ever had a human brain, but which is that you can consciously set your time Domain window like you can we can be focused here We can be focused on all of austin or we can be focused on the entire planet You can make those choices consciously But in the time domain it's it's hard like different activities bring us into fine slicing a more or more broad binning of time depending on what we're doing programming or exercising or researching or podcasting but um, just how unbelievably um fluid the human brain is in terms of its The aperture of of the time space window of our cognition and of our experience And I I feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable Tools that we have access to that we don't really leverage as much as we should which is when things are really hard you Need to zoom out and see it as one element within your whole lifespan and that there's more to come um You know, I mean people commit suicide because they can't see beyond the time domain they're in or they think it's going to go on forever Um, when we're happy we rarely think this is going to last forever, but uh, which is interesting contrast in its own right but I think that Psychedelics while I have very little experience with them I have saw them and it sounds like they're just a very interesting Window into the the different apertures Well, how to surf that wave is probably a skill One of the things I was prepared for and I think it's important is not to resist I think I understand what it means to resist the thing a powerful wave and it's not going to be good So you have to be able to surf it so I was ready for that to relax through it. Maybe because I'm quite good at that from knowing how to relax and all kinds of disciplines playing piano and uh Guitar when I was super young and then through jiu-jitsu knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports Should be able to relax the body fully just accept whatever happens to you that process is probably why it was a very positive experience for me Do you have any interest in iboga? I'm very interested in ibogaine iboga There's a colleague of mine and researcher at Stanford Nolan Williams Who's been doing some transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people who have taken the ibogaine ibogaine um As I understand it gives a 22 hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open, but you close your eyes and you get a um a very high resolution image of actual events that happened in your life But then you have agency within those movies. I think you have to be Of healthy heart to be able to do it. I think you have to be on a heart rate monitor. It's not trivial It's not like these other psychedelics But there's a wonderful group called veteran solutions um that has used iboga combined with some other psychedelics um in the veterans community to to great success for things like PTSD and It's a group. I've really tried to support in in any way that I can mainly by being vocal about the great work they're doing but um, you hear incredible stories of people who are just like Like near cratered in their life or zombied by PTSD and other things post war um get back a lightness or achieve a lightness and a clarity Um that they didn't feel they had so I'm very curious about these compounds. Um, the state of Kentucky We should check this but um, I believe it's taken money from the Opioid crisis settlement for ibogaine research. I mean, so this is like no longer. Yes. If you look here, let's see Did they do it? Oh, no. No. Oh, no They backed away Kentucky backs away from the plan to fund opio treatment research They were going to use the money To treat opio. Now officials are backing off 50 billion. What is on its way over the coming years 50 billion dollars 50 billion dollars is on its way to state and local government over the coming years The pool of funding comes from multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid Painkillers, Kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid So they were going to do psychedelic research with ibogaine Supporting research on illegal illegal folks Psychedelic drug called ibogaine. Well, I guess they backed away from it. Well Sooner or later, we'll get some happy news up on the Internet during this episode Talk about the the the shark and the crocodile fighting. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true And you survived the jungle. Well, that's the the thing I was I was I was writing to you on what's that multiple times because I was going to put on the internet Are you okay? And if you're like alive and then I was going to just like put it to twitter Just like he's alive, but then of course you're far too classy for that. So you just came back alive Well jungle or not One of the lessons is also, you know, when you hear the call for adventure Just fucking do it. I was gonna ask you it's kind of silly question, but like give me a Small fraction of things on your bucket list Bucket list. Yeah Go to mars Yeah, what's what's the status of that? I don't know. I'm being patient about the whole thing red planet ran that cartoon of you guys Going to my that was pretty funny. That's true. That was pretty funny. One where Goggins is already up there. Yeah That's a great. That's a funny one Probably also true. Uh, I would love I would love to die in mars But I just love humanity reaching onto the stars and doing this Bold adventure and taking big risks and exploring. I love exploration What about seeing different animal species? I'm a huge fan of this guy Joel Sartori Um, where he he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of all these different animals If people aren't already following him on instagram. He's doing some really important work um this guy's instagram is Amazing like portraits. Well, look at it. Look at these portraits the amount of um, I must say personality because we don't want to project anything onto them. But yeah, the the like the eyes And he'll occasionally put him a movie. No, there's a little owl. I delight in things like this I've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes And now dogs or all kinds of all animals um, and I'm very interested in um Kids content that that incorporates animals. We have some things brewing there Like I could look at this kind of stuff all day long Look at that bat like bats people think about bats is kind of like little flickering a little annoying disease carrying things But look how beautiful that little sucker is How's your uh podcast with the cookie monster coming? Oh, yeah, we've been in discussions with cookie the um It's uh, can't say too much about that. But um, cookie monster embodies dopamine, right? Cookie monster wants cookie Right wants cookie right now, you know, like it was that it was that one tweet cookie monster I bounce because cookies come from all directions You know, it's like it's just embodying the the desire for for something and and which is an incredible aspect of ourselves The other one is you remember a little while ago Elmo put out a tweet Hey, how's everyone doing out there and it went viral And you know the surgeon general of the united states have been talking about the loneliness crisis He came on the podcast and you know a lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness mental health issues with loneliness Elmo puts out a tweet. Hey, how's everyone doing out there? And Everyone gravitates toward it, you know So that the different sesame street characters really embody the different that kind of aspects of self through very like narrow Neural circuit perspective You know snuffle off against the shy and um oscar the grouch it's grouchy, right and the count Won a tool the archetypes of yeah, the archetypes is very young in once again. Yeah, and I think that um You know the creators of sesame street clearly either understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that So yeah, there are some things brewing on on uh conversations with sesame street characters It's not I know you'd like to talk to vladimir putin. I'd like to talk to cookie monster It illustrates the differences in our like a sophistication or something. Well, that's illustrates a lot. Yeah But yeah, I also I love animation So I'm not anime. That's not my thing but animation. So I'm very interested in the use of animation to get Uh science content across so there are a bunch of things brewing but um, but anyway, I delight in Sartori's work and and and it's there's a conservation aspect to it as well. But I think that um Mostly want to thank you for finally putting up something that like where something is not being killed or like let some sad Sad outcome. Well, these are all really positive. They're really cool. They're really cool and every once in a while look at look at that mountain line But I also like to look at these and and some of them remind me of certain people Right, so let's just scroll through like for instance. I think when we don't try and process it too much So like like okay, look at this cat this is amazing Like I feel like that somebody I feel like this is like a like someone I met once as a curiosity and curiosity and a playfulness um carnivore Carnivore frontalized eyes Found in forces the area right so then you go down, you know, it's like This beautiful fish neon pink Right, so it reminds you of some of the like the influencers you see on instagram, right? Except this one's natural. Just kidding. Um Uh, let's see no filter. Um filter. Yeah um Let's see like I feel like Bears I'm a big fan of bears. Yeah bears are beautiful. This one kind of reminds me of you a little bit There's like a stoic nature to it a curiosity So you can kind of feel like the essence of animals. You don't even have to do psychedelics to get there Oh, look at that. He's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually yeah and then there's um Wow, yeah Yeah, the in the jungle the diversity of life was also stark From a scientific perspective just the the fact that most of those species are not identified was fascinating Right. It was like a little every little every little insect is a kind of discovery Right. I mean one of the reasons I love new york city so much Just by its problems at times is that um everywhere you look there's life It's like a tropical reef if you've ever done scuba diving or snorkeling you look on a tropical reef and it's like There's some little crab working on something and like everywhere you look there's life You know the bay area if you go scuba diving or snorkeling it's like a kelp bed You know the bay area is like a kelp bed every once in a while some big fish goes by it's like a big IPO But like most of the time not a whole lot happens Actually, the bay area it's interesting as I've been going back there more and more recently um There are really cool little subcultures starting to pop up again. Nice. Um There's incredible skateboarding the gx-1000 guys are these guys that that bomb down hills They're in Nuts like they're just going like that's just speed not tricks You gotta see gx-1000 these guys going down hills in san francisco They are wild and occasionally unfortunately occasionally someone will get hit by a car, but gx-1000 Look into intersections. They have spotters. You can see someone there Um, oh, I see there's uh Into traffic. Yeah into traffic. So in san francisco. Yeah, this is crazy. Like this is unbelievable and um, and they're They're just wild But in any case What's on your bucket list that you haven't done? Well, I'm working on a book. So I'm actually going to Head to a cabin for a couple weeks and right which I've never done People talk about doing this, but I'm gonna do that That's I'm excited for that just the mental space of really dropping into writing like jack dickelson in the shining cabin Let's hope not. Okay. Let's hope not, you know before I mean only started doing public facing anything for posting on instagram in 2019 But I used to head up to walla la on the northern coast of california um, sometimes by myself um to a little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just Read and write papers and things like that. I used to do that all the time I I I missed that so some of that Um, I'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in argentina relatives in on the east coast See my parents more. They're in good health. Thankfully. I want to get married and have a family. That's an important priority And put a lot of a lot of work in there. Yeah, that's a big one. Yeah. Yeah, I'm putting a lot of work Into the the the runway on that um, what are advice for people about That or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world how to find how to build a family Get there and and then I'll listen to it someday and see if I hit the marks um Yeah, but well, obviously pick the right partner But also like do the work on yourself. No know yourself That the oracle know thyself and I think um, listen I have a friend. He's a new friend, but he's a friend uh who I met for uh a meal He's a very very well known actor overseas And his stuff has made it over here and um, we become friends and we went to lunch And we were talking about work and being public facing and all this kind of thing and And then I said you have kids, right? He says he has four kids. I was like, oh, yeah, you know I see your posts with the kids. You seem really happy. He said he just looked at me leaned in and he said It's the best gift you'll ever give yourself And he also said and pick your partner the mother of your kids very carefully So, you know, that's good advice coming from excellent advice coming from somebody who's, you know, very successful in work and family So that's the only thing I can pass along. We hear this from friends for ours as well, but um kids are amazing and family is amazing and um You know, that's the different People all these people who want to like be immortal and like live to be 200 or something, you know There's also the the old fashioned way of you know, having children that Live on and evolve a new legacy But they have, you know, half your dna. So that's exciting. Yeah, I think you make an amazing dad. Thank you It seems like a fun thing and you know, I've also gotten advice from friends who are Super high performing and have a lot of kids They'll say just don't overthink it All right, start having kids Let's go right. Well the chaos of kids is kind of the like You can either bury you or it can or it can give you energy But I grew up in a big pack of boys always doing like wild and crazy things and so that kind of energy is great And and if it's not a big pack of wild boys, it's you know You have daughters and they can be you know, different form of chaos sometimes same form of chaos Um, how many kids do you think you want? Hmm? You know, it's either two or five Yeah, very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You know the other yeah Um, I mean, I'm very close with my sister I couldn't imagine having another sibling because it there's so much richness there. We talk almost every day Sorry, you know three four times a week, you know Sometimes just briefly but we're we're tight, you know, we're Really look out for one another um She's an amazing person like truly an amazing person and has like Raised her daughter in an amazing way. She's like You know, my niece is like Going to head to college in a year or two and like my sister's done an amazing job And her dad's done a great job too. They they both really put a lot into um The family aspect and she has to spend time with a really amazing person in the In peru in the amazon jungle and he is one of 20 kids. Wow. So he's got It's mostly guys. That's just a lot of brothers and I think two sisters I just said jonathan height on the podcast the guy who's talking about the anxious generation causing the american mind He's great, but he was saying that you know in order to keep kids healthy They need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're 16 I've actually been thinking a lot about Getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties, you know, everyone talks about this Not creating a commune or anything like that, but I think I think jonathan's right. We were more or less Our brain wiring does best when we I'm raised in Small village type environments where kids can forage the whole free range kids idea And I grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt clawed wars and all that stuff Um, it would be so strange to have a childhood without that Yeah, and I think more and more As we wake up to the negative aspects of the digital interaction will put more and more value to in-person interaction So I mean it's cool to see for instance kids in new york city I'm just kind of moving around the city with so much sense of agency. It's really really cool The suburbs like where I grew up Like as soon as we could get out take the 7f bus up to san francisco and hang out with you know Wild ones like you know while there were dangers I mean we couldn't wait to get out of the suburbs the moment that you know Forts and dirt clawed wars and stuff didn't didn't cut it. We just like wanted into the city. So I um bucket list I will probably move to a major city not los angeles or san francisco um In the next few years new york city Potentially there's all such different flavors of experiences. Yeah, so I'd love to live in new york city for a while I've always wanted to do that and I and I will do that I've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural Some area so colorado montana are high on my list right now and to be able to Pivot back and forth between the two would be great just for such different experiences I and also I like a very physical life So the idea of getting up in the sun with the sun in the montana or colorado type environment um And I've been doing some putting some effort towards finding a spot Um for that and new york city to me I know it's got its issues and people say it wasn't what it was. Okay. I get it but listen I've never lived there. So for me would be entirely new and um You know Schultz seems full of life There is an energy to that city and he represents that I mean there's yeah And and the full diversity of weird that is represented in new york city is great. Yeah, you walk down this tree There's like a person with like a cat on their head and no one gives a shit. Yeah, that's great All right, San Francisco used to be like that the joke was like You have to be naked and on the fire and San Francisco before someone takes it but now it's changed But again, it recently I've noticed that San Francisco. It's not just about the skateboarders. It's there's um some community Houses of people in tech that are super interesting. There's some community housing of people not in tech That I've learned about him and um known people have lived there and and it's it's cool like there's stuff happening Um in these cities that's new and different. I mean, that's what youth is for they're supposed to evolve evolve things out uh So amidst all that you still have to get shit done. I've been really obsessed with tracking time recently Like making sure I have daily activities of habits that I'm maintaining and I'm very Religious about making sure I get shit done. Do you use an app or something like that? No, just google sheets So basically a spreadsheet and I'm tracking daily and I write scripts that That uh, whenever I achieve a goal it glows green Yeah, do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too? No, just the fact that I got the workout done Yeah, so I just it's a checkmark thing. So I I'm really really big On making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. I have a rule for myself that I Do a set of tasks, uh for at least five minutes every day And it turns out that many of them I do way longer, but just even just doing it I have to do it every day and there's currently 11 of them It's just a thing like one of them is playing guitar, for example So do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do uh, like daily habits? Yeah, I do my um I wake up if I don't feel I slept enough I do this non-sleep-deep-rest yoga nidra thing that I've talked about a bunch We actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on spotify um 10 minute 20 minute ones puts me back into a state that feels like sleep and I feel very rested Actually matt walker and I are gonna run a study. He's just submitted the IRB to run a study on nsdr And what is actually doing to the brain? There's some evidence of increases in dopamine, etc But those are older studies still cool studies, but um, so I'll do that get up hydrate and if I've Got my act together. I punched some caffeine down Like some matina some coffee maybe another matina and Resistance train three days a week run three days a week and then take one day off um And like to be done by 839 and then I want to get into some real work I actually have a sticky note on my computer It's like just like reminding me how good it feels to accomplish some real work and then I go into it right now It's the book writing researching a podcast and just fight tooth and nail to stay off Social media text message. What's app youtube all that? Get something done. How long can you go? Can you go like? three hours Just deep focus if I hit a groove. Uh, yeah 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove um That's tough for me. I start the day actually that's why I'm afraid I'd really prize that Those morning hours I start with the work. Yeah, and it's it's it's uh I'm trying to hit the four hour mark of deep focus great I love it. Then it often can't work. It's important. I'm really really deeply. Yeah It's it's often torture actually. It's really really difficult. Oh, yeah the agitation but I've Sat across the table from you a couple years ago when I was out here in austin doing some work And I was working on stuff you were and I noticed you're just like stare at your notebook sometimes just like pen at the Same position and then you'll get back into it like there are those won't you're building that hydraulic pressure and then go Yeah, I try and get something done of value then it the communications start and Talking to my podcast producer. My team is everything. I mean like the the magic potion in the podcast is rob more right Who's in the has been in the room with me every single solo Costello used to be in there with us because that's it people have asked journalists have asked can they sit in friends have asked Nope just rob and For guests interviews. He's there as well. And I talk to rob all the time all the time we talk multiple times per day and You know in life I've I've made some errors in certain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that and Certainly don't blame all of it on them. But you know, I played my role but but in terms of picking business partners And friends like you know to work with I mean rob It's just it's been bull's-eyes and it's just rob has been amazing my play back our photographer and the guys I mentioned earlier like We just Communicate as much as we need to And we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we make we put anything out there and So including like even created decisions of like topics to cover all that Yeah, like a photo for the book jacket the other day Mike shoots photos then And then we look at them. We pour over them together Logo for the perform podcast with Andy Gallop and then we're launching like is that the right contour Mike's the real He's got the aesthetic thing because he was at DC so long as a portrait photographer And his cute with close friends with Ken block To Jim conna like all the car jumping in the city stuff like I mean Mike is a master. He's a he's a true master of that stuff and um And we just pour over every little decision, but even which sponsors, you know, there are dozens of ads now By the way that that whole josser-sizer thing of me saying oh a guy went from a two to a seven I never said that that's AI Like I would never call it number off somebody a two to a seven. Are you kidding me? It's crazy. So it's AI if you bought the thing I'm sorry But like our sponsors we list the sponsors that we have and why on our website and like the decision Do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product? I mean we've we've got ways with sponsors because of like changes in the product or change, you know Most time it's amicable all good But you know like just every detail and that just takes a ton of time and energy but I try and Work mostly on content and my team is constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions But I because I obsess but um, yeah, you you have to you have to have a team of some sort someone that you can run Things bot for sure, but one of the challenges the larger the team is And I I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff including engineering stuff robotics work research All of those interactions at least for me take away from the deep work the deep focus Unfortunately, I get Drained by social interaction even with the people I love and really respect and all that kind of stuff You're an introvert. Yeah, like fundamentally an introvert. So To me it's a trade-off getting shit done versus Collaborating and I have to choose wisely because without collaboration without a great team Which I'm fortunate enough to be a part of Like you wouldn't get anything really done But as an individual contributor to get stuff done like to do the hard work of Researching or programming all that kind of stuff. You need the hours of deep work I used to spend a lot more time alone That's that's on my bucket list spend a bit more time dropped into work alone it I think social media like It causes our brain to go the other direction I try and answer some comments and then and then get back to work. I'm really After going to the jungle, I appreciate not using the device I've played with the idea of Like spending certainly maybe like one week a month not using social media at all I used it. So after that morning block, I'll eat some lunch and I'll usually do something while I'm doing lunch or something And then a bit more work and that real work deep work and then Around 2 30 I do a non-sleep deep rest to go short nap wake up. Boom Maybe a little more caffeine and then lean into it Again, and then you know if you I find if you really put in the deep work Two or three bouts per day by about five or six p.m. It's over I was down at Jaco's place not that long ago and in the evening did a sauna session with him and Some family members of his and some of their friends And it's really cool like they all work all day and train all day and then in the evening They get together and they they sauna and cold plunge. I'm really into this whole thing of gathering with other people At a specific time of day. I have a gym at my house and I you know tim will come over and train or you know That we've kind of slowed that down in recent months, but I think Gathering in groups once a day being alone for part of the day. It's like very fundamental stuff We're not saying anything that hasn't been said millions of times before but how often do people actually do that? And and and call the party, you know, like be the person to like bring people together if it's not happening That's something I've really had to learn Even though I'm an introvert like hey, I'm like gather people together You came through town the other day and there's a lot of people at the house Yeah, Brad actually I was playing because I was getting a massage when you walked in I don't sit around getting massages very often But I was getting one that day and then everyone came in and the dog came in like everyone's piled in. It was very sweet Again, no devices, but choose wisely the people You gather with right right and I was clothed Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't which is very weird Uh Yeah, yeah, the the the frenzy surround yourself with that. That's another thing. It's like I understood that from my Alaska and from just the experience in the jungle is like Just select the people Just be careful how you allocate your time. I just saw on Somewhere Conor McGregor has this good line. I wrote it down about loyalty He said don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with That guy's I mean, he's being on loyalty all the shit talk all of that set that aside To me like loyalty is really big because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them and What what else is life about?
