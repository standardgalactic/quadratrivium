00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.760
What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.920
The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,

00:14.920 --> 00:17.920
professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,

00:17.920 --> 00:21.200
focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,

00:21.200 --> 00:23.920
visual perception, and consciousness.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.760
He's the author of over 120 scientific papers

00:27.760 --> 00:31.120
on these topics, and his most recent book titled

00:31.120 --> 00:34.080
The Case Against Reality, Why Evolution

00:34.080 --> 00:36.640
Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.520
I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,

00:39.520 --> 00:42.720
like those of Donald Hoffman's attempt to shake

00:42.720 --> 00:45.840
the foundation of our understanding of reality,

00:45.840 --> 00:50.240
and thus they take a long time to internalize deeply.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.400
So proceed with caution. Questioning the fabric of reality

00:54.400 --> 00:58.400
can lead you to either madness or the truth.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.400
And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.120
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

01:05.120 --> 01:07.600
please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.000
And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.320
In your book The Case Against Reality,

01:14.320 --> 01:17.120
Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,

01:17.120 --> 01:21.920
you make the bold claim that the world we see with our eyes is not real.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.480
It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.

01:24.480 --> 01:29.600
It is completely detached from objective reality.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.120
Can you explain this idea? Right.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.240
So this is a theorem from Evolution of a Natural Selection.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.400
So the technical question that I and my team asked was,

01:38.400 --> 01:42.080
what is the probability that natural selection would shape

01:42.080 --> 01:46.240
sensory systems to see true properties of objective reality?

01:46.240 --> 01:50.560
And to our surprise, we found that the answer is precisely zero, except for one

01:50.720 --> 01:52.400
kind of structure that we can go into if you want to.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.000
But for any generic structure that you might think the world might have,

01:56.000 --> 02:02.160
a total order, a topology metric, the probability is precisely zero

02:02.160 --> 02:06.400
that natural selection would shape any sensory system of any organism

02:06.400 --> 02:08.480
to see any aspect of objective reality.

02:08.480 --> 02:15.200
So in that sense, what we're seeing is what we need to see

02:16.480 --> 02:18.800
to stay alive long enough to reproduce.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.880
So in other words, we're seeing what we need to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

02:23.520 --> 02:30.000
So the evolutionary process, the process that took us from the original life on earth

02:30.000 --> 02:35.280
to the humans that we are today, that process does not maximize

02:36.640 --> 02:39.280
for truth and maximizes for fitness, as you say.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.400
Fitness beats truth.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.680
And fitness does not have to be connected to truth is the claim.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.680
And that's where you have an approach towards zero of probability that we

02:52.720 --> 02:58.240
have evolved human cognition, human consciousness, whatever it is,

02:58.240 --> 03:06.160
the magic that makes our mind work, evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,

03:06.160 --> 03:09.040
but its ability to survive in the environment.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.160
That's exactly right.

03:10.240 --> 03:17.360
So most of us intuitively think that surely the way that evolution will make our senses

03:17.360 --> 03:22.880
more fit is to make them tell us more truths, or at least the truths we need to know

03:22.880 --> 03:25.360
about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.

03:26.000 --> 03:26.880
That's the standard view.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.840
And it was the view I took.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.760
I mean, that's sort of what we're taught or just even assume.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.080
It's just sort of like the intelligent assumption that we would all make.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.760
But we don't have to just wave our hands.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.240
Evolution of a natural selection is a mathematically precise theory.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.600
John Maynard Smith in the 70s created evolutionary game theory.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.400
And we have evolutionary graph theory and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.320
And so we don't have to wave our hands.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.640
It's a matter of theorem and proof and or simulation before you get the theorems and proofs.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.120
And a couple of graduate students of mine, Justin Mark and Brian Marion,

04:01.120 --> 04:05.440
did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off that there was something going on here.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.400
And then I went to a mathematician, Chaitan Prakash and Manish Singh and

04:11.440 --> 04:13.680
some other friends of mine, Chris Fields.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.880
And but Chaitan was the real mathematician behind all this.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.680
And he's proved several theorems that uniformly indicate that with one exception,

04:21.680 --> 04:27.760
which has to do with probability measures, there's no the probability zero.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.880
The reason there's an exception for probability measures,

04:30.880 --> 04:38.480
so-called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes, is that for any scientific theory,

04:40.560 --> 04:44.880
there is the assumption that needs to be made that the whatever

04:47.280 --> 04:51.040
structure, the whatever probabilistic structure the world may have,

04:51.680 --> 04:56.160
is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure of our perceptions.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.880
If they were completely unrelated, then no science would be possible.

04:59.600 --> 05:06.160
So this is technically, the map from reality to our senses has to be a so-called

05:06.160 --> 05:08.480
measurable map, has to preserve sigma algebras.

05:08.480 --> 05:14.160
But that means it could be infinite to one and it could collapse all sorts of event information.

05:14.160 --> 05:20.880
But other than that, there's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory for fitness payoff

05:20.880 --> 05:25.520
functions, for example, to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.880
So you can ask the technical question. This is one of the avenues we took.

05:30.800 --> 05:37.520
If you look at all the fitness payoffs from whatever world structure you might want to

05:37.520 --> 05:40.240
imagine, so a world with, say, a total order on it.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.000
So it's got n states and they're totally ordered.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.120
And then you can have a set of maps from that world into a set of payoffs,

05:49.120 --> 05:51.920
say from zero to a thousand or whatever you want your payoffs to be.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.440
And you can just literally count all the payoff functions.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.000
And just do the combinatorics and count them.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.840
And then you can ask a precise question.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.840
How many of those payoff functions preserve the total order?

06:03.840 --> 06:04.720
If that's what you're looking for.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.400
Or how many preserve the topology?

06:07.280 --> 06:08.960
And you just count them and divide.

06:08.960 --> 06:13.120
So the number that are homomorphisms versus the total number,

06:13.120 --> 06:16.560
and then take the limit as the number of states in the world,

06:16.560 --> 06:19.760
and the number of payoff values goes very large.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.600
And when you do that, you get zero every time.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.320
Okay, there's a million things to ask here.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.520
But first of all, just in case people are not familiar with your work,

06:30.800 --> 06:35.360
let's sort of linger on the big, bold statement here,

06:36.480 --> 06:39.040
which is the thing we see with our eyes

06:40.960 --> 06:44.400
is not some kind of limited window into reality.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.840
It is completely detached from reality,

06:47.840 --> 06:49.520
likely completely detached from reality.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.040
You're saying 100% likely.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.680
Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.920
In the way we have this intuition,

06:59.920 --> 07:05.200
there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.760
but underneath it all, there's atoms.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.760
And there's an entire century of physics

07:09.760 --> 07:11.920
that describes the functioning of those atoms

07:11.920 --> 07:13.680
and the quarks that make them up.

07:13.680 --> 07:19.760
There's many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields

07:19.760 --> 07:23.200
and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up

07:23.200 --> 07:25.040
to something that's perceivable to us,

07:25.040 --> 07:29.280
both with our eyes, with our different senses as this table.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.640
Then there's also ideas of chemistry

07:33.520 --> 07:38.480
that overlays of abstraction from DNA to embryos,

07:38.480 --> 07:42.000
the cells that make the human body.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.760
So all of that is not real.

07:46.560 --> 07:52.400
It's a real experience and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.200
So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
We want to think that the perceptions are real.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.640
So their perceptions are real as perceptions.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.440
We are having our perceptions,

08:03.440 --> 08:06.800
but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship

08:06.800 --> 08:08.800
between our perceptions and reality.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.520
If I look up and see the moon,

08:11.520 --> 08:15.040
then there is something that exists in space and time

08:15.040 --> 08:18.880
that matches what I perceive.

08:18.880 --> 08:24.400
And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution

08:24.400 --> 08:29.520
by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.760
That our perceptions are there.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.040
They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.720
They're not there to show you the truth.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.000
In fact, the way I think about it is they're there to hide the truth

08:40.560 --> 08:42.400
because the truth is too complicated.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.320
It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop to write an email.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.160
What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,

08:50.160 --> 08:51.760
but good luck trying to do it that way.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.240
The reason why we have a user interface

08:54.240 --> 08:56.480
is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,

08:56.480 --> 08:59.520
the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.960
If you had to know all that truth,

09:02.080 --> 09:02.960
your friends wouldn't hear from you.

09:03.920 --> 09:08.240
So what evolution gave us was perceptions

09:08.240 --> 09:10.080
that guide adaptive behavior.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.920
And part of that process, it turns out,

09:11.920 --> 09:15.840
means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.080
So what's the difference between hiding the truth

09:20.640 --> 09:26.480
and forming abstractions, layers upon layers of abstractions

09:26.480 --> 09:32.720
over these over low level voltages and transistors and chips

09:32.720 --> 09:37.600
and programming languages from assembly to Python

09:37.600 --> 09:40.880
that then leads you to be able to have an interface like Chrome

09:40.880 --> 09:46.240
where you open up another set of JavaScript and HTML programming

09:46.240 --> 09:49.280
languages that lead you to have a graphical user interface

09:49.280 --> 09:51.840
on which you can then send your friends an email.

09:52.160 --> 09:57.760
So is that completely detached from the zeros and ones

09:58.320 --> 10:00.640
that are firing away inside the computer?

10:01.440 --> 10:01.920
It's not.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.440
Of course, when I talk about the user interface on your desktop,

10:06.720 --> 10:10.960
there's this whole sophisticated backstory to it,

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
right, that the hardware and the software

10:12.960 --> 10:14.160
that's allowing that to happen.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.120
Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?

10:17.120 --> 10:20.320
So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate

10:20.320 --> 10:22.960
to tell you what is that backstory.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.960
It's going to say that whatever reality is,

10:26.960 --> 10:27.840
and that's the interesting thing.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.560
It says whatever reality is, you don't see it.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.600
You see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you

10:34.320 --> 10:38.720
what that user interface is, how it's built, right?

10:38.720 --> 10:43.760
Now, we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface,

10:43.760 --> 10:45.920
but already we're going to look at that and go,

10:45.920 --> 10:47.840
okay, before I would look at neurons,

10:47.840 --> 10:49.520
and I was assuming that I was seeing something

10:49.520 --> 10:51.840
that was at least partially true.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.720
And now I'm realizing it could be like looking

10:54.720 --> 10:59.120
at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop,

10:59.120 --> 11:02.480
and good luck going from that to the data structures

11:02.480 --> 11:03.520
and then the voltages.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.280
And I mean, good luck.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.880
There's just no way.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.600
So what's interesting about this is that our scientific theories

11:10.640 --> 11:15.280
are precise enough and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,

11:15.840 --> 11:18.640
but, and even limits of the theories themselves.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.160
But they're not going to tell us what the next move is,

11:22.160 --> 11:24.320
and that's where scientific creativity comes in.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.360
So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,

11:27.360 --> 11:29.680
is not alien to physicists.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.480
The physicists are saying precisely the same thing,

11:32.480 --> 11:33.920
that space time is doomed.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.920
We've assumed that space time is fundamental.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.240
We've assumed that for several centuries,

11:38.240 --> 11:39.360
and it's been very useful.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.800
So all the things that you were mentioning,

11:40.800 --> 11:42.640
the particles and all the work that's been done,

11:42.640 --> 11:44.080
that's all been done in space time,

11:44.960 --> 11:47.360
but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.

11:47.360 --> 11:51.040
There's no such thing as space time fundamentally

11:51.600 --> 11:53.040
in the laws of physics.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.800
And that comes actually out of gravity together

11:58.800 --> 11:59.760
with quantum field theory.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.960
It just comes right out of it.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.880
It's a theorem of those two theories put together.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.920
But it doesn't tell you what's behind it.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.120
So the physicists know that their best theories,

12:11.680 --> 12:13.840
Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together,

12:15.040 --> 12:17.280
entail that space time cannot be fundamental,

12:17.280 --> 12:19.760
and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.400
They're just irreducible representations

12:22.400 --> 12:23.600
of the symmetries of space time.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.640
That's what they are.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.440
So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.600
We put together what the physicists are discovering,

12:29.600 --> 12:32.080
and we can talk about how they do that.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.680
And then we, the new discoveries

12:33.680 --> 12:35.280
from evolution of a natural selection,

12:35.280 --> 12:37.680
both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.080
And what both are saying is space time has had a good ride.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.160
It's been very useful.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.400
Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.240
And it's time for us to go beyond.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.200
When you say space time is doomed, is it the space?

12:52.240 --> 12:53.040
Is it the time?

12:53.040 --> 12:57.200
Is it the very hard coded specification of four dimensions?

12:59.600 --> 13:02.320
Or are you specifically referring to the kind of

13:03.440 --> 13:06.240
perceptual domain that humans operate in,

13:06.240 --> 13:07.200
which is space time?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.960
You think like there's a 3D,

13:09.920 --> 13:13.120
like our world is three-dimensional,

13:13.120 --> 13:15.280
and time progresses forward.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.000
Therefore, three dimensions plus one, 4D.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
What exactly do you mean by space time?

13:21.840 --> 13:23.920
What do you mean by space time is doomed?

13:23.920 --> 13:24.560
Great, great.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.480
So this is, by the way, not my quote.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.960
This is from, for example, Nima Arkany Ahmed

13:29.680 --> 13:31.600
at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.160
Ed Whitten also there.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.480
David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.200
So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,

13:39.200 --> 13:40.560
this is what the physicists are saying.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.240
Yeah, the physicists, they're space time skeptics.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.080
Yeah, they're saying that, and I can say exactly why

13:48.640 --> 13:51.520
they think it's doomed, but what they're saying is that,

13:51.520 --> 13:53.760
because your question was what aspect of space time,

13:53.760 --> 13:54.880
what are we talking about here?

13:54.880 --> 13:56.720
It's both space and time.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.600
They're union into space time as in Einstein's theory.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.320
That's doomed.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.240
And they're basically saying that

14:05.200 --> 14:09.120
even quantum theory, this is Nima Arkany Ahmed especially.

14:09.120 --> 14:12.880
So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.440
So that the notion of Hilbert space,

14:15.440 --> 14:18.880
which is really critical to quantum field theory,

14:18.880 --> 14:21.920
quantum information theory, that's not going to figure

14:21.920 --> 14:25.200
in the fundamental new laws of physics.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.440
So what they're looking for is some new mathematical structures

14:29.920 --> 14:35.200
beyond space time, beyond Einstein's four-dimensional space time,

14:35.200 --> 14:38.720
or super symmetric version, geometric algebra,

14:38.720 --> 14:41.040
signature, two comma four kind of,

14:41.040 --> 14:43.200
there are different ways that you can represent it,

14:43.200 --> 14:45.440
but they're finding new structures.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.200
And then by the way, they're succeeding now.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.880
They're finding, they found something called the amplitude

14:48.880 --> 14:49.520
to hydrant.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.520
This is Nima and his colleagues, the cosmological polytope.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.280
These are, so there are these like polytopes,

14:57.280 --> 15:01.520
these polyhedra in multi-dimensions, generalizations of simplices

15:02.400 --> 15:07.200
that are coding for, for example, the scattering amplitudes

15:07.200 --> 15:10.800
of processes in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.480
So they're finding that if they let go of space time completely,

15:15.280 --> 15:18.720
they're finding new ways of computing these scattering amplitudes

15:18.720 --> 15:22.240
that turn literally billions of terms into one term.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.640
When you do it in space and time, because it's the wrong framework,

15:26.720 --> 15:29.440
it's, it's, it's just a user interface from,

15:29.440 --> 15:30.800
that's now from the evolutionary point of view,

15:30.800 --> 15:32.080
it's just user interface.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.560
It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.800
So it's missing deep symmetry,

15:36.800 --> 15:38.880
it's something called a dual conformal symmetry,

15:38.880 --> 15:40.800
which turns out to be true of the scattering data,

15:40.800 --> 15:42.640
but you can't see it in space time.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.160
And it's making the computations way too complicated

15:46.160 --> 15:49.120
because you're trying to compute all the loops and Feynman diagrams

15:49.120 --> 15:50.240
and all the Feynman integrals.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.880
So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes

15:52.880 --> 15:56.400
is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,

15:56.480 --> 15:57.840
locality and uniterity.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.320
And so by, when you enforce those,

16:00.320 --> 16:03.520
you get all these loops and multiple, you know,

16:03.520 --> 16:04.480
different levels of loops.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.440
And for each of those, you have to add new terms to your computation.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.080
But when you do it outside of space time,

16:11.040 --> 16:13.600
you don't have the notion of uniterity.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.600
You don't have the notion of locality.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.200
You have something deeper.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.080
And it's capturing some symmetries that are actually true of the data.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.640
And, but then when you look at the geometry of the facets of these polytopes,

16:25.360 --> 16:30.720
then certain of them will code for uniterity and locality.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.360
So it actually comes out of the structure of these deep polytopes.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.400
So what we're finding is there's this whole new world,

16:36.400 --> 16:41.920
now beyond space time, that is making explicit symmetries

16:41.920 --> 16:44.480
that are true of the data that cannot be seen in space time.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.920
And that is turning the computations from billions of terms

16:47.920 --> 16:50.320
to one or two or a handful of terms.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.200
So we're getting insights into symmetries.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.280
And we're, and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple

16:55.280 --> 16:56.720
because we're not doing something silly.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.880
We're not adding up all these loops in space time.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.640
We're doing something far deeper.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.240
But they don't know what this world is about.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.600
So, you know, they're in an interesting position

17:07.040 --> 17:08.880
where we know that space time is doomed.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.200
And I should probably tell you why it's doomed,

17:11.200 --> 17:12.720
what they're saying about why it's doomed.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.440
But, but they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.560
What, what flashlight are we going to use to look into the dark

17:18.560 --> 17:19.600
beyond space time?

17:19.600 --> 17:22.800
Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory can't tell us.

17:23.200 --> 17:23.920
What's beyond them.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.240
All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,

17:26.240 --> 17:30.000
space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.520
10 to the minus 43 seconds.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.920
Beyond that, space time doesn't even make sense.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.840
It just has no operational definition.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.880
So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.520
And so they're, they're just looking for deep structures.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.600
Like guessing is really fun.

17:43.600 --> 17:47.440
So these really brilliant guys, generic, brilliant men and women

17:47.440 --> 17:49.760
who are doing this work, physicists,

17:49.760 --> 17:52.240
are making guesses about these structures.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.080
Informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,

17:54.080 --> 17:56.800
well, okay, what deeper structure could give us the stuff

17:56.800 --> 17:58.240
that we're seeing in space time,

17:58.240 --> 18:00.720
but without certain commitments that we have to make

18:00.720 --> 18:02.720
in space time, like locality unit.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.560
So they make these brilliant guesses.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.560
And of course, most of the time you're going to be wrong.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.520
But once you get one or two, that start to pay off.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.360
And then you get some lucky breaks.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.760
So they got lucky break back in 1986.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.360
Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor

18:18.320 --> 18:22.560
took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in

18:22.560 --> 18:25.520
at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.120
So that kind of scattering thing.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.160
So it's like apparently for people who are into this,

18:30.160 --> 18:31.920
that's sort of something that happens so often

18:31.920 --> 18:34.240
you need to be able to find it and get rid of those

18:34.240 --> 18:36.080
because you already know about that and need to.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.120
So you needed to compute them.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.760
It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.920
Even for the supercomputers couldn't do that

18:41.920 --> 18:44.400
for the many billions or millions of times per second

18:44.400 --> 18:45.040
they needed to do it.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.720
So they bagged, the experimentals bagged the theorists

18:48.720 --> 18:50.560
and please can you, you got it.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.040
So Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,

18:53.040 --> 18:57.440
hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And then a little bit later they guessed

19:00.000 --> 19:02.400
one term expression that turned out to be equivalent.

19:02.400 --> 19:07.120
So billions of terms reduced to one term

19:07.120 --> 19:10.720
that's so-called famous Park-Taylor formula, 1986.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.840
And that was like, okay, where did that come from?

19:13.920 --> 19:16.560
What, this is a pointer into a deep realm

19:17.200 --> 19:20.560
beyond space and time, but no one, I mean,

19:20.560 --> 19:21.600
what can you do with it?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.040
And they thought maybe it was a one-off,

19:23.040 --> 19:25.760
but then other formulas started coming up

19:25.760 --> 19:28.400
and then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamad and his team

19:28.400 --> 19:30.160
found this thing called the amplituhedron

19:30.160 --> 19:32.160
which really sort of captures the whole,

19:32.880 --> 19:34.320
a big part of the whole ball of wax.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.840
I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.320
So I won't say they did it all by any means.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.640
They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.

19:42.640 --> 19:48.880
So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars of modern science,

19:49.680 --> 19:52.160
quantum field theory with gravity on the one hand,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.560
and evolution by natural selection on the other.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.240
Just in the last 20 years have very clearly said

19:58.960 --> 20:00.480
space-time has had a good run.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.680
Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.600
So we had a great ontology of space-time,

20:05.600 --> 20:07.200
a great methodology of reductionism.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.280
Now it's time for a new trick.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.080
But now you need to go deeper.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.760
And show, by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away everything we've done,

20:15.760 --> 20:16.560
not by a long shot.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.880
Every new idea that we come up with beyond space-time

20:20.880 --> 20:23.200
must project precisely into space-time.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.480
And it better give us back everything that we know and love in space-time

20:26.480 --> 20:27.680
or generalizations.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.800
Or it's not going to be taken seriously and it shouldn't be.

20:30.800 --> 20:34.560
So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going to do

20:34.560 --> 20:35.440
beyond space-time.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.520
It needs to project into space-time.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.280
And whatever this deeper theory is,

20:39.280 --> 20:42.720
it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.320
This may not be part of this deeper realm.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.440
But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space-time

20:47.440 --> 20:49.120
and project it into space-time,

20:49.120 --> 20:51.680
it has to look like evolution by natural selection.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.320
Or it's wrong.

20:52.960 --> 20:57.360
So that's a strong constraint on this work.

20:57.360 --> 21:04.160
So even the evolution by natural selection and quantum field theory

21:05.120 --> 21:10.640
could be interfaces into something that doesn't look anything like,

21:11.520 --> 21:12.080
like you mentioned.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.800
I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution might be

21:15.360 --> 21:18.160
a very crappy interface into something much deeper.

21:18.160 --> 21:18.880
That's right.

21:18.880 --> 21:23.040
They're both telling us that the framework that you've had can only go so far.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.000
And it has to stop.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.440
And there's something beyond.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.040
And that framework, the very framework that is space and time itself.

21:29.040 --> 21:33.040
Now, of course, evolution by natural selection is not telling us

21:33.840 --> 21:36.240
about like Einstein's relativistic space time.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.240
So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.600
It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,

21:42.400 --> 21:49.040
which we have used as the basis for creating first a Newtonian space versus time

21:49.600 --> 21:53.440
as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.560
And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.960
So the relationship between what evolution is telling us

21:58.960 --> 22:00.960
and what the physicists are telling us is that,

22:00.960 --> 22:09.440
in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time are formulated as sort of

22:10.160 --> 22:12.400
rigorous extensions of our perceptual space,

22:14.080 --> 22:19.040
making it mathematically rigorous and laying out the symmetries that they find there.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.720
So that's sort of the relationship between them.

22:20.720 --> 22:27.040
So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.640
And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical extension

22:30.960 --> 22:34.880
of that into the Einsteinian formulation has to be,

22:34.880 --> 22:36.880
as well, not the final story.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.080
There's something deeper.

22:38.080 --> 22:43.120
So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces.

22:43.120 --> 22:49.040
As we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics,

22:49.920 --> 22:53.280
these are all, in your view, interfaces.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.640
Are we getting closer to objective reality?

22:59.280 --> 23:04.000
How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science,

23:04.800 --> 23:09.680
the reason we like those interfaces is because they're predictive of some aspects,

23:09.680 --> 23:12.880
strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.

23:14.080 --> 23:19.440
Is that completely deviating from our understanding of that reality?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.920
Or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?

23:22.640 --> 23:27.200
Well, of course, one critical constraint on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested

23:27.200 --> 23:30.800
and pass the experiments that we have for them.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.400
So no one's arguing against experiments being important

23:34.400 --> 23:40.560
and wanting to test all of our current theories and any new theories on that.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.520
So that's all there.

23:44.240 --> 23:50.800
But we have good reason to believe that science will never get a theory of everything.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.520
Everything, everything.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.680
Everything, everything, right, a final theory of everything, right?

23:56.320 --> 23:59.600
I think that my, my own take is for what it's worth is that

23:59.600 --> 24:03.040
girdles in completeness theorem sort of points us in that direction,

24:03.040 --> 24:08.480
that even with mathematics, any finite axiomatization that's

24:08.480 --> 24:10.400
sophisticated enough to be able to do arithmetic,

24:11.040 --> 24:14.160
it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true,

24:14.160 --> 24:18.800
that can't be proven, can't be deduced from within that framework.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.840
And if you add the new statements to your axioms,

24:21.840 --> 24:24.160
then there'll be always new statements that are true,

24:24.160 --> 24:26.000
but can't be proven with a new axiom system.

24:26.880 --> 24:32.560
And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,

24:32.560 --> 24:34.960
and also now evolution, are mathematical.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.440
So our theories are going to be, they're going to have their own assumptions,

24:38.400 --> 24:41.600
and they'll be mathematically precise.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.320
And there'll be theories perhaps of everything except those assumptions,

24:44.320 --> 24:46.960
because assumptions are, we say,

24:46.960 --> 24:48.160
please grant me these assumptions.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.640
If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain this other stuff.

24:51.440 --> 24:57.520
But so you have the assumptions that are like miracles,

24:57.520 --> 24:59.360
as far as the theory is concerned, they're not explained,

24:59.360 --> 25:01.600
they're the starting points for explanation.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.240
And then you have the mathematical structure of the theory itself,

25:04.240 --> 25:06.880
which will have the girdle limits.

25:07.520 --> 25:16.400
And so my take is that reality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend

25:16.400 --> 25:22.320
any conceptual theory that we can come up with.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.000
There's always going to be mystery at the edges.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.360
Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.

25:29.360 --> 25:29.680
Okay.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.080
And truths.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.840
So there's this idea that is brought up in the financial space of settlement,

25:37.840 --> 25:38.720
of transactions.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.400
It's often talked about in cryptocurrency especially.

25:42.480 --> 25:47.600
So you could do, money, cash is not connected to anything.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.080
It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,

25:52.080 --> 25:56.240
but then you can use money to exchange value to transact.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.880
So when it was on the gold standard,

25:59.760 --> 26:05.280
the money would represent some stable component of reality.

26:05.280 --> 26:11.280
Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation

26:12.160 --> 26:14.160
if we generalize that idea?

26:14.160 --> 26:21.520
Isn't it better to connect your, whatever we humans are doing in the social interaction

26:21.520 --> 26:26.560
space with each other, isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective to connect it

26:26.560 --> 26:33.600
to some degree to reality so that the transactions are settled with something that's universal,

26:33.600 --> 26:37.360
as opposed to us constantly operating in something that's a complete illusion?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.160
Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?

26:41.280 --> 26:50.800
Like where you really deviate very, very far away from the underlying reality?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.720
Or do you not never get in trouble for this?

26:53.600 --> 27:00.800
Can you just completely drift far, far away from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?

27:01.440 --> 27:02.240
That's a great question.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.800
On the financial side, there's two levels at least that we could take your question.

27:06.800 --> 27:10.720
One is strictly evolutionary psychology of financial systems.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.800
And that's pretty interesting.

27:13.440 --> 27:19.360
And there, the decentralized idea, the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies may make

27:19.360 --> 27:21.920
good sense from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.

27:23.520 --> 27:29.600
Human nature being what it is, putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers

27:30.560 --> 27:37.040
depends a lot on the veracity of those and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.

27:37.440 --> 27:41.200
We have ample evidence time and again that's often betrayed.

27:41.840 --> 27:47.040
So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say, to have a decentralized, I mean,

27:47.040 --> 27:48.480
democracy is a step in that direction.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.160
We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do.

27:52.160 --> 27:57.760
We decentralize things, because if you have Marcus Aurelio says you're emperor,

27:57.760 --> 27:58.480
you're great.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.040
If you have Nero, it's not so great.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.240
And so we don't want that.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.160
So democracy is a step in that direction.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.800
But I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step

28:08.800 --> 28:13.120
and is going to even make the democratization even greater.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.640
So that's one level.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.720
Also, the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is also

28:19.520 --> 28:22.320
a consequence of evolution.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.080
That's also a feature, I think.

28:26.880 --> 28:32.480
You can argue from the long span of living organisms, it's nice for power to corrupt.

28:33.440 --> 28:41.840
So mad men and women throughout history might be useful to teach us a lesson.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.640
We can learn from our negative example, right?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.120
Exactly.

28:47.280 --> 28:47.920
Right.

28:47.920 --> 28:52.240
Power does corrupt, and I think that you can think about that again from an evolutionary

28:52.240 --> 28:52.720
point of view.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.440
But I think that your question was a little deeper.

28:55.760 --> 29:03.200
When that was, does the evolutionary interface idea sort of unhinge science from

29:05.120 --> 29:08.480
some kind of important test for the theories?

29:10.400 --> 29:15.760
Does it mean that anything goes in scientific theory, but if we don't see the truth,

29:15.760 --> 29:18.080
is there no way to tether our theories and test them?

29:18.560 --> 29:24.080
And I think there's no problem there.

29:24.800 --> 29:29.520
We can only test things in terms of what we can measure with our senses in space and time.

29:29.520 --> 29:36.000
So we're going to have to continue to do experiments, but we're going to understand

29:36.000 --> 29:38.240
a little bit differently what those experiments are.

29:38.880 --> 29:45.600
We had thought that when we see a pointer on some machine in an experiment,

29:45.600 --> 29:49.920
that the machine exists, the pointer exists, and the values exist even when no one

29:49.920 --> 29:52.640
is looking at them, and that they're an objective truth.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.880
And our best theories are telling us no.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.840
Pointers are just pointers, and that's what you have to rely on for making your judgments.

30:02.800 --> 30:09.840
But even the pointers themselves are not the objective reality.

30:10.480 --> 30:15.840
So and I think Gertl is telling us that not that anything goes, but

30:16.800 --> 30:20.800
as you develop new axiom systems, you will find out what goes within that axiom system

30:21.520 --> 30:23.600
and what testable predictions you can make.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.680
So I don't think we're untethered.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.840
We continue to do experiments.

30:27.840 --> 30:32.960
What I think we won't have that we want is a conceptual understanding

30:33.920 --> 30:36.640
that gives us a theory of everything that's final and complete.

30:37.440 --> 30:42.720
I think that this is, to put it another way, this is job security for scientists.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.120
Our job will never be done.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.720
It's job security for neuroscience.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.640
Because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,

30:50.640 --> 30:57.440
we saw neurons and neural networks and action potentials and synapses and so forth,

30:57.440 --> 30:59.680
and that was the reality.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.680
Now we have to reverse engineer that.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.680
We have to say what is beyond space-time?

31:04.640 --> 31:05.680
What is going on?

31:05.680 --> 31:08.240
What is a dynamical system beyond space-time?

31:08.240 --> 31:10.480
That when we project it into Einstein space-time,

31:10.480 --> 31:13.920
gives us things that look like neurons and neural networks and synapses.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.400
So we have to reverse engineer.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.880
So there's going to be lots more work for neuroscience.

31:18.880 --> 31:23.760
It's going to be far more complicated and difficult and challenging.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.960
But that's wonderful.

31:24.960 --> 31:25.920
That's what we need to do.

31:25.920 --> 31:29.280
We thought neurons exist when they are perceived and they don't.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.920
In the same way that if I show you, when I say they don't exist,

31:31.920 --> 31:33.360
I should be very, very concrete.

31:34.320 --> 31:40.400
If I draw on a piece of paper a little sketch of something that is called the necker cube,

31:40.400 --> 31:42.640
it's just a little line drawing of a cube.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.920
It's on a flat piece of paper.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.320
If I execute it well and I show it to you, you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.680
Sometimes you'll see one face in front.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.120
Sometimes you'll see the other face in front.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.960
But if I ask you, which face is in front when you don't look?

31:57.200 --> 32:00.320
The answer is, well, neither face is in front because there's no cube.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.560
This is a flat piece of paper.

32:03.200 --> 32:07.520
So when you look at the piece of paper, you perceptually create the cube.

32:08.400 --> 32:13.120
And when you look at it, then you fix one face to be in front and one face to be in front.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.920
So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.080
Space time itself is like the cube.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.840
It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,

32:21.840 --> 32:27.280
whatever your sensory systems mean now, because we now have to even take that for granted.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.720
But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.920
And they're data structures and the computer science says,

32:33.920 --> 32:35.600
and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.360
So you create them and garbage collect them.

32:37.360 --> 32:45.440
But is it possible that it's mapped well in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality?

32:45.440 --> 32:50.560
The sheet of paper, the two-dimensional space, or we can talk about space time,

32:51.200 --> 32:58.480
maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand, but we'll one day understand

32:58.560 --> 32:59.520
what that mapping is.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.800
But it maps reliably.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.320
It is tethered in that way.

33:02.880 --> 33:03.440
Well, yes.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.600
And so the new theories that the physicists are finding beyond space time have that kind of

33:07.600 --> 33:08.080
tethering.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.760
So they show precisely how you start with an amplitude hydrant

33:11.760 --> 33:17.600
and how you project this high-dimensional structure into the four dimensions of space time.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.240
So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.

33:22.240 --> 33:25.040
And they're doing the same thing with the cosmological polytopes.

33:25.600 --> 33:32.800
So they're the ones that are making the most concrete and fun advances going beyond space time.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.400
And they're tethering it.

33:35.200 --> 33:40.960
They say this is precisely the mathematical projection from this deeper structure into space time.

33:41.760 --> 33:46.800
One thing I'll say about, as a nonphysicist, what I find interesting is that they're finding just

33:47.600 --> 33:50.320
geometry, but there's no notion of dynamics.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.960
Right now, they're just finding these static geometric structures,

33:55.840 --> 33:57.120
which is impressive.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.240
So I'm not putting them down.

33:58.240 --> 34:05.440
This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated and brilliant and adventurous.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.160
It's all those things.

34:08.160 --> 34:12.800
And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective because geometry is beautiful.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.000
It's absolutely.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.680
And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data that can't be seen in space time.

34:18.640 --> 34:24.160
But I'm looking for a theory beyond space time that's a dynamical theory.

34:25.120 --> 34:29.840
I would love to find, and we can talk about that at some point, a theory of consciousness in which

34:30.800 --> 34:36.320
the dynamics of consciousness itself will give rise to the geometry that the physicists are

34:36.320 --> 34:37.760
finding beyond space time.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.520
If we can do that, then we'd have a completely different way of looking at how consciousness

34:41.520 --> 34:46.160
is related to what we call the brain or the physical world more generally.

34:46.240 --> 34:51.360
Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues, about 99% of them, are trying to...

34:53.920 --> 34:55.600
They're assuming space time is fundamental.

34:56.560 --> 35:00.880
They're assuming that particles are fundamental, quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.000
Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.920
And that therefore neurons and brains are part of objective reality.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.840
And that somehow when you get matter that's complicated enough,

35:12.720 --> 35:17.760
it will somehow generate conscious experiences by its functional properties.

35:17.760 --> 35:23.040
Or if you're panpsychist, maybe in addition to the physical properties of particles, you add

35:24.000 --> 35:27.120
consciousness property as well.

35:27.120 --> 35:32.080
And then you combine these physical and conscious properties to get more complicated ones.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.480
But they're all doing it within space time.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.680
All of the work that's being done on consciousness and its relationship

35:40.640 --> 35:45.760
to the brain has all assumed something that our best theories are telling us is doomed,

35:45.760 --> 35:46.720
space time.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.240
Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?

35:50.240 --> 35:51.680
So you bring up space time.

35:53.520 --> 35:58.320
I mean, that's just one useful interface we've used for a long time.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.600
Surely there's other interfaces.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.360
Is space time just one of the big ones that you...

36:05.360 --> 36:09.520
To build up people's intuition about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?

36:10.320 --> 36:16.240
Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw in the way we see the world?

36:17.360 --> 36:21.600
Well, everything else that we think we know are things in space time.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.160
Sure.

36:24.160 --> 36:32.720
And so when you say space time is doomed, this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,

36:32.720 --> 36:35.040
the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.760
Not to the scientific method, but to the fundamental ontology and also the fundamental

36:41.760 --> 36:47.280
methodology, the ontology of space time and its contents, and the methodology of reductionism,

36:47.280 --> 36:53.920
which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time, we will find more and more fundamental

36:53.920 --> 36:54.240
laws.

36:55.040 --> 37:00.720
And that's been very useful for space and time for centuries, reductionism for centuries.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.640
But now we realize that that's over.

37:04.640 --> 37:08.640
Reductionism is in fact dead as a space time.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.480
What exactly is reductionism?

37:10.480 --> 37:17.600
What is the process of reductionism that is different than some of the physicists that

37:17.600 --> 37:21.920
you mentioned that are trying to let go of the assumption of space time?

37:21.920 --> 37:22.640
What can be on?

37:22.640 --> 37:27.200
Isn't that still trying to come up with a simple model that explains this whole thing?

37:27.200 --> 37:28.480
Isn't it still reducing?

37:29.280 --> 37:33.040
It's a wonderful question because it really helps to clarify two different notions,

37:33.040 --> 37:39.280
which is scientific explanation on the one hand and a particular kind of scientific explanation

37:39.280 --> 37:40.800
on the other, which is the reductionist.

37:40.800 --> 37:46.720
So the reductionist explanation is saying, I will start with things that are smaller

37:46.720 --> 37:51.040
in space time and therefore more fundamental, where the laws are more fundamental.

37:51.040 --> 37:54.800
So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.

37:54.800 --> 38:00.160
Whereas in science, more generally, we just say like when Einstein did the special theory

38:00.160 --> 38:03.440
of relativity, he's saying, let me have a couple postulates.

38:03.440 --> 38:11.040
I will assume that the speed of light is universal for all observers in uniform motion

38:11.840 --> 38:18.080
and that the laws of physics, for uniform motion, are that's not a reductionist.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.920
Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.280
I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.400
It's not a reductionist thing.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.800
You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.560
You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.160
Same thing with this theory of gravity.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.600
It's the falling elevator idea, right?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.440
So it's not a reductionist kind of thing.

38:38.880 --> 38:39.680
It's something different.

38:39.680 --> 38:44.320
So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.440
Reductionism has been a particularly useful kind of scientific explanation,

38:49.440 --> 38:53.360
for example, in thermodynamics, where the notion that we have of heat,

38:53.360 --> 38:55.760
some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat.

38:56.560 --> 39:01.040
It turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered, well, hey, if we go to smaller

39:01.040 --> 39:03.840
and smaller scales, we find these things called molecules or atoms.

39:04.480 --> 39:08.640
If we think of them as bouncing around and having some kind of energy,

39:08.640 --> 39:13.840
then what we call heat is really can be reduced to that.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.960
So that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,

39:18.960 --> 39:23.760
is a useful kind of scientific explanation that works within a range of scales

39:23.760 --> 39:25.280
within space time.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.320
But we know now precisely where that has to stop,

39:28.320 --> 39:32.080
at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

39:32.640 --> 39:37.360
And I would be impressed if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.760
I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.160
I don't even know how to comprehend either of those numbers, frankly.

39:47.120 --> 39:51.360
Just a small aside, because I am a computer science person,

39:51.360 --> 39:53.360
I also find cellular automata beautiful.

39:54.800 --> 40:01.280
So you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram, who recently has been very excitedly exploring

40:02.320 --> 40:07.920
a proposal for a data structure that could be the numbers that would make you a little bit

40:07.920 --> 40:11.440
happier in terms of scale, because they're very, very, very, very tiny.

40:11.680 --> 40:17.920
So do you like this space of exploration of really thinking, letting go of space time,

40:18.480 --> 40:22.080
letting go of everything and trying to think what kind of data structures could be

40:22.080 --> 40:23.760
underneath this whole mess?

40:23.760 --> 40:24.240
That's right.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.680
So if they're thinking about these as outside of space time,

40:27.680 --> 40:29.040
then that's what we have to do.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.560
That's what our best theories are telling us.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.480
You now have to think outside of space time.

40:32.480 --> 40:40.240
Now, of course, I should back up and say, we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?

40:40.240 --> 40:42.880
But that doesn't mean that there's not good work to do Newton.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.080
There's all sorts of Newtonian physics that takes us to the moon and so forth,

40:46.080 --> 40:49.840
and there's lots of good problems that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.200
The same thing will be true of space time.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.840
We'll still, it's not like we're going to stop using space time.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.320
We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.

40:56.320 --> 41:04.080
But for those scientists who are really looking to go deeper, to actually find the next,

41:04.080 --> 41:07.360
just like what Einstein did to Newton, what are we going to do to Einstein?

41:07.360 --> 41:10.880
How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory to something deeper?

41:10.880 --> 41:13.120
Then we have to actually let go.

41:13.120 --> 41:17.520
And if we're going to do like this automata kind of approach,

41:18.720 --> 41:23.520
it's critical that it's not automata in space time, it's automata prior to space time,

41:23.520 --> 41:25.760
from which we're going to show how space time emerges.

41:25.760 --> 41:29.520
If you're doing automata within space time, well, that might be a fun model,

41:29.520 --> 41:31.840
but it's not the radical new step that we need.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.080
Yeah, so the space time emerges from that whatever system,

41:36.080 --> 41:39.360
and like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.

41:39.360 --> 41:43.360
Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means when we go beyond?

41:45.600 --> 41:49.600
When you start to think about dynamics, that could mean a lot of things.

41:50.240 --> 41:56.320
Even causality could mean a lot of things if we realize that everything's an interface.

41:58.160 --> 42:01.280
Like what, how much do we really know is an interesting question?

42:01.280 --> 42:05.360
Because you brought up neurons, I got to ask you on another, yet another tangent.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.000
There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at called,

42:08.640 --> 42:11.440
Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?

42:11.440 --> 42:15.360
And I just enjoyed that thought experiment that they provided, which is,

42:15.920 --> 42:21.360
they basically, it's a couple of neuroscientists, Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,

42:22.240 --> 42:27.680
who use the tools of neuroscience to analyze a microprocessor.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.520
I saw a computer chip.

42:30.240 --> 42:34.320
If we lesion it here, what happens and so forth, and if you go and lesion in a computer,

42:35.680 --> 42:39.040
it's very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers are not going to give you a lot

42:39.040 --> 42:40.320
of insight into how it works.

42:40.320 --> 42:44.000
And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of just using the basic approaches of

42:44.000 --> 42:49.360
neuroscience collecting the data, trying to intuit about the underlying function of it.

42:49.360 --> 42:55.440
And that helps you understand that our scientific exploration of concepts,

42:55.440 --> 43:04.080
depending on the field, are maybe in the very, very early stages.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.360
I wouldn't say it leaves us astray.

43:08.320 --> 43:13.920
Perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not a, it's not anywhere close to some fundamental

43:13.920 --> 43:16.320
mechanism that actually makes the thing work.

43:16.320 --> 43:20.960
I don't know if you can sort of comment on that in terms of using neuroscience to understand

43:20.960 --> 43:24.080
the human mind and neurons.

43:24.080 --> 43:29.280
Are we really far away potentially from understanding in the way we understand

43:30.480 --> 43:33.680
the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?

43:33.680 --> 43:39.200
So one thing about understanding is you can understand for fun.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.960
The other one is to understand so you could build things.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.760
And that's when you really have to understand.

43:49.040 --> 43:49.840
Exactly.

43:49.920 --> 43:57.520
In fact, what got me into the field that I at MIT was work by David Maher on this very topic.

43:57.520 --> 44:02.720
So David Maher was a professor at MIT, but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience, studying

44:02.720 --> 44:05.200
just the architectures of the brain.

44:05.200 --> 44:08.480
But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.

44:09.920 --> 44:16.960
He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was, left him unsatisfied because he didn't

44:16.960 --> 44:21.680
know what the cerebellum was for and why it had that architecture.

44:21.680 --> 44:29.120
And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there and he said, he had this three-level

44:29.120 --> 44:30.640
approach that really grabbed my attention.

44:30.640 --> 44:34.720
So when I was an undergrad at UCLA, I read one of his papers in a class and said,

44:34.720 --> 44:35.280
who is this guy?

44:35.280 --> 44:37.440
Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.720
What is being computed and why?

44:40.240 --> 44:41.280
An algorithm.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.320
How is it being computed?

44:42.320 --> 44:44.880
What are the algorithms?

44:44.880 --> 44:45.920
And then the hardware.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.760
How does it get instantiated in the hardware?

44:47.760 --> 44:52.640
And so to really do neuroscience, he argued, we needed to have understanding at all those levels.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.320
And that really got me.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.320
I loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was saying, if you can't build it,

44:58.320 --> 45:00.000
you don't understand it effectively.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.840
And so that's why I went to MIT.

45:01.840 --> 45:07.520
And I had the pleasure of working with David until he died just a year and a half later.

45:09.120 --> 45:13.920
So there's been that idea that with neuroscience, we have to have,

45:13.920 --> 45:18.800
in some sense, a top-down model of what's being computed and why

45:18.800 --> 45:19.920
that we would then go after.

45:19.920 --> 45:24.800
And the same thing with the trying to reverse engineer a computing system like your laptop.

45:25.360 --> 45:29.520
We really need to understand what the user interface is about and why we have

45:30.080 --> 45:34.080
what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.

45:34.080 --> 45:39.360
You need to know why to really understand all the circuitry and what it's for.

45:40.320 --> 45:48.880
Now, evolution of a natural selection does not tell us the deeper question

45:50.480 --> 45:53.120
that we're asking, the answer to the deeper question, which is why.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.800
What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?

45:59.520 --> 46:05.200
All it tells us is that whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

46:06.160 --> 46:11.360
What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

46:12.080 --> 46:18.000
So just to linger on this fascinating bold question that shakes you out of your dream state,

46:18.880 --> 46:27.040
does this fiction still help you in building intuitions as literary fiction does about reality?

46:27.680 --> 46:36.240
The reason we read literary fiction is it helps us build intuitions and an understanding

46:36.240 --> 46:40.320
in indirect ways sneak up to the difficult questions of human nature.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.280
Great fiction.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.160
Same with this observed reality.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.120
Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,

46:49.120 --> 46:54.080
help us build intuition about deeper truths of how this whole mess works?

46:54.960 --> 47:00.480
Well, I think that each theory that we propose will give its own answer to that question.

47:01.760 --> 47:06.240
When the physicists are proposing these structures like the amplitude

47:06.240 --> 47:11.040
hydrant and cosmological polytope, associated hydrant and so forth, beyond space time,

47:11.040 --> 47:14.960
we can then ask your question for those specific structures and say,

47:14.960 --> 47:19.840
how much information, for example, does evolution of a natural selection and the

47:20.720 --> 47:26.880
kinds of sensory systems that we have right now give us about this deeper reality?

47:26.880 --> 47:29.920
And why did we evolve this way?

47:29.920 --> 47:32.960
We can try to answer that question from within the deeper.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.880
So there's not going to be a general answer.

47:34.880 --> 47:39.280
I think what we'll have to do is posit these new deeper theories

47:39.280 --> 47:43.520
and then try to answer your question within the framework of those deeper theories,

47:43.520 --> 47:46.480
knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.

47:47.120 --> 47:49.200
So is this paralyzing though?

47:49.760 --> 47:55.840
Because how do we know we're not completely adrift out to see

47:55.840 --> 48:00.000
lost forever from, so like that our theories are completely lost?

48:00.000 --> 48:07.680
So if it's all, if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,

48:09.120 --> 48:11.680
if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,

48:12.000 --> 48:17.440
isn't that paralyzing for a scientific mind?

48:17.440 --> 48:21.200
Well, it's interesting that you say introspect to the bottom,

48:23.040 --> 48:28.800
because there is that, there is one, again, this isn't the same spirit of what I said before,

48:28.800 --> 48:32.640
which is it depends on what answer you give to what's beyond space time,

48:32.640 --> 48:35.120
what answer we would give to your question, right?

48:35.120 --> 48:40.880
So but one answer that is interesting to explore is something that spiritual traditions

48:40.880 --> 48:43.600
have said for thousands of years, but haven't said precisely.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.800
So we can't take it seriously in science until it's made precise,

48:46.800 --> 48:48.240
but we might be able to make it precise.

48:49.200 --> 48:54.640
And that is that they've also said something like space and time aren't fundamental,

48:54.640 --> 48:56.000
they're Maya, they're illusion.

48:56.720 --> 49:01.120
And but that if you look inside, if you introspect

49:03.120 --> 49:05.600
and let go of all of your particular perceptions,

49:07.200 --> 49:10.080
you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.

49:11.200 --> 49:18.720
And that is, they claim, being in contact with the deep ground of being that transcends

49:18.720 --> 49:20.480
any particular conceptual understanding.

49:21.120 --> 49:23.280
If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,

49:24.240 --> 49:27.520
but and I'm not saying it's not correct, I'm just saying if that's correct,

49:28.320 --> 49:33.200
then it would be the case that as scientists, because we also are in touch with this ground of

49:33.200 --> 49:39.360
being, we would then not be able to conceptually understand ourselves all the way.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.160
But we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.

49:43.520 --> 49:49.920
And so we would, there would be a sense in which there is a fundamental grounding to the whole

49:49.920 --> 49:52.640
enterprise, because we're not separate from the enterprise.

49:53.200 --> 49:57.280
This is the opposite of third, the impersonal third person science.

49:57.280 --> 50:00.640
This would make science go personal all the way down.

50:01.600 --> 50:05.600
And but but nevertheless, scientific, because the scientific method would still be

50:05.840 --> 50:10.400
what we would use all the way down for the conceptual understanding.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.720
Unfortunately, you still don't know if you went all the way down.

50:12.720 --> 50:17.200
It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is, and we'll talk about it,

50:17.200 --> 50:22.320
is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.

50:25.040 --> 50:30.320
It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality, but you still don't know when you

50:30.320 --> 50:34.720
get to the bottom, you know, a lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs, and they'll

50:34.720 --> 50:39.600
say, well, that takes my mind to certain places where it feels like that is

50:40.320 --> 50:42.960
revealing some deeper truth of reality.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.800
But you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.

50:46.800 --> 50:52.400
That's, that's in your view of this, you really don't know.

50:52.400 --> 50:55.600
I mean, Gato's incompleteness is that you really don't know.

50:55.600 --> 51:00.560
My own view on it, for what it's worth, because I don't know the right answer,

51:00.560 --> 51:04.880
but my own view on it right now is that it, it's never ending.

51:05.680 --> 51:11.040
I think that there will never, that this is great, as I said before, great job security for science,

51:12.000 --> 51:17.680
and that we, if this is true, and if, if consciousness is somehow important or

51:17.680 --> 51:21.440
fundamental in the universe, this may be an important fundamental fact about consciousness

51:21.440 --> 51:26.480
itself, that, that it's never ending exploration that's going on in some sense.

51:27.440 --> 51:31.760
Well, well, that's interesting, let me push back on the job security.

51:31.760 --> 51:32.080
Okay.

51:34.400 --> 51:40.800
So maybe as we understand this kind of idea deeper and deeper, we understand that the pursuit

51:40.800 --> 51:48.320
is not a fruitful one, that maybe we need to, maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere,

51:48.320 --> 51:51.120
is you get smarter and smarter and smarter.

51:51.120 --> 51:58.240
You realize that like exploration is, there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.

51:59.200 --> 52:05.520
You could be, you could be sort of living maximally in some way that's not exploration.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.960
You know, I could, there's all kinds of video games you can construct and put yourself inside

52:10.960 --> 52:14.400
of them that don't involve you going outside of the game world.

52:15.040 --> 52:20.880
It's, you know, feeling for my human perspective, what seems to be fun is challenging yourself,

52:20.880 --> 52:22.480
and overcoming those challenges.

52:22.480 --> 52:26.000
So you can constantly artificially generate challenges for yourself,

52:26.000 --> 52:30.640
like Sisyphus and his boulder, just, and that's it.

52:30.640 --> 52:34.960
So the scientific method that's always reaching out to the stars, that's always trying to figure

52:34.960 --> 52:39.360
out the puzzle on bottom puzzle, the trick, always trying to get to the bottom turtle.

52:40.480 --> 52:46.880
Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition that that's infinite pursuit, we get,

52:47.600 --> 52:53.760
we agree to start deviating from that pursuit, start enjoying the here and now versus the

52:54.320 --> 52:56.480
looking out into the unknown always.

52:56.480 --> 53:07.440
Maybe that's looking out into the unknown is a early activity for a species that's evolved.

53:07.440 --> 53:12.400
I'm just sort of saying pushing back is you probably got a lot of scientists excited in terms

53:12.400 --> 53:13.520
of job security.

53:13.520 --> 53:20.320
I could envision where it's not job security or scientists become more and more useless.

53:21.920 --> 53:29.600
Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom that allows us to study our own history,

53:29.600 --> 53:32.160
but not much more than that.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.400
Just to find pushback.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.200
That's good pushback.

53:36.400 --> 53:39.520
I'll put one in there for the scientists again, but sure.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.440
But then I'll take the other side too.

53:41.440 --> 53:49.200
So when Faraday did all of his experiments with magnets and electricity and so forth,

53:50.160 --> 53:54.160
came with all this wonderful empirical data and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it and

53:54.720 --> 53:58.080
wrote down a few equations, which we can now write down in a single equation,

53:58.080 --> 54:00.880
the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra, just one equation.

54:03.840 --> 54:09.360
That opened up unbelievable technologies where people are zooming and talking to each other

54:09.360 --> 54:12.720
around the world, the whole electronics industry.

54:13.680 --> 54:18.160
There was something that transformed our lives in a very positive way.

54:19.440 --> 54:24.560
With the theories beyond space time, here's one potential.

54:26.400 --> 54:31.040
Right now, most of the galaxies that we see, we can see them,

54:31.040 --> 54:34.000
but we know that we could never get to them no matter how fast we traveled.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.200
They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond, so we can't ever get to them.

54:39.280 --> 54:42.640
There's all this beautiful real estate that's just smiling and waving at us,

54:42.640 --> 54:43.680
and we can never get to it.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.160
But that's if we go through space time.

54:47.200 --> 54:51.600
But if we recognize that space time is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.

54:52.640 --> 54:56.160
We're not little things inside space time.

54:56.160 --> 54:59.440
Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.360
It's just the other way around.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.960
Once we understand that and we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time,

55:06.960 --> 55:10.560
maybe we won't have to go through space time.

55:10.560 --> 55:11.680
Maybe we can go around it.

55:11.680 --> 55:14.160
Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri and not go through space.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.640
I can just go right there directly.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.520
It's a data structure.

55:17.520 --> 55:18.800
We can start to play with it.

55:20.160 --> 55:26.480
I think that for what it's worth, my take would be that the endless

55:28.480 --> 55:34.000
sequence of theories that we could contemplate building will lead to an endless

55:34.960 --> 55:41.360
sequence of new remarkable insights into the potentialities, the possibilities

55:41.360 --> 55:47.520
that would seem miraculous to us, and that we will be motivated to continue the exploration

55:47.520 --> 55:52.000
partly just for the technological innovations that come out.

55:52.800 --> 55:57.680
But the other thing that you mentioned, though, what about just being?

55:57.680 --> 56:02.240
What have we decided instead of all this doing and exploring what about being?

56:02.320 --> 56:09.840
My guess is that the best scientists will do both and that the act of being

56:11.520 --> 56:17.840
will be a place where they get many of their ideas and that they then pull into their conceptual

56:17.840 --> 56:18.640
realm.

56:18.640 --> 56:23.040
And I think many of the best scientists, Einstein comes to mind where these guys say,

56:23.040 --> 56:26.880
look, I didn't come up with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.

56:27.520 --> 56:33.920
I was thinking in vague images and it was just something non-conceptual.

56:33.920 --> 56:38.720
And then it took me a long, long time to pull it out into concepts and then

56:38.720 --> 56:40.560
longer to put it into math.

56:40.560 --> 56:45.600
But the real insights didn't come from just slavishly playing with equations.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.600
They came from a deeper place.

56:48.240 --> 56:53.600
And so there may be this going back and forth between the complete non-conceptual

56:54.560 --> 56:57.520
where there's essentially no end to the wisdom.

56:57.520 --> 57:01.520
And then conceptual systems where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.

57:02.160 --> 57:06.240
And that may be if consciousness is important and fundamental.

57:06.240 --> 57:09.600
That may be what consciousness, at least part of what consciousness is about, is this

57:10.240 --> 57:13.920
discovering itself, discovering its possibilities, so to speak.

57:13.920 --> 57:20.800
And we can talk about what that might mean by going from the non-conceptual to the conceptual

57:21.360 --> 57:25.520
back and forth to get better and better and better at being.

57:26.400 --> 57:26.720
Right.

57:27.280 --> 57:32.080
Let me ask you, just to link on the evolutionary, because you mentioned

57:32.080 --> 57:36.560
evolutionary game theory and that's really where you, the perspective from which you come

57:38.400 --> 57:39.920
to form the case against reality.

57:42.000 --> 57:48.880
At which point in our evolutionary history do we start to deviate the most from reality?

57:49.440 --> 57:54.960
Is it way before life even originated on earth?

57:55.760 --> 58:00.800
Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?

58:02.160 --> 58:07.520
Or is it when some inklings of what we think of as intelligence or maybe even

58:09.040 --> 58:12.800
complex consciousness started to emerge?

58:12.800 --> 58:18.720
So where did this deviation, just like with the interfaces in a computer,

58:19.360 --> 58:27.040
you start with transistors and then you have assembly and then you have C, C++,

58:27.040 --> 58:31.360
then you have Python, then you have GUIs, all that kind of, you have layers upon layers.

58:31.360 --> 58:32.560
When did we start to deviate?

58:33.200 --> 58:40.080
Well, David Maher, again, my advisor at MIT, in his book Vision, suggested that the more

58:40.080 --> 58:46.560
primitive sensory systems were less realistic, less theoretical, but that by the time you got

58:46.560 --> 58:50.240
to something as complicated as the humans, we were actually estimating the true

58:51.120 --> 58:53.280
shapes and distances to objects and so forth.

58:53.840 --> 59:00.160
So his point of view, and I think it was probably, it's not an uncommon view among

59:00.800 --> 59:07.280
my colleagues, that the sensory systems of lower creatures may just not be complicated

59:07.280 --> 59:08.960
enough to give them much, much truth.

59:09.920 --> 59:14.800
But as you get to 86 billion neurons, you can now compute the truth or at least

59:14.800 --> 59:16.160
the parts of the truth that we need.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.120
When I look at evolutionary game theory,

59:21.680 --> 59:27.120
one of my graduate students, Justin Mark, did some simulations using genetic algorithms.

59:27.680 --> 59:34.400
So there, he was just exploring, we start off with random organisms, random sensory genetics

59:34.400 --> 59:39.600
and random actions and the first generation was unbelievably, there was a foraging situation,

59:39.600 --> 59:44.080
they were foraging for resources and most of them, you know, stayed in one place,

59:44.080 --> 59:51.840
didn't do anything important and, but we could then just look at how the genes evolved and what

59:51.840 --> 01:00:04.080
we found was, what he found was that basically you never even saw the truth organisms even come

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.560
on the stage.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.720
If they came, they were gone in one generation, they just weren't.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:16.240
So they came and went, even just in one generation, they just are not good enough.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.160
The ones that were just tracking, their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.400
were far more fit than the truth seekers.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.760
So from, so an answer at one level, I want to give an answer to a deeper level,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.160
but just with evolutionary game theory, because my attitude as a scientist is,

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.480
I don't believe any of our theories.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.680
I take them very, very seriously, I study them, I look at their implications, but

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.640
none of them are the gospel, they're just the latest ideas that we have.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.320
So the reason I study evolutionary game theory is because that's the best tool we have

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.240
right now in this area.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.280
There is nothing else that competes.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.360
So as a scientist is my responsibility to take the best tools and see what they mean.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.840
And the same thing the physicists are doing, they're taking the best tools and looking at what

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.480
they entail.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.720
But I don't, I think that science now has enough experience to realize that we should not

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.040
believe our theories in the sense that we've now arrived.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.320
In 1890, it was a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:28.240
They were discouraging bright young students from going into physics because it was all done.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.720
And that's precisely the wrong attitude.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.840
Forever is the wrong attitude forever.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.400
The attitude we should have is a century from now, they'll be looking at us and laughing

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.600
at what we didn't know.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.080
And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.720
Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant right now, our final theory of

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.200
everything.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.600
A century from now, they'll look at us like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.280
how could they have been so dumb?

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.600
Yeah, so I don't want to make that mistake.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.800
So I'm not Dr. Nair about any of our current scientific theories.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.200
I am Dr. Nair about this.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.320
We should use the best tools we have right now.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.040
And with humility.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.360
Well, so let me ask you about game theory.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:20.240
There's, I love game theory, evolution game theory, but I'm always suspicious of it,

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.160
like economics.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:30.160
When you construct models, it's too easy to construct things that oversimplify

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:38.800
just because we are human brains enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.280
that somehow represent organisms or represent people and running a simulation that then allows

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.960
you to build up intuition.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.760
And then it feels really good because you can get some really deep and surprising intuitions.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.760
But how do you know your models aren't the assumptions underlying your models on some

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.800
fundamentally flawed.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.880
And because of that, your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.920
So I guess my question is, what are the limits in your use of game theory,

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.160
evolution game theory, your experience with it?

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.760
What are the limits of game theory?

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.640
So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues and friends who have tried to rerun

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.400
simulations and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth is not comfortable.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.320
And so many of my colleagues are very interested in trying to show that we're wrong.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.480
And so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something, as you're suggesting,

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.880
maybe something special that wasn't completely general.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.160
We've got some little special part of the whole search space and evolutionary game theory

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.440
in which this happens to be true.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.560
But more generally, organisms would evolve to see the truth.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.360
So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.840
And they suggested that if you use thousands of payoff functions,

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.600
our simulations would just use a couple, one or two,

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.160
because it was our first simulations.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.120
So that would be a limit.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.680
We had one or two payoff functions we showed the result in those,

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.960
at least for the genetic algorithms.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.400
And they said, if you have 20,000 of them, then we can find these conditions in which

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.400
truth-seeing organisms would be the ones that evolved and survived.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:25.120
And so we looked at their simulations, and it certainly is the case that you can find

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.520
special cases in which truth can evolve.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.400
So when I say it's probability zero, it doesn't mean it can't happen.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.120
It can happen.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.880
In fact, it could happen infinitely often.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.320
It's just probability zero.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.600
So if probability zero things can happen infinitely often.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.040
When you say probability zero, you mean probability close to zero.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.960
To be very precise.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.560
So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane,

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:56.080
and I use a probability measure in which the area of a region is this probability,

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.520
then if I draw a curve in that unit square,

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.840
it has measure precisely zero, precisely, not approximately, precisely zero.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.280
And yet it has infinitely many points.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.360
So there's an object that for that probability measure has probability zero,

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.240
and yet there's infinitely many points in it.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.840
So that's what I mean when I say that the things that are probability zero

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.840
can happen infinitely often in principle.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:27.280
Yeah, but infinity, as far as I, and I look outside often at walk around

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.280
and I look at people, I haven't never seen infinity in real life.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.920
That's an interesting issue.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.720
I've been looking.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.440
I've been looking.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.120
I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.600
And so the tools of mathematics, you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.120
that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.400
That's a big debate in mathematics.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.960
The intuitionist versus the ones who take, for example, the real numbers as real.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.960
And that's a fun discussion.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.800
Nicholas Giesen has a physicist who has a really interesting work recently

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.760
on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:13.440
you could effectively quantize Newton, and you find that Newtonian theory and quantum theory

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.320
aren't that different once you go with it.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:16.880
It's funny.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.000
It's really quite interesting.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.640
So the issue you raise is a very, very deep one, and one that I think we should take quite

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:30.400
seriously, which is how shall we think about the reality of the contrast hierarchy,

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:41.760
a1, a2, and all these different infinities versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.200
So everything's computable in some sense.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.520
Everything's finite as big as you want, but nevertheless finite.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:57.520
So yeah, ultimately boils down to whether the world is discrete or continuous in some

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.400
general sense.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:06.320
And again, we can't really know, but there's just a mind-breaking thought, just common sense

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:12.560
reasoning, that something can happen and is yet probability of it happening is 0%.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.160
That doesn't compute for common sense computer.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.800
Right.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.520
This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician to really, and I'm not.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.880
Sharp is one word.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.440
What I'm saying is common sense computer is, I mean that in a very kind of,

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:38.000
in a positive sense, because we've been talking about perception systems and interfaces,

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.960
if we are to reason about the world, we have to use the best interfaces we got.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:52.480
And I'm not exactly sure that game theory is the best interface we got for this.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.280
And applications of mathematics, tricks and tools of mathematics to game theory is the

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:05.360
best we got when we're thinking about the nature of reality and fitness functions and

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.560
evolution, period.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.000
Well, that's a fair rejoinder.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And I think that that was the tool that we used.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.840
And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool, and here's why.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.400
This is this mathematical tool better captures the essence of Darwin's idea.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.160
John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it with evolutionary game theory.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.440
There's this better, this thing.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.240
Now, there are tools like evolutionary graph theory, which generalize evolutionary game

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:32.880
theory.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.520
And then there's quantum game theory.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:43.760
So you can use quantum tools like entanglement, for example, as a resource in games,

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.640
that change the very nature of the solutions, the optimal solutions of the game theory.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.320
Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:00.640
It's a really interesting challenge of these ideas where, okay, if you have a very large

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:07.440
number of fitness functions, or let's say you have a nearly infinite number of fitness functions,

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:13.680
or a growing number of fitness functions, what kind of interesting things start to emerging?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.760
If you are to be an organism, if to be an organism that adapts means having to deal with

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.080
an ensemble of fitness functions.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.920
Right.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.960
And so we've actually redone some of our own work based on theirs.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.240
And this is the back and forth that we expect in science, right?

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.520
And what we found was that in their simulations, they were assuming that you

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.760
couldn't carve the world up into objects.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.920
And so we said, well, let's relax that assumption.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.960
Allow organisms to create data structures that we might call objects.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.520
And an object would be you take, you would do hierarchical clustering

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.720
of your fitness payoff functions, the ones that have similar shapes.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.440
If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50 are all very, very similar.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:05.600
So I can take all the perception action fitness stuff and make that into a data structure,

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.600
and we'll call that a unit or an object.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.440
And as soon as we did that, then all of their results went away.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.640
It turned out they were the special case and that the organisms that were allowed

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.240
to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs were the ones that were.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.120
So the idea is that objects then, what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.360
This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle, it was because I was seeing a true

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.200
object that existed whether or not it was perceived.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.920
Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:44.960
I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding a convenient way of looking at various fitness

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.640
payoffs. I can use this for drinking. I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.080
I could beat someone with head with it. If my goal is mating, this is pointless.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:04.080
So I'm seeing for what I'm coding here is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.560
When I pick up an apple, now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs for.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.520
When I pick up a rock, I'm getting, so for every object, what I'm getting is a different set

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:23.440
of payoff functions with various actions. And so once you allow that, then what you find is once

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.720
again that truth goes extinct and the organisms that just get an interface are the ones that that

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:36.800
win. But the question I'm just sneaking up on, this is fascinating, from where do fitness functions

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:43.440
originate? What gives birth to the fitness functions? So if there's a giant black box that

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.960
just keeps giving you fitness functions, what are we trying to optimize? You said that water

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:58.560
has different uses than an apple. So there's these objects. What are we trying to optimize?

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.520
And why is not reality a really good generator of fitness functions?

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.760
So each theory makes its own assumptions and says, grant me this and I'll explain that. So

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:16.320
evolutionary game theory says grant me fitness payoffs, right? And grant me strategies with payoffs

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.960
and I can write down the matrix for this strategy interacts with that strategy. These are the payoffs

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.960
that come up. If you grant me that, then I can start to explain a lot of things. Now you can ask

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:33.440
for a deeper question like, okay, how does physics evolve biology and where do these fitness payoffs

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:42.240
come from? Now that's a completely different enterprise and of course evolutionary game

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.560
theory then would be not the right tool for that. It would have to be a deeper tool that

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:54.800
shows where evolutionary game theory comes from. My own take is that there's going to be a

01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:04.640
problem in doing that because space time isn't fundamental. It's just a user interface and

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.840
that the distinction that we make between living and non-living is not a fundamental distinction.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:17.120
It's an artifact of the limits of our interface. So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:23.600
wrinkle. It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental because if something looks like it's

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:30.080
inanimate, it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living. Now it's much more complicated.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.480
Certain things are obviously living. I'm talking with you. I'm obviously interacting with something

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.920
that's alive and conscious. I think we've let go of the word obviously in this conversation.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.720
I think nothing is obvious. Nothing's obvious, that's right. But when we get down to like

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:54.400
an ant, it's obviously living but I'll say it appears to be living. When we get down to a virus,

01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:00.160
now people wonder and when we get down to protons, people say it's not living and my attitude is,

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.680
look, I have a user interface. The interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.040
and others to... It's an uneven representation, put it that way. Certain things just get

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:19.760
completely hidden. Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy and matter that's out there.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:25.520
Our interface just flat out hides them. The only way we get some hint is because

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.920
gravitational things are going wrong within our... So most things are outside of our interface.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.640
The distinction between living and non-living is not fundamental. It's an artifact of our

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:45.360
interface. So if we really want to understand where evolution comes from to answer the question,

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.040
the deep question you asked, I think the right way we're going to have to do that is to come up

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:57.680
with a deeper theory than spacetime in which there may not be the notion of time and show that

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:03.360
whatever this dynamics of that deeper theory is. By the way, I'll talk about how you could have

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.320
dynamics without time, but the dynamics of this deeper theory, when we project it into,

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.160
in certain ways, then we do get spacetime and we get what appears to be evolution by natural

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.720
selection. So I would love to see evolution by natural selection. Nature, red and tooth and

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.880
claw, people fighting and animals fighting for resources and the whole bit, come out of a deeper

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.840
theory in which perhaps it's all cooperation. There's no limited resources and so forth,

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.840
but as a result of projection, you get space and time, and as a result of projection, you get

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:39.040
nature, red and tooth and claw, the appearance of it, but it's all an artifact of the interface.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.720
I like this idea that the line between living and non-living is very important

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.080
because that's the thing that would emerge before you have evolution, the idea of death.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:16:00.960
So that seems to be an important component of natural selection, and if that emerged,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.040
because that's also asking the question, I guess, that I ask, where do fitness

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.920
functions come from? That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right? It's what's the

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:22.560
why, why, why? And one of the big underlying whys, okay, you can start with evolution on earth,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.000
but without living, without life and death, without the line between the living and the dead,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.440
you don't have evolution. So what if underneath it, there's no such thing as the living and the dead?

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.000
There's no, like this concept of an organism period. There's a living organism that's defined

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:51.840
by a volume and space time that somehow interacts, that over time maintains its integrity somehow,

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.320
it has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind, the outside world, the environment,

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:04.160
and then inside there's an organism. So you're defining an organism, and also you're defining

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:11.280
that organism by the fact that it can move, and it can become alive, which you kind of think of as

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.320
moving, combined with the fact that it's keeping itself separate from the environment. So you can

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:22.720
point out that thing is living, and then it can also die. That seems to be of all very

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:30.000
powerful components of space time that enable you to have something like natural selection and

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.600
evolution. Well, and there's a lot of interesting work, some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:42.960
and others where they have Bayes net kind of stuff that they build on and the notion of a

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.560
Markov blanket. So you have some states within this network that are inside the blanket, then you

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.880
have the blanket, and then the states outside the blanket, and the states inside this Markov blanket

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.800
are conditionally independent of the states outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:04.400
And what they're looking at is that the dynamics inside of the states inside the Markov blanket

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.360
seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside and react to them in a way. So it seems

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.240
like you're doing probabilistic inferences in ways that might be able to keep you alive. So

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:20.800
there's interesting work going on in that direction. But what I'm saying is something

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.480
slightly different. And that is, like when I look at you, all I see is skin heronize, right? That's

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.240
all I see. But I know that there's a deeper reality. I believe that there's a much deeper

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.840
reality. There's the whole world of your experiences, your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:42.720
In some sense, the face that I see is just a symbol that I create, right? And as soon as I

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.480
look away, I delete that symbol. But I don't delete you. I don't delete the conscious experience,

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:54.880
the whole world of your... So I'm only deleting an interface symbol. But that interface symbol

01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:05.520
is a portal, so to speak. Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal into your beliefs, into your

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.800
conscious experiences, into... That's why we can have a conversation. Your consciousness is

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.800
genuinely affecting mine. Mine is genuinely affecting yours. Through these icons, which I

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.120
create on the fly. I mean, I create your face when I look, I delete it. I don't create you,

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:28.000
your consciousness, that's there all the time. But I do... So now when I look at a cat, I'm creating

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.320
something that I still call living, and I still think is conscious. When I look at an ant, I create

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:39.920
something that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious. When I look at something I call a

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.200
virus, now I'm not even sure I would call it living. And when I look at a proton, I would say,

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:52.000
I don't even think it's not alive at all. It could be that I'm nevertheless

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.640
interacting with something that's just as conscious as you. I'm not saying the proton is

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.360
conscious. The face that I'm creating when I look at you, that face is not conscious. That face

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:07.280
is a data structure in me. That face isn't... It's an experience. It's not an experiencer.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:14.960
Similarly, a proton is something that I create when I look or do a collision

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:21.360
in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that. But what is behind the entity and space time?

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.520
So I've got this space-time interface, and I just got this entity that I call a proton.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.720
What is the reality behind it? Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures,

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:36.880
ample two Hadron, the associate Hadron. What's behind those? Could be consciousness,

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.640
what I'm playing with. In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.680
I could be interacting with consciousness. Again, to be very, very clear, because it's

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.320
easy to... Listen, I'm not saying a proton is conscious. Just like I'm not saying your face

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:56.880
is conscious. Your face is a symbol I create and then delete as I look. And so your face is not

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.760
conscious, but I know that that face in my interface, the Lex Friedman face that I create,

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:08.800
is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal into your consciousness. The portal is less clear

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.320
for a cat, even less clear for an ant. And by the time we get down to a proton, the portal is not

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.240
clear at all. But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness. It just means

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:24.960
my interface gave up. And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after. So your question

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.400
really forces out a big part of this whole approach that I'm talking about.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:35.600
So this portal and consciousness, I wonder why you can't... Your portal is not as good to a cat,

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.360
to a cat's consciousness than it is to a human. Does it have to be...

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:48.320
It has to do with the fact that you're human and just similar organisms, organisms of similar

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.160
complexity, are able to create portals better to each other? Or is it just...

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.800
As you get more and more complex, you get better and better portals?

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.800
Well, let me answer one aspect that I'm more confident about. Then I'll speculate on that.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:10.000
Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons and elementary particles more generally? So quarks,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.440
leptons, and gluons, and so forth? Well, the reason for that is because those are just

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.120
symmetries of spacetime. More technically, they're irreducible representations of the

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:31.440
Poincaré group of spacetime. So they're just literally representations of the data structure

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.200
of spacetime that we're using. So that's why they're not very much insightful. They're just almost

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.400
entirely tied to the data structure itself. There's not much... They're telling you only

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.920
something about the data structure, not behind the data structure. It's only when we get to higher

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:51.520
levels that we're starting to, in some sense, build portals to what's behind spacetime.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:23:01.280
Sure. Yeah. So there's more and more complexity built on top of the interface of spacetime with the

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:11.280
cat. So you can actually build a portal, right? Yeah, right. Yeah, this interface of face and hair

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:22.560
and so on, skin. There's some sinking going on between humans, though, where we sink. You're

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:31.120
getting a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head and starting to get a foggy view of my

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:37.840
memories in my head. Even though this is the first time we're talking, you start to project your own

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:45.840
memories. You start to solve a giant hierarchy of puzzles about a human, because we're all... There's

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:50.160
a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes. So you start to make a lot of inferences and you build

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:56.080
up this model of a person. You have a pretty sophisticated model of what's going on underneath.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.960
Again, I just... I wonder if it's possible to construct these models about each other and

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:10.080
nevertheless be very distant from an underlying reality. There's a lot of work on this. So there's

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:15.520
some interesting work called Signaling Games, where they look at how people can coordinate and

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.480
come to communicate. There's some interesting work that was done by some colleagues and friends of

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:30.000
mine, Louis Naranze and Natalia Komarova and Kimberly Jamison, where they were looking at

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:40.000
evolving color words. So you have a circle of colors, the color circle, and they wanted to see

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.640
if they could get people to cooperate and how they carved the color circle up into units of words.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.680
So they had a game, theoretic kind of thing that they'd had people do. What they found was that

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.720
so most people are trichromats. You have three kinds of cone photoreceptors, but there are some

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.600
a lot of men, 7% of men have our dichromats. They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:11.680
They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence on the final ways that the whole

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.840
space of colors was carved up and labels attached. You needed to be able to include the dichromats

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.760
in the conversation. So they had a bigger influence on how you made the boundaries

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.400
of the language. I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight that there's going

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.560
to be, again, a game, perhaps a game or evolutionary or genetic algorithm kind of thing that goes on

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:40.320
in terms of learning to communicate in ways that are useful. So yeah, you can use game theory to

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.360
actually explore that or signaling games. There's a lot of brilliant work on that. I'm not doing it,

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:52.080
but there's work out there. So if it's okay, let us tackle once more and perhaps several more

01:25:52.080 --> 01:26:00.240
times after the big topic of consciousness. This very beautiful, powerful things that perhaps is

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:06.880
the thing that makes us human. What is it? What's the role of consciousness in, let's say even just

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.920
the thing we've been talking about, which is the formation of this interface,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.400
any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking about it?

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:25.680
Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say. 99% are, again, assuming that

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:32.320
spacetime is fundamental. Particles in spacetime matter is fundamental. And most are reductionist.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:42.960
And so the standard approach to consciousness is to figure out what complicated systems of matter

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.480
with the right functional properties could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:56.880
That's the general idea. So maybe you have to have neurons. Maybe only if you have neurons,

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.040
but that might not be enough. They have certain kinds of complexity in their

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.640
organization and their dynamics, certain kind of network abilities, for example.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:14.560
So there are those who say, for example, that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:22.400
of quantum states of microtubules and neurons. So this is Hamroff and Kenrose have this kind of.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:28.240
So you start with something physical, a property of quantum states of neurons,

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.040
of microtubules and neurons. And you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.560
is consciousness or conscious experiences. Or integrated information theory. Again,

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.720
you start with something physical. And if it has the right kind of functional properties,

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.000
it's something they call fee, with the right kind of integrated information,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.800
then you have consciousness. Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.560
where you might say, well, in addition to the particles in space and time,

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.280
those particles are not just matter, they also could have a unit of consciousness.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.480
And so, but once again, you're taking space and time and particles as fundamental.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.160
And you're adding a new property to them, say consciousness. And then you have to talk about

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.760
how when a proton and a neutron or proton and electron get together to form hydrogen,

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:28.400
then how those consciousnesses merge to or interact to create the consciousness of hydrogen,

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:33.520
so forth. There's attention schema theory, which again, this is how neural network

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:40.880
processes representing to the network itself, it's attentional processes, that could be

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:47.600
consciousness. There's global workspace theory. And neuronal global workspace theory.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.840
Workspace theory. So there's many, many theories of this type. What's common to all of them

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.160
is they assume that space time is fundamental. They assume that physical processes in space

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:02.480
time is fundamental. Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:10.320
it's almost dualist in that regard. And my attitude is, our best science is telling us

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:18.320
that space time is not fundamental. So why is that important here? Well, for centuries,

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.080
deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water as the fundamental elements.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.800
It was a reductionist kind of idea. Nothing was more elemental than those. And you could

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.840
sort of build everything up from those. When we got the periodic table of elements,

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.040
we realized that, of course, we want to study earth, air, fire, and water. There's combustion

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:50.960
science for fire. There's sciences for all these other things, water and so forth. So we're going

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:56.080
to do science for these things, but fundamental, no, no. If you're looking for something fundamental,

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.360
those are the wrong building blocks. Earth has many, many different kinds of elements

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.080
that project into the one thing that we call earth. If you don't understand that there's

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.520
silicon, that there's iron, that there's all these different kinds of things that project

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:16.240
into what we call earth, you're hopelessly lost. You're not fundamental. You're not going to get

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:22.160
there. And then after the periodic table, then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:29.760
the particles of the standard model of physics. And so we actually now know that if you really

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:35.920
want to get fundamental, the periodic table isn't it. It's good for chemistry and it's just

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:40.720
wonderful for chemistry. But if you're trying to go deep, fundamental, what is the fundamental

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.000
science? That's not it. You're going to have to go to quarks, leptons, and gluons, and so forth.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:53.360
Well, now we've discovered spacetime itself is doomed. Quarks, leptons, and gluons are just

01:30:53.360 --> 01:31:00.640
irreducible representations of the symmetries of spacetime. So the whole framework on which

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:07.840
consciousness research is being based right now is doomed. And for me, these are my friends and

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:14.800
colleagues that are doing this, they're brilliant. They're absolute, they're brilliant. I, my feeling

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:23.920
is, I'm so sad that they're stuck with this old framework, because if they weren't stuck,

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.920
like with earth, air, fire, and water, you could actually make progress. So it doesn't matter how

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:31.920
smart you are. If you start with earth, air, fire, and water, you're not going to get anywhere, right?

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.440
Can I actually just, because the word doomed is so interesting. Let me give you some options,

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:46.160
multiple choice quiz. It's spacetime, we could say is reality, the way we perceive it, doomed,

01:31:49.840 --> 01:32:01.520
wrong, or fake. Because doomed just means it could still be right, and we're now ready to go deeper.

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.280
It would be that.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:09.920
So it's not wrong. It's not a complete deviation from a journey toward the truth.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:15.600
Right. It's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong. There is earth, air, fire, and water.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.920
That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.320
Right. Well, there's also wrong, which is, they used to believe, as I recently learned,

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:28.640
that George Washington was the president, the first president in the United States,

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:33.040
was blood to death for something that could have been easily treated,

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.000
because it was believed that you can get, actually, I need to look into this further,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.160
but I guess you get toxins out or demons out. I don't know what you're getting out with the

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:50.080
bleeding of a person, but so that ended up being wrong, but widely believed as a medical tool.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:58.080
So it's also possible that our assumption of spacetime is not just doomed, but it's wrong.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:04.320
Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong. But if we believe it's a useful tool,

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.840
that's right. But bleeding somebody to death was believed to be a useful tool.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:18.400
It wasn't just not fundamental. I'm sure there's cases in which bleeding somebody

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:25.280
would work, but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases. So it could be that it's

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:31.600
wrong, like it's a side road that's ultimately leading to a dead end, as opposed to a truck

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:37.280
stop or something that you can get off of. My feeling is it's not the dead end kind of thing.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.040
I think that what the physicists are finding is that there are these structures beyond

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:47.120
spacetime, but they project back into spacetime. And so spacetime, when they say

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:50.640
spacetime is doomed, they're explicit. They're saying it's doomed in the sense that

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.400
we thought it was fundamental. It's not fundamental. It's a useful,

01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.400
absolutely useful and brilliant data structure, but there are deeper data structures like cosmological

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:06.720
polytool. And spacetime is not fundamental. What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:12.880
is reductionism. Which is saying spacetime is fundamental.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.560
Essentially. Right, right. The idea that somehow

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.800
being smaller in spacetime is a fundamental nature of reality, that's just wrong. It turned out to

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.200
be a useful heuristic for thermodynamics and so forth, and several other places,

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:37.760
reductionism has been very useful. But that's in some sense an artifact of how we use our interface.

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.680
Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter. Okay, this is very important for me to write

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:50.960
down ultimately. It's useful for theories like thermodynamics and also for understanding brain

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.400
networks in terms of individual neurons and neurons in terms of chemical systems inside cells.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.840
That's all very, very useful. But the idea that we're getting to the more fundamental nature of

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:09.120
reality, no. When you get all the way down in that direction, you get down to the quarks and

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.760
gluons. What you realize is what you've gotten down to is not fundamental reality, just the

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.720
irreducible representations of a data structure. That's all you've gotten down to. So you're always

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:24.400
stuck inside the data structure. So you seem to be getting closer and closer. I went from neural

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.560
networks to neurons, to neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles, particles to clerks and

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:35.760
gluons. No, I'm getting closer and closer to the actual structure of the data structure of

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.760
space and time, the irreducible representations. That's what you're getting closer to,

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.040
not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space-time.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:49.040
We'll also refer, we'll return again to this question of dynamics, because you keep

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.800
saying that space-time is doomed, but mostly focusing on the space part of that. It's very

01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:01.040
interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too, because how do you have dynamics without time is

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:08.720
the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about. But let us return your brilliant whirlwind

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:12.160
overview of the different theories of consciousness that are out there.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.240
What is consciousness if outside of space-time? If we think that we want to have a model of

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.000
consciousness, we as scientists then have to say, what do we want to write down? What kind of

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
mathematical model are we going to write down? And if you think about it, there's lots of things

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.840
that you might want to write down about consciousness. It's a really complicated subject.

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:38.560
So most of my colleagues are saying, let's start with matter or neurons and

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.440
say what properties of matter could create consciousness. But I'm saying that that whole

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.200
thing is out. Space-time is doomed, that whole thing is out. We need to look at consciousness,

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.320
qua consciousness. In other words, not as something that arises in space and time,

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.880
but perhaps as something that creates space and time as a data structure.

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.880
So what do we want? And here again, there's no hard and fast rule, but what you as a

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:10.240
scientist have to do is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions that are going to

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:18.560
allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory. That is the trick. So what do I want? So what I

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:24.880
chose to do was to have three things. I said that there are conscious experiences,

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:33.920
feeling of headache, the smell of garlic, experiencing the color red. So that's a

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:38.000
primitive of theory. And the reason I want few primitives, because those are the miracles of

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.440
the theory, right? The primitives, the assumptions of the theory are the things you're not going

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.080
to explain. Those are the things you assume. And those experiences you particularly mean

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.480
there is a subjectiveness to them. That's the thing when people refer to the hard problem

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:58.080
of consciousness is it feels like something to look at the color red. Okay.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.800
Exactly. It feels like something to have a headache or to feel upset to your stomach.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:10.560
It feels like something. And so I'm going to grant that in this theory, there are experiences

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:15.040
and they're fundamental in some sense. So conscious experience. So they're not derived

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:21.600
from physics. They're not functional properties of particles. They are sui generis. They exist.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.240
Just like we assume space time exists. I'm now saying space time is just a data structure. It

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.520
doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences. Sorry to interrupt once again, but should we be

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:41.280
focusing in your thinking on humans alone? Or is there something about in relation to other kinds

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:47.760
of organisms that have a sufficiently high level of complexity? Or is there some kind of

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.720
generalization of the panpsychist idea that all consciousness permeates all matter

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:01.120
outside of the usual definition of what matter is inside space time?

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:07.120
So it's beyond human consciousness. Human consciousness, from my point of view, would be

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:12.400
one of a countless variety of consciousnesses. And even within human consciousness, there's

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.200
countless variety of consciousnesses within us. You have your left and right hemisphere.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.880
And apparently, if you split the corpus callosum, the personality of the left hemisphere and the

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.760
religious belief of the left hemisphere can be very different from the right hemisphere.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:32.400
And their conscious experiences can be disjoint. One could have one conscious experience.

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.000
They can play 20 questions. The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind and the right

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.160
hemisphere has to guess. And it might not get it. So even within you, there is more than just

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:47.920
one consciousness. It's lots of consciousnesses. So the general theory of consciousness that I'm

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.120
after is not just human consciousness. It's going to be just consciousness. And I presume human

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:59.200
consciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:08.000
That said, I should clarify that the black hole of consciousness is the home cat. I'm pretty sure

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.760
cat's lack is the embodiment of evil and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.560
So I just want to lay that out. But that's the theory I'm working on. I don't have any

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:25.520
good evidence, but it's just a shout out. Sorry to distract. So that's the first assumption.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.000
The first assumption is right. The second assumption is that these experiences have

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.640
consequences. So I'm going to say that conscious experiences can trigger other conscious experiences

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:45.040
somehow. So really, in some sense, there's two basic assumptions. There's some kind of

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.360
causality. Is there is a chain of causality? Does it relate to dynamics?

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.680
I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship. So I'm trying to be

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.720
as nonspecific to begin with and see where it leads me. So what I can write down are probability

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:09.040
spaces. So probability space, which contains the conscious experiences that this consciousness

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:18.400
can have. So I call this a conscious agent. This technical thing. Anika Harris and I've

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.600
talked about this and she rightly cautions me that people will think that I'm bringing in a

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.240
notion of a self or agency and so forth when I say conscious agent. So I just want to say that I

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:35.040
use the term conscious agent merely as a technical term. There is no notion of self in my fundamental

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.640
definition of a conscious agent. There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.200
that of how they trigger other experiences. So the agent is the generator of the conscious

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:51.120
experience. The agent is a mathematical structure that includes a probability measure,

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:57.520
the probability space of possible conscious experiences and what an Amarcovian kernel,

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.720
which describes how if this agent has certain conscious experiences,

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:07.360
how that will affect the experiences of other conscious agents, including itself.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.960
But you don't think of that as a self? No, there is no notion of a self here.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:21.120
There's no notion of really of an agent. But is there a locality? Is there an organism?

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:29.040
So these are conscious units, conscious entities. But they're distinct

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.920
in some way because they have to interact. Well, so here's the interesting thing. When we write

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:40.800
down the mathematics, when you have two of these conscious agents interacting, the pair

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.280
satisfy a definition of a conscious agent. So they are a single conscious agent.

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.880
So there is one conscious agent. But it has a nice analytic decomposition into as many

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:59.120
conscious agents. So that's a nice interface. It's a very useful scientific interface. It's

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:05.200
a scale free or if you like a fractal like approach to it in which we can use the same

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:11.520
unit of analysis at all scales in studying consciousness. But if I want to talk about

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:19.920
so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence, self, agency.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:28.480
So none of that is fundamental. So and the reason I did that was because I want to assume

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.880
as little as possible. Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory. It's not something you

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.120
explain as something you assume. So I have to build networks of conscious agents.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.120
If I want to have a notion of a self, I have to build a self. I have to build learning, memory,

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.200
problem solving, intelligence, and planning, all these different things. I have to build

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.320
networks of conscious agents to do that. It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.720
are computationally universal. That's trivial. So anything that we can do with neural networks

01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.960
or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents. That's trivial.

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:09.520
But you can also do more. The events in the probability space need not be computable. So

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:15.920
the Markovian dynamics is not restricted to computable functions because the very events

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:21.680
themselves need not be computable. So this can capture any computable theory. Anything we can

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.280
do with neural networks, we can do with conscious agent networks. But it leaves open the door for

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:33.760
the possibility of non computable interactions between conscious agents. So we have to, if we

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.600
want a theory of memory, we have to build it. And there's lots of different ways you could build.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:44.160
We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead on this. And he, we have a paper called

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.320
conscious agent networks where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use these networks of

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.560
conscious agents to build memory and to build primitive kinds of learning.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:45:01.520
But can you provide some intuition of what conscious networks, networks of conscious agents

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:08.880
helps you? Well, first of all, what that looks like. And I don't just mean mathematically,

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.600
of course, maybe that might help build up intuition, but how that helps us potentially

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:21.200
solve the hard problem of consciousness. Right. Or is that baked in that that exists?

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.600
Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness? Why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:36.000
ice cream with networks of conscious agents? Or is that taken as an assumption?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:44.480
So the standard way the hard problem is thought of is we're assuming space and time in particles

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.240
or neurons, for example. These are just physical things that have no consciousness. And we have

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.960
to explain how the conscious experience of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those. So

01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:00.880
that's the typical hard problem of consciousness is that problem, right? How do you boot up the taste

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:07.440
of chocolate, the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say, or the right kind

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:13.440
of artificial intelligence circuitry? How do you boot that up? That's typically what the hard

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:19.040
problem of consciousness means to researchers. Notice that I'm changing the problem. I'm not

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:24.240
trying to boot up conscious experiences from the dynamics of neurons or silicon or something like

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.840
that. I'm saying that that's the wrong problem. My hard problem would go in the other direction.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:35.520
If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time?

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.280
How do I build up what I call the physical world? How do I build up what we call brains?

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.560
Because I'm saying consciousness is not something that brains do.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:53.280
Brains are something that consciousness makes up. It's an ephemeral experience

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.480
in consciousness. I look inside, so to be very, very clear, right now I have no neurons.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:05.200
If you looked, you would see neurons. That's a data structure that you would create on the fly,

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.920
and it's a very useful one. As soon as you look away, you garbage collect that data structure,

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:12.880
just like that Necker cube that I was talking about on the piece of paper.

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:19.520
When you look, you see a 3D cube. You create it on the fly. As soon as you look away, that's gone.

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.320
When you say you, you mean a human being scientist?

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.320
Right now, that's right. More generally, it'll be conscious agents, because as you pointed out,

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.320
asking for theory of consciousness only about humans, no, it's consciousness, which human

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:41.840
consciousness is just a tiny sliver. But you are saying that there's a useful data structure.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.480
How many other data structures are there? That's why I said you human. If there's another earth,

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.520
if there's another alien civilization and doing these kinds of investigations,

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.800
would they come up with similar data structures? Probably not.

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:57.600
What is the space of data structures, I guess, is what I'm asking.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:05.040
My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental, consciousness is all there is,

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.800
then the only thing that mathematical structure can be about is possibilities of consciousness.

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.920
And that suggests to me that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses,

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:27.600
and a vanishingly small fraction of them use spacetime data structures,

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.840
and the kinds of structures that we use. There's an infinite variety of data structures.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.920
Now, this is very similar to something that Max Tegmark has said, but I want to distinguish it.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.080
He has his level four multiverse idea. He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.480
And so that's the fundamental reality. And since there's an infinite variety of,

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:50.960
endless variety of mathematical structures, there's an infinite variety of multiverses

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:57.040
in his view. I'm saying something similar in spirit, but importantly different. There's

01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.240
an infinite variety of mathematical structures, absolutely. But mathematics isn't the fundamental

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:08.480
reality in this framework. Consciousness is, and mathematics is to consciousness,

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.280
like bones are to an organism. You need the bones. So mathematics is not divorced from

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:21.040
consciousness, but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means. And so there's an

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:29.200
infinite variety of consciousnesses and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.480
And therefore worlds, common worlds, data structures that they can use to communicate.

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:43.600
So spacetime is just one of an infinite variety. And so I think that what we'll find is that as

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:52.080
we go outside of our little spacetime bubble, we will encounter utterly alien forms of conscious

01:49:52.080 --> 01:50:01.360
experience that we may not be able to really comprehend in the following sense. If I ask

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:09.200
you to imagine a color that you've never seen before. Does anything happen? Nothing happens.

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.080
No. Nothing happens. And that's just one color. I'm asking for just a color. We actually know,

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:23.200
by the way, that apparently there are women called tetrafemes who have four color receptors,

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.920
not just three. And Kimberly Jamison and others who've studied these women have good evidence

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:36.080
that they apparently have a new dimension of color experience that the rest of us don't have.

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:41.920
So these women are apparently living in a world of color that you and I can't even

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:47.600
concretely imagine. No man can imagine them. And yet they're real color experiences. And so

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.720
in that sense, I'm saying now take that little baby step. Oh, there are women who have color

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.080
experiences that I could never have. Well, that's shocking. Now take that infinite. There are

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:03.920
consciousnesses where every aspect of their experiences is like that new color. It's something

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:09.920
utterly alien to you. You have nothing like that. And yet these are all possible varieties

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:15.440
of conscious experience. When you say there's a lot of consciousnesses as a singular consciousness,

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.880
basically the set of possible experiences you can have in that subjective way,

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:28.960
as opposed to the underlying mechanism. Because you say that, you know, having an

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:34.880
extra color receptor, you know, ability to have new experiences that somehow

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:39.520
a different consciousness, is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:46.000
the subjectivity itself? Right. Because when we have two of these conscious agents interacting,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.920
the mathematics, they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent. So in fact,

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:55.600
they are a single conscious agent. So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying, I'm

01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.080
postulating with my colleagues, Chaitanya and Chris and others, Robert Prettner and so forth.

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:07.760
There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated. But fortunately, we can, for analytic

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:12.080
purposes, break it down all the way to, in some sense, the simplest conscious agent, which has

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:19.200
one conscious experience, one. This one agent can experience red 35. That's it. That's what

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:26.320
experiences. You can get all the way down to that. So you think it's possible that consciousness,

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:36.160
whatever that is, is much more, is fundamental, or at least much more in the direction of the

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:44.320
fundamental than is space time as we perceive it. That's the proposal. And therefore, what I have

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:51.040
to do in terms of the heart problem of consciousness is to show how dynamical systems of conscious

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:57.120
agents could lead to what we call space and time and neurons and brain activity. In other words,

01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:05.440
we have to show how you get space time and physical objects entirely from a theory of

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:12.320
conscious agents outside of space time with the dynamics outside of space time. So I can tell you

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:18.560
how we plan to do that. But that's the idea. Okay. The magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:25.280
So there's a mathematical kind of thing that we could say here, how it can emerge within the system

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.920
of networks of conscious agents. But

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:38.960
is there going to be at the end of the proof why chocolate is so delicious? Or no? I guess I'm

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.120
going to ask different kinds of dumb questions to try to sneak up.

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.920
Oh, well, that's the right question. And when I say that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:54.000
what that means is in the current version of my theory, I'm not explaining conscious experiences

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.560
where they came from. That's the miracle. That's one of the miracles. So I have two

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.600
miracles in my theory. There are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate,

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:08.560
and that there's a probabilistic relationship when certain conscious experiences occur,

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:13.440
others are more likely to occur. Those are the two miracles that are possible to

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:21.440
get beyond that and somehow start to chip away at the miracle-ness of that miracle.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.200
That chocolate is still delicious. I hope so. I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:33.040
now. But I can just say at top level how we would think about that. That would get at this

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:47.040
consciousness without form. This is really tough because it's consciousness without form versus

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.760
the various forms that consciousness takes for the experiences that it has.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:55:02.880
Right. So when I write down a probability space for these conscious experiences,

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.520
I say, here's a probability space for the possible conscious experiences.

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:11.280
It's just like when I write down a probability space for an experiment. I'm going to flip a coin

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.680
twice. I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes. So I have to write down a

01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.600
probability space. There could be heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.520
Any class in probability, you're told, write down your probability space. If you don't

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.440
write down your probability space, you can't get started. So here's my probability space for

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.480
consciousness. How do I want to interpret that structure? The structure is just sitting there.

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.520
There's going to be a dynamics that happens on it. Experiences appear and then they disappear.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:46.320
Just like heads appears and disappears. So one way to think about that fundamental

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.960
probability space is that corresponds to consciousness without any content.

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.080
The infinite consciousness that transcends any particular content.

01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:01.040
Well, do you think of that as a mechanism, as a thing,

01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.920
like the rules that govern the dynamics of the thing outside of space-time?

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:12.640
If you think consciousness is fundamental, isn't it essentially getting like,

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:19.760
if it is solving the hard problem, which is like, from where does this thing pop up?

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:26.240
Which is the mechanism of the thing popping up. Whatever the consciousness is, the different

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:34.640
kinds was so on. That mechanism. And also the question I want to ask is, how tricky do you think

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:41.120
it is to solve that problem? You've solved a lot of difficult problems throughout the history of

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:51.200
humanity. There's probably more problems to solve left than we've solved by an infinity.

01:56:52.800 --> 01:57:00.880
But along that long journey of intelligent species, when will we solve this consciousness one?

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.960
Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:09.760
So I'll give two answers. There's one problem I think we can solve, but we haven't solved yet.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.520
And that is the reverse of what my colleagues call the hard problem.

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.240
The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences in the way that I've just described

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:24.720
them and the dynamics, and build up space and time and brains. That I think is a tough technical

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.640
problem, but some principle solvable. So I think we can solve that. So we would solve the hard

01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.480
problem, not by showing our brains create consciousness, but how networks of conscious

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.760
agents create what we call the symbols that we call brains.

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:43.440
But does that allow you to... So that's interesting. That's an interesting idea.

01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:47.360
Consciousness creates the brain, not the brain creates consciousness. But does that allow you

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:55.200
to build the thing? My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies. And I'll tell

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.920
you why. I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing. So this theory of consciousness

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.480
will be even deeper than the structures that the physicists are finding, like the Amplitude

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:12.160
Hadron. But the other answer to your question is less positive. As I said earlier, I think that

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:20.320
there is no such thing as a theory of everything. So that I think that the theory that my team is

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:28.320
working on, this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory. We're using probability

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:32.960
spaces and Markovian kernels. I can easily see people now saying, well, we can do better if we

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:39.520
go to category theory. And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting. And then someone will

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:43.840
say, well, now I'll go to Topoi theory. And then there'll be... So I imagine that there'll be,

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:52.800
you know, conscious agents 5, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0. But I think it will never end. I think ultimately,

01:58:53.680 --> 01:59:01.680
this question that we sort of put our fingers on of, how does the formless give birth to form,

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:10.080
to the wonderful taste of chocolate? I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:15.760
but we will never solve that. That in some sense, that will be a primitive. I hope I'm wrong.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:24.960
Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination. So I'll just say my imagination

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:32.240
right now doesn't peer that deep. Hopefully... So by the way, I'm saying this, I don't want to

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:38.880
discourage some brilliant 20-year-old who then later on proves me dead wrong. I hope to be proven

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:42.720
dead wrong. But just like you said, essentially from now, everything we're saying now, everything

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:50.400
you're saying, all your theories will be laughing stock. They will respect the puzzle-solving

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:57.040
abilities and how much we were able to do with so little. But outside of that, it will all be just

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:02.880
the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager. Especially the silliness when we

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:08.400
thought that we were so smart and we knew it all. So it would be interesting to explore your ideas

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:16.720
by contrasting, you mentioned Annika Harris, you mentioned Philip Goff. So outside of,

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:22.480
if you're not allowed to say the fundamental disagreement is the fact that space-time is

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:29.120
fundamental, what are interesting distinctions between ideas of consciousness between you and

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:36.240
Annika, for example? You guys have been on a podcast together, I'm sure in private,

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:41.600
you guys have some incredible conversations. So where are some interesting sticking points,

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.520
some interesting disagreements, let's say with Annika first. Maybe there'll be a few other people.

02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:50.960
Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning where we were talking about

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:56.000
our ideas. And what we discovered really in our conversation was that we're pretty much on the

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.400
same page. It was really just- About consciousness. Yeah, our ideas about consciousness are pretty

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:09.520
much on the same page. She rightly has cautioned me to, when I talk about conscious agents,

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:16.480
to point out that the notion of agency is not fundamental in my theory. The notion of self

02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:21.360
is not fundamental. And that's absolutely true. I can use this network of conscious agents.

02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.440
As a technical term, conscious agent is a technical term for that probability space

02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.800
with the Markovian dynamics. I can use that to build models of a self and to build models of

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:42.000
agency, but they're not fundamental. So she has really been very helpful in helping me to be a

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.360
little bit clear about these ideas and not say things that are misleading. Sure. I mean,

02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:52.240
this is the interesting thing about language, actually, is that language, quite obviously,

02:01:52.240 --> 02:02:05.040
is an interface to truth. It's so fascinating that individual words can have so much ambiguity

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:12.880
and the slight, the specific choices of a word within a particular sentence, within the context

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:19.120
of a sentence can have so much such a difference in meaning. It's quite fascinating, especially when

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:24.480
you're talking about topics like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term. It means a lot

02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:30.080
of things to a lot of people. And the entire concept of shrouded in a mystery. So combination

02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:35.520
of the fact that it's a loaded term and that there's a lot of mystery, people can just interpret it

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:44.160
in all kinds of ways. And so you have to be both precise and help them avoid getting stuck on some

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.720
kind of side road of miscommunication, loss in translation, because you use the wrong word.

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:58.080
That's interesting. I mean, because for, for a lot of people, consciousness is ultimately connected

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:08.000
to a self. I mean, that's our experience of consciousness is very, it's connected to this

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.720
ego. I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be? I can't even, how do you begin to

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:20.960
comprehend, to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness that's not connected to like this

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:26.720
particular organism? Well, I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now that's,

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:33.280
that's, that comes out of this, this framework that's different. So we can imagine a dynamics of

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:40.560
consciousness, not in space and time, just abstractly. It could be cooperative, for all we know, it

02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:47.120
could be very friendly, I don't know. And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics that is

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:52.960
so-called stationary. And that's a technical term, which means that the entropy effectively is not

02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:57.040
increasing. There is some entropy, but it's constant. So there's no increasing entropy.

02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:05.360
And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless. There is no entropic time. But it's a trivial theorem,

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:13.760
three line proof, that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:18.000
of that dynamics by conditional probability, and if you want, I can state a little more,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.440
even more mathematically precisely for, for some readers or listeners. But if any projection you

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:30.160
take by conditional probability, the induced image of that Markov chain will have increasing entropy.

02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:39.760
You will have entropic time. So, so I'll be very, very precise. I have a Markov chain x1 x2

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:48.880
through xn, where xn, n goes to infinity, right? The entropy h, capital H of xn is equal to the

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:59.840
entropy h of xn minus one for all n. So the entropy is the same. But it's a, it's a theorem that h

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:09.200
of xn, say given x sub one is greater than or equal to h of xn minus one, given x1.

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:15.520
Sure. Where does the grader come from? Because with the theorem, the three line proof,

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:27.280
h of xn given x1 is greater than or equal to h of xn given x1 and x2, because conditioning reduces.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:37.040
But then h of xn minus one given x1 comma x2 is equal to h of xn

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:46.160
given x2, xn minus one given x2 by the Markov property. And then because it's stationary,

02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:55.360
it's equal to h of x. I have to write it down. xn minus, I have to write it down. Anyway,

02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:00.640
there's a three line proof. Sure. So, but the assumption of stationarity,

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.040
we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand, doesn't matter.

02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:13.440
So there's some kind of, some Markovian dynamics is basically trying to model some kind of system

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:17.600
with some probabilities and there's agents and they interact in some kind of way. And you could

02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:27.040
say something about that system as it evolves. Stationarity, so stationary system is one that

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:32.960
has certain properties in terms of entropy very well. But we don't know if it's stationary or not.

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.480
We don't know what the properties, right? You see, you have to kind of take assumptions and see,

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:43.520
okay, well, what is, what does the systems behave like under these different properties?

02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:48.240
The more constraints, the more assumptions you take, the more predictive, the more

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:51.040
interesting, powerful things you can say, but sometimes they're limiting.

02:06:52.160 --> 02:07:00.080
That said, we're talking about consciousness here. How does that, you said cooperative,

02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:07.680
okay, competitive. It just, I like chocolate. I'm sitting here. I have a brain. I'm wearing a suit.

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:15.680
It sure as hell feels like I'm a self. Right. Now, what am I tuning in? Am I plugging into

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:22.880
something? Am I a projection, a simple trivial projection into space time from some much larger

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:28.480
organism that I can't possibly comprehend? How the hell, you're saying some, you're building

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:35.040
up mathematical intuitions. Fine. Great. But I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here,

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:40.560
and I'm going to die soon. We'll all die pretty quickly. So I, I want to, I want to figure out

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:46.080
why chocolate is so delicious. So help me out here. So let's just keep sneaking up to this.

02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:54.880
Right. So the whole technical, technical thing was to say this, even if the dynamics of consciousness

02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:02.320
is stationary so that there is no entropic time, any projection of it, any view of it

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:12.000
will have the artifact of entropic time. That's a limited resource, limited resources.

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:18.400
So the fundamental dynamics may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever. Any projection

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:24.000
will have certainly time as a limited resource and probably lots of other limited resources.

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:31.600
Hence we could get competition and evolution and nature, red, and tooth, and claw as an artifact

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.720
of a deeper system in which those aren't fundamental. And, and in fact, I take it as

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:42.720
something that this theory must do at some point is to show how networks of conscious agents,

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:48.400
even if they're not resource limited, give rise to evolution of a natural selection via a projection.

02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:53.840
Yeah. But you're saying, I'm trying to understand how the limited resources that give rise

02:08:53.840 --> 02:09:00.640
to, so first the thing gives rise to time, it gives rise to limited resource, it gives rise to

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.280
evolution by natural selection, how that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious.

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:09.840
Well, it's not going to do that directly. It's going to get to this notion of self.

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:12.800
Oh, it's going to give you the notion of self.

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.800
Oh, the evolution gives you the notion of self.

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:21.600
And also of a self separate from other selves. So the idea would be that competition has life

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.200
and death, all those kinds of things.

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:28.960
That's right. So it won't, I don't think, as I said, I don't think that I can tell you how

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:33.520
the formless gives rise to the experience of chocolate. Right now, my current theory says

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:35.920
that's, that's one of the miracles I'm assuming. Yeah.

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:39.440
So my theory can't do it. And the reason my theory can't do it is because

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:44.960
Hoffman's brain can't do it right now. But, but the notion of self, yes,

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:53.520
the notion of self can be an artifact of the projection of it. So there's one conscious agent.

02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.320
Because anytime conscious agents interact, they form a new conscious agent. So there's one

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:05.280
conscious agent. Any projection of that one conscious agent gives rise to time, even if

02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.320
there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent. And it gives rise, I want to, I haven't

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:14.400
proven this. So this is, so now this is me guessing where the theory is going to go.

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:17.840
Not, I haven't done this. There's no paper on this yet. So now I'm speculating.

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.400
My guess is I'll be able to show, or the, or the, but my brighter colleagues working with me

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:26.960
will be able to show that, that we will get evolution of a natural selection, the notion

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:31.040
of individual selves, individual physical objects, and so forth coming out as a projection of this

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.400
thing. And, and, and that the self, this thing will be, be really interesting in terms of how

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:42.640
it starts to interact with certain spiritual traditions, right? Where they will say that

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:47.360
there is a notion of self that needs to be let go, which is this finite self that's competing

02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:53.840
with other selves to, you know, get more money and prestige and so forth. That self in some sense

02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.760
has to die. But there's a deeper self, which is the timeless

02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:07.040
being that preclude, that precedes, not precludes, but precedes any particular

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.480
conscious experiences, the ground of all experience, that there's that notion of a deep

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:20.000
capital self. But our little capital, lowercase s selves could be artifacts of projection.

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:27.920
And it may be that what consciousness is doing in this framework is, right? It's projected itself

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:35.520
down into a self that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex. And through conversations

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:42.320
like this, it's trying to find out about itself, and eventually transcend the limits of the Don

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:50.480
and Lex little icons that it's using, and that little projection of itself through this conversation

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:58.720
is somehow it's learning about itself. So that thing dressed me up today in order to understand

02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.200
itself. And in some sense, you and I are not separate from that thing, and we're not separate

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:09.040
from each other. Yeah. Well, I have to question the fashion choices on my end. All right. So

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.360
you mentioned you agree on in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Annika.

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:25.440
Is there somebody friend or friendly foe that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way,

02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:32.080
or some major way about consciousness about these topics of reality that you return to

02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:43.360
often? It's like Christopher Hitchens with Rabbi David Walby have had interesting conversations

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:49.040
through years that added to the complexity and the beauty of their friendship. Is there somebody

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:55.360
like that, that over the years has been a source of disagreement with you that strengthened your

02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:06.800
ideas? My ideas have been really shaped by several things. One is the physicalist framework that

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:13.680
my scientific colleagues almost to a person have adopted, and that I adopted too, until the reason

02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:21.040
I walked away from it was because it became clear that we couldn't start with unconscious

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:28.160
ingredients and boot up consciousness. Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?

02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:35.600
So a physicalist, I would say is someone who takes space time and the objects within space

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:42.640
time as ontologically fundamental. Right. And then reductionist is saying the smaller,

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.240
the more fundamental. That's a methodological thing. That's saying within space time as you go

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:53.040
to smaller and smaller scales in space, you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental

02:13:53.040 --> 02:14:01.200
laws. And the reduction of temperature to particle movement was an example of that,

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:07.120
but I think that the reason that worked was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:12.320
That was for a long time, and your colleagues, including yourself or physicalist, and now

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:17.040
you broke away. I broke away because I think you can't start with unconscious ingredients and boot

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:22.720
up consciousness. And so even with Roger Penrose, where there's like a gray area.

02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:30.080
Right. And here's the challenge I would put to all of my friends and colleagues who are,

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:38.960
give one specific conscious experience that you can boot up. So if you think that it's

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:44.400
integrated information, and this I've asked this of Julia to know me a couple times back in the

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:49.120
90s, and then just a couple of years ago, I asked Julia, okay, so great integrated information. So

02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:54.640
we're all interested in explaining some specific conscious experiences. So what, what is, you

02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:00.720
know, pick one, the taste of chocolate? What is the integrated information, precise structure

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.000
that we need for chocolate? And why does that structure have to be for chocolate? And why,

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.440
why is it that it could not possibly be vanilla? Is there any, last time, is there any one specific

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:17.360
conscious experience that you can account for? Because notice, they've set themselves the task

02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:22.320
of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems. That's the task they've set

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:27.440
themselves. But that doesn't mean they're, I understand your intuition, but that doesn't mean

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:32.080
they're wrong just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet. That's right. No, that doesn't

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:38.240
mean that they're wrong. It just, it just means that they haven't done it. I think it's principled.

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:44.160
The reason is principled, but, but I'm happy that they're exploring it. But the fact is, the

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:49.840
remarkable fact is there's not one theory. So integrated information theory, orchestrated

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:56.160
collapse of microtubules, global workspace theory. These are all theories of consciousness.

02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:01.840
These are all theories of consciousness. There's not a single theory that can give you a specific

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:06.560
conscious experience that they say, here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure

02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:11.120
that must be the taste of chocolate or whatever one they want. So you're saying it's impossible,

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:19.520
they're saying it's just hard. Yeah. My attitude is, okay, no one said you had to start with neurons

02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.640
or physical systems and boot up consciousness. You guys are just taking that. You chose that

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:27.520
problem. So since you chose that problem, how much progress have you made? Well,

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:32.080
when you've not been able to come up with a single specific conscious experience,

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:35.680
and you've had these brilliant people working on it for decades now,

02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:42.480
that's not really good progress. Let me ask you to be, to play devil's advocate. Can you try to

02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:50.480
steal man, steal man, meaning argue the best possible case for reality, the opposite of your

02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.920
book title. So, or maybe just stick into consciousness. Can you take the physicalist view?

02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:01.760
Can you steal man, the physicalist view for a brief moment, playing devil's advocate too?

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:05.760
Or steal man, the person you used to be. Right.

02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:10.960
She's a physicalist. What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now?

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:21.360
What would be a convincing argument for that? Well, I think the argument I would give and

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:27.360
that I believed was, look, when you have very simple physical systems, like a piece of dirt,

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.360
there's not much evidence of life for consciousness. It's only when you get really

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:36.320
complicated physical systems like that have brains and really the more complicated the brains,

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:41.280
the more it looks like there's consciousness and the more complicated that consciousness is.

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:47.280
Surely that means that simple physical systems don't create much consciousness,

02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:52.560
if maybe not any, or maybe panpsychists, they create the most elementary kinds of

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.400
simple conscious experiences. But you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,

02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:03.920
to create more complicated consciousnesses. I think that's the intuition that drives most of my

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:12.240
colleagues. And you're saying that this concept of complexity is ill-defined when you ground it to

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:17.360
space-time. Well, I think it's well-defined within the framework of space-time, right?

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:23.120
No, it's ill-defined relative to what you need to actually understand consciousness

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:26.160
because you're grounding complexity in just in space-time.

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:35.280
Oh, got you. Right. Yeah. What I'm saying is, if it were true that space-time was fundamental,

02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:41.040
then I would have to agree that if there is such a thing as consciousness, given the data that we've

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:47.760
got, that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't, that somehow it's the complexity of

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.040
the dynamics or organization, the function of the physical system that somehow is creating the

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:59.920
consciousness. So under those assumptions, yes. But when the physicists themselves are telling us

02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.880
that space-time is not fundamental, then I can understand. See, then the whole picture starts

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:11.920
to come into focus. Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right? These are really smart people.

02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:17.440
I mean, Francis Crick worked on this for the last 20 years of his life. These are not stupid

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:21.600
people. These are brilliant, brilliant people. The fact that we've come up with not a single

02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:26.640
specific conscious experience that we can explain and no hope. There's no one that says,

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:31.440
oh, I'm really close. I'll have it for you in a year. No, there's just like, there's this

02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:37.520
fundamental gap. So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says, look, he likes the

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:42.480
global workspace theory. But he says the last dollop of the theory in which there's something

02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:51.280
it's like to, he says we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact. Pinker is brilliant,

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:57.280
right? He understands the state of play on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,

02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:03.200
starting with physical assumptions and then trying to boot up consciousness. You've set

02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:09.120
yourself the problem. I'm starting with physical stuff that's not conscious. I'm trying to get

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.080
the taste of chocolate out as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.

02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:18.160
We've not been able to do that. And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.

02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:24.800
We may have to just stipulate that last bit. He calls it the last dollop. And just say,

02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:28.560
stipulate it as a bare fact of nature that there is something it's like. Well,

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:33.120
from my point of view as the physical, the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist was

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:37.280
we wouldn't have to stipulate. I was going to start with the physical stuff and explain where

02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:41.680
the consciousness came from. If I'm going to stipulate consciousness, why don't I just stipulate

02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:47.440
consciousness and not stipulate all the physical stuff too? So I'm stipulating less. I'm saying,

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:51.520
okay, I agree. The panpsychist perspective. Well, it's actually what I call the conscious

02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:56.880
realist perspective. Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right? They're saying there's physical

02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:00.960
stuff that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff. So I would go with Pinker

02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:05.120
and say, look, let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff, but I'm not going to stipulate the

02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.600
physical stuff. I'm going to actually now show how to boot up the physical stuff from just the

02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:15.120
consciousness stuff. So I'll stipulate less. Is it possible? So if you stipulate less,

02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:25.520
is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:30.880
Is it possible to visualize somehow with the tools of math, with the tools of computers,

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:37.280
with the tools of our mind? Are we hopelessly lost? You said there's ways to intuit

02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:49.920
what's true using mathematics and probability and sort of Markovian dynamics, all that kind

02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:56.480
of stuff, but that's not visualizing. That's what's the kind of building intuition, but is it possible

02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:03.680
to visualize in the way we visualize so nicely in space time, in four dimensions, in three dimensions?

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:08.000
Sorry. Well, we really are looking through a two-dimensional screen until

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:15.360
what we intuit to be a three-dimensional world and also inferring dynamic stuff,

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.120
making it 4D. Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures that give us

02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:28.880
a deeper sense of the truth of reality? I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.

02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:36.560
I think that, for example, the picture that we have of electrons and photons interacting

02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:45.280
and scattering, it may have not been possible until Faraday did all of his experiments and

02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:50.800
then Maxwell wrote down his equations, and we were then sort of forced by his equations to think

02:22:50.800 --> 02:23:01.120
in a new way. And then when Planck in 1900, desperate to try to solve the problem of black

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:05.920
body radiation, what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe, where Newton was predicting infinite

02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:13.920
energies, there weren't infinite energies in black body radiation. And he, in desperation, proposed

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:23.600
packets of energy. Then once you've done that, and then you have an Einstein come along five years

02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:31.600
later and show how that explains the photoelectric effect. And then eventually, in 1926, you get

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:36.800
quantum theory. And then you get this whole new way of thinking that was, from the Newtonian point

02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:46.240
of view, completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly. And maybe if

02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:50.480
Giesen is right, not contradictory. Maybe if you use intuition as math, they're not contradictory.

02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:57.040
But still, certainly you wouldn't have gone there. And so here's a case where the experiments

02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:05.520
and then a desperate mathematical move, sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog,

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:12.880
right? And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.

02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:20.000
I wonder if it's still possible to visualize in the, like we talk about consciousness in,

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.960
from a self perspective, experience it. Hold that idea in our mind, the way you can experience

02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:34.480
things directly. We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world. And that's a very rich

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:43.040
experience. When you're thinking mathematically, you still, in the end of the day, have to project

02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:50.720
it down to a low dimensional space to make, to make conclusions. Their conclusions will be a

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:59.920
number or a line or a plot or a visual. So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.760
in a subjective way, like experience it, really feel the beauty of it, you know,

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:11.680
in the way that humans feel beauty. Right. Are we screwed? I don't think we're screwed.

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:18.240
I think that we get little hints of it from psychedelic drugs and so forth. We get hints

02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:22.640
that there are certain interventions that we can take on our interface. I apply this chemical,

02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:30.320
which is just some element of my interface, to this other, to a brain. I ingest it. And all of

02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:37.520
a sudden, I seem like I've opened new portals into conscious experiences. Well, that's very,

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:42.400
very suggestive. That's like the black body radiation doing something that we didn't expect,

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:46.480
right? It doesn't go to infinity when we thought it was going to go to infinity and we're forced to

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.920
propose these quanta. So once we have a theory of conscious agents,

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.760
and it's projection to space, I should sketch what I think that projection is.

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:05.680
But then I think we can then start to ask specific questions. When you're taking DMT,

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:13.120
or you're taking LSD or something like that. Now that we have this deep model that we've

02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:17.360
reverse engineered space and time and physical particles, we've pulled them back to this theory

02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:24.240
of conscious agents. Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future, what are we doing to

02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:31.120
conscious agents when we apply 5MEO DMT? What are we doing? Are we opening a new portal?

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:37.440
So when I say that, I mean, I have a portal into consciousness that I call my body of

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:42.880
Lex Friedman that I'm creating. And it's a genuine portal, not perfect, but it's a genuine portal

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:46.800
I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness. And we know that we have

02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.280
one technology for building new portals. We know one technology and that is having kids.

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:59.920
Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness. It takes a long time.

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:07.040
Can you elaborate that? Oh, oh, oh, you mean like your son and your daughter didn't exist.

02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:11.840
That was a portal though. You're having contact with consciousness that you never would have had

02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:16.320
before. But now you've got a son or a daughter, you had, you went through this physical process,

02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:23.040
they were born, then you, there was all the training. But is that portal yours? So when you

02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:27.600
have kids, are you creating new portals that are completely distinct from the portals that you've

02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:32.720
created with other consciousness? Like, can you elaborate on that? To which degree are the

02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:41.440
consciousness of your kids a part of you? Well, so every person that I see, that symbol that I

02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:47.120
see, the body that I see is, is a portal potentially for me to interact with, with the

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:54.560
consciousness. Yeah. And, and each consciousness has a unique character that we call a personality

02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:02.560
and so forth. So with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:06.880
we've never seen before. And a version of consciousness that we've never seen before.

02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:12.000
At a deeper level, as I said, the theory says there's one agent. So this is a different projection

02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:20.880
of that one agent. But, but, so that's what I mean by a portal is within my own interface,

02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:31.200
my own projection, can I see other projections of that one consciousness? So can I get portals in,

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:37.040
in that sense? And I, so and I think, I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:42.000
theory of portals. And then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting, are they actually

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:48.400
creating new portals or not? If they're not, we should nevertheless, then understand how we could

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:52.960
create a new portal, right? Maybe we have to just study what happens when we make, when we have kids.

02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:59.360
We know that that technology creates new portals. So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:06.640
okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo with that?

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:11.280
With, with something like, like brain-computer interfaces, for example.

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:14.560
Yeah, maybe just a chemical or something. So probably more complicated than a chemical. That's

02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:19.520
why I think that the psychedelics, the psychedelics may, because they might be affecting this portal

02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:24.880
in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up. Whereas it may be, once we understand what

02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:28.960
this thing is a portal, your body as a portal, understand all of its complexities, maybe we'll

02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:34.240
realize that that portal can be shifted and to different parts of the deeper consciousness

02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:41.040
and give new windows on it. And so in that way, maybe, yes, psychedelics could open up new portals

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:44.320
in the sense that they're taking something that's already a complex portal and just

02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:50.000
tweaking it a bit. Well, but creating is a very powerful difference between morphing.

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:57.840
Tweaking versus creating, I agree. But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space

02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:01.840
of the kinds of things that this particular system is capable of. I mean, you, I mean,

02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:07.680
the idea, your idea of the consciousness creates brains. I mean, that breaks my brain because

02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:13.440
there's a, you know, I'm, I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense, because that you could,

02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:22.240
it's just much easier to intuit the world. It's very, it's practical to think there's a neural

02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:31.920
network and what are the different ways fascinating capabilities can emerge from this neural network?

02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:38.720
I agree. It's easier. And so you start to, and then present to yourself the problem of, okay,

02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:45.360
well, how does consciousness arise? How does intelligence arise? How does emotion arise?

02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:53.840
How does memory arise in the, how do we filter within the system all the incoming

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:59.040
sensory information we're able to allocate attention in different interesting ways? How do

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:04.800
all those mechanisms arise to say that there's other fundamental things we don't understand

02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:11.920
outside of space time that are actually core to how this whole thing works is a bit paralyzing

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:20.000
because it's like, oh, we're not, we're not 10% done. We're like 0.001% done.

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:25.760
Well, it's the immediate feeling. I certainly understand that. My attitude about it is,

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:32.000
if you look at the young physicists who are searching for these structures beyond space

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:39.760
time, like the episode of Eden and so forth, they're having a ball. Space time, that's what

02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:45.760
the old folks did. That's what our, the older generation did. We're doing something that

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:53.760
really is fun and new and they're having a blast and they're finding all these new structures.

02:31:53.760 --> 02:32:04.160
So I think that we're going to succeed in getting a new deeper theory. I can just say what I'm

02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:09.680
hoping with the theory that I'm working on, I'm hoping to show that I could have this timeless

02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:15.440
dynamics of consciousness, no entropic time. I take a projection and I show how this timeless

02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:22.400
dynamics looks like the Big Bang and the entire evolution of space time. In other words, I see

02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:29.120
how my whole space time interface. So not just the projection, it just doesn't just look like

02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:34.080
space time. You can explain with it the whole from the origin of the universe.

02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:37.840
That's what we have to do and that's what the physicists understand. When they go beyond

02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:42.480
space time to the amplitude and the cosmological polytope, they ultimately know that they have

02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:48.640
to get back the Big Bang story and the whole evolution, that whole story where there were no

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:55.520
living things. There was just a point and then the explosion and then just particles at high energy

02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:59.120
and then eventually the cooling down and the differentiation and finally

02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:05.040
matter, condenses and then life and then consciousness. That whole story has to come

02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:12.880
out of something that's deeper and without time and that's what we're up to. The whole story

02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:17.040
that we've been telling ourselves about Big Bang and how brains evolve in consciousness

02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:25.040
will come out of a much deeper theory. For someone like me, it's a lot. But for the

02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:31.360
younger generation, this is like, oh wow, all the low cherries aren't picked. This is really

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:38.160
good stuff. This is really new, fundamental stuff that we can do. I can't wait to read the papers

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:47.360
of the younger generation and I want to see them. Kids these days with their non-space time

02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:52.960
assumptions. It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition of the difficult ideas

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:58.720
you struggle with. If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant, what are some interesting

02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:04.000
agreements and disagreements you have with a guy about the nature of reality?

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:11.040
So there's a lot in agreement. So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist and

02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:20.880
he basically had the idea that we don't see nature as it is. We impose a structure on nature.

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:31.120
So in some sense, I'm saying something similar. I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself

02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:35.840
an idealist. I call myself a conscious realist because idealism has a long history, a lot of

02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:40.400
different ideas come under idealism and there's a lot of debates and so forth. It

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.960
tends to be identified with, in many cases, anti-science and anti-realism. And I don't

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:52.080
want either connection with my ideas. And so I just called my conscious realism with an emphasis

02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:59.680
on realism and not anti-realism. But one place where I would, of course, disagree with Kant was

02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:06.960
that he thought that Euclidean space time was a priori. We just know that that's false.

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:16.080
So he went too far on that. But in general, the idea that we don't start with space time,

02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.240
that space and time is, in some sense, the forms of our perceptions. Yes, absolutely.

02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:27.040
And I would say that there's a lot in common with Barclay in that regard.

02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:36.880
There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Barclay. Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly

02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:42.160
that the hard problem was not solvable. He posed a hard problem and basically dismissed it and

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:47.520
just said, you can't do this. And so if he came here and saw where we are, he said,

02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:52.000
look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago. And he had his monodology. He was trying

02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:58.320
to do something like this. It's different from what I'm doing. But he had these things that

02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:04.080
were not in space and time, these monads. He was trying to build something. I'm trying to build

02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:10.160
a theory of consciousness. My guess is that if he came here, I could just, if he saw what I was

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:16.480
doing, he would say, he would understand it and immediately take off with it and go places that

02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:23.440
I couldn't. He would have no problems. Right. There would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas.

02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:27.040
Absolutely. It would be totally overlapping. But his genus would then just run with it far

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:31.840
faster than I could. I love the humility here. So let me ask you about sort of practical

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:37.280
implications of your ideas to our world, our complicated world. When you look at the big

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:50.240
questions of humanity of hate, war, what else is there, evil? Maybe there's the positive aspects

02:36:50.240 --> 02:37:02.560
of that, of meaning, of love. What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived as? What is

02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:09.280
the conscious realism when applied to daily life? What kind of impact does it have?

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:20.000
A lot. And it's sort of scary. We all know that life is ephemeral. And spiritual traditions have

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.280
said, wake up to the fact that anything that you do here is going to disappear.

02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.400
But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought. I see this bottle because I create it

02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:36.560
right now. As soon as I look away, that data structure has been garbage collected. That bottle,

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:40.960
I have to recreate it every time I look. So I spend all my money. I buy this fancy car.

02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:45.920
That car, I have to keep recreating it every time I look at it. It's that ephemeral.

02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:52.160
So all the things that we invest ourselves in, we fight over, we kill each other over,

02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:58.080
and we have wars over, these are all, it's just like people in a virtual reality simulation.

02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:06.560
Right? And there's this Porsche. We all see the Porsche. Well, that Porsche exists when I look

02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:12.160
at it. I turn my headset and I look at it. And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.400
he'll see his Porsche. But it's not even the same Porsche that I see. He's creating his own Porsche.

02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:25.120
So these things are exceedingly ephemeral. And now, just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.

02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:31.360
Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche, but really, the Porsche only exists as long as you

02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:38.080
look. So this all of a sudden, what the spiritual traditions have been saying for a long, long time,

02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:43.840
this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science. It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact,

02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.000
it lasts for a few milliseconds, a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it, and then it's

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:59.520
gone. So the whole idea, why are we fighting? Why do we hate? We fight over possessions

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:08.080
because we think that we're small little objects inside this pre-existing space time. We assume

02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:15.920
that that mansion, that car exists independent of us and that somehow we, these little things,

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:21.680
can have our sense of self and importance enhanced by having that special car or that special house

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:28.480
or that special person. In fact, it's just the opposite. You create that mansion every time you

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:35.200
look. You're something far deeper than that mansion. You're the entity which can create that

02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:41.520
mansion on the fly. And there's nothing to the mansion except what you create in this moment.

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:50.240
So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view, it has all sorts of implications for how we

02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:59.520
interact with each other, how we treat each other. And again, a lot of things that spiritual

02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:04.240
traditions have said, it's a mixed bag. Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag. So let me just be

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:08.320
right up front about that. I'm not promoting any particular, but they do have some insights.

02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:12.080
Yeah, they have wisdom. They have certain wisdom. They have, I can point to nonsense,

02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:16.560
I won't go into it, but I can also point to lots of nonsense. So the issue is to then

02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:24.240
to look for the key insights. And I think they have a lot of insights about the ephemeral nature of

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:29.760
objects in space and time and not being attached to them, including our own bodies and reversing

02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:33.840
that I'm not this little thing, a little consciousness trapped in the body. And the

02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:37.440
consciousness itself is only a product of the body. So when the body dies, the consciousness

02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:42.880
disappears, it turns completely around, the consciousness is fundamental, the body,

02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:51.040
my hand exists right now because I'm looking at it. My hand is gone. I have no hand. I have,

02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.080
I have no brain. I have no heart. If you looked, you'll see a heart. Whatever I am

02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:04.080
is this really complicated thing in consciousness. That's what I am. All the stuff that I thought

02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:09.600
I was is something that I create on the fly and delete. So this whole, so this is completely

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:18.400
a radical restructuring of how we think about possessions, about identity, about survival

02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:23.520
of death, and so forth. This is completely transformative. But the nice thing is that

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:27.840
this whole approach of consciousness agents, unlike the spiritual traditions, which have

02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:34.000
said, in some cases, similar things, they've said it in precisely. This is mathematics.

02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.080
We can actually now begin to state precisely, here's the mathematical model of consciousness,

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.400
conscious agents. Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly.

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:53.280
And here's why things are ephemeral. And here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral

02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:58.320
nature of things, because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time,

02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:01.120
quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time.

02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:07.840
The I and the am and the I am is all kind of emerging through this whole process of evolution

02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:14.880
and so on. That's just surface waves. And there's a much deeper ocean that we're trying to figure

02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:19.520
out here. So how does you said, this said, some of the stuff you're thinking about maps the space

02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:24.240
time, how does it map the space? Right. So just a very, very high level, and I'll keep it brief.

02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:31.120
The structures that the physicists are finding, like the amplitude heat, it turns out they're

02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:37.840
just static structure, they're polytopes. But they remarkably, most of the information in them

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:46.480
is contained in permutation matrices. So it's a matrix, like an n by n matrix that just has zeros

02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:53.680
and ones. That contains almost all of the information. And you can they have these plabbit

02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:57.840
graphs and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering, you can compute those scattering

02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:06.320
amplitudes almost entirely from these permutation matrices. So that's just now from my point of

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:12.240
view, I have this conscious agent dynamics, it turns out that the stationary dynamics that I was

02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:19.840
talking about, where the entropy is increasing, all the stationary dynamics are sketched out by

02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:29.280
permutation matrices. So if you there's so called Birkhoff polytope, all the vertices of this

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:37.200
polytope, all the points are permutation matrices, all the internal points are Markovian kernels

02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:42.080
that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.

02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:48.400
I need to intuit a little better what the heck you're talking about. But so basically,

02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:54.960
there's some complicated thing going on with the network of conscious agents, and that's

02:43:54.960 --> 02:44:01.920
mappable to this. You're saying it to dimensional matrix that scattering has to do with what,

02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:06.640
without the perception like that's like photon stuff. I mean, I don't know if it's useful to

02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:14.720
sort of dig into detail. I'll do just the high level thing. Yes. So the high level is the long

02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:18.640
term behavior of the conscious agent dynamics. So that's the projection of just looking at the

02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:26.400
long term behavior. I'm hoping we'll give rise to the amplitude, the amplitude, then gives rise to

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:31.440
space time. So then I can just use their link to go all the way from consciousness through its

02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:37.360
asymptotics to through the amplitude and into space time and get the map all the way into our

02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:40.400
interface. And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix because it gives you a nice

02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:45.040
thing to try to generate. That's right. It's the connection with the amplitude, the permutation

02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:49.760
matrices are the core of the amplitude, and it turns out they're the core of the asymptotic

02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:54.720
description of the conscious agents. So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,

02:44:54.720 --> 02:45:01.040
but I like, first of all, I like video games and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.560
First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea, this thought experiment that will live in

02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:12.320
a simulation? And in general, do you think we'll live in a simulation? So the Nick Bostrom's idea

02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:19.760
about the simulation is typically couched in a physicalist framework. Yes. So there is the bottom

02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:25.200
level. There's some programmer in a physical space time, and they have a computer that they've

02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:31.600
programmed really cleverly, where they've created conscious entities. So you have the hard problem

02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.600
of consciousness, right? The standard hard problem, how could a computer simulation create a

02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:41.840
which isn't explained by that simulation theory. But then the idea is that the next level, the

02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:47.200
entities that are from the, that are created in the first level simulation, then can write

02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:54.160
their own simulations and you get this this nesting. So, so the idea that this is a simulation

02:45:54.160 --> 02:46:00.720
is fine. But the idea that this starts with a physical space, I think is important. There's

02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:07.440
different properties here, the partial rendering. And to me, that's the interesting idea is not

02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:13.360
whether the entirety of the universe is simulated, but how efficiently can you

02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:23.360
create interfaces that are convincing to all other entities that can appreciate such interfaces?

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.800
How little does it take? Because you said like partial rendering, or like temporal,

02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:34.800
ephemeral rendering of stuff, only render the tree falling in the forest when there's somebody

02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.240
there to see it. It's interesting to think how can you do that superficially without having

02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:45.040
to render everything. And that to me is one perspective on the simulation, just like it is

02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.760
with video games, where a video game doesn't have to render every single thing. It's just

02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:55.520
the thing that the observer is looking at. Right. There is actually, that's a very nice question.

02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:00.960
And there's whole groups of researchers that are actually studying in virtual reality, what

02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:07.680
is the sort of minimal requirements on the system? What, how does it have to operate

02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:12.560
to give you an immersion experience, to give you the feeling that you have a body,

02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:16.480
to get you to take it real? And there's actually a lot of really good work on that right now.

02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.480
And it turns out it doesn't take that much. You do need to get the perception action loop

02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:26.880
tight. And you have to give them the perceptions that they're expecting, if you want them to.

02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:31.600
But if you, you can lead them along, if you give them perceptions that are close to what

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:35.440
they're expecting, you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.

02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:38.480
Yeah, it's a trick engineering problem, especially when you're trying to create a product

02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.000
that costs little, but that's, it feels like an engineering problem, not a deeply scientific

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.440
problem. Or meaning obviously it's a scientific problem, but as a scientific problem, it's not

02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:56.400
that difficult to trick us descendants of apes. But here's, here's a case for just us in our own,

02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:59.840
if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now. So here's something you

02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:08.400
can try for yourself. If you just close your eyes and look at your experience in front of you,

02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:11.920
to be aware of your experience in front of you, what you experience is just like a modeled

02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.880
dark gray, where there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it, but it's just dark gray.

02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:24.160
But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward, put your attention backward,

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:32.320
what is it like behind you with your eyes closed? And there, it's like nothing.

02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:41.120
It's real. So what is going on here? What, what am I experiencing back there?

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:49.680
Right. Well, it's, I don't know if it's nothing. It's, it's like, I guess it's the absence of,

02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:55.760
it's not even like darkness or something. It's not even darkness. There's no, there's no

02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:02.080
qualia to it. And yet there is a sense of being. And that's the interesting thing.

02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:06.640
There's a sense of being back. So I close my, I put my attention forward. I just,

02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:10.240
I have the quality of a gray model thing. But when I put my attention backward,

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:13.200
there's no quality at all, but there is a sense of being.

02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:19.920
I personally, you haven't been to that side of the room. I have been to that side of the room.

02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:26.960
So for me, memories, I start, I started playing the engine of memory replay,

02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:33.680
which is like, I take myself back in time and think about that place where I was hanging

02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:38.640
out in that part. That's when I see what I'm behind. So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,

02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:42.960
we're able to, we're collecting these experiences and we can replay them in interesting ways,

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:48.160
whenever we feel like it. And it's almost like being there, but not really, but almost.

02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:54.000
That's right. And yet we can go our entire lives in this. You're talking about the minimal thing

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:59.680
for VR. We can go our entire lives and not realize that all of my life, it's been like

02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:07.920
nothing behind me. We're not even aware that all of our lives, if you just, for the,

02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:10.960
just pay attention, close your eyes, pay attention to what's behind me, you're like,

02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:16.000
oh, holy smoke. It's sort of scary. I mean, it's like nothing. There's no quality there at all.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:21.280
How did I not notice that my entire life? We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.

02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:26.640
Yeah. I mean, you could see this with children, right? Though with persistence, you know, you

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:32.320
could do the peek-a-boo game. You can hide from them and appear and they're fully tricked. And in

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:36.560
the same way, we're fully tricked. There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.

02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:40.960
And that's really interesting. These theories are pretty heavy.

02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:49.840
You as a human being, as a mortal human being, how has these theories been to you personally?

02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:55.280
Like, are there good days and bad days when you wake up and look in the mirror and the fact that

02:50:55.280 --> 02:51:00.240
you can't see anything behind you? The fact that it's rendered like, is there interesting quirks?

02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:06.560
You know, Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:11.760
How has these theories, these ideas changed you as a person?

02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:20.720
It's been very, very difficult. The stuff is not just abstract theory building because it's about us.

02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:26.160
Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me that my mind is doing all this

02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:30.400
science and coming with these conclusions. And the rest of me is not integrating. I was just like,

02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:35.440
I don't believe it. I just don't believe this. I mean, it seems. So as I start to take it seriously,

02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:44.080
I get scared myself. Then I read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying very,

02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:55.200
very similar things. There's a lot of convergence. So for me, the first time I thought it might be

02:51:55.200 --> 02:52:01.440
possible that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986. It was from some mathematics we were doing.

02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:08.880
And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to sit down. It was, it really,

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:17.280
it was scary. It was really a shock to the system. And then to realize that everything that has been

02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:25.040
important to me, like, you know, getting a house, getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.

02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:30.720
Well, that car is just like the car I see in the virtual reality. It's there when you

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:34.720
perceive it and it's not there. So the whole question of, you know,

02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:41.040
what am I doing and why? What's worthwhile doing in life? Clearly,

02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:47.280
getting a big house and getting a big car. I mean, we all knew that we were going to die.

02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:53.280
So we tend not to know that. We tend to hide it, especially when we were young. Before age 30,

02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:58.560
we don't believe we're going to die. But we factually maybe know that you kind of are supposed

02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:02.800
to, yeah. But they'll figure something out and probably the generation that is the first one

02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:07.520
that doesn't have to die. That's the kind of thing. But when you really face the fact that

02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:13.680
you're going to die, and then when I start to look at it from this point of view that, well,

02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:19.280
this thing was an interface to begin with. So what I'm really, is what I'm really going to be doing,

02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:24.080
just taking off a headset. So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day.

02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:30.160
And I got lost in the game when I was fighting over a Porsche. And I shot some guys up and I

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:35.200
punctured their tires and I got the Porsche. Now I take the headset off. And what was that for?

02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:40.880
Nothing. It was just, it was a data structure and the data structure is gone. So all of the wars,

02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:46.720
the fighting and the reputations and all this stuff, you know, where it's just a headset.

02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:58.880
So now, and so my theory says that intellectually, my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.

02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:02.880
This is like, you know, and so I have to meditate. I meditate a lot.

02:54:02.880 --> 02:54:10.960
Well, what percent of the day would you say you spend as a physicalist sort of living life,

02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:19.600
pretending your car matters, your reputation matters? Like, how much was that Tom Waits song?

02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:25.680
I like my town with a little drop of poison. How much poison do you allow yourself to have?

02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:31.280
I think my default mode is physicalist. I think that that's just the default. I, when I'm not

02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:35.760
being conscious, consciously attentive.

02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:42.080
Then intellectually conscious, because if you're just, you're still, if you're tasting coffee and

02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:46.640
not thinking or drinking or just taking it in the sunset, you're not being intellectual,

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:53.520
but you're still experiencing it. So it's when you turn on the like the introspective machine,

02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:58.800
that's when you can start and turn off the thinker. When I actually just start looking

02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:05.600
without thinking. So that's when I feel like I, all of a sudden, I'm starting to see through.

02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:14.400
I'm sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface is all the stories I'm telling

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:18.560
about it. It's really important for me to get that really important to do that. So I'm telling all

02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:24.320
these stories and so I'm all wrapped up. Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:35.600
is about attachment to the interface. And so what I found is that the essentially the only way to

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:45.360
really detach from the interface is to literally let go of thoughts altogether. And then all of a

02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:52.560
sudden, even my identity, you know, my whole history, my name, my education, all this stuff

02:55:53.120 --> 02:56:02.160
is almost irrelevant because it's just now here is the present moment. And this is this is the

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:08.880
reality right now. And all of that other stuff is an interface story. But this conscious experience

02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:14.880
right now, this is the only, this is the only reality as far as I can tell, the rest of it's a

02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:22.480
story. And, but that is, again, not my default, that is, I have to make a really

02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:29.600
conscious choice to say, okay, I know intellectually this is all an interface.

02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:36.640
I'm going to take the headset off and so forth. And then immediately sink back into the game and

02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:42.080
just be out there playing the game and get lost. And so I'm always lost in the game unless I

02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:50.880
literally consciously choose to stop thinking. Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge that

02:56:53.520 --> 02:57:00.880
to look beyond the game? Isn't it scares the hell out of me? It's really a scary

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.440
because I'm so attached. I'm attached to this body. I'm attached to the interface.

02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:11.920
Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit? Meaning like, it's,

02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:18.640
I mean, some of these ideas, when you think about reality, even with like Einstein,

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:27.680
just realizing you said interface, just realizing that light, you know, that there's a speed of

02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:32.160
light and you can't go faster than the speed of light and like what kind of things black holes and

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:39.840
can do with light, even that can mess with your head. Yes. But that's still space time.

02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:44.560
That's a big mess, but it's still just space time. It's still a property of our interface.

02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:51.360
That's right. But it's still like even, even Einstein realized that this particular thing,

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:58.080
some of the stories you tell ourselves is constructing interfaces that are oversimplifying

02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:04.320
the way things work because it's nice. The stories are nice. Stories are nice.

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:06.800
That's what I mean. It's just like video games. They're nice.

02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:12.560
Right. But Einstein was a realist, right? He was a famous realist in the sense that he

02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:18.400
was very explicit in a 1935 paper with Podolski and Rosen, the EPR paper where he,

02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:27.680
they said, if without in any way disturbing a system, I can predict with probability one,

02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:34.720
the outcome of a measurement, then there exists in reality that element,

02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:40.640
right? That value, that, and we now know from quantum theory that that's false.

02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:46.320
That Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.

02:58:47.280 --> 02:58:52.800
Yeah. And so we can predict, we can set up, in quantum theory, you can set up,

02:58:52.880 --> 02:58:58.560
and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism, where he, he scouts this out,

02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:01.360
it was done by the people, but he gives a good presentation of this,

02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:04.640
where they have a sequence of like something like nine different quantum measurements

02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:09.840
that you can make. And you can predict with probability one, what a particular outcome

02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:17.840
will be, but you can actually prove that it's impossible that the value existed before you

02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:20.640
made the measurement. So you know with probability one, what you're going to get,

02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:25.760
which you also know with certainty that that value was not there until you made the measurement.

02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:31.360
So the, so we know from quantum theory that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:37.120
And that is built in to what I'm saying with this theory of consciousness.

02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:42.320
If consciousness is fundamental, space time itself is an act of fact creation. It's,

02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:46.480
it's an interface that we create, consciousness creates, plus all the objects in it. So local

02:59:46.480 --> 02:59:53.360
realism is not true. Quantum theory is established that also non-contextual realism

02:59:53.360 --> 02:59:58.400
is not true. And that, that fits in perfectly with this idea that consciousness is fundamental.

02:59:59.440 --> 03:00:02.480
These things are, these exist as data structures when we create them.

03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:08.640
As, as, as Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:17.440
But I must say on a personal level, I'm having to spend, I spend a couple hours a day

03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:25.840
just sitting in meditation on this and facing the rebellion

03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:30.320
in me that goes to the core, it feels like it goes to the core of my being,

03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:34.240
rebellion against these ideas. So, so here it's very, very interesting for me to look at this

03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:38.400
because so here I'm a, I'm a scientist and I'm a person. The science is really clear.

03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:43.680
Local realism is false. Non-contextual realism is false. Spacetime is doomed. It's, it's very,

03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:50.720
very clear. It couldn't be clearer. And my, my emotions rebel left and right. When I sit there

03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:57.600
and say, okay, I am not something in space and time. Something inside of me says, you're crazy.

03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:01.760
Of course you are. And I'm completely attached to it. I'm completely attached to all this stuff.

03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:05.840
I'm attached to my body. I'm attached to the headset. I'm attached to my car.

03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:12.720
Attached to people. I'm attached to all of it. And, and yet I know as a absolute fact,

03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:20.640
I'm going to walk away from all of it. I'm going to die. It'll, you know, in fact, I almost died

03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:28.160
last year. COVID almost killed me. I, I sent a goodbye text to my wife. So I was, I thought I

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:34.880
was, I sent her a goodbye. I thought I was in the emergency room and it attacked my heart

03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:41.680
and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours. I, I couldn't last much longer. I knew

03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:48.880
I, they couldn't stop it. So that was, that was it. So that was it. So, so I texted her goodbye

03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:54.960
from the emergency room. I love you. Goodbye kind of thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that was it.

03:01:54.960 --> 03:02:00.240
So, so were you afraid? God, it scares the hell out of you, right? But there, there is,

03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:04.160
there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway, that, that all, you know, you,

03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:07.680
that, that sort of, you're scared, but you're just feeling so bad that in some sense,

03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:16.240
you just want to stop anyway. So, so I've, I've, I've been there and faced it just, just a year ago.

03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:22.240
How did that change you by the way? Having, having this intellectual reality that's so

03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:26.080
challenging that you meditate on a year, it's just an interface. And one of the,

03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:32.640
one of the hardest things to come to terms with is that, that means that, you know, it's going to end.

03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:38.800
How did I change you having come, come so close to the reality of it? It's not just an

03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:45.920
intellectual reality. It's, it's a reality of death. It's, it's forced. I've, I've meditated for

03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:50.160
20 years now. And then I would say averaging three or four hours a day.

03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:59.920
But it's put a new urgency, but urgency is not the right word because that, that

03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:07.120
it's, it's riveted my attention. I'll put it that way. It's really riveted my attention. And

03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:13.600
I've really paid, I spent a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say.

03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:20.480
I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with the, you know, take it all with a green

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:25.840
assault. But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me to ignore it. So I try to listen

03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:33.600
to the best ideas and, and to sort out nonsense from, and it's just, we all have to do it for

03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:39.200
ourselves, right? It's not easy. So what makes sense? And I have the advantage of some science,

03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:42.960
so I can look at what science says and try to compare with spiritual tradition.

03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:48.880
I try to sort it out for myself. And, but then I also look and realize that there's another

03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:54.960
aspect to me, which is this whole emotional aspect. The, I seem to be wired up

03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:03.280
as evolutionary psychology says, I'm wired up, right? All these defensive mechanisms. So, you

03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:10.880
I'm, I'm inclined to lie if I need to, I'm inclined to, to be angry, to protect myself,

03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:17.600
to have an in group and an out group, to try to, you know, make my reputation as big as possible,

03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:22.000
to try to demean the out group. There's all these things that evolutionary psychology

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:27.440
is spot on. It's really brilliant about the human condition. And yet I think evolution,

03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:32.720
as I said, evolutionary theory is a projection of a deeper theory where there may be no

03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:41.040
competition. So how, so I'm in this very interesting position where I feel like, okay,

03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:45.440
according to my own theory, I'm consciousness. And maybe this is what it means for consciousness

03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:53.200
to wake up. It's not easy. It's, it's, it's almost like I have, I feel like I have real

03:04:53.200 --> 03:05:00.080
skin in the game. It really is scary. I really was scared when I was about to die. It really was

03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:04.800
hard to say goodbye to my wife. It really, it really pained. And

03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:11.440
to then look at that, and then look at the fact that I'm going to walk away from this anyway,

03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:16.880
and it's just an interface. How do I, so it's, it's trying to put all this stuff together and really

03:05:17.840 --> 03:05:22.560
grok it, so to speak, not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.

03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:28.480
Yeah. What are you afraid of? You silly evolved organism that's gotten way too attached to the

03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:35.760
interface. What are you really afraid of? That's right. Is there a very personal, you know, it's

03:05:35.760 --> 03:05:42.720
very, very personal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, speaking of the text, what do you think is this whole love

03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:50.960
thing? What's the role of love in our human condition? This interface thing we have this,

03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:55.760
is this somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness, this attachment we have to other

03:05:55.760 --> 03:06:06.400
humans, and this deep, like some quality to it that seems very interesting, peculiar.

03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:13.120
Well, there are two levels I would think about that. There's love in the sexual sense, and there's

03:06:13.120 --> 03:06:19.520
love in a deeper sense. And in the sexual sense, we can give an evolutionary account of that and

03:06:19.520 --> 03:06:28.240
so forth. And I think that's pretty clear to people. In this deeper sense, right? So, of course,

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:33.920
I married your, I love my wife in a sexual sense, but there was a deeper sense as well.

03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:38.080
When I was saying goodbye to her, there was a deeper, much deeper love that was really at play

03:06:38.080 --> 03:06:43.600
there. That's one place where I think that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions has something

03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:47.920
right. When they say, you know, love your neighbor as yourself, that some, in some sense, love is

03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:55.040
fundamental. I think that they're onto something, something very, very deep and profound. And

03:06:56.720 --> 03:06:59.680
every once in a while, I can get a personal glimpse of that, especially when I'm in the

03:07:01.840 --> 03:07:10.160
space with no thought. Like when I can really let go of thoughts, I get little glimpses of a love

03:07:10.160 --> 03:07:16.560
in the sense that I'm not separate. It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that. I,

03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:22.080
you know, yeah, if you and I are separate, then there's, I can fight you. But if you and I are

03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:31.280
the same, if there's a union there, the togetherness of it, yeah. What, who's God? All those gods,

03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:35.760
the stories that have been told throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions,

03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:42.800
what do you think that is? Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?

03:07:43.680 --> 03:07:53.200
Oh, well, in many traditions, not all. The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister,

03:07:54.720 --> 03:08:04.480
we tend to think of God as a being. But I think that that's not right. I think the closest way

03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:12.240
to think about God is being, period, not a being, but being the very ground of being itself is God.

03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:18.000
I think that's the deep, and from my point of view, that's the ground of consciousness. So the

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:25.200
ground of conscious being is what we might call God. But the word God has always been, you know,

03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:29.920
for example, you don't believe the same God as my God, so I'm going to fight you. We'll have wars

03:08:29.920 --> 03:08:35.520
over, because the being, the specific being that you call God is different from the being that I

03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:42.800
call God, and so we fight. Whereas if it's not a being, but just being, and you and I share being,

03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:48.240
then you and I are not separate, and there's no reason to fight. We're both part of that one

03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:54.800
being, and loving you is loving myself, because we're all part of that one being. The spiritual

03:08:54.800 --> 03:09:02.080
traditions that point to that, I think are pointing in a very interesting direction, and that does seem

03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:07.280
to match with the mathematics of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on as well,

03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:11.040
that it really fits with that, although that wasn't my goal.

03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:20.800
Is there, you mentioned, you mentioned that the young physicist that you talk to or whose work

03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:27.040
you follow have quite a lot of fun breaking with the traditions of the past, the assumptions of

03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:33.360
the past. What advice would you give to young people today in high school, in college, not just

03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:39.840
physicists, but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of, how they can have a life

03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:45.280
they can be proud of, how to make their way in the world from the lessons, from the wins and

03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:52.320
the losses in your own life. What little insights could you pull out? I would say the universe is

03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:58.880
a lot more interesting than you might expect, and you are a lot more special and interesting

03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:06.800
than you might expect. You might think that you're just a little tiny, irrelevant 100-pound,

03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:14.960
200-pound person in a vast billions of light years across space, and that's not the case.

03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:20.640
You are, in some sense, the being that's creating that space all the time, every time you look.

03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:29.200
So, waking up to who you really are outside of space and time, as the author of space and time,

03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:36.800
is the author of everything that you see. The author of space and time, you're the author of

03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:41.680
space and time, and I'm the author of space and time. Space and time is just one little data

03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:47.120
structure. Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures. They're authors of various

03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:53.680
other things. So, realizing, and then realizing that I had this feeling that growing up and going

03:10:53.680 --> 03:11:00.480
and reading all these textbooks, oh man, it's all been done. If I'd just been there 50 years ago,

03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:05.760
I could have discovered this stuff, but it's all in the textbooks now. Well, believe me,

03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:10.560
the textbooks are going to look silly in 50 years, and it's your chance to write the new

03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:16.080
textbook. So, of course, study the current textbooks. You have to understand them. There's

03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:24.400
no way to progress until you understand what's been done. But then, the only limit is your

03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:29.840
imagination, frankly. That's the only limit. The greatest books, the greatest textbooks ever written

03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:36.720
on earth are yet to be written. Exactly. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:11:36.720 --> 03:11:43.280
What's the meaning of life from your limited interface? Can you figure it all out? Why?

03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:49.200
So, you said the universe is trying to figure itself out through us. Why?

03:11:53.840 --> 03:12:02.000
Yeah, that's the closest I've come. So, I'll give you. So, I will say that I don't know, but here's

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:06.160
my guess, right? That's a good first sentence. That's a good starting point. And maybe that's

03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:11.120
going to be a profound part of the final answer is to start with the I don't know. It's quite

03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:17.120
possible that that's really important to start with the I don't know. My guess is that if consciousness

03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:24.160
is fundamental and if girdle, girdle's incompleteness theorem holds here, and there's infinite variety

03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:37.120
of structures for consciousness to some sense explore, that maybe that's what it's about.

03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:40.160
This is something that Onika and I talked about a little bit, and she doesn't like this way of

03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:43.760
talking about it. And so, I'm going to have to talk with her some more about this way of talking.

03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:47.040
But right now, I'll just put it this way, and I'll have to talk with her more and see if I

03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:51.680
can say it more clearly. But the way I'm talking about it now is that

03:12:55.600 --> 03:13:04.240
there's a sense in which there's being, and then there's experiences or forms that come out of

03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:13.760
being. That's one deep, deep mystery. And the question that you asked, what's it all about?

03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:19.600
Somehow it's related to that. Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms?

03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:26.640
Why does it, why do we have experiences? Why should, why not just have, when you close your eyes

03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:30.640
and pay attention to what's behind you, there's nothing. But there's being.

03:13:31.440 --> 03:13:39.280
Why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there? Why did we create all tables and chairs

03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:48.240
on the sun and moon and people, all this really complicated stuff? Why? And all I can guess right

03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:53.360
now, and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years and say that was dumb, but all I can

03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:58.800
guess right now is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself by knowing what it's not.

03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:06.560
So here I am, I'm not this body. And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face when I

03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:13.360
sent a text goodbye. But then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like, okay, I sort of don't want to

03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:20.240
go there, right? Okay, so I just, so I am my body. I go back to the standard thing, I am my body,

03:14:20.240 --> 03:14:25.920
and then I want to get that car. And even though I was just about to die a year ago, so that comes

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:38.000
rushing back. So, so consciousness immerses itself fully into a particular headset, gets lost in it,

03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:43.600
and then slowly wakes up. Just so it can escape and that is the waking up, but it needs to have

03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:48.720
a negative. It needs to know what it's not. It needs to know what you are. You have to say,

03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:51.840
oh, I'm not that, I'm not that, that wasn't important, that wasn't important.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:15:00.480
That's really powerful done. Let me just say that, because I've been a long-term fan of yours,

03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:05.600
and we're supposed to have a conversation doing this very difficult moment in your life. Let me

03:15:05.600 --> 03:15:10.240
just say you're a truly special person. And I for one, I know there's a lot, a lot of others,

03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:15.440
they agree. I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth, if for a short time.

03:15:15.520 --> 03:15:25.600
So, whatever, whatever the universe, whatever plan it has for you that brought you close to

03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:33.920
death, to maybe enlighten you some kind of way, I think, I think has an interesting plan for you.

03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:38.000
You're one of the truly special humans, and it's a huge honor that you would sit and talk with me

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.680
today. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lex. I really appreciate that. Thank you.

03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:46.720
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Donald Hoffman. To support this podcast,

03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:51.600
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from

03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:59.440
Albert Einstein, relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation. Time and space are modes by

03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:06.320
which we think, and not conditions in which we live. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you

03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:15.920
next time.
