00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
I don't know what it's like to be an alien, I would like to know.

00:03.040 --> 00:07.040
Two alien civilizations co-existent on a planet, what's that look like exactly?

00:07.040 --> 00:11.360
When you see them and they see you, you're assuming they have vision,

00:11.360 --> 00:14.400
they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.400
There's a lot of assumptions they're making.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.600
What human level intelligence has done is quite different.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.840
It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before,

00:23.840 --> 00:26.560
it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed

00:26.560 --> 00:29.120
and we can actually make them come into existence.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.480
So you can travel back in time sometimes?

00:32.480 --> 00:32.960
Yes.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.960
You travel forward in time to travel back?

00:34.960 --> 00:35.280
Yes.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.560
The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.160
They have each been on this podcast once before individually

00:46.160 --> 00:49.280
and now for their second time they're here together.

00:49.840 --> 00:55.360
Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, Lee is a chemist,

00:55.360 --> 01:00.720
and if I may say so, the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.280
They both are interested in how life originates and develops

01:05.280 --> 01:08.480
both life here on earth and alien life,

01:08.480 --> 01:12.400
including intelligent alien civilizations out there in the cosmos.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.640
They are colleagues and friends who love to explore,

01:16.640 --> 01:20.080
disagree and debate nuanced points about alien life.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.680
And so we're calling this an alien debate.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.880
Very few questions to me are as fascinating as what do aliens look like?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.480
How do we recognize them?

01:30.480 --> 01:32.080
How do we talk to them?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.800
And how do we make sense of life here on earth

01:34.800 --> 01:37.760
in the context of all possible life forms that are out there?

01:38.560 --> 01:42.720
Treating these questions with the seriousness and rigor they deserve

01:42.720 --> 01:47.120
so that I hope to do with this conversation and future ones like it.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.240
Our world is shrouded in mystery.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.560
We must first be humbled to acknowledge this

01:52.640 --> 01:56.400
and then be bold in diving in and trying to figure things out anyway.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.280
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.160
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.440
And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.080
First of all, welcome back, Sarah.

02:10.080 --> 02:10.960
Welcome back, Lee.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.480
You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.520
You're incredible people.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.120
I should say thank you to Sarah for wearing really awesome boots.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.520
We'll probably overlay a picture later on,

02:19.520 --> 02:21.600
but why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.120
This is me dressed up.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.200
You were saying that you're pink.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.800
That your thing is pink.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.360
My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.040
Where's the pink?

02:31.040 --> 02:34.080
When did it hit you that pink is your color?

02:34.080 --> 02:40.480
I became pink about, I don't know, actually, maybe 2017?

02:41.360 --> 02:42.720
Did you know me when you first-

02:42.720 --> 02:43.920
I think I met you pre-pink.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.400
Yeah, yeah.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.920
So about 2017, I think, I just decided I was boring

02:48.800 --> 02:50.240
and I needed to make a statement.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.960
And red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.200
Well, I think you were always pink.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.280
You just found yourself in 2017.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.400
There's an amazing photo of him

03:00.400 --> 03:02.160
where there's like everybody in their black gown

03:02.160 --> 03:03.440
and he's just wearing the pink pants.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.120
Well, that wasn't a wagon in university.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.160
It's totally nuts.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.640
100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary

03:08.640 --> 03:10.640
and they didn't find the outfit for me.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.960
So they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns

03:12.960 --> 03:14.240
and there was me dressed up in pink,

03:14.240 --> 03:15.840
looking like a complete idiot.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.920
We're definitely going to have to find that picture

03:18.000 --> 03:21.520
and overlay a big full-screen slow motion.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.600
All right, let's talk about aliens.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.760
We'll find places we disagree

03:25.760 --> 03:26.720
and places we agree.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.720
Life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.880
Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson

03:35.440 --> 03:38.720
stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.

03:39.600 --> 03:39.920
Quote,

03:40.480 --> 03:43.920
How egocentric of us to think that space aliens

03:43.920 --> 03:47.520
who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy

03:47.520 --> 03:50.560
would give, pardon the French,

03:51.600 --> 03:54.000
would give a shit about humans on Earth.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.920
So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,

03:57.920 --> 03:59.600
observing, communicating with humans?

04:00.320 --> 04:02.160
Let's take a perspective of aliens.

04:02.160 --> 04:06.240
Maybe Sarah, first, are we interesting

04:06.240 --> 04:09.760
in the whole spectrum of life in the universe?

04:10.960 --> 04:13.680
I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now

04:13.680 --> 04:15.360
we're the most interesting thing in the universe.

04:16.320 --> 04:22.240
So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity that we have

04:22.880 --> 04:26.640
and how much I think that's deeply related to the physics of what we are

04:26.640 --> 04:29.920
that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out

04:29.920 --> 04:34.320
examples of the phenomena they are to understand themselves better.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.120
And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.600
And I don't think there's any kind of judgment on

04:40.240 --> 04:41.920
it being a lesser being or not.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.320
It's like saying you have nothing to learn by talking to a baby.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.320
You have lots to learn, probably more than you do talking to somebody that's 90.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.280
So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.400
So whatever the phenomena is that is human,

04:55.280 --> 04:57.600
there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomenon

04:57.600 --> 05:00.000
within alien species and they will be seeking that same.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.520
I think there's got to be some features of us that are universal.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.400
And I think the ones that are most interesting,

05:06.400 --> 05:08.560
and I hope I live in an interesting universe,

05:08.560 --> 05:13.920
are the ones that are driven by our curiosity

05:13.920 --> 05:18.480
and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things

05:18.480 --> 05:21.280
that the universe wouldn't be able to do without things like us existing.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.160
We're going to define a lot of terms.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.440
One of them is interesting.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.800
Yes.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.880
That's a very interesting term to try to define.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.560
What do you think are humans interesting for aliens?

05:33.360 --> 05:34.720
Well, let's take it from our perspective.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.960
We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.720
So if we put the shoe on the other foot, of course we're interesting.

05:41.280 --> 05:46.000
But I'm wondering, and assuming that we're at the right technological capability

05:46.000 --> 05:49.040
to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.040
So what I mean is, if there needs to be a massive leap in technology

05:53.040 --> 05:58.720
that we don't have, how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?

05:58.720 --> 06:02.400
But I do think that they would come and find us,

06:02.400 --> 06:04.160
because they'd want to find out about our culture,

06:04.800 --> 06:07.600
what things are universal, what about, I mean, I'm a chemist,

06:07.600 --> 06:09.440
so I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?

06:10.080 --> 06:13.680
Are the creatures that we're going to find making all this commotion,

06:13.680 --> 06:15.120
are they made of the same stuff?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.960
What does their science look like?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.000
Are they off-planet yet?

06:23.920 --> 06:27.520
I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson is being slightly pessimistic

06:27.520 --> 06:33.280
and maybe trying to play the tune that the universe is vast

06:33.280 --> 06:35.280
and it's not worth them coming here.

06:35.280 --> 06:40.320
I don't think that, but I just worry that maybe we don't have the ability

06:40.320 --> 06:42.400
to talk to them, we don't have the universal translator,

06:42.400 --> 06:43.600
we don't have the right physics.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.280
But sure, they should come.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.160
We are interesting.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.520
I want to know if they exist.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.040
It would make it easy if they just came.

06:50.720 --> 06:56.240
So again, I'm going to use your tweets like it's Shakespeare and analyze it.

06:56.240 --> 07:00.960
So Sarah tweeted, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.320
So how much do you think aliens are thinking about other aliens,

07:06.320 --> 07:07.680
including humans?

07:07.680 --> 07:15.280
So you said we humans want to visit, we're longing to connect with aliens.

07:15.280 --> 07:15.920
Why is that?

07:15.920 --> 07:16.800
Can you introspect that?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.480
Is that an obvious thing that we should be?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.760
Like, what are we hoping to understand by meeting aliens?

07:22.400 --> 07:22.960
Exactly.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.720
Asking as an introvert is like, I ask myself this all the time,

07:26.720 --> 07:29.600
why go out on a Friday night to meet people?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.120
What are you hoping to find?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.680
I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,

07:33.680 --> 07:35.680
I think I answered it actually as well, which was,

07:36.640 --> 07:38.880
we are thinking about trying to make contact.

07:38.880 --> 07:43.440
So they almost certainly are, but maybe there's a number of classes.

07:43.440 --> 07:48.240
There are those aliens that have not yet made contact with other aliens, like us.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.680
Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien,

07:51.680 --> 07:53.440
and maybe it's an anti-climax and slime.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.720
And aliens that have made contact with not just one set of intelligent species,

07:58.720 --> 08:01.120
but several, that must be amazing actually.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.280
Literally, there is some place in the universe,

08:03.280 --> 08:06.400
there must be one alien civilization to not make contact with, not one,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.440
but two other intelligent civilizations.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.080
So they must be thinking about it.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.480
There must be entire degree courses on aliens,

08:16.480 --> 08:20.560
thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.120
Do you think they will survive the meeting?

08:24.400 --> 08:28.480
And by the way, Lee did respond saying that's all the universe wants.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.280
So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.400
Lee said, that's all the universe wants.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.760
And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.160
So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,

08:42.160 --> 08:44.880
all of which we'll try to define mathematically.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.040
Cheeky might be harder than interesting.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.560
Because there's humor in that too.

08:48.560 --> 08:49.360
Yes.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.360
I think there's a mathematical definition of humor,

08:51.360 --> 08:52.480
but we'll talk about that in a bit.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.360
Oh, interesting.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.560
Yeah, it surely is, yeah.

08:54.560 --> 08:59.840
So if you're a graduate student alien looking at multiple alien civilizations,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.240
do you think they survive the encounters?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.680
I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.080
A lot of the discussions about alien life, which is a really big challenge.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.040
So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems,

09:13.040 --> 09:16.400
I don't try to think about us as humans,

09:16.400 --> 09:20.080
but us as an example of phenomena that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.

09:20.800 --> 09:27.520
And it doesn't seem to be the case that if I think about the features,

09:27.520 --> 09:30.400
I would argue are most universal about that phenomena,

09:30.400 --> 09:34.960
that there's any reason to think that a first encounter with another lineage

09:34.960 --> 09:38.560
or example of life would be antagonistic.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.000
I think, yeah.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.040
And I think there's this kind of assumption.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.200
I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote,

09:49.200 --> 09:52.000
I mean, it kind of bothers me because I'm a physicist,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.160
so I know we have a lot of egos about how much we can describe the world,

09:56.160 --> 09:59.600
but that there's this like, because we understand fundamental physics so well,

09:59.600 --> 10:02.640
we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate,

10:02.640 --> 10:03.760
and I just think that we don't.

10:04.480 --> 10:09.840
And the quest there is really to understand something totally new about the universe,

10:09.840 --> 10:11.600
and that thing just happens to be us.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.160
I agree.

10:12.160 --> 10:12.560
I agree.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.840
There's something else more profound.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.120
I think Neil was just being, again, he's just trying to stir the pot.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.280
I would say from a contingency point of view,

10:21.280 --> 10:25.360
I want to know how many ways does the universe build structures, build memories, right?

10:26.320 --> 10:30.000
And then I want to know if those memories can interact with each other.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.640
And if you have two different origins of life and then origins of intelligence,

10:34.640 --> 10:36.000
and then these things become conscious,

10:36.720 --> 10:41.760
surely you want to go and talk to them and figure out what commonalities you share.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.800
And it might be that we're just unable to conceive of what they're going to look like.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.760
They're just going to be completely different, you know, infrastructure.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.320
But surely we'll want to go and find out a map.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.960
And surely curiosity is a property that evolution has made on Earth,

10:54.960 --> 10:59.520
and I can't see any reason that won't happen elsewhere because curiosity

10:59.520 --> 11:03.600
probably exists because we want to find innovations in the environment.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.840
We want to use that information to help our technology.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.720
And also curiosity is like planning for the future.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.000
Are they going to fight us?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.560
Are they, are we going to be able to trade with them?

11:15.120 --> 11:19.280
So I think that Neil's just, I don't know, maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.840
That's really, I think that's really down on Earth, right?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.560
How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?

11:26.080 --> 11:28.080
How would we, so let's put it the other way around.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.120
Slime category.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.200
Maybe, no, no, no, we, maybe we could, they think it's a bit odd, right?

11:33.200 --> 11:36.800
Look at Instagram, Twitter, all these people taking selfies.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.000
I mean, does the universe is the ultimate state of consciousness,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.760
thinking beings that take photographs themselves and upload them to an

11:43.760 --> 11:46.960
internet with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos?

11:46.960 --> 11:49.440
So I think that they will be.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.240
What's wrong with that?

11:51.040 --> 11:53.520
Yeah, I did not say there was anything wrong with it.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.400
It's consciousness manifested at scale.

11:56.400 --> 11:56.800
Yeah.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.600
Selfies.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.000
Yeah, it's like the mirror test at scale.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.360
Yeah, I do think that curiosity is really the driving force of why we have our technology,

12:05.360 --> 12:05.920
right?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out left the cave.

12:08.480 --> 12:14.320
So I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.400
Actually, of course, they'd want to come here.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.840
It doesn't mean they are coming here.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.360
We've seen evidence for that.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.360
I guess we can argue about that, right?

12:21.920 --> 12:26.160
But I think that we want, I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too,

12:26.160 --> 12:27.520
but I won't speak for you when you're here.

12:27.520 --> 12:32.480
You can, I desperately want to have missions to look for life in the solar system right now.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.720
I want to map life over the solar system.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.240
And then I want to understand how we can go and find life as quickly as possible

12:38.240 --> 12:42.480
at the nearest stars and also at the same time do it in the lab just to compensate,

12:43.200 --> 12:43.520
you know?

12:44.320 --> 12:44.960
So, sure.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.360
Yeah, I just want to point on this.

12:47.360 --> 12:52.240
If you think about sort of what's driven the most like features of our own evolution

12:52.240 --> 12:54.960
as a species and try to map that to alien species,

12:54.960 --> 12:57.920
I always think like optimism is what's going to get us furthest.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.760
And so I think a lot of people always think that it's like war and conflict

13:01.760 --> 13:06.000
is going to be the way that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.360
But if you just look at how we're doing it and how we talk about it,

13:09.360 --> 13:14.240
it's always our future in space is always built from narratives of optimism.

13:14.240 --> 13:18.560
And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out in the universe,

13:18.560 --> 13:22.160
that it's going to be more optimism and curiosity driving it than war and conflict

13:22.160 --> 13:24.080
because those things end up crushing you.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.960
So there might be some selective filter.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.360
Of course, this is me being an optimist.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.840
I'm a half full kind of person, but...

13:31.840 --> 13:35.360
Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious,

13:35.360 --> 13:38.960
but what do you think is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe than

13:39.680 --> 13:42.400
violence and the will to power?

13:43.200 --> 13:49.920
So, because you said you frame curiosity as a way to also plan on how to avoid violence,

13:49.920 --> 13:52.320
which is an interesting frame of curiosity.

13:52.320 --> 13:57.120
But I could also argue that violence is a pretty productive way

13:58.080 --> 14:01.040
to operate in the world, which is like...

14:01.040 --> 14:02.480
That's one way to protect yourself.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.840
The best defense is offense.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.840
I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.040
I think violence...

14:09.040 --> 14:10.480
That's not what violence...

14:10.480 --> 14:12.000
That's the summary of this podcast.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.600
Yeah, but maybe I would...

14:15.600 --> 14:17.680
Let's not call it violence, but I call it erasure.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.400
So if you think about the way evolution works all the way...

14:22.080 --> 14:24.240
Obviously call it assembly theory, but I won't...

14:24.240 --> 14:29.120
So if you say curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?

14:29.120 --> 14:36.080
So new features you can play, what the ability to erase those things allows you to start again,

14:36.080 --> 14:37.360
and do some pruning.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.760
So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.680
Curiosity gets you rockets at land.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.760
It gets you robots that can make drugs.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.480
It gets you poetry and art and communication.

14:48.480 --> 14:53.280
And then I often think, wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy to have another world war,

14:53.280 --> 14:54.720
not literally a world war now.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.120
Please, no world war, but the equivalent.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.640
So we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, all the admin violence,

15:00.640 --> 15:01.920
get rid of it and start again.

15:01.920 --> 15:02.640
Do you know what I mean?

15:03.120 --> 15:06.160
Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.200
So actually a reset, let's not call it violence,

15:09.200 --> 15:16.400
a reset in some aspects of our culture and our technology allows us to then

15:17.840 --> 15:19.680
build more important things without the...

15:19.680 --> 15:22.160
Because how many cookies do I have to click on?

15:22.160 --> 15:27.520
How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life that I could remove

15:27.520 --> 15:33.040
and that a bit of a reset would allow us to start again?

15:33.040 --> 15:37.040
And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter with aliens will be.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.240
Maybe they will fight with us and say,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.040
we're not as excited by you as we thought.

15:41.040 --> 15:41.840
We'll just get rid of you.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.000
Or they might want to reset Earth.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.880
Yeah, why not?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.280
To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.600
This seems like there's nothing new happening here.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.880
They're observing for a while.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.920
This is just not...

15:53.920 --> 15:55.760
Let's keep it more fun.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.960
Let's start with a fish again.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.520
I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.680
I suppose that's the kind of violence.

16:06.240 --> 16:10.000
And this is this modern world where words are violence, resetting cookies.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.040
I don't know where that came from.

16:11.040 --> 16:11.760
I'm completely...

16:11.760 --> 16:12.080
Yeah.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.680
That's poetic, really.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
Okay, so let's talk about life.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.640
What is life?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.880
What is non-life?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.440
What is the line between life and non-life?

16:23.440 --> 16:26.960
And maybe at any point we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.920
Like how do we start to try to define life?

16:29.920 --> 16:32.000
And for people listening,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.280
so Sarah identifies as a physicist

16:35.280 --> 16:37.760
and Lee identifies as a chemist.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.160
Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature in general.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.520
But, so what is life?

16:46.480 --> 16:47.040
Yeah.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.920
I love asking that question because it's so absurdly big.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.800
I know, I love it.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.200
So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.600
And I like to say all three of them

17:01.600 --> 17:03.840
because people latch on to different facets of them.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.960
And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on

17:06.960 --> 17:08.240
is not to try to define life,

17:08.240 --> 17:10.000
but to try to find a more fundamental theory

17:10.000 --> 17:12.320
that explains what the phenomena we call life.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.000
And then it should explain certain attributes.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.840
And you end up having a really different framing

17:15.840 --> 17:17.200
than the way people usually talk.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.360
So the way I talk about it, three different ways.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.840
Life is how information structures matter across space and time.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.360
Life is, I don't know, this one's from you.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.000
Actually, simple machines constructing more complex machines.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.480
And the other one is the physics of existence, so to speak,

17:36.480 --> 17:39.600
which is life is the mechanism the universe has

17:39.600 --> 17:41.280
to explore the space of what's possible.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.200
That's my favorite.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.640
So can I add on to that?

17:46.640 --> 17:48.160
Okay, can you say the physics one again?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.960
Physics of existence.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.160
Yeah, the physics of existence.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.280
I don't know what to call it.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.600
You know, if you think of all the things that could exist,

17:55.600 --> 17:57.120
only certain things do exist.

17:57.120 --> 18:01.200
And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism

18:01.200 --> 18:04.160
of bringing things into physically existing in the moment now.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.400
And what's another one?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.680
We were debating this the other day.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.360
So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it,

18:14.240 --> 18:16.000
that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.240
Because this is where physicists really go wrong.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.920
They think of a universe with nothing in it.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.400
They can't.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.800
The non-existence is really hard to think of.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.520
Non-existent, yeah.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.520
And then you think of a universe with everything in it.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.920
That's really hard.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.160
And you just have this white blob, right?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.440
This is everything.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.560
But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe beyond,

18:34.560 --> 18:35.200
say, planets.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.480
So you've got star, space, planet stuff, right?

18:38.480 --> 18:39.280
The boring stuff.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.040
Well, I would define life or say that life is where

18:44.480 --> 18:47.120
there are architectures, any architectures,

18:47.120 --> 18:50.960
and we should stop fixating on what is building

18:50.960 --> 18:52.160
the architectures to start with.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.200
And the fact that the universe has discrete things

18:55.200 --> 18:57.200
and it is completely mind-blowing.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.240
If you think about it for one second,

19:00.880 --> 19:02.880
the fact there's any objects at all,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.680
and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy

19:07.680 --> 19:10.480
for a machine that built it.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.160
Some information being moved around,

19:14.800 --> 19:17.840
actuation, sensing, getting resource,

19:18.640 --> 19:20.080
and building these objects.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.480
So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.520
But I'm like, forget the machine.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.560
Let's see the objects.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.520
And I think in a way that assembly theory,

19:30.160 --> 19:33.360
we realized maybe a few months ago that assembly theory

19:33.360 --> 19:36.160
actually does account for the soul in the objects,

19:36.160 --> 19:37.760
not mystically like, say,

19:37.760 --> 19:41.520
Sheldrecht's morphic resonance or Leibniz's monodology

19:41.520 --> 19:42.800
seeing souls in things.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.600
But when you see an object, and I've said this before,

19:45.600 --> 19:48.160
but this object is evidence of thought,

19:49.120 --> 19:51.200
and then there's a lineage of those objects.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.280
So I think what is fascinating is that you put it much more

19:55.280 --> 19:58.400
elegantly, but the barrier between life and non-life

19:58.400 --> 20:00.880
is accruing enough memories to then actuate.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.720
What that means is there are contingency,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.640
there are things that happen in the universe get trapped.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.440
These memories then have a causal effect on the future.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.400
And then when you get those concentrated in a machine,

20:12.400 --> 20:15.040
and you're actually able in real time, able to integrate

20:16.160 --> 20:19.760
the past, the present, with the future, and do stuff,

20:19.760 --> 20:21.280
that's when you are most alive.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.760
You being the machine.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.400
Yes.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.200
Wait a minute.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.560
Why is the object, so one of the ways to define life,

20:29.200 --> 20:33.280
that Sarah said, is simple machines creating complex machines.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.280
So there's a million questions there.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.560
So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?

20:41.120 --> 20:41.840
By mutation.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.160
So this is what we were talking about at the beginning,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.080
is you have a minimum replicator, so a molecule.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.600
So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah

20:47.600 --> 20:49.680
of the mechanism get there years ago, I think,

20:49.680 --> 20:51.280
but then you've been building on it and saying,

20:52.480 --> 20:54.880
you have a molecule that can copy itself,

20:55.680 --> 20:58.240
but then there has to be some variability,

20:58.240 --> 21:00.240
otherwise it's not going to get more functional.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.080
So you need to add bits on.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.560
So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,

21:04.560 --> 21:07.120
but then it can add bits on, and that can be copied as well,

21:07.120 --> 21:09.680
and those add-ons can give you additional function

21:12.400 --> 21:15.040
to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.

21:15.680 --> 21:20.240
So existence is weird, but the fact that there is existence

21:20.240 --> 21:21.120
is why there is life.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.400
And that's why I realized a few days ago that there must be,

21:24.400 --> 21:26.480
that's why alien life must be everywhere,

21:27.200 --> 21:28.720
because there is existence.

21:28.720 --> 21:33.680
Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.880
So how can you keep injecting more complex things?

21:38.880 --> 21:41.760
Doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be

21:42.560 --> 21:47.280
as or more powerful than the things it creates?

21:48.320 --> 21:50.800
So how can you get complexity from simplicity?

21:51.760 --> 21:54.880
So the way you get complexity from simplicity

21:54.880 --> 21:57.520
is that you, I'm just making this up,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.840
but this is kind of my notion that you have a large volume of stuff.

22:00.400 --> 22:05.600
So you're able to get seeds if you like random cues from the environment.

22:05.600 --> 22:09.760
So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape,

22:09.760 --> 22:10.960
ones and zeros, whatever.

22:11.760 --> 22:17.680
And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.600
But it has a low assembliness,

22:19.600 --> 22:21.280
but even though it has a high assembly number,

22:21.280 --> 22:22.480
we can talk about that.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.640
But then when you start to then integrate that all

22:24.640 --> 22:27.120
into a smaller volume as over time,

22:28.640 --> 22:32.320
and you become more autonomous, you then make the transition.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.720
I don't know what you think about that.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.800
I think the easiest way to think about it is actually,

22:38.800 --> 22:40.000
which I know is a concept you hate,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.520
but I also hate it, which is entropy,

22:41.520 --> 22:43.200
but people are more familiar with entropy

22:43.200 --> 22:44.720
than what we talk about in assembly theory.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.360
And also the idea that, like say physics as we know it,

22:50.080 --> 22:52.720
involves objects that don't exist across time,

22:52.720 --> 22:54.560
or as we would say low memory objects.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.400
So one of the key distinctions that is-

22:58.400 --> 22:59.680
Low memory objects.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.160
Yeah.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.040
So physics is all-

23:01.040 --> 23:03.440
Well, physicists are low memory objects.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.000
Quick clip.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
But physicists are creators of low memory objects

23:08.000 --> 23:10.160
or manipulators of low memory objects.

23:10.160 --> 23:10.640
Absolutely.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.600
That's a very nice way.

23:13.200 --> 23:13.840
Okay, sorry, I got it.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.480
Yeah, I know, sorry.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.360
Sorry to interrupt you.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.720
No, no, no, it's fine.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.360
I like it too.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.000
It's very funny.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.320
But I think it's a good way of phrasing it,

23:20.320 --> 23:22.000
because I think this kind of idea

23:22.000 --> 23:23.360
we have in assembly theory is that,

23:24.640 --> 23:26.240
you know, physics as we know it

23:26.240 --> 23:28.240
has basically removed time as being

23:28.240 --> 23:31.360
a physical observable of an object.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.520
And the argument I would make is that

23:33.520 --> 23:35.280
when you look at things like water bottles or us,

23:36.080 --> 23:38.240
we're actually things that exist

23:38.240 --> 23:40.880
that have a large extent in time.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.400
So we actually have a physical size in time,

23:44.400 --> 23:46.320
and we measure that with something

23:46.320 --> 23:49.440
called the assembly index in molecules,

23:49.440 --> 23:51.360
but presumably everyone should have

23:51.360 --> 23:54.880
sort of a, do you want to explain what assembly?

23:54.880 --> 23:56.320
Yeah, let's, you know what?

23:56.320 --> 23:59.520
Let's step back and start at the beginning.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.960
What is assembly theory?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.080
Please send me some slides.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.880
There's a big sexy paper coming out,

24:04.880 --> 24:07.360
probably, maybe, I don't know.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.320
We've not finished it.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.440
Almost, almost finished it.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.520
That's also a summary of science.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.720
We're almost done.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.040
Yes.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.320
Well, no, no, we're almost done.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.880
I think we're, we are ready to start

24:18.880 --> 24:21.120
an interesting discussion with our peers.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.160
You're at the machine that created the object,

24:24.160 --> 24:26.080
and we'll see what the object takes us.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.480
All right, so what is assembly theory?

24:29.040 --> 24:30.720
Yeah, well, I think the easiest way

24:30.720 --> 24:31.600
for people to understand it

24:31.600 --> 24:34.960
is to think about assembly in molecules,

24:34.960 --> 24:36.480
although the theory is very general.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.080
It doesn't just apply to molecules.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.360
And this was really leased in sight,

24:39.360 --> 24:41.440
so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it, but.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.280
I'll mark you.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.320
Okay, all right.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.120
I'm ready, I'm ready.

24:45.120 --> 24:45.520
I'm ready.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.600
You can tell me where I get the check mark minus, but.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.480
It's your theory as well.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.360
Yeah, I know.

24:49.360 --> 24:53.200
But imagine a molecule, and then you can, you know,

24:53.200 --> 24:55.680
break the molecule apart into elementary building blocks.

24:55.680 --> 24:56.960
They happen to be bonds.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.480
And then you can think of all the ways

24:58.480 --> 24:59.680
for molecular assembly theory.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.720
You can think of all the ways

25:00.720 --> 25:02.240
of building up the original molecules.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.880
So there's all these paths that you can assemble it,

25:04.880 --> 25:06.640
and the sort of rules or assemblies

25:06.640 --> 25:08.720
you can use pieces that have been generated already.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.360
So it has this kind of recursive property to it.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.440
And so that's where kind of memory

25:13.440 --> 25:15.040
comes into assembly theory.

25:15.040 --> 25:18.640
And then the assembly index is the shortest path

25:18.720 --> 25:19.280
in that space.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.680
So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history

25:21.680 --> 25:23.200
that the universe has to undergo

25:23.200 --> 25:25.440
in order to assemble that particular object.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.200
And the reason that this is significant

25:27.200 --> 25:29.200
is we figured out how to measure that

25:30.480 --> 25:33.200
with a mass spec in the lab.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.800
And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps

25:36.800 --> 25:39.120
was sufficiently large, it would indicate

25:39.120 --> 25:41.600
that you required a machine or a system that had information

25:41.600 --> 25:43.280
about how to assemble that specific object

25:43.280 --> 25:45.040
because the combinatorial space of possibilities

25:45.040 --> 25:47.200
is getting exponentially large

25:47.200 --> 25:48.960
as the assembly index is increasing.

25:48.960 --> 25:51.520
So just sorry to interrupt, but so that means

25:51.520 --> 25:54.480
there's a sufficiently high assembly index

25:55.760 --> 26:00.480
that if observed in an object is an indicator

26:00.480 --> 26:04.240
that something lifelike created it,

26:04.240 --> 26:06.240
or is the object itself lifelike?

26:07.360 --> 26:07.680
Both.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.920
But you might want to make the distinction

26:09.920 --> 26:11.840
that a water bottle is not life,

26:12.480 --> 26:14.560
but it would still be a signature

26:14.560 --> 26:15.920
that you were in that domain of physics.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.600
And I might be alive.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.000
So there will be potentially a lot of arguments

26:22.000 --> 26:25.280
about where the line at which assembly index

26:26.800 --> 26:28.800
does interesting stuff start to happen.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.480
The point is we can make all the arguments,

26:30.480 --> 26:32.160
but it should be experimentally observable.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.080
And Lee can talk more about that part of it.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.920
But the point I want to make about it

26:35.920 --> 26:39.040
is there was always this intuition that I had

26:39.040 --> 26:41.200
that there should be some complexity threshold

26:41.200 --> 26:43.920
in the universe above which you would start to say

26:43.920 --> 26:46.880
whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.920
And I think about it a little bit,

26:47.920 --> 26:49.280
like we have Planck's constant,

26:50.320 --> 26:52.320
and we have the fine structure constant.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.560
And then this sort of assembly threshold

26:54.560 --> 26:59.760
is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.000
It might depend on specific features of the system,

27:02.880 --> 27:04.480
which we debate about sometimes.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.680
But then when you're past that,

27:07.680 --> 27:09.920
you have to have some other explanation

27:09.920 --> 27:11.520
than the current explanations we have in physics

27:11.520 --> 27:12.720
because now you're in high memory.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.320
The things actually require time for them to exist,

27:18.320 --> 27:19.840
and time becomes a physical variable.

27:19.840 --> 27:23.600
So the path to the creation of the object is the memory.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.960
So you need to consider that.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.800
Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.120
So when I think of all the things in this room,

27:34.400 --> 27:37.360
we see the projection of them as a water bottle,

27:37.360 --> 27:39.760
but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph

27:39.760 --> 27:41.680
of all the ways the universe can create this thing.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.280
That's what it is as an object.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.520
And we're all interacting a causal graph.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.360
And most of the creativity in the biosphere

27:47.360 --> 27:49.920
is because a lot of the objects that exist now

27:49.920 --> 27:52.480
are huge in their structure across time,

27:52.480 --> 27:54.240
four billion years of evolution to get to us.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.600
Is it possible to look at me and infer the history

27:59.600 --> 28:02.800
that led to me as a human?

28:02.800 --> 28:04.880
You as an individual might be hard.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.400
You as a representative of a population

28:08.400 --> 28:10.080
of objects that have high assembly

28:10.080 --> 28:12.160
with similar causal history and structure

28:12.160 --> 28:14.560
that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,

28:14.560 --> 28:15.680
you can infer a lot probably.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.880
Yeah, also with them.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.240
Which we do genomically even.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.880
I mean, it's not like we have a lot of information in us.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.360
We can reconstruct histories from assembly

28:23.360 --> 28:24.480
saying something slightly deeper.

28:24.480 --> 28:25.440
Yeah, one thing to add.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.800
I mean, it's not just about the object,

28:26.800 --> 28:28.000
but the objects that occur.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.160
And not just objects with a high assembly number,

28:30.160 --> 28:32.000
because you can have random things

28:32.000 --> 28:32.960
that have a high assembly number,

28:32.960 --> 28:36.320
they must be a number of identical copies.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.720
So you know you're getting away from the random,

28:38.720 --> 28:40.000
because you could take a snapshot.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.760
This is why I hate entropy.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.240
I love entropy when used correctly.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.160
But it's about the problem of entropy.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.680
You have to have a labeler.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.560
And so you can label the beginning and the end

28:50.560 --> 28:51.520
to start on the finish.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.760
You know, what you can do in assembly is say,

28:53.760 --> 28:56.400
oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.160
They all have these features.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.200
And then you can infer.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.760
And one of the things that we debated a lot,

29:01.760 --> 29:02.880
particularly during lockdown,

29:02.880 --> 29:04.800
because I almost went insane trying to crush

29:04.800 --> 29:06.800
the produce the assembly equations.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.400
So we came up with the assembly equation.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.920
I had, just imagine this.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.960
So you have this string where, oh,

29:13.760 --> 29:15.920
actually it makes me sick trying to remember it.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.480
It was so, it did my head in for a long time.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.280
It's dramatic.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.880
Yeah, because I couldn't,

29:21.600 --> 29:23.840
so if you just have a string of say words,

29:23.840 --> 29:26.960
say, you know, series of words, series of letters.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.840
So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.480
And you find that object and you just have four A's,

29:32.480 --> 29:34.560
four B's, four C's, four D's together.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.360
Boom.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.920
Then, and that you measured that.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
So you physically measured that string of letters.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.080
Then what you could do is you can infer

29:42.800 --> 29:46.560
subgraphs of maybe the four A's, the four B's,

29:46.560 --> 29:47.600
the four C's and the four C's,

29:47.600 --> 29:49.920
but you don't see them in the real world.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.280
You just infer them.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.760
And I really got stuck with that

29:53.760 --> 29:55.600
because there's a problem to try and work out

29:55.600 --> 29:56.960
what's the difference between a long,

29:57.600 --> 30:01.280
you know, physical object and the assembly space of the objects

30:01.280 --> 30:05.200
so that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.080
So although we can't infer your entire history,

30:08.080 --> 30:10.320
we know at some point the four A's were made,

30:10.320 --> 30:12.480
the four B's were made, the four C's were made,

30:12.480 --> 30:15.440
and four D's were made, and they all got added together.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
And that's one really interesting thing

30:17.440 --> 30:18.960
that's come out of the theory.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.600
But the killer, when we knew we were going beyond

30:24.080 --> 30:26.240
beyond standard complexity theories,

30:26.240 --> 30:29.840
it was incredibly successful is that we realized

30:29.840 --> 30:32.800
we could start to measure these things for real across domains.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.560
So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property

30:36.560 --> 30:40.320
of all stuff that you can break into components,

30:41.600 --> 30:42.880
particularly molecules are good

30:42.880 --> 30:45.600
because you can break them up into smaller molecules,

30:45.600 --> 30:46.400
into atoms.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.760
The challenge will be making that more general

30:49.760 --> 30:50.560
across all the domains,

30:50.560 --> 30:51.680
but we're working on it right now

30:51.680 --> 30:52.880
and I think the theory will do that.

30:52.880 --> 30:57.280
So components, domains, so you're talking about basically

30:57.280 --> 30:59.520
measuring the complexity of an object

31:00.160 --> 31:03.120
in what, biology, chemistry, physics,

31:03.120 --> 31:04.400
that's what you mean by domains.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.720
Complexity of tests,

31:06.720 --> 31:10.160
sociology, computers, complexity of memes, you know.

31:10.160 --> 31:10.960
Memes, yep.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.200
What is that, ideas?

31:13.200 --> 31:15.120
Yeah, I mean, so one of them.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.960
Ideas are objects in the assembly theory though.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.920
Yeah, they are.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.880
They're physical things,

31:18.880 --> 31:20.320
they're just features of the causal graph.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.080
I mean, the fact I can talk to you right now

31:22.080 --> 31:24.560
is because we're exchanging structure of our assembly space.

31:24.880 --> 31:33.200
So conversation is the exchanging structures in assembly space.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.320
What is assembly space?

31:35.040 --> 31:36.720
When I started working on Origins of Life,

31:36.720 --> 31:39.600
I was writing about something called top-down causation,

31:39.600 --> 31:42.160
which a lot of philosophers are interested in

31:42.160 --> 31:44.000
and people that worry about the mind-body problem.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.280
But the whole idea is, if we have the microscopic world of physics

31:49.840 --> 31:50.960
is causally complete,

31:50.960 --> 31:53.360
it seems like there's no room for higher-level causes.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.480
Our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.

31:56.480 --> 32:01.440
And that seems problematic when you get to studying life and mind

32:01.440 --> 32:04.400
because it does seem that quote-unquote emergent properties

32:04.400 --> 32:05.360
do matter to matter.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.120
And then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation

32:11.120 --> 32:13.040
where information looks like it's disembodied.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.320
So we talk about information,

32:14.320 --> 32:16.240
like it can just move from any physical system

32:16.240 --> 32:17.680
to any other physical system.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.960
And it doesn't require,

32:20.400 --> 32:22.720
like you don't have to specify anything about the substrate

32:22.720 --> 32:24.240
to talk about information.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.440
And then there's also the way we talk about mathematics

32:27.440 --> 32:31.200
is also disembodied, like the platonic world of forms.

32:31.200 --> 32:35.040
And I think all of those things are hinging

32:35.040 --> 32:37.200
that we really don't know how to think about abstractions

32:37.200 --> 32:38.240
as physical things.

32:39.760 --> 32:44.000
And really, I think what Assembly Theory is pointing to

32:44.000 --> 32:46.320
is what we're missing there is the dimension of time.

32:47.040 --> 32:50.640
And if you actually look at an object being extended across time,

32:51.440 --> 32:54.320
what we call information and the things that look abstract

32:54.320 --> 32:57.440
are things that are entangled in the histories of those objects.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.000
They're features of the overlapping assembly space.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.360
So they look abstract because they're not part of the current structure,

33:05.360 --> 33:07.520
but they're part of the structure if you thought about it

33:07.520 --> 33:09.920
as like the philosophical concept of a hyper object,

33:09.920 --> 33:13.120
an object that's too big in time for us to actually resolve.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.920
And so I think information is physical.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.760
It's just physical in time, not in space.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.320
Too hyper object, too difficult for us to resolve.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.440
So we're supposed to think about of life

33:26.160 --> 33:28.240
as this thing that stretches through time

33:28.240 --> 33:30.960
and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.480
And then you're trying to measure something

33:34.480 --> 33:36.880
with the assembly index about properties of that.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.480
The assembly index is the ordering,

33:40.160 --> 33:41.840
you could think of it as like a partial ordering

33:41.840 --> 33:43.120
of all the things that can happen.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.880
So in thermodynamics, we coarse-grain things

33:46.880 --> 33:48.160
by temperature and pressure.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.560
In assembly theory, we coarse-grain

33:50.560 --> 33:53.280
by the number of copies of an object and the assembly index,

33:53.280 --> 33:56.240
which is basically, if you think of the space of all possible things,

33:56.240 --> 33:58.400
it's like a depth of how far you've gone into that space

33:58.400 --> 34:00.480
and how much time was required to get there.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.240
In the shortest possible version.

34:02.240 --> 34:02.960
The shortest possible version.

34:02.960 --> 34:07.520
Not average, because can't you just 3D print?

34:07.520 --> 34:09.200
You're going to kill me with that question.

34:09.200 --> 34:13.440
Oh, not 3D, can't you always 3D print the thing?

34:13.440 --> 34:14.960
That's like cabin in the heart.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.640
No, because I had such fights.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.520
So Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper at the moment.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.120
And I think we kind of share the, at the beginning,

34:23.120 --> 34:24.080
you were like, no, that's not right.

34:24.080 --> 34:24.800
Oh, yes, right.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.160
And we're doing this for a bit.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.760
And then the problem is when you build a theory

34:27.760 --> 34:31.600
and build the intuition, there's some certain features, right?

34:31.600 --> 34:35.200
Of the theory that almost felt like I was being religious about,

34:35.200 --> 34:36.960
say, right, you have to do this.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.320
A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.

34:40.320 --> 34:44.320
And Sarah's postdoc Daniel and my postdoc, Abhishek,

34:44.400 --> 34:45.760
and they were both brilliant.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.560
They're brilliant.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.360
But they were like, no, we don't, we don't buy that.

34:49.360 --> 34:53.440
And I was like, it is, they were like, well, Lee, actually,

34:54.240 --> 34:56.560
I thought you're the first to say that, you know, you can't,

34:56.560 --> 34:58.000
if you can't explain it, it doesn't,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.160
and you can't do an experiment that doesn't exist.

35:00.160 --> 35:00.800
And that saved me.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.280
And I said to Abhishek, Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow,

35:03.280 --> 35:06.080
Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.880
I was like, I have the experimental data.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.960
So when I basically take the molecules

35:10.960 --> 35:12.640
and chop them up in the mass spec,

35:12.720 --> 35:14.400
the assembly number is never the average.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.680
It's always the shortest.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.800
It's an intrinsic property.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.960
And then the penny drop for Abhishek said, okay,

35:18.960 --> 35:22.640
because I had these things that we had to believe to start with

35:22.640 --> 35:23.200
or to trust.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.640
And then we've done the math and it comes out

35:24.640 --> 35:26.560
and they now have the shortest path.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.120
Actually, it's up that explains why the shortest path.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.440
Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.640
The shortest path needs you to identify

35:34.640 --> 35:38.000
when the universe is basically got a memory, not an average.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.520
So what you want to be able to do is to say,

35:40.240 --> 35:43.680
what is the minimum number of features

35:43.680 --> 35:45.440
that I want to be able to see in the universe?

35:45.440 --> 35:48.240
When I find those features, I know the universe

35:48.240 --> 35:52.560
has had a coherent memory and is basically alive.

35:53.440 --> 35:56.880
And so that gives you the lower bound.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.440
So that's like, of course, there's going to be other paths.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.040
We can be more ridiculous, right?

36:01.040 --> 36:03.360
We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.000
So probabilistically, at the beginning,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.560
because assembly theory was built as a measure

36:08.560 --> 36:11.120
for biosignatures, I needed to go there.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.600
And then I realized it was intrinsic.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.600
And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic

36:15.600 --> 36:16.800
and these hyperobjects were coming.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.200
And we were kind of fusing that notions together.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.760
And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy

36:23.760 --> 36:26.960
and I have enough resources, I might not take the shortest path.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.920
I might go a bit longer.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.840
I might take a really long path

36:29.840 --> 36:33.040
because it allows me then to do something else.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.440
So what you do is, let's say I've got two different objects,

36:36.000 --> 36:40.240
A and B, and they both have different shortest paths to get them.

36:40.240 --> 36:43.040
But then if you want to make A and B together,

36:43.760 --> 36:44.720
they will have a compromise.

36:44.720 --> 36:48.480
So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,

36:48.480 --> 36:52.160
but actually it's the shortest way you can make both A and B

36:52.160 --> 36:54.640
with a minimum amount of resource in time.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.720
So suddenly you then layer these things up.

36:56.720 --> 36:59.680
And so the average becomes not important,

36:59.680 --> 37:03.600
but as you literally overlap those sets,

37:03.600 --> 37:05.280
you get a new shortest path.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.120
And so what we realized time and time again

37:07.120 --> 37:10.080
when we're doing the math, the shortest path is intrinsic,

37:10.080 --> 37:14.160
is fundamental, and is measurable, which is kind of mind-blowing.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.280
So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients,

37:17.280 --> 37:20.960
maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients could be

37:20.960 --> 37:23.760
and how many steps, when you say shortest path,

37:23.760 --> 37:28.320
how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients

37:28.320 --> 37:30.800
into the final meal.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.720
So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.120
For a pie, an apple pie.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.480
An apple pie, that's right.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.240
And the pizza and a pie together.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.040
For a scratch.

37:41.040 --> 37:41.680
Yeah.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.960
So there's a lot of ways.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.880
There's the shortest way, and you take the full spectrum of ways,

37:48.880 --> 37:55.200
and there's probably an average duration for a noob to make an apple pie.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.240
Is the average interesting still?

37:58.240 --> 38:02.960
If you measure the average length of the path to assemble a thing,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.960
does that tell you something about the way nature usually does it?

38:08.720 --> 38:13.840
Versus something fundamental about the object,

38:13.840 --> 38:16.400
which I think is what you're aiming at with the assembly index.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.360
Yeah. I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.040
The minimum path gives you the lower bounds,

38:21.040 --> 38:22.240
so you know you're detecting something,

38:22.240 --> 38:24.000
you know you're inferring something.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.080
The average tells you about really how the objects are existing

38:28.080 --> 38:30.160
in the ecosystem or the technology.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.800
And there has to be more paths explored,

38:34.800 --> 38:39.920
because then you can happen upon other memories,

38:39.920 --> 38:41.360
and then condense them down.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.400
I'm not making too much sense,

38:42.400 --> 38:44.640
but if you look at, say, let's just say,

38:44.640 --> 38:47.200
I mean, maybe we're going to get to alien civilizations later, right?

38:47.200 --> 38:51.040
But I would argue very strongly that alien civilization A

38:51.040 --> 38:55.520
and alien civilization B, they're different assembly spaces.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.040
So they're kind of going to be a bit messed up

38:57.040 --> 38:58.960
if they happen to come one another.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.160
Only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,

39:02.160 --> 39:04.160
because if aliens come to us and we,

39:04.160 --> 39:06.560
they don't share any of the causal graph we've shared,

39:06.560 --> 39:08.400
but hopefully they share the periodic table

39:09.200 --> 39:11.280
and some other and bonds and things,

39:11.280 --> 39:13.920
so we're going to have to really think about the language

39:13.920 --> 39:16.720
to talk to us aliens by inferring,

39:16.720 --> 39:21.600
by using assembly theory to infer their language,

39:21.600 --> 39:23.120
their technology, and other bits and bobs.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.000
And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.440
All right, so all aliens in the causality graphs

39:29.440 --> 39:32.160
have a common ancestor in the-

39:32.160 --> 39:33.840
If the building blocks are the same,

39:33.840 --> 39:35.600
which means they live in the same universe as us.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.240
So in this-

39:36.240 --> 39:38.400
It depends on how far back in time you go, though.

39:38.400 --> 39:42.000
But the universe has all the same building blocks.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.640
Yeah.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.320
And we have to assume that.

39:45.760 --> 39:52.960
So there's not different classes of causality graphs, right?

39:52.960 --> 39:53.440
No.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.640
The universe doesn't just say,

39:55.440 --> 39:59.360
here, you get the red causality graph and you get the blue one.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.640
These basic ingredients and they're geographically constrained

40:02.640 --> 40:05.440
or constrained in space or time or something like that.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
They're constrained in time because only by the virtue of the fact that

40:11.280 --> 40:14.480
you need enough time to have passed for some things to exist.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.040
So the universe has to be big enough in time for some things.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.680
So just a one point on the shortest path versus the average path,

40:19.680 --> 40:22.800
which I think we'll get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.120
It's like the minimal compression is the shortest path

40:25.120 --> 40:26.480
for the universe to produce that.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.840
But it's also like the first time in the ordering of events

40:29.840 --> 40:31.520
that you might expect to see that object.

40:32.400 --> 40:38.000
But the average path tells you something about the actual steps

40:38.000 --> 40:40.880
that were realized and that becomes an emergent property

40:40.880 --> 40:43.600
of that object's interaction with other objects.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.440
So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.680
It's a feature of the interactions with other things.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.840
And so one of the nice features of assembly

40:49.840 --> 40:51.200
is you basically gotten rid of-

40:51.200 --> 40:52.640
you just look at the things that exist

40:52.640 --> 40:55.600
and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms for constructing them

40:55.600 --> 40:57.280
in some sense, like the machines or not,

40:59.280 --> 41:02.560
as important in the current construction of the theory,

41:02.560 --> 41:06.240
although I would like to bridge it to some ideas about constructors.

41:07.920 --> 41:12.400
But then you could only communicate with things as Lee was saying

41:12.400 --> 41:14.960
if you have some overlap in the past history.

41:14.960 --> 41:18.640
So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap,

41:18.640 --> 41:20.320
then there would be no means of communication.

41:21.200 --> 41:25.200
But as we progress further and further in time

41:25.200 --> 41:26.720
and more things become possible

41:26.720 --> 41:29.360
because the assembly spaces are larger-

41:29.360 --> 41:32.640
because you can have a larger assembly space in terms of index

41:32.640 --> 41:34.080
and also just the size of the space

41:34.080 --> 41:35.280
because it's exponentially growing,

41:36.240 --> 41:38.160
then more things can happen in the future.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.920
And the example I like to give is actually

41:40.480 --> 41:42.960
when we made first contact with gravitational waves

41:43.680 --> 41:47.120
because that's an alien phenomena that's been permeating our plate,

41:47.120 --> 41:48.640
not alien in life phenomena,

41:48.640 --> 41:51.840
but alien like something we had never knew existed.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.760
It's been, you know, like we're, you know,

41:53.760 --> 41:56.160
there's gravitational waves rippling through this room right now.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.800
But we had to advance to the level of Einstein writing down

42:01.840 --> 42:05.760
his theory of relativity and then 100 years of technological development

42:05.760 --> 42:07.760
to even quote-unquote see that phenomena.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.440
So the, okay, to see that phenomena,

42:12.080 --> 42:15.920
our causal graph have to start intersecting.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.840
Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first,

42:17.840 --> 42:18.880
the abstraction, right?

42:18.880 --> 42:20.480
And then we had to build the technology

42:20.480 --> 42:23.600
that could actually observe features of that abstraction.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.760
So the nice promising thing is

42:25.760 --> 42:27.440
over time the graph can grow,

42:27.440 --> 42:29.440
so we can start overlapping eventually.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.760
Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph is

42:31.760 --> 42:32.800
there was an event, you know,

42:32.800 --> 42:35.760
1.4 billion years away of a black hole merger

42:35.760 --> 42:38.400
that we detected on our detector.

42:38.400 --> 42:41.440
And, you know, now suddenly we're connected

42:41.440 --> 42:42.880
through this communication channel

42:42.880 --> 42:44.960
with this distant event in our universe

42:45.040 --> 42:47.920
that, you know, if you think about 1.4 billion years ago

42:47.920 --> 42:49.200
what was happening on this planet

42:49.200 --> 42:50.720
or even further back in time,

42:51.920 --> 42:53.760
that, you know, there is common physics

42:53.760 --> 42:54.960
underlying all those events,

42:54.960 --> 42:56.880
but even for those two events to communicate with them.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.720
Oh, I understand what you were going on about the other week.

42:58.720 --> 43:01.280
Yeah, I'm sorry, this is a really abstract example, but,

43:02.320 --> 43:03.040
but it's sort of-

43:03.040 --> 43:04.560
Your causal graphs are not overlapping.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.800
Yeah, so, well, let's just say

43:06.800 --> 43:09.520
now our causal graphs are overlapping in the deep past.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.680
No, I like it, so you made it-

43:11.680 --> 43:12.320
I totally missed it.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.280
Oh, all of the 1.6 billion.

43:13.280 --> 43:13.680
Yeah.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.640
You made a connection with it.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.440
No, I do like that.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.440
You know, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.320
This is good.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.120
Because I was-

43:19.120 --> 43:21.920
And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.680
Oh, I get it now.

43:25.040 --> 43:25.760
No, it's all right.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.200
The joke came two minutes ago.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.560
Our flow on the uptake here.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.560
I wasn't able to comprehend what you were talking about

43:30.560 --> 43:32.720
when saying the channel communicating to the past,

43:32.720 --> 43:33.600
but what you're saying is

43:34.640 --> 43:39.200
we were able to infer what happened 1.4 billion years ago.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.600
We detected the gravity wave.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.120
I mean, I think it's amazing that, you know,

43:43.120 --> 43:44.480
at that time we weren't even-

43:44.480 --> 43:46.240
We were just becoming multicellular, right?

43:46.720 --> 43:48.320
It's like insane.

43:48.320 --> 43:51.760
And then we progressed the multicellularity

43:51.760 --> 43:55.280
through to technology and built the detector,

43:55.280 --> 43:58.000
and then we just extrapolate backwards.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.080
So although we didn't do anything back to the graph back in time,

44:02.080 --> 44:04.400
we understood there's existence then overlapped going forward.

44:04.400 --> 44:04.800
And that-

44:04.800 --> 44:06.560
Well, that's because our graphs are larger.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.040
Yeah, but that means that has a consequence.

44:09.040 --> 44:12.880
One of the things I was trying to say is I think

44:13.680 --> 44:16.800
I don't know, Sarah might be, she can correct me, information first.

44:16.800 --> 44:19.520
And I'm an object first kind of guy.

44:19.520 --> 44:21.680
So I mean, as things that get constructed,

44:21.680 --> 44:25.200
there has to be this transition in random constructions.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.200
So when the construct,

44:27.200 --> 44:29.920
the object that's being constructed by the process

44:30.720 --> 44:31.840
bakes in that memory,

44:31.840 --> 44:34.640
and those memories then add on and add on and add on.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.520
So as it becomes more competent,

44:37.520 --> 44:39.920
and life is about taking those memories

44:39.920 --> 44:42.160
and compressing them, increasing their autonomy.

44:42.880 --> 44:47.040
And so I think that like the cell that we have in biology on Earth

44:47.040 --> 44:48.080
is our way of doing that,

44:48.080 --> 44:52.400
that really the maximum ability to take memories and to act on the future.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.160
Oh, I think that's mathematics.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.320
No, mathematics doesn't exist.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.360
No, but that's the point.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.760
The point is that abstractions do exist.

45:01.760 --> 45:03.040
They're real physical things.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.600
We call them abstractions.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.640
But the point about mathematics that I think is-

45:08.720 --> 45:10.640
So I don't disagree.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.640
I think you're object first and I'm information first,

45:12.640 --> 45:15.120
but I think I'm only information first

45:15.120 --> 45:17.360
in the sense that I think the thing that we need to explain

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
is what abstractions are and what they are as physical things.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.680
Because of all of human history,

45:23.680 --> 45:27.920
we've thought that there were these properties that are disembodied,

45:27.920 --> 45:29.520
exist outside of the universe.

45:29.520 --> 45:32.400
And really, they do exist in the universe,

45:32.400 --> 45:34.800
and we just don't understand what their physics is.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.720
So I think mathematics is a really good example.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.280
We do theoretical physics with math,

45:39.280 --> 45:41.920
but imagine doing physics of math,

45:42.480 --> 45:44.720
and then thinking about math as a physical object.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.240
And math is super interesting.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.640
I think this is why we think it describes reality so well,

45:48.640 --> 45:50.800
because it's the most copyable kind of information.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.080
It retains its properties when you move it between physical media,

45:54.080 --> 45:56.160
which means that it's very deep.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.040
And so it seems to describe the universe really well,

45:59.040 --> 46:01.920
but it probably is because it's information that's very deep in our past.

46:01.920 --> 46:06.400
And it's just we invented a way of communicating it

46:06.400 --> 46:07.760
very effectively between us.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.120
Isn't math more fundamental?

46:11.120 --> 46:13.280
Isn't the assembly of the graph,

46:13.280 --> 46:15.200
isn't basically, I'm going to say,

46:15.200 --> 46:16.160
I sound completely boring.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.280
It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.

46:19.920 --> 46:20.720
It has to be.

46:20.720 --> 46:20.960
Okay.

46:23.760 --> 46:28.880
So what is math exactly?

46:28.960 --> 46:33.360
It's a nice simplification,

46:34.880 --> 46:38.000
a simple description of what?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.480
So we have a computer scientist, a physicist, and a chemist here.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.000
Walking to a bar.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.680
I think the chemist is going to define math,

46:43.680 --> 46:44.880
and you guys can correct me.

46:45.520 --> 46:46.080
Go for it.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.160
Let's lay in honestly.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.000
We're ready.

46:50.800 --> 46:57.280
I think the ability to label objects and place them into classes

46:57.280 --> 46:59.680
and then do operations on the objects is what math is.

47:00.960 --> 47:06.240
So on that point, what does it mean to be object first versus information first?

47:06.880 --> 47:09.520
So what's the difference between object and information

47:09.520 --> 47:11.920
when you get to that low fundamental level?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.920
Well, I might change my view.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.600
So I'm stuff first, the stuff.

47:16.400 --> 47:20.560
And then when stuff becomes objects, it has to invent information.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.720
And then the information acts on more stuff and becomes more objects.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.960
So I think there is a transition to information.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.440
That occurs when you go from stuff to object.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.560
Just mean time though.

47:30.560 --> 47:30.960
Yeah.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.440
Information is emergent.

47:33.440 --> 47:34.400
Not emergent.

47:34.400 --> 47:39.520
Information is actionable memories from the universe.

47:40.320 --> 47:43.760
So when memories become actionable, that's information.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.600
But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.

47:48.240 --> 47:48.480
Yeah.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.680
And then it's not information.

47:49.680 --> 47:49.920
Great.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.240
And actionable is what you can create.

47:52.240 --> 47:52.960
You can use it.

47:53.600 --> 47:55.680
If you can't use it, then it's not information.

47:55.680 --> 47:59.280
If you can't transmit it, if it doesn't have any causal consequence.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.400
It falls in the forest.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.600
I don't understand.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.880
Why is that not information?

48:03.440 --> 48:04.320
It's not information.

48:04.320 --> 48:07.200
It's stuff.

48:07.200 --> 48:10.160
It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.600
Yeah, yeah, we can.

48:11.600 --> 48:12.000
This is cool.

48:12.000 --> 48:12.800
It's happening.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.200
No, no.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.120
The happening requires information.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.800
No, no, no, no.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.240
Stuff is always happening.

48:18.240 --> 48:18.720
No.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.680
This is where the physicists and the mathematicians get themselves in a loop

48:21.680 --> 48:23.600
because I think the universe, I mean,

48:24.560 --> 48:29.200
I think, say, Max Teckmark and is very playful and say like the universe,

48:29.200 --> 48:30.080
universe is just math.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.280
Well, the universe is just math.

48:31.280 --> 48:34.000
Then we might as well not bother having any conversation

48:34.000 --> 48:35.040
because the conversation will be written.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.160
We just might as well go to the future and say,

48:36.160 --> 48:37.520
can you just give us the conversations?

48:37.520 --> 48:38.640
It's happened already.

48:38.640 --> 48:43.520
So I think the problem is that mathematicians are so successful at labeling stuff

48:43.520 --> 48:46.240
and so successful understanding of stuff through those labels.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.440
They forget that actually those labels had to emerge

48:49.440 --> 48:52.880
and that information had to be built on those memories.

48:52.880 --> 48:56.560
So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph,

48:56.560 --> 48:59.600
when they become actionable and the graph can loop back on itself

48:59.600 --> 49:02.160
or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,

49:02.800 --> 49:05.840
those memories become actionable and therefore their information.

49:05.840 --> 49:09.760
And I think you just changed my mind on something pretty big,

49:09.760 --> 49:11.520
but I don't have a pen so I can't write.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.400
I'm going to write it down later.

49:12.400 --> 49:18.000
But roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs of objects of stuff.

49:18.640 --> 49:21.520
They have memories and then when they intersect

49:22.320 --> 49:24.400
and then they can act on each other,

49:24.400 --> 49:26.880
that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then,

49:27.440 --> 49:29.200
so then you can then abstract.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.240
So when one graph can then build another graph and say,

49:32.240 --> 49:34.720
hey, you don't have to go through the nonsense we had to go through.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.080
Here's literally the way to do it.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.680
Stuff always comes first,

49:37.680 --> 49:39.360
but then when stuff builds the abstraction,

49:39.360 --> 49:41.600
the abstraction can be then teleported onto other stuff.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.840
And the abstraction is the looping back power.

49:44.960 --> 49:45.600
Okay.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.680
Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.880
Yeah, so first a God made stuff.

49:52.240 --> 49:56.320
And after that, when you start to be able to form abstractions,

49:56.320 --> 49:56.880
that's when the-

49:56.880 --> 49:59.520
God is the memory the universe can remember.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.320
God is the memory the universe can remember.

50:02.880 --> 50:03.760
Otherwise there's no-

50:03.760 --> 50:06.320
I'm just deciphering that statement hundreds of years from now.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.760
What the hell does that mean?

50:07.760 --> 50:09.200
What does that mean by this?

50:09.200 --> 50:12.480
Hey, look, don't diss my one-liners.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.080
No, no, I wasn't dissing it.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.560
It took me 15 seconds to come up with that.

50:16.560 --> 50:17.600
I don't know what it means.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.240
What does it mean?

50:18.560 --> 50:21.760
Okay, wait, we need to-

50:21.760 --> 50:22.960
Well, how do we get onto this?

50:24.400 --> 50:30.560
We were time causality mathematics.

50:30.560 --> 50:34.160
So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff,

50:35.760 --> 50:41.840
objects, memory, and information?

50:42.800 --> 50:44.880
Is, what is that, is mathematics?

50:44.880 --> 50:46.880
It's the most efficient labeling scheme

50:46.880 --> 50:49.040
that you can apply to lots of different graphs.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.320
Well, the labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.280
Can I try?

50:53.280 --> 50:54.560
Yep, sure, please.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.640
Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?

50:56.640 --> 50:57.280
I'm shocked.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.120
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

50:59.120 --> 50:59.920
But it's correct.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.000
Go ahead, sorry.

51:02.000 --> 51:02.640
Excellent.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.320
No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right?

51:06.320 --> 51:08.480
Because we can't not be us.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.160
Like, we're stuck in the shells we are,

51:10.160 --> 51:11.360
and we're trying to observe the world.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.680
And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.

51:13.680 --> 51:16.080
And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful

51:16.080 --> 51:18.960
is to try to imagine, if you were outside of us

51:18.960 --> 51:22.240
looking at us as physical systems using mathematics,

51:22.240 --> 51:24.800
what would be the specific features you associate

51:24.800 --> 51:28.720
to the property of understanding mathematics

51:28.720 --> 51:32.000
and being able to implement it in the universe, right?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.240
And when you do that,

51:34.240 --> 51:36.800
mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties

51:36.800 --> 51:39.040
relative to other kinds of abstraction

51:39.040 --> 51:42.240
we might talk about, like language or artistic expression.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.040
One of those properties is the one I mentioned already

51:45.040 --> 51:48.000
that is really easy to copy between physical media.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.240
So if I give you a mathematical statement,

51:50.240 --> 51:51.840
you almost immediately know what I mean.

51:51.840 --> 51:53.920
If I tell you the sky is blue, you might say,

51:53.920 --> 51:54.800
is it gold ball blue?

51:54.800 --> 51:55.520
Is it your blue?

51:55.520 --> 51:56.720
What color blue do you mean?

51:56.720 --> 52:00.160
And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.840
So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it

52:01.840 --> 52:03.360
when it's copied between physical systems.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.440
It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.080
And then the second one is it retains its property

52:10.080 --> 52:13.760
of actually what it can do in the universe when it's copied.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.000
So the example I like to give there

52:16.000 --> 52:18.160
is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.000
It's actually, it's a compressed regularity

52:22.000 --> 52:25.360
of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe.

52:25.360 --> 52:28.560
But then that information actually is a causal in a sense

52:28.560 --> 52:30.400
that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do

52:30.400 --> 52:31.840
without that particular knowledge

52:31.840 --> 52:33.280
and that particular abstraction.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.040
And in this case, like launch satellites to space

52:35.040 --> 52:36.640
or send people to Mars or whatever it is.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.800
So if you look at us from the outside

52:40.800 --> 52:42.640
and you say, what is it for physical systems

52:42.640 --> 52:44.720
to invent a thing called mathematics?

52:44.720 --> 52:51.200
And then to use and then it to become a physical observable,

52:51.200 --> 52:53.680
mathematics is kind of like the universally

52:53.680 --> 52:58.320
copyable information that allows new possibility spaces

52:58.320 --> 52:59.200
to be opened in the future

52:59.200 --> 53:01.280
because it allows this kind of ability

53:01.280 --> 53:02.960
to map one physical system to another

53:02.960 --> 53:05.600
and actually understand the general principles.

53:05.600 --> 53:10.480
So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then?

53:10.480 --> 53:10.560
Yes.

53:10.560 --> 53:11.440
By mapping.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.000
Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is

53:14.000 --> 53:15.920
in terms of the physical theory of assembly

53:15.920 --> 53:18.080
would be some feature of the structure

53:18.080 --> 53:20.560
of the assembly spaces of causal graphs

53:20.560 --> 53:22.080
and their relationship to each other.

53:22.080 --> 53:24.560
So for example, and I mean,

53:24.560 --> 53:26.080
this is things that we're going to have to work out

53:26.080 --> 53:27.040
over the next few years.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.680
I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory here.

53:30.800 --> 53:34.400
But as is usual, diving off the deep end.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.920
But I would expect that we would be able to come up

53:37.920 --> 53:40.640
with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems

53:40.640 --> 53:43.920
can communicate with each other, like language?

53:43.920 --> 53:45.600
Language is basically because

53:45.600 --> 53:47.120
we're objects extended over time

53:47.120 --> 53:49.760
and some of the history of that assembly space

53:49.760 --> 53:50.960
actually overlaps.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.080
And when we communicate,

53:52.080 --> 53:53.680
it's because we actually have shared structure

53:53.680 --> 53:54.880
in our causal history.

53:54.880 --> 53:56.400
Let me have another quick go at this, right?

53:56.400 --> 53:57.360
So I think we all agree.

53:57.360 --> 54:01.360
So I think we take mathematics for granted

54:01.360 --> 54:02.800
because we've gone through this chain, right?

54:02.800 --> 54:06.320
Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?

54:06.320 --> 54:07.600
And we can, well, we share,

54:07.600 --> 54:10.480
so we have languages that we can make interoperable.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.880
And so whether you're speaking, I don't know,

54:14.880 --> 54:17.440
all the different dialects of Chinese,

54:17.440 --> 54:20.720
all the different dialects of English at French, German,

54:20.720 --> 54:22.640
whatever, you can interconvert them.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.240
The interesting thing about mathematics now

54:24.240 --> 54:26.480
is that everybody on planet Earth, every human being

54:26.480 --> 54:29.760
and computers share that common language.

54:29.760 --> 54:33.280
That language was constructed by a process in time.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.360
So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math

54:35.360 --> 54:39.040
is those right from the, you know, mathematics didn't occur,

54:39.120 --> 54:43.440
didn't exist before life, abstraction was invented by life,

54:43.440 --> 54:44.000
right?

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable

54:46.000 --> 54:47.200
of mathematical things.

54:47.200 --> 54:47.840
Wait, wait a minute.

54:47.840 --> 54:50.640
Can we just ask that, that old famous question,

54:50.640 --> 54:52.640
is math invented or discovered?

54:52.640 --> 54:56.320
So when you say assembly invented or whatever,

54:57.680 --> 54:58.800
you, it means it's just-

54:58.800 --> 54:59.280
Well, if someone makes this for an assembly,

54:59.280 --> 55:00.640
it's a mathematical theory, but sorry.

55:01.440 --> 55:01.840
Right.

55:01.840 --> 55:02.320
Are we arguing?

55:02.320 --> 55:02.960
Exactly.

55:02.960 --> 55:03.760
Are we arguing now?

55:03.760 --> 55:04.960
That's what it sounds like.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.880
Are we discovering mathematics?

55:06.880 --> 55:07.360
No.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.400
Well, yes and no.

55:08.480 --> 55:09.520
I would say-

55:09.520 --> 55:11.280
And you call mathematics a language.

55:11.840 --> 55:11.920
I would say that-

55:11.920 --> 55:12.960
So it's developing.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.360
Look, I'm pretty sure that there are some very common seeds

55:17.360 --> 55:19.120
of mathematics in the universe, right?

55:19.680 --> 55:23.040
But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now

55:23.840 --> 55:26.400
is not discovered, it's invented.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.040
And but even though, I think there's two terms,

55:29.040 --> 55:31.920
are very triggering and I don't think they're necessarily useful

55:31.920 --> 55:35.120
because I think that what people do, the mathematicians that say,

55:35.120 --> 55:39.520
oh, mathematics was discovered because they live in a universe

55:39.520 --> 55:41.600
where there is no time and it just all exists.

55:42.400 --> 55:46.080
But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way you can create,

55:46.080 --> 55:49.280
let's say I'm going to go and create and make a piece of art.

55:51.280 --> 55:55.120
Did I make that piece of art or did I discover it?

55:55.920 --> 55:57.360
Like inventing the airplane.

55:57.360 --> 55:58.560
Did I invent the airplane?

55:58.560 --> 55:59.440
Let's stick with the airplane.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.160
The airplane is a good one.

56:00.160 --> 56:03.040
I, let's say I'm, did I discover the airplane?

56:03.040 --> 56:04.720
Well, in a way, the universe discovered the airplane

56:04.720 --> 56:06.160
because it's just chucked a load of atoms together

56:06.160 --> 56:08.800
and a load of random human beings want to do stuff and they,

56:08.800 --> 56:12.080
we, we discovered the airplane in the space of possibilities.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.280
But here's the thing.

56:13.280 --> 56:19.440
When the space of possibilities is so vast, infinite almost,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.960
and you're able to actualize one of those in an object,

56:22.960 --> 56:24.480
then you are inventing it.

56:24.480 --> 56:27.760
So in mathematics, because there are infinite number of theorems,

56:27.760 --> 56:29.280
the fact you're actually pulling,

56:29.280 --> 56:32.880
there's no difference between inventing a mathematical structure

56:32.880 --> 56:34.160
and inventing the airplane.

56:34.160 --> 56:35.280
They're the same thing.

56:35.280 --> 56:38.400
But that doesn't mean that now the airplane exists in the universe.

56:38.400 --> 56:41.120
It's something weird about the universe that, you know,

56:41.120 --> 56:44.800
so I think that the more, this is the thing that you probably,

56:44.800 --> 56:50.240
the more memory required for the object, the more invented it is.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.080
So when a mathematical theorem has a,

56:52.800 --> 56:56.640
has a, needs more bytes to store it, the more invented it is,

56:56.640 --> 56:59.360
and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.000
But everything then is invented.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.600
It's just more or less invented.

57:03.680 --> 57:04.320
Absolutely.

57:04.960 --> 57:07.200
The universe has to generate everything as it goes.

57:07.760 --> 57:08.000
Yeah.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.960
And it wasn't there in the beginning.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.720
And the way we're thinking it,

57:12.720 --> 57:14.960
when you're thinking about the difference between invented and

57:14.960 --> 57:17.760
discovered is because we're throwing away all the memory.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.400
Yeah.

57:18.400 --> 57:21.440
So if you start to think in terms of causality and time,

57:22.160 --> 57:23.680
then those things become the same.

57:23.680 --> 57:24.640
Everything is invented.

57:25.840 --> 57:28.160
And the idea is to make everything intrinsic to the universe.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.560
So I think one of the features of assembly theory

57:30.560 --> 57:32.400
is we don't want to have external observers.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.560
There's been this long tradition in physics of trying to describe

57:34.560 --> 57:36.320
the universe from the outside and not the inside.

57:37.440 --> 57:40.000
And the universe has to generate everything itself

57:40.000 --> 57:40.960
if you do it from the inside.

57:40.960 --> 57:44.240
Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.

57:46.400 --> 57:49.760
They'll take you 15 seconds to say that and do it to come up with that also.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.200
No, I've thought about that before.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.560
Okay, good line.

57:53.520 --> 57:54.800
Are you making fun again?

57:54.800 --> 57:55.760
No, I'm not making fun.

57:55.760 --> 57:56.400
I'm having fun.

57:56.400 --> 57:57.200
There's a difference.

57:57.200 --> 57:57.840
Oh, that's good.

57:57.840 --> 57:58.880
All right, I'm you.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.840
She's inventing fun.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.120
I'm not all intimidated.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.800
And there's a causal history to that fun.

58:06.160 --> 58:09.600
You mentioned that there's no way to communicate with aliens

58:09.600 --> 58:12.400
until there's overlap in the causal graph.

58:14.080 --> 58:17.440
Communication includes being able to see them.

58:18.560 --> 58:21.600
And like what are we, this is the question is,

58:23.680 --> 58:26.240
is communication any kind of detection?

58:26.240 --> 58:29.680
And if so, what do aliens look like

58:29.680 --> 58:32.960
as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?

58:32.960 --> 58:38.000
You're assuming, let's assume that so when you see them and they see you,

58:38.960 --> 58:40.640
you're assuming they have vision,

58:40.640 --> 58:43.760
they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time,

58:43.760 --> 58:45.680
there's a lot of assumptions we're making.

58:45.680 --> 58:46.400
What detection?

58:46.400 --> 58:47.440
All right, let's step back.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.120
So yes, okay, you're right.

58:49.120 --> 58:52.080
So when in the English language, when we say the word C,

58:52.080 --> 58:54.720
we mean visually, they show up to a party and it's like,

58:54.720 --> 58:56.160
oh, wow, that's an alien.

58:56.160 --> 58:56.880
That's visual.

58:56.880 --> 58:57.680
That's 3D.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.040
That's okay.

58:59.840 --> 59:05.520
And that's also assuming spatial scale of something that's visible to you.

59:05.520 --> 59:08.240
So it can't be microscopic or it can't be so big

59:08.240 --> 59:10.720
that you don't even realize that's an entity.

59:10.720 --> 59:10.960
Okay.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.000
But other kinds of detection too.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.600
I would make it more abstract and go down.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.400
I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite

59:18.400 --> 59:22.960
the Arecibo message in assembly theory and also to abandon binary.

59:22.960 --> 59:26.080
Because I don't think aliens necessarily, why should they have binary?

59:27.040 --> 59:32.080
Well, they have some basic elements with which to do information exchange.

59:32.720 --> 59:37.040
Well, let's make it more fundamental or more universal.

59:37.040 --> 59:40.080
So we need to think about what is the universal way of making a memory

59:40.080 --> 59:42.400
and then we should re-encode Arecibo in that way.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.600
What's more basic than 0's and 1's?

59:45.600 --> 59:48.800
Well, it's really difficult to get out of that causal chain because we're so...

59:48.800 --> 59:51.600
So let's raise the idea of 0 for a moment.

59:51.600 --> 59:54.320
It took human beings a long time to come up with the idea of 0.

59:54.880 --> 59:55.920
Now you've got the idea of 0.

59:55.920 --> 59:56.720
You can't throw it away.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.360
It's so useful.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.040
To discover the idea of 0.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.000
To discover or invent.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.360
I don't know.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.320
But it took a long time so it was invented.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:04.880
That's right.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.120
Yeah.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.960
I think 0 was invented.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.680
It's exactly.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.160
So it's not given that aliens know what 0 is.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.440
It's a massive assumption.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.000
It's a useful discovery.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You're saying if you break the causal chain,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.400
there might be some other more efficient way of representing...

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.920
That's why I want to meet him and ask him for a shortcut.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.600
But you won't be able to ask him until...

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.840
So I interrupted you and I think you're making good point.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.960
I was just going to say, well look.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.000
Thank you.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.400
Sorry.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:34.880
Rather than saying...

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.600
Please internet.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.600
Tweet at him for the rude interruptions.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.240
Oh, go ahead.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:38.800
I'm sorry.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.440
No, it's okay.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.200
Maybe it's change.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.400
How do we say...

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.840
I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.720
I would like to know.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.000
What is the full spectrum of what aliens might look like to us?

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.200
Now that we've laid this all on the table of like,

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.520
all right, so there has to be some overlap

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.880
and this causal chain that led to them.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.520
What are we looking for?

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.880
What do you think we should be looking for?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.400
So you mentioned mass spec measuring certain objects

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.440
that aliens could create or are aliens themselves.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.440
We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.240
or maybe what the hell is the basic object

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.880
we're trying to measure the assembly index of?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.840
Let's cut ourselves a break.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.440
Let's assume that they're metabolized.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.680
They've got an energy source and there are a size

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.800
that we can recognize.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.000
Let's give our cut ourselves a break

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.240
because there could be aliens that are so big

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.920
we won't recognize we're seeing them.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.200
There might be aliens that are so small

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.800
we don't yet have the ability to...

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.920
We don't have microscopes that can see far enough away

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.200
that just won't be able to see them.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.320
So what's a good range?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.760
So let's just make a range...

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.400
Let's just be very anthropocentric and say

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.320
we're going to look for aliens roughly our size

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.760
and technology our size

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.240
because we know it's possible on Earth, right?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.280
I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be to find exoplanets

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.480
that in the same zone as Earth in terms of heat and stuff

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.240
and then say, hey, if there's that same kind of gravity,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.120
same kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.880
that the alien life there might use

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.640
a similar kind of physical infrastructure and then we're good.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.440
So then your question becomes really relevant.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.840
Say, right, let's use vision, sound, touch.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.800
So okay, that's really nice.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.960
So if there's a lot of aliens out there,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.400
there's a good likelihood if you match to the planet

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.960
that they're going to be in the same spatial and temporal...

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.320
Operating in the same spatial temporal domain as humans.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:46.320
Okay, within that, what did they look like?

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.800
Visually, what do they sound like?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.640
What are they?

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.000
Oh, God, this sounds creepy.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.760
Tastes like, what are they?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.320
Oh, smell like, smell like that.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.440
It sounds like our clubhouse.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.200
We was like, can we have sex of aliens?

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.640
Which was basically me saying...

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.520
Passionate, passionate love.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.640
But it wasn't actually about sex.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.800
It was about, is our chemistry compatible, right?

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.280
Is there some...

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.840
Yeah, can we...

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.720
Yeah, are they edible too?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.840
They could be very edible.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.040
They could be delicious.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.560
That's why I want to see some aliens, right?

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.000
Because I think, are there...

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.280
I think evolution...

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.440
I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.280
Because why generate memory?

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.840
Why generate storage, the need for storage space

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.960
when you can use symmetry?

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.480
So, and symmetry is quite, maybe quite effective

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.960
in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.000
So maybe you could be reasonable to assume

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.960
that aliens could have...

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.680
They could be bipedal.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.440
They could be symmetric in the same way.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.960
Might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.240
I mean, we can make them.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.960
Perhaps there's this whole zoo of different aliens out there

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.640
and we'll never get to be able to classify

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.560
some of the weird aliens we can't interact with

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.720
because they have made such weird stuff.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.040
But we are just going to look at...

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040
We're going to find aliens that look most like us.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:03:59.520
Why not?

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.240
Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:02.720
Yeah.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.440
Yeah.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.920
But I think it's really hard to imagine

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.280
what the space of aliens is because the space is huge.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.520
Because one of the arguments that you can make

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.200
about wildlife emerges in chemistry

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.400
is because chemistry is the first scale

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.600
in terms of building up objects from elementary objects.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280
That the number of possible things that could exist

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.000
is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once, right?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.200
So imagine you have two planets

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.840
and they're cooking some geochemistry.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.720
Our planet invented one kind of biochemistry.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.960
And presumably as you start building up

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.800
the complexity of the molecules,

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.200
the chances of the overlap in those trajectories,

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.760
those causal chains being built up is probably very low.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.600
And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.960
along its evolutionary path.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.840
So I think it's very difficult to imagine predicting

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.680
the technologies that aliens are going to have.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.760
I mean, you're looking at basically planets

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.520
have kind of convergent chemistry,

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.720
but there's some variability.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.640
And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.400
into the possibility space for chemistry.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.360
So do you think it would detect the technology,

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.480
the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.240
Possibly.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.400
So when you're talking about measuring assembly index,

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.480
don't you think we would detect the garbage first?

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.600
Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations,

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.880
isn't this going to be trash?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.920
I think I would come back to Arecibo.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.320
The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.360
built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.560
How's Arecibo spelled?

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.960
A-R-E-C-I-B-O.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.320
Yes, thank you.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.920
And there we go, they got out there.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.760
That's the telescope that sent the message

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.480
that you're talking about.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.440
So that message was sent where?

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.720
It was beamed at a star, a specific star,

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.960
and it was sent out many years ago.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.440
And what they did,

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.120
so this is why I was pushing on binary,

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.160
is a binary message.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.840
I think it's a semi-prime length number of characters.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.840
So I think 27E3 by 23, I think.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.520
And it basically represents human bit,

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.920
proton, binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.000
And it's really cool.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.280
But I'm just wondering if it could be done

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.640
not making any, because it made assumptions

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.000
that aliens speak binary.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.160
Why make that assumption?

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.480
Why not just assume that if the difference

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.480
between physics, chemistry, and biology

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.760
is the amount of memory that's recordable

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.800
by the substrates, then surely the universal thing,

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.720
I'm going to make some sacrilegious statement

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.320
which I think is pretty awesome for people to argue with.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.080
So this is, we're looking at an image

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.040
where it's the entirety of the message encoded in binary.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.080
And then there's probably interpretation

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.680
of different parts of that image.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.840
There's a person, there's green parts.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.520
It looks like for people just listening

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.520
like a game of Tetris.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.600
Encoding in minimal ways, a bunch of cool information probably.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.640
Representing all of us.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.800
So at the top, it's kind of teaching yourself to count

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.920
and then it all goes all the way down,

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.680
teaching you chemistry and then just says,

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.920
but it makes so many assumptions.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.920
And I think if we can actually,

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.120
still look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.400
in expressing this, but I'll have a go

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.760
and you can correct it if you want.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.800
Which is like, one of the things that Sarah

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.360
has had a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of life.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.520
And this is one of the reasons why we're working together,

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.080
because we don't really care about the origin of life.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.520
We want to make life, make aliens and find aliens,

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.800
make aliens, find aliens.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.640
I think we might have to make aliens in the lab

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.720
before we find aliens in the universe, right?

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.480
I think that would be a cool way to do it.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.160
So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.520
Well, it's selection through assembly theory,

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.520
creating memories, because when you create memories,

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.960
you can then command your domain,

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.240
you can basically do stuff.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.680
You can command matter.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.800
So we need to find a way by understanding

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.920
what life is of how the minimal way to command matter,

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.520
how that would emerge in the universe.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.840
And if we want to communicate,

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.480
I mean, maybe we don't want to necessarily uniformly communicate.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.200
What I would do, perhaps, if I had,

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.000
is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.920
to have this magic way of communicating with aliens,

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.440
get them quite far away from Earth, plausibly deniable,

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.520
and then send out the message

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.120
that would then attract all the aliens,

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.440
and then basically work out if they're a friend or foe,

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.400
and how will they want to hang out?

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.960
The message is being something that has to do with the memories.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.680
Yes.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.640
Like the assembly version of our SIBO,

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.240
so that everyone in the universe

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.160
that has been understands what life is.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.120
So aliens need to work out what they are.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.720
Once they've worked out what they are,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.040
they then can work out how to encode what they are,

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.560
and then they can go out and send messages.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.160
It's like the universal Rosetta Stone

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.760
for life in the universe is working out

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.800
how the memories are built.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.720
I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well,

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.240
whether that, you would agree with that?

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.080
No, I wanted to raise a different point,

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.360
which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens yet

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.960
because we haven't gotten the technology.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.000
And presumably, we think assembly theory

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.040
is the right way of doing it,

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.400
but I don't think that we know how to go

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.920
from the kind of data you're describing,

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.200
Lex, like, you know, visual data or smell

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.440
to construct the assembly spaces yet.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.600
And in some ways, I think that the problem

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.400
of life detection really is the same problem

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.240
at the foundations of AI,

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.960
that we don't understand how to get machines

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.640
to see causal graphs, to see reality in terms of causation.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.240
And so I think assembly and AI

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.320
are going to intersect in interesting ways, hopefully.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.000
But the sort of key point,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.560
and I've been trying to make this argument more recently,

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.800
I might write an essay on it,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.040
is, you know, people talk about the great filter,

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.440
right, and which is, again, this like doomsday thing

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.720
that, you know, people want to say,

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.680
there's no aliens out there

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.040
because something terrible happened to them.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.760
And it matters whether that's in our past or our future,

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.320
as to the longevity of our species, presumably,

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.920
which is why people find it interesting.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.640
But I think it's not a physical filter.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.840
It's not like things go extinct.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.560
I think it's literally,

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.160
we don't have the technology to see them.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.880
And you could see that with microscopes.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.560
I mean, we didn't know there were microbes on this table

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.600
for our tables for thousands of years or telescopes.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.360
Like, there's so much of the universe we can't see.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.600
And then, basically, what we have done as a species

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.120
is outsource our physical perceptions to technology,

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.800
building microscopes based on our eyes,

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.360
you know, and building size monitors

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.800
based on our sense of feelings,

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.160
like feel earthquakes and things.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.000
And AI is basically, we're trying to outsource

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.480
what's actually happening in our thinking apparatus

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.200
into machines now, into technological devices.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.960
And maybe that's the key technology

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.040
that's going to allow us to see things like us

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.640
and see the universe in a totally different way.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.160
But you kind of mentioned the great filter.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.240
Do you think there's a way through technology

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.920
to stop being able to see stuff?

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.680
So can you take a step backwards?

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.400
I think so, yeah.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.560
Did you imply that with the great, so like...

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.040
Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.360
in the sense that a example of life

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360
evolving on a planet over billions of years

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.880
has to acquire a certain amount of knowledge and technology

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.480
to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.720
Well, that's the sense I have is,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.080
I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.200
there's this kind of idea that we have most of the tools

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.200
already to hear the signal.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.680
But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.640
to see the signal.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:32.800
No, we don't have what we're doing.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.600
Yeah, I agree.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.680
That's the biggest, like, to hear.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.760
We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:37.920
Yeah.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.080
Aliens are everywhere.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:40.960
We just don't have the...

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.440
Exactly.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.800
Yeah, well, oh, that's...

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.160
I mean, I got this in part, actually,

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.080
because you were like, you know, last time I was here,

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.360
I was like, look at the carpet.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.040
You know, could it, like, if you had an alien detector,

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.480
would the carpet be aliens?

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.680
I mean, I think we really don't.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.440
It would be, but the aliens would nevertheless

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.600
have a high assembly index or produce things

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.560
of a high assembly index.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.880
And those things of a high assembly index,

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.040
you have to have a detector that can recognize

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.120
high assembly index in all its forms.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah, yes.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:10.800
That's it, that's it.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.680
Take data, construct assembly space.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.200
Yeah, those patterns, basically.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.440
So one way to think about high assembly index

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.440
is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.680
I can give you an example, because, I mean,

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.440
in molecules, we've been talking about in objects,

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.960
but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.320
Like, imagine you're just, like, I always get bothered

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.280
by the fact that, like, when you look at birds flocking,

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.360
you can describe that with, like, a simple boys model,

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.800
or, like, you know, people use spin glass

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.000
to describe animal behavior,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
and those are, like, really simple physics models.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.640
Yet you're looking at a system that you know has agency,

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.720
and there's intelligence in those birds.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.840
And I, and basically, like, you can't help but think

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.240
there must be some statistical signatures of the fact that

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.680
they're, that's a group of agents versus, you know,

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.080
like, I don't know, you know, the physics example,

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.560
maybe, like, I don't know, brownie emotion or something.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.040
And so what we're trying to do is actually apply

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040
assembly to trajectory data to try to say

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.760
there's a minimal amount of causal history

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.800
to build up certain trajectories for observed agents

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.560
that's, like, an agency detector for behavior.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.200
Do you think it's possible to do some, like,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.600
like, Boids or those kinds of things, like, artificial,

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.880
like, cellular automata play with those ideas

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.240
with assembly, with assembly theory?

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.880
Have you found any useful, really simple,

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.280
mathematical, like, simulation tools

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.920
that allow you to play with these concepts?

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.800
So, like, one, of course, you're doing mass spec

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.280
in this physical space with chemistry,

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.640
but it just seems, well, I mean, computer science person,

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.640
maybe, it seems easier to just-

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.440
I agree with you.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:53.280
And sexier in terms of tweeting visual information

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.080
on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly, to play,

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.040
like, here's an organism of a low assembly index

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.600
and here's an organism of a high assembly index

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.160
and let's watch them create more and more memories

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.200
and more and more complex objects.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.840
And so, like, in mathematics, you get to observe

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.240
what that looks like, to build up an intuition

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.680
what assembly index is like.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.760
We are building a toolkit right now,

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.960
so I think it's a really good idea.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.000
But what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.080
with the infrastructure required.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.880
And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.720
in mathematics, when human beings,

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.760
when human being, we take a lot of the infrastructure

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.960
for granted.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.040
And I think we have to strip that back a bit

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:35.760
for going forward.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.720
But you're absolutely right.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.400
I would agree that I think the fact that we exist

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.200
in the universe, this is like, I can see that

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.960
lots of people would disagree with this statement,

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.320
but I don't think Sarah will, but I don't know.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320
The fact that objects exist,

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.640
I don't think anyone on Earth will disagree

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.120
that objects can exist elsewhere, right?

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.720
But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.280
But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition,

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.840
the universe's ability to acquire memory

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.200
is the very first step for building life.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.000
And that must be, that's so easy to happen.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.480
So therefore alien life is everywhere,

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.000
because all alien life is,

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.000
is those memories being compressed and minimized

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.160
and the alien equivalent of the cell working.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.680
So I think that we will build new technologies

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.640
to find aliens.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.160
But we need to understand what we are first

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.120
and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.960
The most interesting thing, as you're saying,

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.080
to take these two organisms,

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.880
different assemblies, there's one you get into biology.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.840
Biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.720
Physics is probably, chemistry is less weird,

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.080
because the rules of chemistry are small

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.880
and the rules of biology.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.760
And then going away to physics where you have a very

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.520
nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.760
And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.640
And so once we get there,

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.200
my dream is that we are just going to be able to suddenly are,

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.480
I mean, I'm, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.520
I'm not mean to be arrogant.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.000
It's just, again, I've got this hammer called assembly

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.280
and everything's a nail.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.280
But I think that once we crack it,

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.640
we'll be able to use assembly theory

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.640
plus telescopes to find aliens.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.680
Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.080
on the number of aliens that are out there?

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.000
Do actually, yeah.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.400
Well.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.520
And what they look like.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.120
So any of the things we've been talking about,

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.000
is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.520
wisdom through nuanced disagreement.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.840
Yeah, I don't, I don't wholly disagree,

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.560
but I think, but I do think I disagree.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.480
It's kind of, there's nuance there.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:51.760
But, but we need to-

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.720
You can disagree.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.360
No, that's fine.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.600
It is nuanced, right?

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.760
So you made the point earlier that you think,

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.040
you know, once we discover what alien light,

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.200
what life is, we'll see alien life everywhere.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.240
And I think I agree on some levels in the sense

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.040
that I think the physics that governs us is universal.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.200
But I don't know how far I would go to say,

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.800
to say that we're a likely phenomena,

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.840
because we don't understand all of the features

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.600
of the transition at the origin of life,

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.600
which we would just say in assembly,

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.800
as you go from the no memory physics to,

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.840
there's like a critical transition around the assembly index

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.520
where assembliness starts to increase.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.120
And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.720
and complexification of the biosphere.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.440
So there's a principle of increasing assembliness,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.120
where that goes back to what I was saying at the very beginning

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.720
about the physics of the possible,

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.440
that the universe basically gets in this mode

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.560
of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.880
Now, how often that transition happens,

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.040
that you get the kind of cascading effect

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.400
that we get in our biosphere,

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.000
I think we don't know, if we did,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
we would know the likelihood of life in the universe.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.600
And a lot of people want to say life is common,

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.040
but I don't think that we can say that yet,

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.400
so we have the empirical data,

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.840
which I think you would agree with.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.040
But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have,

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.160
which I don't like, but I did have it,

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.320
which is, if life emerges on one planet,

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.920
and you get this real high density of things

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.200
that can exist on that planet,

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.400
is it sort of dominating the density of creation

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.000
that the universe can actually generate?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.520
So like if you're thinking about counting,

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.360
entropy, right?

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.760
Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it,

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.840
and then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle,

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.960
it's not entropy.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.880
But the idea is that now transformations among stuff

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.080
or the actual physical histories of things

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.600
now become things that you have to count

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.000
as far as saying that these things exist

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.920
and we're increasing the number of things that exist.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.440
And if you think about that cosmologically,

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.600
maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.800
of the whole universe, I don't know.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.600
How's that, can you explain that a little bit?

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.440
Why can anyone geographical region suck up

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.040
the creative capacity of the universe?

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.160
Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.440
I don't actually agree with it,

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.320
but it was just a thought experiment.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.920
I love that you can have thoughts

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.880
that you don't like and don't agree with,

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.960
but you have to think through them anyway.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.280
Yeah.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.920
The human mind is fascinating.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.840
Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual thought experiments

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.520
are really good when you're trying to build new theories

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.840
because you have to think through all the consequences.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.600
And there are people that want to try to account for, say,

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.200
the degrees of freedom on our planet

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.920
in cosmological inventories of talking

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.600
about the entropy of the universe

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.640
and when we're thinking about cosmological era of time

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.440
and things like that.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.360
Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.080
as they stand now,

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.160
but assembly would give you a way of counting it.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.280
And then the question is,

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.680
if there's a certain maximal capacity

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.000
of the universe's speed of generating stuff,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.360
which Lee always has this argument

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.520
that assembly is about time,

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.200
the universe is generating more states.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.880
Really, what it's generating is more assembly possibilities.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.000
And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.240
that the universe is accelerating its expansion

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.000
because that makes more physical space.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.280
And what's happening on our planet

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.600
is it's accelerating in the expansion

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.120
of possible things that exist.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.040
And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.280
of what it can do to generate things.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.040
And then if there is a maximal rate,

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.440
maybe only a certain number of planets can actually do that

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.080
or there's a trade-off about the piece of growth

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.440
on certain planets versus others.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.120
I have a million questions there.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.800
Do you have thoughts on what you're saying?

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.440
Just a quick, yeah.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.160
I'll just say something very quick.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.960
It's a thought experiment.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.440
No, that's good.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.160
I think I get it.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:24.880
I think I get it.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.800
So what I want to say is,

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.960
when I mean aliens everywhere,

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:36.080
I mean memories are the prerequisite for aliens

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.960
via selection and then concentration of selection

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.320
when selection becomes autonomous.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.840
So what I would love to do

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.160
is to build, say, a magical telescope

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:44.960
that was a memory...

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.520
A magical one.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.160
A magical one.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:46.800
A magical one.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.000
Sorry, a real one.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.800
There will be a memory detector to see selection.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.200
So you could get to exoplanets

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.320
and say that exoplanet looks like

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320
there's lots of selection going on there.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.640
Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.080
So what I'm trying to say is narrow down

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.760
the regions of space where you say

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.840
there's definitely evidence of memory

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.280
as high assembly there,

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.040
or not high assembly because that would be life,

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.120
but where it's capable of happening.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.400
And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.680
I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to cells

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.880
and all the other things.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.160
I think you're right.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.360
But I think that we just need to get more data.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.800
Well, I didn't like the thought experiment

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.920
because I don't like the idea

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.600
that if the universe has a maximal limit

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600
on the amount it can generate per unit time,

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.320
that our existence is actually precluding the existence of other things.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:32.960
Well, I'll just say one thing.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.160
But I think that's probably true anyway

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.520
because of the resource limitations.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.360
So I don't like your thought experiment

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.400
because I think it's wrong.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.000
Well, no, no.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.360
I do like the thought experiment.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.320
So what you're trying to say is like,

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.080
there is a chain of events that goes back

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.520
that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.840
And you're not saying that life isn't possible

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.880
where else where you say that

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.400
there has been these number of things,

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.600
contingent things that have happened

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.520
that have allowed life to merge here.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.240
That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere,

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.400
but you're saying that the intersection of events

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.320
may be concentrated here.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.240
Not exactly.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.800
It's more like if you look at, say,

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.160
the causal graphs are fundamental,

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.000
maybe space is an emergent property,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.560
which is consistent with some proposals in quantum gravity,

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.480
but also how we talk about things in assembly theory,

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.680
then the universe is causal graphs generating

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.080
more structure in causal graphs.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.080
So this is how the universe is unfolding.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.000
And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.240
Like there's only so much stuff that gets made

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.560
per update of the universe.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.320
And then if there's a lot of stuff being made

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.400
in a particular region that happens

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.880
to look the same locally, spatially,

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.200
that's an after effect of the fact

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.960
that the whole causal graph is updating.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.200
Yeah, I don't know that.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.880
I think that doesn't work.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.840
I don't think it works either,

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.600
but I don't have a good argument in my mind about.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.840
But I do like the idea of the capacity of the universe

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.520
because you've got the number of states.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.640
Yeah, we can come back to it.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.560
Well, let me ask real quick.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.760
Why does different local pockets

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.720
of the universe start remembering stuff?

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.400
How does memory emerge exactly?

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.920
So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.600
That's when the physicists were happiest,

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.000
those low memory objects, which is like

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.760
ultra low memory objects,

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.600
which is what the definition of stuff.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.960
Okay, so how does memory emerge?

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.760
How does, which is this, how does this,

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.200
the temporal stickiness?

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.920
So objects emerge.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.920
I'm going to take a very chemo-centric point of view

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.400
because I can't imagine any other way of doing it.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.760
You could think of other ways maybe.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:53.360
But I would say heterogeneity in matter is where the memory,

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.440
so you must have enough different ways

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.400
of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.960
So what that means is if you've got particles colliding in a box,

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.520
let's just take some elements in a box.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.240
Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.760
So there's a combinatorial explosion

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.280
of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.240
bonds being made.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.280
Because there's such a large number,

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.160
the population of different objects that are possible,

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.040
this goes back to assembly theory where assembly theory,

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.280
there's four types of universes, right?

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.800
So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier,

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.320
where one universe where you've just got everything is possible,

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.360
so you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.320
Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial,

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.840
where you basically have to accrue information in steps.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.320
Then you've got assembly observed,

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.360
and then you've got the object assembly going back.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.280
So what I'm trying to say is if you can take atoms and make bonds,

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.080
let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom,

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.520
you find an amino acid,

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.960
then you add another carbon atom on it,

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.080
in a particular configuration,

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.160
then another one, all different molecules,

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.640
they all represent different histories.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.160
So I would say for me right now,

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.200
the most simple route into life seems to be

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.280
through recording memories and chemistry.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.080
But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.560
and can't be other emergent effects.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.600
But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds,

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.360
and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.800
So imagine a box of atoms,

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.880
and then you combine those atoms in some way.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.080
So you make molecule A from load of atoms,

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.400
and then molecule A can go back to the box and influence the box.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:49.600
Then you make A' or AB or ABC,

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.040
and that process keeps going,

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.200
and that's where the memories come from.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.320
Is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding?

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.000
I don't know if it makes any sense.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.120
And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.800
So the physicists have no, no, like not enough.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.520
They're like desperately begging for more freedom

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.400
and heterogeneous components to play with.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.960
That's exactly it.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.720
What do you think about that, Sarah?

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.720
I mentioned already, I think it's significant

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.080
that whatever physics governs life emerges actually in chemistry.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.880
It's not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale.

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.840
It's in, well, atomic scale chemistry.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.440
But like when you get into this,

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.760
this combinatorial diversity that you get

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.400
from combining things on the periodic table,

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.520
that's when selection actually matters

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.960
or the fact that some things can exist

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.120
and others can't exist actually starts to matter.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.840
So I think of it like you don't study gravity

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.040
inside the atomic nucleus.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.520
You study it in terms of large-scale structure of the universe

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.200
or black holes or things like that.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.240
And whatever we're talking about as physics of information

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.080
or physics of assembly becomes relevant

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.000
at a certain scale of reality.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.040
And the transition that you're talking about,

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.240
I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.720
in terms of the assembly space

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.560
of the relationship of the overlap and the assembly space,

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:23.040
which is a feature of common memory,

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.440
there is this transition to assembly-dominated physics,

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.080
whatever that is.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.320
Oh, like when we're talking about,

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.960
and we're trying to map out exactly what that transition looks like.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.080
We're pretty sure of some of its features,

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.520
but we haven't done all of that.

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.360
Do you think if you were there in the early universe,

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:43.040
you would have been able to predict the emergence of chemistry and biology?

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.800
And I ask that because at this stage as humans,

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.200
do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.880
that might be able to be formed later on

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.880
in this pocket of the universe?

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:02.240
Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.880
I think as much time as you have in the past

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.720
is how much you can predict in the future

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.360
because it's actually physical in the system.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.880
And you have to have enough time for features of that structure to exist.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.800
Wait, let me push back on that.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.040
Isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a shortest path

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.440
that stretches all the way to the beginning,

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.000
that's building some giant monster?

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.360
Maybe, yeah.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:32.240
The universe has as much memory as the largest assembly object in the universe.

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.560
So you can't predict?

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.440
You can't predict any deeper than that, no.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.080
So I guess what I'm saying is what intuition do you have

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.680
about complexity living in the world that you'd have today?

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.440
I guess how long does it get more fun?

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.760
Isn't there going to be at some point,

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.840
because there's a heat death in the universe,

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.680
isn't there going to be a point of the highest assembly of object

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.960
with the highest probability being generated?

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.480
When is the universe going to be the most fun

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.160
and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:10.640
Exactly.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.160
And will you know when you're having the most fun

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.640
that this is the best time you're in your prime?

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.000
Are you going to do what everyone does,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.840
which is deny that you're in your prime

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.280
and the best years are still ahead of you?

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.120
I don't know.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.080
What option do you have?

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.280
I mean, the problem is there's lots of really interesting features here.

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.960
I just want to mention one thing that might be,

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.080
is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.680
to subatomic particles.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.280
And I also think that cosmological selection might have been actually,

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.760
there might have been a, I would say it's a really boring bit,

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.360
but it's really important for a cosmologist

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.520
that universes have gone through.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.360
Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.560
Maybe that there is this,

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.160
that basically the universe evolves.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.680
You've got the wrong constants.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.880
We'll start again.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.160
And the most productive constants

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.800
where you can allow particles to form in a certain way,

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.040
propagate to the next universe, we go again.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.120
So actually selection goes all the way back

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.640
and these are the cycle of universes.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.480
And now this universe has been selected

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:10.240
because life can occur and it carries on.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.320
But I've really butchered that.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.200
There is a much more-

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.720
So this is some aspect where through the selection process,

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.200
there's parameters that are being fine-tuned

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.560
and we happen to be living in one

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.240
where there's some level of fine-tuning.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.160
Is there, given that,

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:31.200
can you still man the case that we humans are alone in the universe?

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.880
We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.240
Yeah, I can, I guess.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.320
Sad though, I mean, so from-

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.200
Is it possible?

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.800
Yes, it's possible.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.080
Let's assume, well, we know.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.000
I mean, it's possible.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.240
So let me, so okay, so there is a particular

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.440
set of elements on earth in a particular ratio

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.560
and the right gravitational constant

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.680
and the right viscosity, you know,

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.680
of stuff being at a move around.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.760
The right distance from our sun,

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.400
right number of events where we have a moon,

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.800
the earth is rotating,

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.120
the late heavy bombardment produced

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.200
a lot of, brought in the right stuff.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.840
And Mars was cooking up, you know,

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.360
the right molecules first.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.200
So it was habitable before earth.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.840
It was literally doing the combinatorial search.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.600
And before Mars kind of became unhabitable

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:34.000
it seeded earth with the right molecular replicators

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.320
and there was just the right stuff on earth

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.960
and that's how the miracle of life occurred.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.360
Although I find, I'm very uncomfortable with that

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:48.240
because actually, because life came so quickly

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.280
in the earth's past.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.520
But that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.760
It just might mean that the-

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:00.080
Because chemistry is actually not a long-term thing.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.200
Chemistry can happen quickly.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:04.080
So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.880
to say, actually, the fact that life emerged quickly

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.240
doesn't mean that life is easy.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:11.680
It just means that the chemistry was right on earth

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.680
and earth is very special.

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.320
And that's why there's no life anywhere else in the universe.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.800
Yeah. So Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.880
So what if that's the reason we're lucky

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.600
is that we got to have a rare cascading

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.840
of accelerating cascading effect

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.760
in terms of the complexity of things.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:38.400
So maybe most of the universe is trying to get sticky

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.280
with the memory and it's not able to really form it.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.960
And then we got really lucky in that.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.720
And there's a lot of earth-like conditions, let's say,

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.960
but you really, really have to get lucky on this.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.080
But I'm doing experiments right now.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.400
In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.240
because we have some joint funding for this,

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.720
where we're seeing that the universe can get sticky

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.360
really quickly.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.320
Now, of course, we're being very anthropocentric.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.680
We're using laboratory tools.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.400
We're using theory.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.760
But actually, the phenomena of selection,

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.360
the process of developing heterogeneity,

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.040
we can do in the lab.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.600
We're just seeing the very first hints of it.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.440
And wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin down

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.520
a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this,

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.080
for the origin of life and the emergence of life,

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.840
defining out what kind of chemistries

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.120
we really need to look for.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.920
And I'm becoming increasingly confident

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.760
we'll be able to do that in the next few years.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.480
Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.000
from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.600
from dead stuff, from moon.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.920
Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon,

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.040
put it in our origin of life experiment

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.000
and make moon life and restrict ourselves

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.320
to interesting self-replicating stuff

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.360
that we find on the moon?

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.560
Sarah, what do you think about this approach

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.040
of engineering life in order to understand life,

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.760
so building life in the machine?

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:06.240
Yeah.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.120
So, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:14.720
to build a vision for a large institute

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.520
or experimental program basically to do this problem.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.960
But I think of it as like we need to simulate a planet.

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.720
So, like the Large Hadron Collider

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.480
was supposed to be simulating conditions

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.600
just after the Big Bang.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.840
Lee's built a lot of technology in his lab

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.000
to do these kind of selection engines.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.960
But the question you're asking is,

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.800
how many experiments do you need to run?

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.520
What volume of chemical space do you need to explore

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.480
before you actually see an event?

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.680
And I like to make an analogy

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.520
to one of my favorite particle physics experiments

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.800
which is super kamiakande

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.480
that's looking for the decay of the proton.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.880
So, this is something that we predicted theoretically,

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.560
but we've never observed in our universe.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.200
And basically what they're doing is every time

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.200
they don't see a proton decay event,

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.600
they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.640
So, imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.520
of trying to simulate planetary conditions,

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.400
physically simulate.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.240
You can't simulate original life in the computer.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.520
You have to do it in an experiment.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.720
Simulate enough planetary conditions

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.640
to explore the space of what's possible

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.960
and bound the probability for an original life event.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.080
Even if you're not observing it,

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.440
you can talk about the probability.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:23.200
But we, hopefully, life is not exponentially rare

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.840
and we would then be able to evolve

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.680
in an automated system alien life in the lab.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:32.720
And if we can do that,

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.160
then we understand the physics

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.360
as well as we understand

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.880
what we can do in particle accelerators.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.920
So, keep expanding physically the simulation,

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.560
the physical simulation until something happens.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.480
Yeah, or just build a big enough volume

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.320
of chemical experiments and evolve them.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.800
So, if they say volume, you mean like literally volume.

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.120
I mean physical volume in terms of space,

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.320
but I actually mean volume

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.160
in terms of the combinatorial space of chemistry.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:01.600
So, how do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.800
the search space, such that it's always like

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.000
you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.480
Yeah, how do you build a search engine for chemistry?

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.520
I think you explained it really well.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.400
We should carry on doing this.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.600
I should pretend the physics,

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.960
be the physicist, you be the chemist.

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.720
So, the way to do it is I will always play a joke

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.560
because I like writing grants to ask for money to do cool stuff.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.880
Years ago, I started wanting to build.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.560
So, I actually wanted the weather.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.800
So, I built this robot in my lab called the computer,

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.200
which is this robot you can program to do chemistry.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.600
Now, I made a programming language for the computer

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.280
and made it operate chemical equipment.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.920
Originally, I wrote grants to say,

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.240
hey, I want to make an origin of life system.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.520
No one would give me any money for this.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.440
They said, what's this ridiculous?

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.400
Why are you wanting to make?

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.120
Oh, it's really hard.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.000
It takes forever.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.320
You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.520
Why would we give you any money?

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.840
And so, I turned it around and said,

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.440
can you instead, can you give me money to make robots,

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.560
to make molecules?

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.200
Oh, interesting.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.880
And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.520
And that's, so actually, the funny thing is the computer

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.040
project, which I have in my lab,

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.960
which is very briefly, it's just basically,

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.960
it's like literally an automated test tube.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.880
And we've made a programming language for the test tube,

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.440
which is cool.

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.560
Has come, has literally came from this.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.760
I went to my lab one day and said,

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.080
I want to make a search engine to get the origin of life

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.440
because I don't have a planet.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.080
And I thought about doing it in a microfluidic format.

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.240
So microfluidic is very nano chat,

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.720
very small channels in device where you can basically

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.840
have all the pipes produced by lithography.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.600
And you can have a chamber, maybe say,

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.400
between say 10 and 100 microns in volume.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.920
And we slot them all together like Lego.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.720
And we can make an origin of life system.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.640
And I could never get it to work.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:59.600
And I realized I had to make do chemistry at the kind of test

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.240
tube level.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.120
And what you want to be able to do,

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.320
yeah, it goes back to that tweet, 1981.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:09.520
1981, the computer, we're looking at a tweet from Lee.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.720
In 1981, the computer was a distant dream.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.920
Oh, wow, this is the scientist looking back.

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.200
It is the young boy who dreamed.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:24.000
In 2018, it was realized, spelled in the British way, realized.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.760
Yeah, I'm starting to say it, but not.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.120
So now there's a system that does the physical manifestation

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:37.040
of whatever the programming language, the spec, tells you to do.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.920
Yeah, well, in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.520
Well, what was the computer?

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.560
ZX81.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.080
ZX81.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.920
Sinclair ZX81.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.840
It was, and I got a chemistry set.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.760
And I like, I like the chemistry set.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.280
And I like the computer.

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.800
And I just wanted to put them together.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.960
I thought wouldn't it be cool if I could use the computer

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.080
to control the chemistry set.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.640
And obviously that was insane.

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.240
And I was like, you know, eight years old, right?

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.000
Nine years old, going on nine years old.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.440
And then I invented the computer just because I wanted to build

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.600
this origin of life grid, right?

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.720
Which is like, literally a billion test tubes connected together

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.280
in real time and real space, basically throwing a chemical dice.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.640
Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.520
You're going to get lucky.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.480
And that's what we, I think Sarah and I have been thinking very deeply about.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.960
Because, you know, there's more money being spent on the origin of the gravity

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.520
or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:43.680
And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question,

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.160
or not the biggest question, it is a big question.

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:46.800
Let's put it that way.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.000
What is the biggest question?

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:48.960
You're okay saying that.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.400
Okay, all right.

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.880
Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.080
that that's not going to solve?

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:59.360
That's not actually going to solve the question of what is life?

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.560
Like, because you're kind of putting a lot of...

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.040
I don't think so, yeah.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.480
I think that's the same problem.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:08.400
But you're putting, is it possible that you're putting too many,

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.920
too much bets into this origin part?

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.320
Maybe the origin thing isn't, isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.600
Isn't it a stack of turtles?

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.600
Because then if you create it in the lab, maybe you need some other stuff.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.640
Well, that's not the thing about the origin.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.120
Like you, like in the lab, there's still memory.

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.080
Yeah, yes.

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:28.480
Right.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.600
The experiment is already the product of evolution.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.000
Right.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.800
And some may be really deep way, not an obvious way,

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.000
in some very deep way.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.520
So maybe the haters are always going to be like,

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.000
well, you have to reconstruct the fold.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.640
They have to build a different score.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.280
Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware of that argument.

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.000
Well, no, I know, I just...

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.760
We're the one making that argument usually.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.320
I just think that if we create life in the lab,

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:59.360
it's not obvious that you'll get to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily,

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.960
what is the line between life and non-life?

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.520
No, I think so.

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.880
Look, there's so much here.

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.240
I'm just saying, playing double.

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:06.800
So much here.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.320
But let me play doubles back in a previous conversation, right?

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.240
And say, yeah, I will.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:14.640
Why not?

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:14.960
Why not?

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.280
I've got time.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:15.920
Yeah, let's go.

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:16.960
Seller Automata.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.280
Yes.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.120
Seller Automata, these very simple things where you color squares,

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.560
black or white, and implement rules and play them in time,

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.800
and you can get these very complex patterns coming out.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.680
There's nice rules.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.040
They're true and complete rules.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:41.520
And I would argue that Seller Automata don't really exist on their own.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.400
They have to exist in a computing device.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.440
If that were there's computing devices, a piece of paper and abstraction,

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.400
a mathematician drawing a grid, or a framework.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:58.320
Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things, simple, going complex,

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:02.080
but the complexity is all borrowed from the lithography, the numbers.

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:03.760
Right.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:08.960
Now, let's take that same argument with the chemistry experiment origin of life.

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.400
What you need to be able to do is go out,

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.880
and I'm inspired to do this, to go out and look for CAs occur in nature.

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:23.920
Let's find some CAs that just emerge in our universe.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.120
For people just to start to interrupt, for people just listening in general,

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:35.040
I think what we're looking at is a Seller Automata, where again, as Lee described,

01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:40.160
there is just binary black or white squares, and they only have local information,

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.200
they're born and they die. You would think nothing interesting would emerge,

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.120
but actually what we're looking at is something that I believe is called glider guns,

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:58.000
or a glider gun, which is moving objects in this multi-cell space that look like their organisms,

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:05.040
that have much more information, that have much more complexity than the individual building

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.600
in fact look like they have a long-term memory, while the individual components

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.960
don't seem like they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:19.680
Yes, the argument here is that has to exist on all this layer of infrastructure,

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.680
right, and though it looks simple, and then what I would make if I were you,

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:28.560
say, well, I think CAs are really simple and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.920
and substrate. Now, let's go to the origin of life, machine. I don't think we want to do the

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.280
origin of life, just any origin is good. So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker,

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.600
shake the sand, like massive grid of chemistry experiments, shaking sand, shaking whatever,

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:48.480
and then because we know what we've put in, so we know where, how we've cheated,

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.800
and the same way with CA, we know how we've cheated, we know what the,

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.840
we know the number of operations needed, we know how big a grid we want to get this,

01:43:54.560 --> 01:44:02.320
if we could then say, okay, how can we generate this recipe in the lab and make a life form,

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.000
what were the, what contingency did we need to put in, and we're up front about how we cheated,

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:13.040
okay, say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic, planet rotates,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.480
it's tried, comes in and out, so, and then we can start to basically say, okay, how

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:24.720
difficult is it for these features to be found, and then we can look for exoplanets and other

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.280
features, so I think Sarah's absolutely right, we want to explain to people we're cheating,

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:33.040
in fact, we have to cheat, no one has given, I'm good at writing grants, I used to be,

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.720
I'm not very good right now, I keep getting rejected, but writing a grant for a planet

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.760
in 100 million years, no grant fund there is going to give me that, but maybe money to make a kind

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:49.040
of a grid, a computer grid, origin of life, computer grid, in physical space, and just do it.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:56.240
So Sarah said something which is, you can't simulate the origin of life in a computer,

01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:04.160
so like in simulation, why not? You said it very confidently, so is it possible,

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.160
and why would it be very difficult? What's your intuition there?

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:13.920
I think it's very difficult right now because we don't know the physics, but if you go based on

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:18.480
principles of assembly theory and you think every molecule is actually a very large causal graph,

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.640
not just the molecule, then you have to simulate all the features of those causal graphs, and I

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.080
think it becomes computationally intractable, you might as well just build the experiment.

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.360
Because you have, in the physical space, you have all the objects with all the memories,

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.920
and in a computer you would have to copy them reconstruct.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:43.440
That's a beautiful put, and I would say that lots of people, you just don't have enough

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:49.680
resources, it's easier to actually do the physical experiment, because we are literally,

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.440
I would view the physical experiment almost like a computational experiment,

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:58.800
we're just outsourcing, it's just basically we're just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.800
On your point about the experiment being also an example of life, it's almost like you want to

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.160
design, it's like, you know, all of us are lineages of propagating information across time,

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:14.000
and so everything we do becomes part of life because it's part of that causal chain,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
so it's like you want to try to pinch off as much as you can of the information from your

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.640
causal chain that goes into the experiment, but you can't pinch off all of it to move it to like

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.920
a different timeline, it's always going to be part of your timeline, but at least if you can

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:29.840
control how much information you put in, you can try to see how much does that particular

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:35.920
trajectory you set up start generating its own assembly, so you know where it starts,

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.080
and then you want to try to see it take off on its own when you try to pinch it off as much as

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:49.840
possible. Got it. Quick pause, bath and break. Yes. All right, cool. And now we're back. All right,

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.120
we talked about the early days of the universe when there was just stuff and no memory,

01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.480
not even causality, I think Lee at least implied the causality is emergent somehow,

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:08.720
we could discuss this. What happened before this all originated? What's outside the universe?

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:17.760
Divide by zero. Okay, so it's not relevant, not understandable. Is it useful to even ask the

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:25.520
question? No. Because it's so hard? No, it's not hard, it's just not a question. If I can't do an

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.800
experiment or even think of an experiment, the question doesn't exist. Well, no, you can't think

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.800
of a lot of experiments, no offense. What I mean is I can't- Because your causality graph is like

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:44.720
this is what we've been talking about. It's like there is limits to your ability to construct

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.440
experiments. I agree, but I was trying to be facetious and I'm trying to make a point because I

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:59.360
think that if there is a causal bottleneck through which information can't propagate in principle,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.600
then it's very hard to think of an experiment, even in principle, even one that's beyond my

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:12.080
mediocre intellect, which is fine. I'm happy to accept that. But this is one of the things I

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.880
actually do think there was something before the Big Bang because I would say that I think

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.320
the Big Bang just couldn't occur and create time. Time created the Big Bang. There was time

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:29.120
before the Big Bang. Yeah. There was no space, but there was time. Yeah. I'm just making that

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.440
stuff up just to make all the physicists happy, but I think it's- You think that would make them

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.920
happy because they would be quite upset, actually. Why would they be upset? Because they would say

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:44.000
that time can't exist before the Big Bang. Yeah. I mean, this goes back to an argument that you

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.120
might not want to have the argument here. I was talking to Sarah earlier today about an argument

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:55.920
we had about time a long time ago, a long time and time. I think there is this thing called

01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.240
time or state creation. The universe is creating states and it's outside of space,

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.200
but they create space. What I mean is you can imagine there are states being created all the

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.280
time and there is this thing called time. Time is a clock, which you can use to measure when

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.160
things happen, but that doesn't mean because you can't measure something that states aren't being

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:24.800
created. You might locally refer to the Big Bang and the Big Bang occurred at some point

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.920
in when those states were there. Probably there had to be enough states for the Big Bang to occur.

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.960
But I think that there is something wrong with our conception of how the universe was created

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:43.680
in the Big Bang because we don't really get time because, again, I don't want to become

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:51.680
boring and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing. Until I can really explain that

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.000
more elegantly, I'm just going to get into more trouble. We're going to talk about time because

01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:01.200
time is a useful measure in device for experiments, but also time is an idea.

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:07.120
But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think? Is it a useful question to ask what happened

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.720
before the Big Bang? Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:20.800
I would think about it as the Big Bang is an event that we reconstructed as probably happening

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.760
in the past of our universe based on current observational data. The way I like to think about

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:35.760
it is we exist locally in something called the universe. Going back to the physics of existence,

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:41.520
we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist. We can infer certain properties of

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.000
the structure of where we exist locally. One of the properties that we've inferred in the past

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.800
is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang. There's some signatures of our local environment

01:50:52.800 --> 01:51:00.480
that indicate that there was a very low information event that started our universe. I think that's

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:08.720
actually just an artifact of the structure of the assembly space that when you start losing

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:14.560
all the memory in the objects, it looks like what we call a Big Bang. I think it makes sense to talk

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:20.160
about where you are locally. I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities,

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:24.640
what could exist outside the universe, in the sense that they become part of our reasoning

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:31.600
and therefore part of our causal chain of things that we can do. The multiverse in my mind exists,

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.360
but it doesn't exist as a multiverse of possibility universe. It exists as an

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:39.120
idea in our minds that allows us to reason about how physics works and then to do physics

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:47.040
differently because we reason about it that way. I always like to recenter it on things exist,

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:52.000
but they don't always exist like we think they exist. When we're thinking about things outside

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.160
the universe, they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them, but they don't look like

01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.560
the projections in our mind. There's something else.

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.800
Something you said just gave me an idea to go back to your question. If

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:12.080
something caused the Big Bang, if there was some memory or some artifact of that,

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:16.560
then of course, to answer your question, it's worth going back to that because that would imply

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.720
there is something beyond that barrier, that filter. That's what you were saying, I guess.

01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:25.600
I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe. I just don't think that. I think the most

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.960
interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more,

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:36.960
like that optimism. I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask as being scientific ones because

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:42.720
I find that that's where the most creative potential is to impact the future trajectory of

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.040
what we're doing on this planet. The interesting thing about the Big Bang is basically from our

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:52.640
current perspective of what we're able to detect, it's the time when things were forgotten.

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:59.440
Yes. It's the time the reset from our limited perspective. The question is,

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:06.960
is it useful to ever study the thing that was forgotten? Or should we focus just on the

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:10.080
memories that are still there? The point I was trying to make about the experiment

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:14.160
is I was trying to say both things. I think perhaps, yes, from the pot following point of view,

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:20.080
if you could then imagine what was forgotten and then work forwards, you will have different

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:25.440
consequences. Then it becomes testable. As long as we can find tests, then it's definitely worth

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:29.440
thinking about. What I don't like is when physicists say, what happened before the Big

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:37.120
Bang and before, before, before, without giving me any credible conjecture about how would we

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:42.640
know the difference? The way you framed it is quite nice. I like that. It's like, what have we forgotten?

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.240
Is there a room for God in assembly theory? Who's God?

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.920
I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.160
What's a necessary being? Something that has to exist.

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:02.080
Oh, I mean, you like the shortest path. Does God need-

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:09.760
No, no, no. You can go back to Thomas Aquinas and arguments for the existence of God. I think

01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.800
most of the interesting theological arguments are always about whether something has to exist,

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:19.200
or there was a first thing that had to exist. I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:28.400
kind of arguments. God here meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.480
What I was trying to say earlier is that- Isn't that just the universe?

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:39.440
Yeah, yeah. There's a difference between- I imagine a black box, like a machine.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:43.360
Yeah. Then I would be more comfortable calling that God,

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:47.600
because it's a machine. You go into a room and there's a thing with a button.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.840
Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version.

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:57.280
Yeah, but if it's more kind of- I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:06.160
if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God, that generates a bunch of stuff.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:13.600
But if there's a machine that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:20.960
then that feels like God. In terms of terminology. I wonder if there's a machine

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:26.000
that's required to generate this universe. That's very important for running this in the lab.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.640
So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier that I can't remember the phrase,

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:36.000
but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe? Yes. Where does God exist?

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:43.760
God at least exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly people who have religious

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:47.440
faith they believe in. But let's then take your- But you're talking a little bit more

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.160
about generics. Say, well, is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God? I would

01:55:52.160 --> 01:56:00.240
say God did not exist at the beginning, but he or she does now. Because I'm saying the

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.680
mechanism- Well, you don't know if he didn't exist in the beginning. So this could be us

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:12.480
in our minds trying to just listen to gravitational waves, detecting gravitational waves. It's the

01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:19.120
same thing. Us trying to go back further and further into our memories to try to understand

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:28.320
the machines that make up us. And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:35.520
what kind of machines could create. There's always a tweet. There's always a tweet.

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.040
If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it because computers need creators.

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:48.480
There you go. And then Yoshibah replied, since there's something rather than nothing,

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:56.320
perhaps existence is the default. If existence is the default that many computers exist,

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.600
creator gods are necessary computers and necessarily computers too. I'm very confused by

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.680
that. But that's an interesting idea that existence is a default versus non-existence.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:11.200
I agree with that, but the rest is- And then Lee responds, perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:17.600
That's how scientists talk trash each other on Twitter apparently. Which part don't you agree with?

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.800
When he said if existence is a default, then many computers exist. This comes back to the

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:29.040
inventor and discovery argument. I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:35.440
of computation because there wasn't enough technology, enough states. So what you're

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:41.680
saying is if God is a mechanism, so I might actually agree, but then the thing is lots of

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:47.600
people see God is more than a mechanism. For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory

01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:52.320
that creates all the stuff that the memories we know. And the fact that we can even relate to

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.120
each other is because we have the same. We share that heritage and why we love each other or we

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:05.440
like to see God in each other is it's just we know we have a shared existence. So if the

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:10.560
God is the mechanism that created this whole thing, I think a lot of people see God in a

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:18.080
religious sense as that mechanism also being able to communicate with the objects it creates.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:23.520
And if it's just the mechanism, we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates.

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:30.960
It can only interact with the... Well, there's versions of God that create the universe and then

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:40.000
left. Yeah, like spark. For some religions. The first spark. Yeah, but I think I liked your analogy

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:48.800
of the machine and the rules. But I think part of the problem is we have this conception that we

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:53.440
can disentangle the rules from the physical substrate and that's the whole thing about software

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:58.480
and hardware being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws that they exist outside the universe.

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.360
They're not actually a feature of the universe. They don't have to merge out of the universe

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:08.480
itself. So I think if you merged your two views, then it gets back to the God as the universe.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:12.160
And then I think the deeper question is why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:18.000
And if I think about the features of the universe that give it the most meaning and purpose, those

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.560
are what we would call the living components of the universe. So if you wanted to say,

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.560
God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an emergent property of our minds,

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:32.480
but I would just say the way the universe creates meaning and purpose, there is really a physics

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:37.040
there. It's not like a illusory thing and that is just what the physics of life is.

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:44.160
So is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?

01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:52.400
So basically, whatever God is that mechanism, we just leave parts of that behind.

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:56.800
But the universe is constantly generating itself. So if God is that mechanism, it would be that

01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:05.040
that would still be active today. I'm agnostic, but if I would call the things I believe in God

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:12.160
in the way that some people talk about God, I would say that God is like in the universe now.

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:19.120
It's not an absent thing. So I think there's a mislabeling here, because you're, I mean,

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:28.800
I mean, I'm a professional idiot, actually. But you should put that on your CV.

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:34.720
Professionally, not recreationally or amateur, but professionally.

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.360
I think so. I would say if you were talking about God, I mean, again, I'm way out,

02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:43.760
way out of my depth here, and I'm almost feeling, you know, I feel quite uncomfortable articulating,

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:49.200
but I'll try. For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness of reasoning entity that

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:56.080
actually has causal power. And you're human like intelligence. And so you're like,

02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.000
then you're saying like gravity could be God or time could be God. I mean, I think for me,

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:06.080
for my conception of time is probably as fundamental as God, because it gave rise to human

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.160
intelligence and consciousness in which we can have this abstract notion of God.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:19.360
So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very mechanistic kind of unsophisticated sense,

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:22.480
whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated and got all this, you know,

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:28.480
feelings and love and, you know, and this abstracting ability. So is that what,

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:34.080
or do you mean that? Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that decided to flick the universe

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:44.640
into existence? Well, one of the features that God would have is the ability to flick the universe

02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:52.080
into existence. I, you know, like Windows 95, I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP

02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:58.000
or Windows 10. I don't know the full feature set. Okay. So the very least you have to flick

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:05.040
the universe into existence. And then other features might include ability to interact with

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:11.360
that universe in interesting ways. And then how do you interact with the universe in interesting

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:16.320
ways? You have to be able to speak the language of its different components. So in order to interact

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:25.920
with humans, you have to know how to act human like. So, so I don't, I don't know.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:38.240
But it seems like whatever mechanism created the universe might want to also generate

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:44.000
local pockets of mechanisms that can interact with that. Like, inject.

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:49.600
God was lonely. Yeah, it was long. I mean, it could be just a teenager and another

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.400
just playing a video game. Yeah, maybe. Well, I was going to say, I mean, I, I don't,

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:59.040
so this is referring to our origin of life engine. It's like, I, I don't believe in God,

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:03.440
but that doesn't mean I don't want to be one. Right. Because I want to make a universe and

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:07.440
make a life form. But that maybe, that may be rude to people who have, you know,

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.440
dear religious beliefs. What I mean by that is,

02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:17.280
isn't it, if we are able to create an entirely new life form, different chemistry, different culture,

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.120
what does it make up and makes us good? By that definition, it makes us gods, right?

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.360
Well, there is. I mean, like when you have children, you're like one of the magical

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:30.320
things of that is your kind of mini gods. I mean, first of all,

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.480
from a child's perspective, parents are gods for quite a while.

02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.160
And then you, I mean, they're, in the positive sense, there's a magic to that. That's why I love

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:44.240
robotics, is you instill life into something. And that makes you,

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.520
feel God like, you know, sort of positive way. Being a creator is a positive thing.

02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.360
A creator. Yeah, exactly. And a small scale. And then God is, would be

02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:02.800
a creator at the largest possible scale, I suppose. Okay. You mentioned offline the

02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:05.920
Assembletron. Assembletron?

02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.360
Assembletron. Yep.

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.160
What's an assembly? These are the, this is an early idea of something you're thinking about.

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:16.240
So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team are interested in

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.600
using AI to understand life. My team is, and I'm, and I'm wondering if we could apply the

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:29.680
principles of assembly theory, that is, the causal structure that you get with assembly theory,

02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:36.800
and hybridize it and make a new type of neuron, if you like. I mean, there are causal neural

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:41.840
networks out there, but they are, they are not quite the architecture, like what I would like.

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:47.520
I would like to associate memory bits with, basically, I'd like to make a,

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:53.760
rather than having an ASIC for neural networks, I want to make an ASIC for assembly networks.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:05:01.680
Right. And so can you say that again, assembly networks? So what, what is a,

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:07.360
sort of like a thing with an input and output? And it's like a neural network type of thing.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.680
What does it do exactly? What's the input? What's the output?

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.600
So in this case, so if you're talking about a general neural network, I mean,

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:17.680
general neural network, you can train it on also any sort of data, right,

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:25.200
depending on the framework, whether it's like text or, or image data or whatnot.

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:31.440
And that's fine. But there's no causal structure associated with that data. Now,

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:35.440
just imagine, rather than, you know, let's say we're in a classified difference between cat and

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.400
the dog, right, classic cat and dog neural network. What about if the system understood

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:48.080
the assembly space to create the cat and the dog? And rather than guessing what was happening and

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:54.640
training on those images and not understanding those features, it, it, you almost like you could

02:05:54.640 --> 02:06:00.880
imagine doing a, going back a step and doing an, and training, going back a step and doing a training,

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:05.840
going back a step, back a step, back a step. And, and I wonder if that is actually the origin of

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:11.680
intelligence or how we'll crack intelligence, because we need to, because we'll, we'll create

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:18.640
the entire graph of events and, and be able to kind of look at cause and effect across those

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:23.680
graphs. I'm explaining it really badly, but it's a, it's a gene of an idea. And I'm guessing

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:27.920
very smart, very rich people in AI already doing this.

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:34.960
Trying to not generate cats and dogs, but trying to generate things of high assembly index.

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:41.360
Yeah. And I think, I think, and, and, and also using causal graphs in neural networks and machine

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:45.200
learning and deep learning, maybe building a new architecture. I'm just wondering,

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:48.720
is there something we can get out of assembly theory allows us to rebuild

02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:55.040
current machine learning architectures to give more, give causation more cheaply? I mean,

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.720
I don't know if that's what you're, we've been inventing this for a little while, but we're

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.440
trying to finish the theory paper first before we do anything else.

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:07.200
Yeah. You also want to have, say, goal directed behavior in neural networks. Then assembly theory

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.880
is a good framework for doing that. Daniel's been thinking about that a lot. And I think it's a

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:17.040
really interesting idea that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn to think about

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:21.280
goal directed behavior as a learning process, that you're learning a specific goal. The

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:25.120
universe is learning a goal when it generates a particular structure and that you can map that

02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:29.680
physical structure in a neural network. How, what's the goal?

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:38.320
Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal in, in biology. I mean, you know,

02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:41.680
people are not supposed to use teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:48.720
but because goals are real things, they're just post-selected. So you can talk about goals after

02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:54.640
the fact. You know, once a goal emerges in the universe, that physical entity has a goal.

02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:59.520
But Lee and I came up with a test for, like a Turing test for goal directed behavior

02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:03.920
based on the idea of assembly. Like, we have to formalize it still, but I would like to write

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:09.360
a paper on it. But like, the basic idea is like, if you, like, if you had two systems that were

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:15.920
completely equivalent, you know, like in the instantaneous, like physical experimental setup,

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:20.160
so Lee has to figure out how to do this. But there was something that would be different in their

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:25.200
future. And there was a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility,

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:29.680
that future outcome, then you could say that that system had some representation of, of,

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:35.120
of some kind of goal in mind about what it wanted to do in the future. And I, so, so goals are

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:40.480
interesting because they don't exist as instantaneous things. They exist across time, which is one,

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:46.480
one of the reasons that assembly theories may be more naturally able to account for the existence

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:54.080
of goals. So goals are the only existent time, or they manifest themselves in time

02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:03.120
through, you said, symmetry breaking. So it's almost like, imagine, like, if representations in

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:09.200
your mind are real, right? And you can imagine future possibilities, but imagine everything

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:14.320
else is physically equivalent. And the only thing that you actually change your decision based on

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:20.080
is what you model as being the future outcome. Then somehow that representation in your mind

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.320
of the future outcome becomes causal to what you're doing now. So it's kind of like retrocausal effect.

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:29.120
But it's not actually retrocausal. It's just that your, your assembly space is actually

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:33.600
includes those possibilities as, as part of the structure. It's just you're not observing all

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:37.600
the features, the assembly space in the current moment. Well, the possibilities exist, but they

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:44.160
don't become a goal until they realize. So, so one of the features of assembly space that's

02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:49.760
super interesting, and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example, is if you're thinking

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.000
about an assembly space, you can't observe the entire assembly space in any instant in time. So

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.560
if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you want to look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos,

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.800
you have to break the Legos apart. And then you look, and then you look at all the possible

02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:07.520
ways of building up the original object. So now you have in your mind the goal of building

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.240
that object, and you have all the possible ways of doing it. And those are actual physical features

02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:16.960
of that object, but that object doesn't always exist. What exists is the possibility of generating

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:22.720
it. And the possibilities are always infinite. Well, for that particular object, you know,

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:26.720
like, you know, it has a well-defined assembly space. And I guess what I'm saying is that

02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:32.320
object is the assembly space, but you actually have to unpack that object across time to view that

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:39.600
feature of it. It's only an observable across time. The term goal is such a important and

02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:45.680
difficult to explain concept, right? Because what you want is a way is like, I think only conscious

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:52.720
beings can have conscious goals. Everything else is doing selection. And but selection does

02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:59.520
invent goals. And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past in the present

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:06.240
is kind of helps you to understand there was a goal in the past now, right? It's kind of like

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:14.720
goals only exist back in time. So first of all, only conscious beings can have

02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:22.720
conscious goals. I'm not even going to touch that one. Why? Go for it. Come on.

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:30.960
The line between conscious goals and non-conscious goals, exactly. And also maybe just on top of that,

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:38.960
you said a touring test for goal-directed behavior. What is a touring test potentially look like?

02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:42.800
So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this. So we actually got some funding to

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.600
work together on two teams. So I'm trying to do, and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.520
and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory. And Sarah is trying to design experiments and I'm

02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:56.560
teaching experiments. Because I think it's really good for us to have that. So say, when would a,

02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.120
so that's good. I like this, this, I'm sure we use the Dan Dennett essay.

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:06.240
Yeah. And I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a touring test after, but yeah. So Dan

02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.600
Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and free will inflation.

02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.840
The title is so brilliant.

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:15.520
It's the actual title. I think so.

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:18.000
Herding cats and free will inflation.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.640
Yeah. Something like that. I mean, it's not maybe not. And so,

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:21.440
No, I think that's right.

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.640
So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hillside.

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.000
Okay. And it just happens to be a snowy hill. And let's just say you see an object go rolling

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.600
down the hill. Or you, you, you, you, and the rock will go rolls downhill. The start goes to the end.

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:40.160
How do you know objects had a goal? Now you unveil the object and you'll see it's actually

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:46.640
a skier. And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom. Great. Then you look at the rock.

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:50.320
Rock rolls down the hill and gets the bottom. How can you tell the difference between the two?

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:55.440
So, and what Dan says is like, well, this, it's clear the skiers in control

02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:00.480
and the, and because they're adjusting the trajectory system updating going on.

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:03.520
Then the only way you can really do that is you have to put the skier back to the top of the hill

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:08.720
again. They tend to start roughly in the same space and probably go to take all that complex

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.880
set of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right? With plus or minus

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.360
few meters. Whereas if it's just a random rock going down to random trajectory, that wouldn't

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:22.240
happen. And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing when we were writing this grant, we're like,

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:29.040
we need to somehow instantiate the skier and the rock in the experiment and then say, okay,

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:34.480
when is the object, when it, so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update, it has to

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:41.440
have some sensing and some kind of, you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment.

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:46.160
And, and then we just have to iterate on that. And maybe Sarah, you can influence the cheering

02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:50.720
test part. Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was slightly different. So I get really

02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.440
frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most people do. You know, a lot of people are,

02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:01.120
which is not necessarily related to, to free will directly or to this goal directed behavior. But I

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:06.880
think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics here. But I think for me, I was, you know,

02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:11.520
everybody's always interested in explaining intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic

02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:16.240
experience. And there's all sorts of problems with that. Because you can never actually be

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:19.360
another physical system. So you can't know what it's like to be another physical system.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:24.960
So I always thought there must be some way of getting at this problem about if an agent or an

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.920
entity is conscious, or at least has internal representations. And those are real physical

02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:38.160
things that there, it must have causal consequences. So the way I would ask the question of consciousness

02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:42.960
is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically? But if, if things have intrinsic experience,

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.160
is there any observable difference from the outside about the kind of causation that that

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.960
physical system would enact in? And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do is have

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:58.080
imaginations. So like we can imagine rocket centuries before we build them, they become real

02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.400
physical things because we imagine them. And people might disentangle that from conscious

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.880
experience. But I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do is actually a conscious process.

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:13.680
So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems, and I said, one had an internal

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:18.480
representation, which is slightly different than a conscious experience, obviously. So I'm entangling

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.720
some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought experiments. Then how, and I, and I set them up

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:30.800
in a physically equivalent situation, would it be the case that there would be

02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:37.360
experimental observables associated with it? And that, that became the idea of trying to

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.840
actually measure for internal representation and consciousness. So Turing basically didn't want

02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:45.920
to do that. You just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior,

02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:51.760
but never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that. And I guess

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:56.720
I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually test for

02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:02.720
that? For the imagination that led to the. That there was something internal going on,

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:09.520
some kind of inner world, as people say, but I, or you could say, you know, like it actually is an

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:14.800
agent, it's making decisions, it has an internal representation. And whether you say that's

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:19.360
experience or not is a different thing. But at least the feature that there's some abstraction

02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:23.120
it's doing, that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates.

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:26.480
Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing? One of the compelling things about the

02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:32.800
Turing test is that, you know, defining intelligent, defining any complicated concept as,

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:40.400
as a thing, like observing it from the surface and not caring about what's going on deep inside,

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:46.320
because how do you know? That's the point. So the idea is exactly that. So what we're trying to do,

02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:51.040
the Turing test for goal directiveness is literally take some objects that clearly don't

02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.200
have an internal representation, grains of sand blowing on the beach or something, right?

02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:01.200
And I know a crab wandering around on the beach. And then generating an experiment where we

02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:06.320
literally the experiment generates an entity that literally has no internal representation

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:10.800
to sand, like a drop, these are oil droplets, actually, what got in mind, a robot that makes

02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.360
oil droplets. But then what we want to try and do is train the oil droplets to be like crabs.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:21.840
Give them an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information from the

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:29.840
environment. So they understand, they remember the past, are in the present, and can imagine a

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:35.680
future and a very limited way they're kind of game engine, their limited simulation of the world

02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.280
allows them to then make a decision. Your objects across time.

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:44.560
So then you would run a bunch of crabs, like over and over and over and over.

02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:45.680
How many crabs, Lee?

02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:52.560
Because you have to have a large number of crabs. What does your theory say? Is there a mathematical?

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:54.160
We're working on it. I mean, this is literally-

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.760
Limit, crab limit.

02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:56.960
There's literally a-

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:57.520
Excellent.

02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:58.560
There's literally-

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:01.840
What's the herding cats have to do? Oh, that's random. Wait, what's cats?

02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.400
In the title by Daniel Dennett, Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:10.800
What does herding cats mean? What does free will inflation mean?

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:16.640
I love this essay, because it explained to me how I could live in a deterministic universe,

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:26.720
but have- not free will, but have freedom, you know, and also helped me explain that

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.800
time needed to be a real thing in this universe.

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:36.640
So what basically Dan was saying here is like, these cats appear to just do what they want,

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.560
right? And if you live in a deterministic universe, why do the cats do these things?

02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:44.800
You know, aren't they just- isn't this all obvious?

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.640
And how does free will inflate the universe?

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:53.680
And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay because my interpretation of the essay

02:18:53.680 --> 02:19:01.520
in assembly theory makes complete sense, because you need an expanding universe in assembly theory

02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:08.960
to create novelty that you search for that then when you find something interesting

02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:12.080
and you keep doing it because it's cool and it gives you an advantage,

02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.360
then it appears in the past to be a goal.

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.520
So what does in assembly theory, the expansion of the universe look like?

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:26.480
What are we- what are we talking about? Why is- why- why does the expansion of the universe

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:29.600
give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.080
So for me, I don't think about the universe in terms of big bang in space.

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.960
I think about in terms of the big- the big memory expansion that you have one- you only have the

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.800
ability to store one bit of information, so then you can't do very much.

02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:48.000
So what the universe has been doing since the- since forever, it's been creating more-

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.880
it's been increasing the size of its RAM.

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:57.440
Okay? So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte, three megabyte, four megabytes all the way up.

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:03.360
And so the more RAM you have, the more you can remember about the past,

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:07.040
then which allows you to do cooler things in the future.

02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:11.600
So if you can remember how to launch a rocket, then you might be able to imagine how to land a

02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:17.520
rocket and then relaunch, re-land and carry on because- and so the- the- the- you able- you're

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.960
able to expand the space and remember the past.

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:23.520
And so that's why I think it's very important.

02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:27.360
But not a perfect memory. It's- it's a- it's an interesting question whether

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.600
there's some forgetting that happens and might increase.

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:37.040
Is the expansion of the forgetting at some point accelerate faster than the- the remembering?

02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:41.120
I think that that's a very important thing that probably intelligence does and we're going to

02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:44.960
learn and machine learning about because you want machine learning right now or- or artificial

02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:50.160
intelligence right now doesn't have memory right, but you want the ability to- or not for- if you

02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:55.360
want to get to human-like consciousness, you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff

02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:59.440
and then to selectively forget stuff so you can re-remember it and compress it.

02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:02.000
Arguably the way that we come up with new physical laws-

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.120
Do currency.

02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:05.360
Yeah, like- yeah, sorry, you were-

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:07.040
No, no, sorry, no, I just wanted to-

02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:15.840
I- I think that there is a- a great deal to be gained from having the ability to remember things,

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:20.640
but then when you forget them, you can then have a- you can basically do the simulation again

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:25.200
and work out if you get to that compressed representation so that it's in cycles.

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:31.200
So cycles of memory- remembering and- and forgetting are probably important, but there

02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.320
shouldn't be excuse to have a met- universe of no memory in it.

02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:37.840
The universe is going to remember that it forgot, but just not tell you.

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.640
I'm- I'm looking at the- this paper and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:48.160
controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:50.560
conceptually easy to understand, but physically impossible.

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:51.600
It's physically impossible.

02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:53.520
It's predicting a fair coin toss.

02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:57.520
I don't know what he's talking about, but there's pictures of puppets controlling puppets.

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:03.840
Let me ask you- there's a- there's a few things I want to ask, but we brought up time quite a bit.

02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:06.720
You guys tweet about time quite a bit.

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:10.640
What is time in all of this?

02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:11.920
We kind of mentioned it a bunch.

02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:16.800
Is it not important at all in terms of- is it just a word?

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:18.800
Should we be talking about causality mostly?

02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:24.080
Like Sarah, what do you think is- we've talked about like memories.

02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:28.400
Is that the fundamental thing that we should be thinking about and- and time is just a useful

02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:30.480
measurement device or something like that?

02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:32.320
Well, there's different concepts of time, right?

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:35.760
So I think in assembly theory, when we're talking about time, we're talking about the ordering of

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:38.160
things. So that's the causal graph part.

02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:42.080
And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a certain ordering

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.560
and certain things can't happen until other things happen.

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:49.760
But usually when we colloquially talk about time, we're talking about the flow of time.

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.840
And I guess Lee and I were actually debating about this this morning.

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:58.800
So in talking on it, walking on the river here, which is a very lovely spot for talking about time,

02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:03.840
but that the- you know, that when the universe is updating, it's transitioning between

02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:06.800
things that exist now and things that exist now.

02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:10.960
That's really the flow of time.

02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:15.600
So there's- there's- you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:19.200
And then there's also an arrow of time that people talk about in physics,

02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.720
which is that time doesn't appear to have a directionality in fundamental physics,

02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:25.040
but it does to us, right?

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:26.720
Like we can't go backwards in time.

02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:29.760
And usually we- you know, that would be explained in physics in terms of,

02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:32.000
well, there's a cosmological arrow of time,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.720
but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time of increasing entropy.

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:39.200
But what we would say in assembly theory is that there is a clear directionality.

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:41.920
The universe only runs in one direction, which is why some things-

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:45.360
it's easy to make- if the universe runs in one direction,

02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.520
it's easy to make processes look reversible.

02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:50.880
For example, if they have no memory, they're easy to run forward and backwards,

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:54.080
which is why the laws of physics that we have now look the way they do,

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:56.480
because they involve objects that have no memory.

02:23:56.480 --> 02:24:00.480
But when you get to things like us, it becomes very clear that the universe has a directionality

02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:01.360
associated to it.

02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:02.960
So it's not reversible at all.

02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:06.240
It's the no man ever steps in the same river.

02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:08.320
I just have to bring that up because you won't go on the river.

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:11.040
No man has ever steps in the same river twice,

02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:13.440
for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.

02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:16.160
So it's not reversible, any of the same.

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:19.360
No, no, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?

02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:22.000
So we think of the reversibility of laws as being fundamental

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.840
and the irreversibility as being emergent.

02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:26.800
But I think what we would say from how we think about it,

02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:29.520
and certainly it's easy to get the case for our perception of time,

02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:32.400
but also what's happening in biological evolution,

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.120
you can make things reversible, but it requires work to do it.

02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:40.400
And it requires certain machines to run it forward and backward.

02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:42.640
And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.480
on a constructor theory related to that,

02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:45.920
which is a totally different set of ideas.

02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:49.600
So you can travel back in time sometimes.

02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.000
Yes, you can't travel actually back in time,

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.840
but you could reconstruct things that have existed in the past.

02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:00.640
You're always moving forward in time, but you can cycle through.

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:03.360
Can I clarify what you just said?

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:06.160
Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back?

02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:06.960
Yes.

02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:09.040
Thank you, that really clarified it.

02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:12.400
What Sarah is saying is you don't go back in time,

02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:15.840
you recreate what happened in the past, in the future, and inspect it again.

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.040
So in that local pocket of time, it's as if you travel back in time.

02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:22.160
So how's that not traveling back in time?

02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:24.720
Because you're not going back to your same self, back in time.

02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:27.200
You're creating that in the future.

02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.040
What else is the same as it was in the past?

02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.440
No, no, no, no.

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:32.640
It's not in registry.

02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:34.080
I mean, it goes back to the big question.

02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:38.400
I'm saying, I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:42.000
when we first had this discussion and I was talking to Sarah on Skype.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.840
And I said, by the way, time is the fundamental thing in the universe.

02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:47.360
She almost hung up on me.

02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:50.960
Right, but you can even, I mean, if you want to make an analogy to computation,

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:52.880
and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this,

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:56.960
like about reversible computation and reversible Turing machines,

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:00.560
in order to make it reversible, you have to store memory to run the process backwards.

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:03.760
So time is always running forward in that.

02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:06.560
So you can't erase the memory.

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.200
You can erase the memory, but the point, when you go back to zero, right?

02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:17.280
But the whole point is that in order to have a process that even runs in both directions,

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.600
you have to start talking about memory to store the information to run it backwards.

02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.080
I got it.

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:26.880
So you can't really then, you can't have it exactly how it was in the past.

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:28.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.880
So you have extra stuff, extra baggage always.

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.280
A really important thing I want to say on this,

02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:38.240
I think if I try and get it right, I just say that if you can think that the universe is expanding

02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:44.080
in terms of the number of boxes that it has to store states, right?

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:48.880
And this is where the directionality of the universe comes from, everything comes from.

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:53.840
You could erase what's in those boxes, but the fact you've now got so many boxes at time

02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.000
now in this present, there's more of those boxes than there were in the past.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.160
But the boxes aren't physical boxes.

02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:03.360
It's not space or time.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.680
Why is the number of boxes always expanding?

02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:08.960
It's very hard to imagine this because we live in space.

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:16.480
So what I'm saying, which is I think probably correct, is that we just let's just imagine for

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:22.480
a second, there is a non-local situation, but there are these things called states

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:30.320
and that the universe, irrespective of whether you measure anything, there is a universal,

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.720
let's call it a clock or a state creator.

02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.840
Maybe we can call it, that's why maybe you can call it God, but let's call it a state creator

02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:40.880
where the universe is expanding and the number of states it has.

02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:43.200
Why are you saying it's expanding though?

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.560
Is that obvious that it's expanding?

02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.000
It's obvious because that's where the, because we...

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.240
That's a source of novelty.

02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:54.800
It's a source of novelty and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.

02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:56.960
I didn't know it's not predictable.

02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:57.600
Well, it's...

02:27:57.600 --> 02:27:59.120
I just like interrupting him.

02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:01.360
Sorry, it's fun because you're struggling.

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:06.480
I'm struggling because I'm trying to be as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm insane.

02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:08.560
And I'm not insane.

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.240
It's obvious because you...

02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:18.800
I'm a chemist, so as a chemist I grew into the world understanding irreversibility.

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:20.880
Irreversibility is all I knew.

02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:27.200
And when people start telling me the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick.

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.480
We can use time to do it.

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:37.440
So what I mean is the second law is really the magical.

02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:39.920
But why does it need to be magical?

02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:41.440
The universe is just asymmetric.

02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:44.560
All I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric in the state production.

02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:50.320
And we can erase those states, but we just have more computational power.

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.440
So what I'm saying is that the universe is deterministic horizon.

02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:57.840
This is one of the reasons we can't live in a simulation, by the way.

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:00.000
The irreversibility.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.040
You can't live in a simulation.

02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:02.400
The irreversibility.

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:02.880
Yeah, yeah.

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:06.560
So basically every time you try and simulate the universe in this, you know,

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:09.040
I live in a simulation, the universe is expanded in states.

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.360
Like, oh, damn it, I need to make my computer bigger again.

02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:14.480
And every time you try and contain the universe in the computation,

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:16.560
because it's got bigger in number of states.

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:22.720
And so I'm saying the fact the universe has novelty in it is going to turn out

02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:29.520
experimentally to be proof that time, as I've labeled it, is fundamental

02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:33.920
and exists as a physical thing that creates space.

02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:38.800
Okay, so if you can prove that novelty is always being created,

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:43.920
you're saying that it's possible to also then prove that it's always expanding

02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:45.360
in the state space.

02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:48.080
Those are things that have to be proven.

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.920
That's what working experiments for, yeah.

02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:53.440
And you're trying to, like by looking at the sliver of reality,

02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:56.320
show that there's always novelty being generated.

02:29:56.320 --> 02:30:01.680
Yeah, because if we go live in a universe that the conventional physicist would live in,

02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:04.240
it's a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.

02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:12.160
I want to prove that that book doesn't exist, it's continuously being added pages on.

02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:15.280
So what I'm saying, if the universe is a book, we started,

02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:19.760
the universe at the beginning only had no pages or had one page, another page, another page,

02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:22.400
whereas the physicists would now say all the pages exist,

02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:24.640
and we could in principle access them.

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:27.120
I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.

02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:29.200
Do you know what's written in this book?

02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:30.240
The free will question.

02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:40.640
Is there room for free will in this view of the universe is generating novelty

02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:46.000
and getting greater and greater assembly structures built, Sarah?

02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:47.040
Yes.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:48.880
Okay.

02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:49.120
Done.

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:50.400
Next question.

02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:52.960
Why, what's the source of free will in this?

02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:57.440
Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but...

02:30:58.240 --> 02:30:58.640
Yeah.

02:30:58.640 --> 02:30:59.280
Well, please.

02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:05.520
I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is,

02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:09.840
do we have individual autonomy and agency?

02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:15.200
And when I do things, is it really me or is it my atoms that did it?

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:19.120
And that's the part that's interesting to me.

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:21.920
I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part.

02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:30.240
But the way I think about it is each of us are a thread or an assembly space through

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.520
this giant possibility space.

02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:37.680
And it's like we're moving on our own trajectory through that space,

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:39.520
and that is defined by our history.

02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:41.920
So we're causally contingent on our past,

02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:48.960
but also because of the intersection of novelty generation,

02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:51.280
it's not completely predetermined by the past.

02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:57.840
And so then you have the causal control of the determinism part,

02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:01.440
that you are your causal history and there's some determinism from that past,

02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:04.320
but there's also room for creativity.

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:08.640
And I think it's actually necessary that something like free will exist

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:11.280
if the universe is going to be as creative as possible.

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:17.280
Because if I were all intelligent being, inventing a universe,

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.400
and I wanted it to have maximal number of interesting things happen,

02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:24.640
again, we should come up with the metric of interesting.

02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:33.680
But generating maximal possibilities, then I would want the agents to have free will

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:37.920
because it means that they're more individual.

02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:42.320
Each entity actually is a different causal force in the universe.

02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:46.480
And it's intrinsic and local property of that system.

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:49.760
There's a greater number of distributed agents.

02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:53.520
Like are you always creating more and more individuality?

02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:58.880
Kind of. I would say you're creating more causal power, but...

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:01.600
So causal power, the word consciousness,

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:05.120
is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?

02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:07.680
I mean, that's why I have this conception of consciousness

02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:09.040
being related to imagination.

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:11.200
Because the more that we can imagine can happen.

02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:14.640
And the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind,

02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:16.240
the more you can actually implement.

02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:20.000
And somehow free will is also at the intersection of the counterfactual becoming the actual.

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:25.760
So can you elaborate on that a little bit, that consciousness is imagination?

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:27.600
I don't know exactly how to articulate it.

02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:31.280
And I'm sure people will take aim at certain things I'm saying,

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:33.040
but I think the language is really imprecise.

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:34.800
So I'm not the best way to...

02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:36.240
It's really interesting.

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:42.880
Like what is imagination and what role does it play in the human experience,

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.560
in the experience of any agent?

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:46.320
I love imagination.

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:49.360
I think it's like the most amazing thing we do.

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:51.360
But I guess one way I would think about it is,

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:54.960
we talked about the transition to life being the universe acquiring memory.

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.560
And life does something really interesting.

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.560
Just think about biology generally.

02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:01.920
It remembers states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future.

02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:04.640
So the longer life has evolved on this planet,

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:06.560
the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:08.720
the more kinds of organisms and things.

02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:12.640
But what human level intelligence has done is quite different.

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.880
It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before,

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:19.520
it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed,

02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:22.480
and we can actually make them come into existence.

02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:26.400
And I think that's the most unique feature about the transition

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:30.160
to whatever we are from what life on this planet has been doing

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:31.920
for the last four billion years.

02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:34.800
And I think it's deeply related to the phenomena we call consciousness.

02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:36.240
Yeah, I was going to just agree with that.

02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:40.320
I think that consciousness is the ability to generate those counterfactuals.

02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:43.040
Now, whether you can say, you know, are there degrees of consciousness?

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.920
I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals,

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:53.360
although they do have some kind of, they are able to search a space and pathways.

02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:59.520
But I think that there is a very concrete, or concrete,

02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:03.040
there's a very specific property that humans have.

02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:05.040
And I don't know if it's unique to humans.

02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:08.880
I mean, maybe dogs can do it and birds can do it, right?

02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:11.600
And where they are basically solving a problem,

02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.320
because consciousness was invented, or this abstraction was invented by evolution

02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:17.840
for a specific reason.

02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:22.960
And so, look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:30.080
that time was fundamental was actually because Sarah and I had a completely different...

02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:32.400
The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.

02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:33.760
No, no, no, no, we had to...

02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:34.960
And which topic?

02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:37.520
No, it goes back to the free will thing.

02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.040
So I think the...

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.800
Although I've changed my view a bit because there's some really interesting physicists out there

02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:48.080
who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space...

02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:50.320
I don't want to go there just now because I think I'll mess it up.

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:54.720
But briefly, I could not see how the universe...

02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:55.920
How we could have free will.

02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:58.160
And I mean, this is really boring because this is like...

02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:00.080
This is a well trodden path, but I'll...

02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:01.680
But I'm not so boring.

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:02.560
I suppose it's kind of...

02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:03.440
We just want to be precise.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.880
If the universe is deterministic, how can we have free will?

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.080
So Sarah's a physicist.

02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:12.480
I think she believe...

02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:17.760
Not believe can show that most of the laws we have are deterministic to some degree,

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:20.160
quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.320
And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will.

02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:26.800
I'm like, your belief system is broken here, right?

02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:31.200
Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic universe.

02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:39.200
And then I realized that I agreed with her that I do think that free will is a thing

02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.360
because we are able to search for novelty.

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:43.840
And then that's where I came to the conclusion that time

02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:46.320
the universe was expanding in terms of novelty.

02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:48.880
And it goes back to that Darren Dennett essay that we're talking about,

02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:50.480
the free will inflation.

02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:53.520
So you have...

02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.320
So the past...

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.800
It did not exist in the past.

02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:58.640
The past exists in the present.

02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:01.520
What I mean is there was no past.

02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:02.560
There is only present.

02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:05.120
So that means you are the sum total.

02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:08.880
Everything that occurs in the past is manifestly here in the present.

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:13.360
And then you have this little echo state in your consciousness

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:18.080
because you're able to imagine something without actualization.

02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:21.600
But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons and potassium

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:24.560
iron flows in your neural network, in your brain.

02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:26.320
Maybe consciousness is just the present.

02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:32.000
So somehow you imagine that and then by imagining, oh, that's good.

02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.240
I'm going to make a robot do this thing and program it.

02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:38.000
And then you physically then go and do it.

02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:40.800
So that changes the future.

02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:41.120
Sorry.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:42.960
What's imagination?

02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:45.920
Does it require the past?

02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:47.600
Does it require the future?

02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:48.800
Does it require memory?

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:49.200
Does it...

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.640
So imagination...

02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.040
Does it only exist in the moment?

02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:54.240
So imagination is...

02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:59.120
Well, yeah, probably it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on.

02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:03.520
You can maybe your subconscious brain has been generating all the bits for it.

02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:09.920
But no, imagination occurs when you, in your game engine, you remember the past

02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:14.320
and you integrate sensory the present and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.

02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:15.440
And then you go and make that happen.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.760
So the imagination is this...

02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:21.520
It's like asking what imagination is about asking what surfing is.

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:26.240
You can surfboard, surf a wave coming in.

02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:31.120
When you're on that wave and you're surfing, that's where the imagination is.

02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:36.000
I think imagination is just accessing things that aren't the present moment in the present moment.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.600
So I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table and I can imagine the river and things

02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:42.560
or whatever it was.

02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:50.000
And so it seems to be that it's our ability to access things that aren't present.

02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:57.280
But to conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin to something that happened to you recently.

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:00.640
Right, but they don't have to be things that actually happened in your past.

02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:02.480
And I think this gets back to assembly theory.

02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.200
Like the way I would think about imagination from an assembly theoretic standpoint is I'm

02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:13.760
a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment as a particular configuration of Sarah.

02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:16.720
But there's a lot of...

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:18.480
I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.

02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:22.240
I have that whole causal history and I can access parts of it.

02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:26.080
Now, when you talk about getting to something as complex as us, having as large an assembly

02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:27.840
space as us, there's ways of...

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.440
Like there's a lot of things in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed

02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:37.120
in the past history of the universe because like the universe got big enough to contain

02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:40.320
the three of us in this room in time.

02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:48.400
But not all the features of each one of us individually have come into existence as physical

02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:50.320
objects we would recognize as individual objects.

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:55.360
This goes back to your point that we actually have to explain why things actually even look

02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:58.320
like objects and aren't just a smear of mass.

02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:03.920
And just on the free will and physics thing, when you were talking...

02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:07.120
I just want to bring this up because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint that

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:12.080
Nicholas Jisen has that we want to use the laws of physics and then say you can't have

02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:12.560
free will.

02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.040
And his point is you have to have free will in order to even choose to set up an experiment

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:18.160
to test the laws of physics.

02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:22.400
So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental than physics is because to even

02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:28.240
do science, there's some assumption that the agents have free will.

02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:34.080
And I always thought it was really perplexing that physics wants to remove agency because

02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:37.520
the idea that I could do an experiment here on this part of earth and then I can move

02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:42.400
somewhere else and prepare an identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again

02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.120
seems to imply something about the structure of our universe that is not encoded in the laws

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:48.400
that we're testing in those experiments.

02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:53.520
So this kind of dream of physics that you can do multiple experiments, different locations

02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:58.560
and then validate each other, you're saying that's an illusion?

02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:03.440
No, I'm saying that requires decision making and free will to be a real thing, I think.

02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:09.040
I think the fact that we can do science is not arbitrary and I think people,

02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.280
the standard canon in physics would be, well, you could trace all of that back to the initial

02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:17.600
condition of the universe, but the whole point of science is I can imagine doing the experiment

02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:19.600
and I can do it and then I can do it again and again and again.

02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:26.480
To your imagination, somehow fundamentally generative of novelty, so it's not like the

02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:28.560
universe could have predicted the things you imagined.

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:33.360
So coming back to novelty, I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,

02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:35.680
but it supercharges it. It's another transition, I think.

02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.640
I mean, this may be a boring statement, but I would say the fact that, sorry?

02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:42.640
I'm not sure. These are hard questions.

02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:46.320
Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist is yet another proof that

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:49.840
time is fundamental and novelty exists, right?

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:54.480
Because I think, again, if you ask the physicists to write down the infinite

02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:01.520
Bible of the universe, let's call it the Bible, the mathematical universe,

02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:04.720
whether you're on Max Teckmark or Sean Carroll or Frank Wilczek

02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:10.320
or Stephen Wolfram, okay?

02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:12.160
I like that book.

02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:14.400
Yeah, I love it too. There's lots of pretty pictures.

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:19.760
It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity of the universe by saying, well,

02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:22.000
it's all there mathematics, it all exists, right?

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.800
And I would say that that's why I'm excited about the future of the universe because it,

02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:35.200
although it is somehow dependent upon the past, it is not constrained just by the past,

02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:37.920
which is kind of mad.

02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.400
Yeah, that's what free will is. It's not constrained by the past.

02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.320
It's dependent on the past. This moment, it's not just dependent.

02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:52.800
This moment is the past, and yet it has the capacity to generate a totally unpredictable future.

02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:56.240
I mean, the other thing I would say is super important for human beings, right?

02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:59.840
Human beings have actually very little cause or control in the future.

02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:02.000
I realize this the other week.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:03.360
Oh, then we have future in the future.

02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:06.160
Yeah, yeah. So what happened? So this is what I think it is.

02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:11.280
The way, by reinterpreting your past, I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive,

02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:17.120
psychological cognitive point of view, by reinterpreting your past in your current mind,

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:20.480
you can actually help you shape your future again.

02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:26.720
So you, but you have much more freedom to interpret your past, to act in the present,

02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.160
to change your future than you do to change your future. I may sound weird,

02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.760
so I'm saying to everybody, imagine your past, think about your past,

02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:39.200
reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can, then imagine what you can do next,

02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:41.840
or imagine your past in a more negative way and what you do next.

02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:44.400
And look at those two counterfactuals, they're different.

02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:47.040
Yeah, it's fast. I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this,

02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.960
that most of our life is lived in our memories. And it's interesting because you can

02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:56.240
essentially, in imagination, choose the life you live. So maybe free will exists in imagination.

02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:03.600
Choices are made in your imagination. And that results in you basically able to control

02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:10.000
how the future unfolds. Because you're like, imagining, like reinterpreting constantly,

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.360
the things that happen to you.

02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:15.200
Exactly. So if you want to increase your amount of free will,

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:18.560
those people that have most, I don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency,

02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:25.920
because of our sad constraints, whether you know, happenstance, health, economic,

02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:33.040
born in a certain place, right? But those of us that have the ability to go back and

02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:40.880
reinterpret our past, and use that to change the future, are the ones that exert most agency

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:47.920
in the present. And I want to achieve higher degrees of agency and enable

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:51.840
everyone else to do that as well, to have more fun in the universe.

02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:54.320
Then we'll hit that peak, maximum fun point.

02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:57.280
I don't think there's ever going to be a maximum, I think it's,

02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:59.840
the wonderful thing about the future is there's always going to be more fun.

02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:05.440
Yeah, you, I think, again, go back to Twitter, I think,

02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:09.760
you lead tweeted something about being a life maximalist that you want to maximize the number

02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:15.920
of life, the amount of life in the universe. So, and, you know, that's the more general

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:21.520
version of that goal is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe, because life is a subset

02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:26.240
of fun. They're all kinds of, I suppose they're either correlated or exactly equal, I don't know.

02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:30.640
Anyway, speaking of fun, let me ask you about alien sightings.

02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:35.040
So there's been quite a bit of UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff.

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:46.240
What do you think would be the first time when humans sight aliens, see aliens in a sort of

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:52.400
unquestionable way, this extremely strong and arguable way

02:45:54.160 --> 02:46:00.960
we've made contact with aliens, Sarah, what would it look like? Obviously, the space of

02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:07.120
possibility is huge here, but if you were to kind of look into the future, what would that look like?

02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:15.040
Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there that slowly unravel the mystery, or would it be like

02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:22.400
an obvious overwhelming signal? So I think we have an obsession with making contact with events.

02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:28.800
So what do I mean by that is, you know, like people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.

02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:36.880
And I always think, you know, what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now is not

02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:41.760
that I have a disbelief about what people are experiencing or feeling, but like the discussion

02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:48.080
right now is sort of at the level of modern mythology. Aliens are our mythos in modern

02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:55.040
culture. And when you treat it like that, then I want to think about when do things that we

02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:59.760
traditionally only regularize through mythology actually become things that become standard

02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:04.480
knowledge? So, you know, like it used to be, you know, variations in the climate were described

02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:08.480
by some kind of gods or something. And now it's like, you know, our technology picks up an anomaly

02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:14.160
or someone sees something, we say it's aliens. And I think the real thing is it's not contact with

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:19.920
events, but like first contact is actually contact with knowledge of the phenomena or the explanation.

02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:25.840
And so this is very subtle and very abstract, but when does it become something that we actually

02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.840
understand what it is that we're talking about? That's first contact. It's not-

02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:35.040
Would you make the myth, would you give credit to the myth, the mythology as first contact?

02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.680
Because you- I think yes, I think it's the rudimentary that we have some understanding

02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:43.200
that there's a phenomena that we have to understand and regularize. So I think-

02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:45.520
Right, to understand that there is weather. Yes.

02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:48.400
You have to construct a pathology on that weather. Yes.

02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:54.640
It's something that's controllable. I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.

02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:02.480
It could be that, you know, although there's lots of alien sight, so-called alien sightings,

02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:05.520
right? So there are a number of things you can do. You could just dismiss them and say they're

02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:09.600
not true. They're kind of made up. Or you say, well, there's something interesting here, right?

02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:13.600
We keep seeing a commonality, right? We see the same phenomena again and again and again.

02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:18.000
Also, there's this interesting thing about human imagination. Even if they are-

02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:25.600
Let's not say made up, but misappropriated kind of other inputs. The fact that human consciousness

02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.800
is capable of imagining in contact with aliens, does that not tell us about something about

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.520
where we are in our position, in our culture, in our technology?

02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:35.360
It tells us not where in time we are.

02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:39.680
Could it be that we're making contact with- Let's say that- So let's say,

02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:43.520
let's take the most miserable version. There are no aliens in the universe. Life is only on earth.

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:48.480
That then, the interpretation of that is we're desperate to kind of understand why we're the

02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.720
only life in the universe, right? The other one is the other most extreme is that aliens are visiting

02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:57.360
all the time and we just, you know, we're just not able to capture them coherently. Or there's a

02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:02.720
big conspiracy and, you know, there's an area 51 and there are lizards everywhere and there's that.

02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.720
Or I'm kind of in favor of the idea that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea that we aren't

02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:14.240
alone in the universe and we're just running the simulation and we're seeing some evidence.

02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.960
You know, we don't know what life is yet. We do have some anomalies out there.

02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:27.680
We can't explain everything. And over time, you know, we will start to unpack that.

02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:32.960
One very plausible thing we might do, which might be boring for the average alien

02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:39.600
observer or believes that aliens are, as in intelligent aliens are visiting earth,

02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:44.800
it could be that we might go to the outer solar system and find a new type of life that has

02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:49.840
completely new chemistry. Bring these cells back to earth where you could say in my hand,

02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:55.920
on earth, here's RNA, DNA and proteins and look, cells self-replicating from Titan.

02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:00.560
We have this new set of molecules, new set of cells and we feed it stuff and it grows.

02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:08.640
That for me, if we were able to do that, which would be like the most, that would be my UFO

02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.640
sign. That's a good test. So you feed it and it grows. Yeah.

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:22.560
We've made, so not until you know how to feed the thing and it grows somehow.

02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:26.000
We can make a comic book, you know, the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:34.640
What would you say is between the two of you is the biggest disagreement about alien life out there?

02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:41.840
Is it from the basic framework of thinking about what is life to maybe what aliens look like,

02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.560
to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings? What would you think?

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:52.800
So I would say the biggest one is that the emergence of life does not have to be

02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:59.680
that it can't just happen once on the planet, that it could be two or more life forms present

02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:04.240
on the planet at once. And I think Sarah doesn't agree with that. I think that's like

02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:11.120
logically inconsistent. That's really polite. I'm really saying it's nonsense because you think.

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:15.280
Oh, likely is that. So the idea that what does it look like? Let's imagine

02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:21.200
two alien civilizations co-existing on a planet. What's that look like exactly?

02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:25.360
So I would say, I think I've got to get around your argument.

02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:31.040
Yeah, let's say that on this planet, there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry

02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:38.800
and one life form emerges based on carbon and interacts and there's an ecosystem based on carbon

02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:45.120
and there's an orthogonal. And so it's planetary phenomena, which is what you I think, right?

02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:50.320
But there's also one that goes on silicon. And because there's enough energy and there's enough

02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:55.360
stuff that these life forms might not actually necessarily compete

02:51:56.560 --> 02:52:00.640
evolutionarily. Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all because they're going to be

02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:03.680
co-constructing each other's causal chains. I think that's what you just got me.

02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:10.080
So there's no overlap in terms of their causal chains or very limited overlap.

02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:14.000
Yeah. So I think the only way I can get away with that is to say, right, life could emerge on a planet

02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:18.640
underneath. The lizard people under the crust of the earth.

02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:24.800
I think, I think, let's go, I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree. So,

02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:30.160
and I think Sarah actually has convinced me because of the life is a planetary phenomenon,

02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:35.600
the emotional life is a planetary phenomena. And actually, because of the way evolution

02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:40.480
selection works, then nothing occurs in isolation, the causal chains interact. So there is a common,

02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:42.480
there's a consensus model for life on the earth.

02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:48.240
But you don't think you can place aliens from elsewhere onto the, can't you just

02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:52.240
place multiple alien civilizations on one planet?

02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:57.840
Right. But I think, so you can take two original life events that were independent

02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:01.520
and commingle them. But I don't think when you're talking about,

02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:09.280
when you look at the interaction of that structure, it's like the same idea as like

02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:13.600
an experiment being an example of life, right? That's a really abstract and subtle concept.

02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:18.880
And I guess what I'm saying is life is information propagating through matter. So once you start

02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:26.000
having things interacting, they, in some sense, commingle and they become part of the same chain.

02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:29.840
This is, the commingling starts quickly. Yeah.

02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:32.320
It proceeds, we proceed to commingle quickly.

02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:37.600
Right, right. So you, you could say, so the question is then, the more interesting question

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:41.760
is, are there two distinct origins events? And I still think that there's reasons that

02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:46.880
on a single planet, you would have one origins event because of the time scales of cycling,

02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:52.480
of geochemistry on a planet. And also the fact that I don't think that the origin of life happens

02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:57.120
in a pool and like radiates outward through evolutionary processes. I think it's a multi-scale

02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:01.520
phenomenon happens at the level of individual molecules interacting, collections of molecules

02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:07.920
interacting in entire planetary scale cycles. So life as we know it has always been multi-scale.

02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:13.120
And there's, I'm brilliant examples of individual mutations at the genome level changing global

02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:18.560
climate, right? So there's a tight coupling between things that happen at, you know,

02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:24.080
the largest scale of our planetary scale and the smallest scale that life mediates.

02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:29.680
But it still might be difficult within something you will call as a single civil alien civilization,

02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:32.800
you know, different, there's species and stuff. But I think what, yeah,

02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:36.560
they can't, might not be able to communicate. But you're asking about life, not species, right?

02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:44.480
So what's the difference between one living civilization? This is almost like a category

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:50.800
question versus species, because it can be very different. The way evolution, because there's

02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:55.600
like island, like literally islands that you can involve different kinds of turtles and stuff.

02:54:55.760 --> 02:55:03.520
Yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is, if you look at the structure of two interacting living

02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:09.760
things, populations, and you look in their past and they have independent origins for their causal

02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:14.800
chain, then you would say one was alien, you know, they have different independent origins events.

02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:19.040
But if you look at their future by virtue of the fact they're interacting, their causal chains have

02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:26.960
become commingled so that then in the future, they are not independent, right? So that's why

02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.400
you would even define them as aliens. So the structure across time is two examples of life

02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:36.080
become one example of life because life is the entire structure across time.

02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:39.280
Right. But there could be a lot of variation with this.

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:44.640
Yeah. So the question we're all interested in is how many independent origins of a

02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.840
complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?

02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:57.760
But the idea of origin is easy for you to define because like when the two, when the

02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:06.160
species split in the evolutionary process, and you get like a dolphin versus a human

02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:10.400
or Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens, isn't there?

02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:16.720
They make a distinction here quickly. So I think, sorry to interrupt. What we're saying,

02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:21.120
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, Sarah, we won that argument because I think she's right,

02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:25.440
that once the causal chains interact and going forward. So we're talking about a number of

02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.440
things. Let's go all the way back before origin of life, origin of life on Earth,

02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:34.400
chemistry emerges. So there's all these, I would say there's probably mechanistically,

02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:39.520
the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way to get replicators, the ribosome kind of

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.880
was really rubbish at the beginning. And he just competed, competed, competed,

02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:47.280
got better and better ribosome. And suddenly that was a technology. The ribosome is the

02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:53.600
technology that way, boom, allowed evolution to start. So what I was trying to, why I interrupted

02:56:53.600 --> 02:57:00.240
you is say that once evolution has started using that technology, then you can speciate.

02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:04.960
And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said was convinced me of, because I was like,

02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:08.400
no, we can have lots of different chemistry, shadow, biosphere on Earth. And she's like,

02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:15.360
no, no, no, you have to have this, you have to get to this minimum evolutionary machine.

02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:20.400
And then when that occurs, speciation occurs, exactly what it's like dolphins, humans,

02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:27.680
everything on Earth. But when you're looking at aliens or alien life, there's not going to be

02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:31.600
two different types of chemistry, because they compete, they compete and interact and cooperate

02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:35.440
because the causal chains overlap, one might kill the other, one might combine with the other,

02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:40.720
and then you go on, and then you have this kind of this average, and sure, there might be

02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:45.520
respeciation. It might be have two types of emerging chemistry. It almost looks like the

02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:52.400
original life on Earth required two different pre-life forms, the peptide world and the RNA world,

02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:57.840
somehow they got together. And by combining, you got the ribosome. And that was the minimum

02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:04.480
competent entity for evolution. And would all alien civilizations have an evolutionary process?

02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:10.400
On a planet. So like, that's one of the almost, it's almost the definition of life,

02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:13.840
to create all those memories, you have to have something.

02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:15.280
Things have to change in time.

02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:15.680
Yeah.

02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:17.120
But there has to be selection.

02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:22.160
That's like an efficient, there's no other way to do it.

02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:24.880
No. Well, never say never, because soon I'll say that.

02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:28.880
That's the part that depresses me though, going back to like, I don't know, the earlier

02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:33.440
discussion on violence and things, like, and I don't know where somebody was tweeting about

02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:38.080
this recently, but like, you know, how much stuff had to die. Maybe it was you.

02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:39.280
Yeah.

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:48.400
Yeah. So we were talking about life. And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.

02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:52.080
Right. So selection means things had to be weeded out, right?

02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:52.480
So.

02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:55.360
Well, we can celebrate that. Death makes way for a tool.

02:58:55.360 --> 02:59:00.160
Yeah. I mean, and also, you know, one of the most interesting features of major extinction

02:59:00.160 --> 02:59:05.840
events in the history of our planet is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?

02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:09.520
So, and of course, you know, a lot of people make arguments, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs

02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:16.480
didn't go extinct. So in some ways, we can attribute our existence to all of that.

02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:21.600
But I guess I was just wondering sort of like, if I was going to build a universe myself,

02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:24.960
in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?

02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:25.920
But it does seem to be a universe.

02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:29.200
I think you have to. I mean, I think we're probably being over

02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:33.760
anthropomorphizing. I remember watching the blue, I think it was the blue planet,

02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:36.400
David Attenborough was showing these seals and because of climate change,

02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:39.760
some seals were falling off a cliff and how tragic that was. I was like,

02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:44.240
I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool. Look at the, those ones down there,

02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:47.920
they've obviously got some kind of mutations, some and they're not doing that dark thing.

02:59:47.920 --> 02:59:54.640
And so that poor gene will be weeded out. Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.

02:59:54.640 --> 02:59:57.760
And of course, as human beings have the ability to abstract and we empathize,

02:59:57.760 --> 03:00:01.360
we don't want to cause suffering on other human beings. And we should retain that.

03:00:01.360 --> 03:00:07.520
But we shouldn't look back in time and say, you know, how many butterflies had to die?

03:00:08.320 --> 03:00:14.080
I remember making, how many, if you think about the caterpillar, become the chrysalis,

03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:18.720
and then the butterfly getting out, how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering,

03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:22.800
if that process of pruning had not occurred, we have no butterflies.

03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:26.640
So none of the butterfly beauty in the world without all that pruning.

03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:31.680
So pruning is required, but we shouldn't anthropomorphize and feel sorry for the biological

03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:36.800
entities. Because that's, that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.

03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:42.480
What we should do is project forward and maybe think about what values we have across our species

03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:47.200
and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings. You know, you know, now that we know that animals

03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:53.040
suffer at some level, think about humane farming. When we find that plants can in fact,

03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:58.480
are conscious and can think and have prane, then we'll do humane gardening.

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:06.240
Until that point, we won't do it, right? I like this. Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature

03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:14.320
of murder. That's the title. I didn't say that, but okay. Well, I just insert it. I have a hard

03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:19.680
time with it, though. I think the way you put it, it's kind of... But it's the reality of,

03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:24.640
it's the reality of, it is beautiful. You know, there's an Instagram account called

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:30.960
Nature's Metal. And I keep following it, I'm following it because I can't handle it for

03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:36.960
prolonged periods of time. We evolve together, you dialogue. Yeah. We evolve together, but you

03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:43.200
die alone. You live alone too. It's a Gatsby thing. I don't know. We evolve together. Where's the

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:48.960
together? The together is the murder and the sex and murder. I just tried like my romantic vision

03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:53.760
of it to try to make me happy, Sarah, instead of sad, Sarah. I talk in third person when I think

03:01:53.760 --> 03:02:01.680
very abstractly, sorry, is this whole certain things can coexist so the universe is trying

03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:08.640
to maximize existence, but there's some things that just aren't the most productive trajectory

03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:13.200
together, but it doesn't mean that they don't exist on another timeline or another chain

03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:18.320
somewhere else. And maybe you would call that then some kind of multiverse or things, but

03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:24.320
what am I saying? I think you can't go down a level. I'm just making stuff up to make it feel

03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:29.520
better. No, you're not. I don't understand. Is it logical? And we need... No, I know, I know.

03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:34.320
If you look at bacteria, if you look at virus, I mean just the number of organisms that are

03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.880
constantly looking at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop. It's like a slaughter. Right.

03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:42.080
So... Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God. I mean, there's a whole thing about

03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:47.600
why is the universe unable to suffering? Individuals don't exist, right? So for this,

03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:53.600
I think if you think about life as an entity on earth, right? Let's just go back a second.

03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:57.360
I mean, I like that. I'll be ludicrous for a second. I don't exist. You don't exist, right?

03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:04.240
But the actions you do, the product of evolution exists, right? The objects you create exist

03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:10.400
quantitatively in the real world. If you then understand life on earth or alien life or any

03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:15.680
life in the universe, there's this integrated entity where you need cells in your body to

03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:20.800
die. Otherwise, you'd just get really big and you wouldn't be able to walk around, right? So,

03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:29.280
you do. Yeah. Yeah. So I think... It's the patterns that persist, not the physical things.

03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:34.480
And of course, we have... We place immense values on fellow human beings. And I'm

03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:39.120
majestic professor, does like other individual human beings.

03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:41.760
Now you're talking in third person too. I know it happens, right?

03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:46.160
So death, would you say... I mean, because you said evolution is a fundamental part of

03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:50.080
life. So death is a fundamental part of life. Yeah.

03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:56.000
Right now, it might not be in the future. We might hack some aspects of death

03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:02.080
and we'll evolve in different ways. But isn't there... I think Sarah mentioned this life density.

03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:11.200
Can't that become a problem? Like too much bureaucracy, too much baggage builds up.

03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:16.720
Like you need to keep... I think it's okay that we dissipate. I don't think of it like...

03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:23.280
Disappear, yes. No, but I mean, we're so fixated on ourselves as individuals and agents. And we

03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:28.800
were talking about this last night actually over dinner. But an individual persists for a certain

03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:33.680
amount of time. But what you want to do, like if you're really concerned with immortality, is not

03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:38.960
to live indefinitely as an individual, but maximize your causal impact. So what are the traces of you

03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:45.680
that are left? And you're still a real... I always think of Einstein. Like for a period of time,

03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:50.640
he was a real physical thing we would identify as a human. And now we just see echoes of that human

03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:55.920
in all of the ways that we talk about his causal impact. Or frankly, right is another great example.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.120
How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future? Like, oh, I got you.

03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:05.920
So I guess the question is, how much do you want to control the localization of certain features

03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:12.880
of, say, a packet of propagating information we might call person and keep them localized to

03:05:12.880 --> 03:05:16.960
one individual physical structure? Or do you want to... Is there a time when that just becomes a

03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:23.040
dissipated feature of the society that it once existed in? And I'm okay with the dissipated

03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:27.120
feature because I just think that makes more room for more creativity in the future.

03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:34.400
So you mentioned engineering life in the lab. Let me take you to Computer Science World.

03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:44.400
What about robots? So is it possible to engineer... Because you're really talking about

03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:51.600
like engineering life at the chemistry level. But do you think it's possible to engineer

03:05:52.560 --> 03:06:01.040
life at the humanoid level, at the dog level? Or is that... At which level can we instill

03:06:01.040 --> 03:06:07.440
the magic of life into inanimate stuff? No, I think you could do it at every level. I just

03:06:07.440 --> 03:06:13.520
think that we're particularly interested in chemistry because it's the origin life transition

03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:17.440
that presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it, is going to give you the most

03:06:18.320 --> 03:06:25.360
and interesting or deepest insights into the physics. But presumably, everything that we do

03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:29.520
and build is an example of life. And the question is just how much do you want to take from things

03:06:29.520 --> 03:06:36.080
that we have now and put them into examples of life and copy them into machines? I saw that there

03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:40.800
was this tweet again. I think you were at the Mars conference and you were hanging out with a

03:06:40.800 --> 03:06:46.640
humanoid robot. Yes. That was a fun time. Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.

03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:52.000
Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot or did that accidentally happen?

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:56.320
Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi. Toro voice, would that be the correct name for

03:06:56.320 --> 03:07:02.560
the color? I think so. We didn't color coordinate our outfits. Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did.

03:07:02.560 --> 03:07:07.600
The robot probably did. Much more stylish. So for people who are just listening, there's a picture

03:07:08.160 --> 03:07:14.800
Sarah standing next to a humanoid robot. I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.

03:07:14.800 --> 03:07:18.400
Actually, no, I just... I did that perfectly. There's a lighter.

03:07:19.520 --> 03:07:25.120
No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested. Sorry to interrupt. Was it manual control? Was

03:07:25.120 --> 03:07:31.520
it actually stabilizing itself? Oh, no, it was walking around. Oh, nice. Yeah. Nice. It was

03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:35.680
pretty impressive. I mean, actually, there's some videos online of Jeff Bezos walking with one of

03:07:35.680 --> 03:07:42.880
those across the lawn nearby there. Yeah. So... I wasn't invited.

03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:53.920
Yeah, but there you go. See? That's incredible, isn't it? Yeah.

03:07:53.920 --> 03:07:58.400
See, you look at the walking robot. Where did the idea for walking come from? It was invented by

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:03.360
evolution, right? And us as human beings able to conceptualize and design and engineer.

03:08:03.440 --> 03:08:08.560
The causal chain. So that robot is evidence of life. And so I think what's going to happen is

03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:15.760
we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically. How can you literally go from

03:08:15.760 --> 03:08:21.360
sand to cells? So that's the first transition. I think there are a number of problems we want to do.

03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:26.480
Make life in the lab. Great. Then we want to make life in the lab and we want to suddenly start to

03:08:26.480 --> 03:08:32.240
make intelligent life or life that can start to solve abstract problems. And then we want to make

03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:39.600
life that is conscious. Okay. In that order. I think it has to happen that order. Getting

03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:43.600
towards this artificial general intelligence. I think that artificial general intelligence

03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:48.480
can't exist in a vacuum. It has to have a causal chain all the way back to Luca, right?

03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:52.320
And so the question I think I really like the question is to say,

03:08:54.240 --> 03:09:00.880
how is our pursuit of more and more life like? I know you want to, you like robots,

03:09:00.880 --> 03:09:05.520
you want to project into them, you want to interact with them. I think you would want,

03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:08.560
if you have a robot dog and a robot dog does everything expected from a normal dog and you

03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:12.560
can't tell a difference, you're not really going to ask the question anymore if it's a real dog

03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:16.720
or not. Or you've got a personality, you're interacting with it. And so I think what would

03:09:16.720 --> 03:09:22.400
be interesting would be to kind of understand the computational architecture, how that evolves,

03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:26.560
because you could then, you know, teleport the personality from one object to the other and

03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:32.320
say, right, does it act the same? And I think that as we go along, we're going to get better and

03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:37.840
better at integrating our consciousness into machines.

03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:44.560
Well, let me ask you that question just to linger on it. I would call that a living

03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:52.800
conscious thing potentially, I as a human allegedly, but would you as a person try to define life?

03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:56.160
If you pass the Turing test, are you a life form?

03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:02.880
One of the reasons I walked up to the robot was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?

03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:11.200
So it felt like I was, and I base a lot of my interaction with reality on emotion and feeling,

03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:15.200
but like, how do you feel about an interaction? And I always love your point about like, is it

03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:19.520
enough to have that shared experience with a robot, right? So walking up to it, does it feel

03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:24.320
like you're interacting with a living thing? And it did to an extent. But in some degrees,

03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:28.720
it feels like you're interacting with a baby living thing. So I think our relationship with

03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:34.560
technology in particular robots we build is really interesting because basically, they exist as

03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:39.840
objects in our future in some sense, like we're much older evolutionary lineage than robots are,

03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:46.320
but we're all part of the same causal chain. And presumably, you know, they're kind of in their

03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:50.720
infancy. So it's almost like you're looking at the future of life when you're looking at them,

03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:56.880
but it hasn't really become life in a full manifestation of whatever it is that they're

03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:04.160
going to become. And, you know, the more, the example of the walking robot was super interesting,

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:08.400
but they also had a dolphin that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,

03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:13.680
and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool. And, you know, it's in this kind

03:11:13.680 --> 03:11:19.680
of uncanny valley because, and I was having this conversation with a gentleman named Mutu,

03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:24.160
who was super perceptive, but he was basically saying like, it made him feel really uncomfortable.

03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:30.720
And I think, yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response. And I guess my point

03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:34.960
about it is, it is kind of interesting because you're basically trying to make a thing that you

03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:40.400
think is nonliving mimic a living thing. And so, so the thought experiment I would want to run in

03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:45.520
that case is, imagine we replaced every living thing on earth with a robot equivalent, like all

03:11:45.520 --> 03:11:50.320
the dolphins and things. And in some sense, then you're making, if you think that the robots aren't

03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:55.120
experiencing reality, for example, in the way that a biologically evolved thing would, you're

03:11:55.120 --> 03:12:02.000
basically making the philosophical zombie argument become real and basically building

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:07.200
reality into a simulation because you've made everything quote unquote fake in some sense.

03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:10.880
You've replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.

03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:17.920
So as opposed to being excited by the possibility of creating something new,

03:12:17.920 --> 03:12:22.240
you're terrified of humans being replaced.

03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:26.080
I was just trying to run like, what would be the absolute, you know, thought experiment,

03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:31.440
but I don't think that scenario would actually play out. I guess what I think is weird for

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:36.320
why we feel this kind of uncanny valley interacting with something like the robot dolphin

03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:40.000
is we're looking at an object we know is kind of in the future in the sense of like,

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:44.080
if everything's ordered in time, but it's borrowing from a structure that we have common

03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:49.120
history with. And it's basically copying in a kind of superficial way things from one

03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:52.320
part of the causal chain to another. Yeah.

03:12:53.120 --> 03:12:54.880
Well, that's, that's a video.

03:12:55.680 --> 03:13:01.040
Everybody believed it was real. They look so real. And obviously,

03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:03.520
a technology was developed for movies. So

03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:08.000
Well, I think we're confusing our emotional response and understanding the causal chain

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.400
of how we got there, right? Because the philosophical zombie argument thinks about

03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:17.600
objects just appearing, right, that you're facsimile in some way. Whereas there is

03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:22.160
the cause of the chain of events that caused the dolphin to be built went for human being.

03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:25.440
Yeah, would a philosophical zombies still have a high assembly index?

03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:31.360
Yeah. Because it came it can't be philosophical zombies can't like like Boltzmann brains just

03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:35.200
can't appear out of nowhere. Well, I guess my question would be in that that scenario where

03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:38.560
you build all the robots and replace everything on earth with robots with the with the biosphere

03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:44.320
be as creative under that scenario or not. And so are there are there quantitative differences

03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:48.400
you would notice over time? And it's not obvious either way, right? It's not obvious right now

03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:53.120
because we don't really we don't understand we haven't built into machines how we work.

03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:58.400
So that's I think that there are one of the big missing things that I think that we're both

03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:03.680
looking for, right? It's a cute robot. But the point there is that the biosphere won't be as

03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:12.240
creative if you did it right now. No, of course, but in the future, we will be able to solve the

03:14:12.240 --> 03:14:20.480
problem of origin of life, intelligence and consciousness, because they exist in physical

03:14:20.480 --> 03:14:26.160
substrates, we just don't understand enough about the material substrate and the causal chain.

03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:30.720
But I'm very confident we will get to an AGI, but it won't be what people think it won't be

03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:36.480
solution won't be a we'll get fooled a lot. And so GPT three is getting better at falling us and

03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:43.920
GPT 153 might really fall us, but it won't have the magic we're looking for it won't be a creative.

03:14:44.880 --> 03:14:51.120
But it will help us understand the differences between really though, because isn't that what

03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:58.960
love is being fooled? Like what why why are you not giving much value to the emotional connection

03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:04.000
with objects with with robots with humans? Emotion is that thing which happens when you're

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:10.480
when you're the the funk your expectation function is is dashed and something else happens.

03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:14.880
Right. I mean, that's what emotion is. Is that what love is to you? Yeah.

03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:20.800
You were expecting one thing and something else happened. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think that's

03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:25.120
true either. Well, what is it then? I think no emotion. Look, I'm sorry emotion is that but

03:15:25.120 --> 03:15:30.400
but I think love is just fulfilling your purpose. No, but I'll can we look like look like whatever

03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:34.560
that means. I mean, really? So yeah, okay. So when are you happiest is like when you're all right?

03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:39.440
All right. Let me go back if you want to follow your bliss. Let me define love quickly. Okay,

03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:45.040
in terms of assembly space, right? Excellent. I didn't think I'll be doing this today.

03:15:45.040 --> 03:15:49.760
I can't wait till assembly theory 101 is taught and the second lecture is assembly theory of love.

03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:59.760
It's being surprised. The expectation is being broken. I'm just I'm not an emotional being,

03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:04.160
but I would say so let's talk. So we'll talk about emotion a bit, but love is more complex is love

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:09.440
is a very complex set of emotions together and logical stuff. But if you've got this thing,

03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:15.520
this person that's on this causal chain that has this empathy for this other thing, love is being

03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:20.960
able to project ahead in your assembly space and work out what you're the person you're in love with

03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:27.360
has a need for and to do that for them without selflessly, right? Because you can project ahead

03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:31.360
what they're going to need and they are there and maybe you can see someone is going to fall over

03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:34.800
and you catch them before they fall over or maybe you can anticipate that someone's going to be

03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:39.520
hungry and without helping you, you just help them. That just sounds like empathy.

03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:44.640
But it's more complex than that, right? It's more complex. It's more about not just empathy,

03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:48.160
it's understanding. It's about kind of sharing that experience.

03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:52.240
You have an expression of love though. That's not what it's like to feel love like feeling love is

03:16:52.240 --> 03:16:58.560
like I like I think it's like when you're aligned with things that you feel like are your purpose

03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:06.160
or your reason for existing. So if you have those feelings towards a robot, why is that rope?

03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:12.800
Because you said the AGI will build an AGI but there'll be a fundamental difference in AGI.

03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:15.040
I don't think we'll build it. It's going to merge from our technology.

03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:20.480
I think you guys all are doing the same thing. I just said that GPT, that we do not correctly

03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:25.280
capture the causal chain that we have. Within GPT. Yeah, within AI.

03:17:25.440 --> 03:17:32.960
Don't you think it captures, because GPT-3 is fundamentally trained on a corpus of knowledge,

03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:38.960
you know, like the internet. Don't you think it gets better and better and better capturing

03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:43.520
the memory of all of them? It will be better at falling you and at some point you won't care.

03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:49.120
But when it comes, my guess, this is as quick as what I was getting to right before we got,

03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:54.880
I got in the Love Trap. Love Trap, yeah. It was like Lee Cronin in the Love Trap, you know.

03:17:57.040 --> 03:18:01.600
Sounds like a good band name. It makes it sad. Okay, it's sad. Assembly space is sad.

03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:08.960
No, it's so short, but I think there are other features that allow, that we pull on innovation

03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:14.160
that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT-3. So if you're being fooled there.

03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:19.120
So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability to be surprising and creative,

03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:28.160
whereas is it Dali, this thing, or if you take GPT-3 is not going to create a new verb. Shakespeare

03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:35.200
created new verbs. You're like, wow. And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language

03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:40.080
in a different domain. So I think having the connections across multiple domains is what

03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:45.840
you need for AGI. Yeah, but I don't know if you need, I don't know if there's any limitations to

03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:54.320
GPT and not being able to be cost domain. The number one problem is it's instantiated in a

03:18:54.320 --> 03:19:02.320
resource-limited substrate that we don't use in silicon. The architecture is used for training,

03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:08.720
for learning. It is about falling. It's not about understanding. And I think that there is some

03:19:09.360 --> 03:19:13.760
understanding that we have that is not yet symbolically representable.

03:19:13.760 --> 03:19:19.120
Language, learning language and using language seems to be fundamentally about fooling,

03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:23.840
not understanding. Why do you use language exactly?

03:19:23.840 --> 03:19:30.000
I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually. But I don't, I'm not sure I understand

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:35.600
how I'll make a coherent argument for that. But my feeling is that there is, there are,

03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:44.880
there is comprehension in reality in our consciousness below language. And we use those

03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:48.960
for language for all sorts of expressions. And we don't yet understand that there's a gap.

03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:52.880
We will get there. But I'm saying, wouldn't it be interesting? It's a bit like saying,

03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:59.600
could I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being, right? And let's just say I could copy

03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:04.880
all your atoms and the positions of all your atoms and electrons into this other person,

03:20:04.880 --> 03:20:09.920
they would be you. The answer is no. And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory,

03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:14.800
because actually the feature space that you have, that graph, the only way to copy you

03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:18.560
is to create you on that graph. So everything that's happened to you in your past,

03:20:18.560 --> 03:20:21.440
we have to have a faithful record for. If you want another copy of Lex,

03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:24.560
you have to do the exact thing. One other copy of Sarah, one other copy of Lee,

03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:29.680
the exact past has to be replicated. Let me push back on that a little bit. That's maybe from an

03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:36.080
assembly theory perspective, but I don't think it's that difficult to recreate a version of me,

03:20:36.080 --> 03:20:44.320
like a clone that would make everybody exactly equally as happy. Like they wouldn't care which

03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:50.080
one. And like there's two of me, and then they get to pick which one, and they'll kill either one,

03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:53.760
they'll be fine, as long as they're forced to kill. They'll be fine. But here's what will happen,

03:20:53.760 --> 03:20:58.640
is let's say we make artificial Lex. And it was like, wow, so cool, it looks the same interact.

03:20:58.640 --> 03:21:02.160
Then there'll be this battle of like, right, we're going to tell the difference. We're going to

03:21:02.160 --> 03:21:09.520
basically keep nudging Lex and artificial Lex until we get in novelty from one and we'll kill

03:21:09.520 --> 03:21:15.200
the other one. And I think thank God. We're not novelty is a fuzzy concept. That's the whole

03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:22.640
problem of novelty. So I will define novelty is not fuzzy. Novelty is the ability for you to create

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:30.320
architectures that are or create an architecture. So let's say you've got corpus of architectures

03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:34.800
known, you can write down, you've got some distance measure. And then I create a new one,

03:21:34.800 --> 03:21:39.920
and the distance measure so far away from what you'd expected is there's no linear algebra

03:21:39.920 --> 03:21:47.360
we're going to get this, like that is creativity. And we don't know how to do that yet on any level.

03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:50.640
Well, I was also thinking about like your argument about free will, like you wouldn't

03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:55.280
be able to know it was it doesn't work instantaneously. It's not like a micro level thing,

03:21:55.280 --> 03:21:59.840
but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories or longer term decisions. So

03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:06.000
if you think that the novelty manifests over those longer timescales, it might be the two Lexes

03:22:06.800 --> 03:22:12.560
diverge quite a bit over certain timescales of their behavior, even though nobody would notice

03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:20.160
the difference. They might not. And the universe, the earth won't notice the difference. The

03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:24.160
universe won't notice the universe would notice the difference. No, the universe doesn't know about

03:22:24.160 --> 03:22:28.880
its novelty. This being generated. That's the whole point of novelty. This is what selection is,

03:22:28.880 --> 03:22:34.400
right? It's like taking nearly equivalent ones and then deciding like the universe selects,

03:22:34.400 --> 03:22:38.880
right? So whatever selection is, select some things to persist in time. It's going to select

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:44.080
the artificial one. So it likes that one better. But you're mixing up two arguments here. So look,

03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:48.880
let's go back a second. What are you basing this argument on? I'm just saying that I kind of

03:22:49.600 --> 03:22:57.840
don't think, because at least said that it's not possible, like if you copy every single molecule

03:22:57.840 --> 03:23:04.880
in a person's body, that's not going to be the same person. That they won't have the same assembly

03:23:04.880 --> 03:23:10.480
index. It won't be the same person. And I just don't, I think copying, you can compress. Not only

03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:16.560
do I disagree with that, I just, I think you can even compress a person down to some where you can

03:23:16.560 --> 03:23:23.920
fool the universe. I'm saying, let me restate it. It is not possible to copy somebody on,

03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:29.600
because you, unless you copy the causal history. Also, you can't have two identical. I mean,

03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:33.040
actually, I really like the idea that everything in the universe is unique. So even if like,

03:23:33.040 --> 03:23:36.960
there were two lexes. I know you like that idea because you're human and you think you're unique.

03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:41.040
Yeah, exactly. But also, I can make a logical argument for it that even if we could copy,

03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:44.560
you know, all of your molecules and all their positions, the other you would be there. And

03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:49.520
you have a different position in space. You're distinguishable. Yeah, the other thing I was

03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:53.840
going to add. How unique are you just by the position in space, really? Sure. But then,

03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:57.760
how much does that light translation of lex sitting there affect the future? That's not an

03:23:57.760 --> 03:24:04.720
interesting, I see. But, but no, wait, wait a minute. Is part of the definition of something

03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:10.080
being interesting is how much it affects the future? Yes. Yes. But let me come back.

03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:14.960
But let me come back to one point quickly that you were making. Sure. I think I probably agree.

03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:19.600
There's two lexes, right? There's a robot lex that you just basically, it's a, it's a,

03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:26.320
it is a charade. It's a facsimile. It's just coded to emulate you.

03:24:27.440 --> 03:24:32.160
Are you a robot lex? I wouldn't know, right? But let's get there. That's a very, very important

03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:38.640
point here because he's ducking and diving between this eye. So, so if I facsimile you into a robot,

03:24:38.640 --> 03:24:43.760
then it would, your robot might be, would be a representation of you now, but fundamentally

03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:47.600
be boring because you go and have other ideas. If however you built an architecture,

03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:51.920
the itself was capable of generating novelty, you would diverge in your causal chain,

03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:56.240
and you're both be equally interesting to interact with. We don't know that mechanism.

03:24:56.240 --> 03:24:59.760
All I'm trying to say is we don't yet know that mechanism. We do not know the mechanism that

03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:07.120
generates novelty. And at the moment, in our AIs, we are emulating, we are not generating.

03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:11.680
You don't think we're sneaking up on that? No, there is no ghost in the machine.

03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:16.720
And I want there to be one. I want the same thing you want. Sorry, I was-

03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:22.160
I know you want that as a human because everything you just said makes you feel more special.

03:25:22.160 --> 03:25:26.640
I want to be, no, no, no, screw my specialness. I just want to be surprised. If I-

03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:30.640
You don't think a robot can surprise you? If I, if you can produce an algorithm in

03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:36.560
instantiated and robot surprise me, I will, I will, I will, I will have one of those robots

03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:42.640
to be brilliant, but they won't surprise me. But why, why is it a problem to think that humans

03:25:42.640 --> 03:25:49.360
are special? Maybe it's not the special, you're right. It's the better than. Yes. Because then

03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:55.280
you start to not recognize the magic in other life forms that you either have created or you have

03:25:55.280 --> 03:26:02.480
observed because I just think there is magic in legged robots moving about and they are full

03:26:02.480 --> 03:26:10.480
of surprises. Yeah. So this is- Infectionality. Yeah. So I'm a little- I know why you like cellular

03:26:10.480 --> 03:26:17.440
automata, right? But the, the specialness in your robot comes from the roboticist that built it.

03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:23.200
Yeah. It's part of the lineage. Yeah. And so that's fine. I'm happy with that.

03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:26.640
That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot was I was looking at 4 billion years of

03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:31.760
evolution. Yeah. Right. If it wasn't, so I think I'm happy. I mean, I'm happy we're going to coexist.

03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:34.640
I'm just saying you're going to get more excitement. There's something missing in our

03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:40.400
understanding of intelligence. Intelligence isn't just training. The way the neural network is

03:26:40.400 --> 03:26:44.160
conceived right now is great and it's lovely and it'll be better and we will argue forever. But

03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:49.520
you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said, look, I know how to invent an architecture

03:26:49.520 --> 03:26:56.560
and I can give it a soul. And what I mean by a soul is some, I know for real that there is

03:26:56.560 --> 03:27:01.920
internal reference. As soon as I'm not fake internal reference, and if we could generate

03:27:01.920 --> 03:27:05.280
that mechanism for internal reference, that's why our goal direct- That's why you have to-

03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:08.800
We can do that. That's for goal directness. Yeah. Get that goal directness. You would love that

03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:14.080
robot more than the one that's just made to look like it does because you'll have more fun with

03:27:14.080 --> 03:27:19.360
it because you better generate other problems, get more novelty. Hell, you'd be able to fall

03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:25.680
in love with that robot for real, but not the one that's faking it. What about fake it till you make

03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:36.160
it? Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with fake humans. It's nice to fall in love

03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:41.840
with something that's full of novelty, yes. I could imagine all kinds of robots that I would

03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:46.480
want to have a close relationship with. And I don't mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy.

03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:53.200
But I just don't think that novelty generation is such a special-

03:27:56.080 --> 03:27:59.520
Okay, there's like mathematical novelty or something like that, and then there's just

03:27:59.520 --> 03:28:03.920
humans being surprised. I think we're easily surprised. That's fine, but that's-

03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:07.200
But you don't think that's a good definition of novelty? No, that's good. I'm happy to be surprised,

03:28:09.760 --> 03:28:13.440
but not globally surprised because of someone else, but I really want, I was one,

03:28:13.440 --> 03:28:18.800
why I'm a scientist, I really want to be the first to be surprised about something and the

03:28:18.800 --> 03:28:23.280
first thing in the first in the universe to create that novelty and to know for sure that

03:28:23.280 --> 03:28:28.320
that novelty has never occurred anywhere else. That's a real buzz, right? That's a way to really

03:28:28.320 --> 03:28:32.880
know that. You have to have a really big look up, David. Right. Yeah, you're never going to be

03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:37.760
know for sure, right? That's one of the hard things about being a scientist searching for

03:28:37.760 --> 03:28:43.280
this type of novelty. Maybe that's why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery,

03:28:43.280 --> 03:28:48.720
but actually they are creating, and then when they do create a new mathematical structure,

03:28:48.720 --> 03:28:54.960
that they can then, you can write code to work out whether that structure exists before. That's

03:28:54.960 --> 03:29:00.400
almost why I would love to have been a mathematician from that regard, to invent new math that really,

03:29:00.400 --> 03:29:04.640
I know pretty much for sure does not exist anywhere else in the universe because it's so

03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:09.680
contingent. Right, but this gets into, you said a few times that I still really don't understand

03:29:09.680 --> 03:29:14.080
how you actually plan to do this, to build an experiment that detects how the universe is

03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:19.280
generating novelty or that time is the mechanism. The problem that we all have, which I think is

03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:24.640
what Lex is pushing against, is if I build the experiment, you don't know what you put into it,

03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:30.160
so you don't know what, unless you can quantify everything you put in, all of your agency,

03:29:30.160 --> 03:29:36.160
all the boundary conditions, you don't know if you somehow biased it in some way. So,

03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:40.160
is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment or to that robot, or is it something

03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:44.000
you gave it, but you didn't realize? It's going to be, it's going to asymptote towards that,

03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:48.000
right? You're never going to know for sure, but you can start to take out, you know, you can use

03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:53.600
good Bayesian approaches and just keep updating and updating and updating until you point to one

03:29:53.600 --> 03:29:58.080
sense of purposes. So you want to bound on how much novelty generation it could be. Yeah. Got it.

03:29:58.960 --> 03:30:03.600
So the ability to generate novelty is correlated with high assembly index,

03:30:03.600 --> 03:30:09.200
with assembly index? Yeah, and yeah. Because the space of possibilities is bigger.

03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:18.400
So that's the key, this could be a good, so we're running joke of like why Lex is single,

03:30:18.400 --> 03:30:27.280
this could be a good part four. So what you're looking for in a robot partner is ability to

03:30:27.280 --> 03:30:37.120
generate novelty. And that's, I suppose you would say it's a good definition of intelligence too.

03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:48.640
Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept. Is creativity better?

03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:55.920
Yeah, I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy. It's kind of the same. Maybe that's why aliens haven't come

03:30:55.920 --> 03:31:00.640
yet is because we're not creating enough novelty. Like there's some kind of a hierarchy of novelty

03:31:00.640 --> 03:31:05.120
in the universe. Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right? So it's a very passive

03:31:05.120 --> 03:31:08.720
thing. But I guess I would remember by saying creativity is I think it's much more active,

03:31:08.720 --> 03:31:13.680
like you think there's like a mechanism of like the things that exist or generating the creativity.

03:31:13.680 --> 03:31:18.160
Novelty seems to be there's some spontaneous production and it's completely decoupled from

03:31:18.160 --> 03:31:24.080
the things that exist. No, I understand. I think that creativity is the mechanism

03:31:24.080 --> 03:31:30.000
and novelty is the observable. Yeah, novelty could just be surprise. Your model of the world

03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:34.880
was broken and not necessarily in a positive way. That's surprise. So there's three things now.

03:31:34.880 --> 03:31:38.160
Let's go back to school. Right. Let's go. You've got surprise, which is basically,

03:31:38.800 --> 03:31:42.400
I'm, I don't, I mean, I'm surprised all the time because I don't read very much. I'm pretty dumb.

03:31:42.400 --> 03:31:47.520
I was like, Oh, wow. I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas. And I was really

03:31:47.520 --> 03:31:51.040
surprised by that. And then when looking at literature properly, and it's there. So surprise,

03:31:51.120 --> 03:31:57.760
that's to the extent that you don't have full information. Creativity, the act of pushing

03:31:58.640 --> 03:32:05.040
on that kind of on the causal structure and novelty, which is measuring that degree.

03:32:05.760 --> 03:32:11.200
Right. So I think that's pretty well defined in that regard. So you want your robot, I mean,

03:32:11.200 --> 03:32:15.760
and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet and the printing press share some,

03:32:16.480 --> 03:32:20.000
I actually think creativity has dropped a bit since the create, since the internet,

03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:23.920
because everyone's just, just, you know, just regurgitating stuff. But of course,

03:32:23.920 --> 03:32:28.080
now it's beginning to accelerate again, because everyone is using this tool to be creative.

03:32:28.720 --> 03:32:33.520
And boom, it's exploding. I think that's what happens when you create these new technologies.

03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:38.160
That's really, that's really helpful. There's a difference between novelty and surprise.

03:32:38.160 --> 03:32:42.960
Okay. I was, I think I was thinking about surprise. If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,

03:32:42.960 --> 03:32:47.120
it'd be great. Robot surprises me, you know, experiment that surprises you. Yeah. I mean,

03:32:47.120 --> 03:32:51.280
that's why I love doing experiments because I'm, I can't. It's still exciting. Yeah. Surprise is

03:32:51.280 --> 03:32:56.640
exciting. Yeah. Even negative surprise. Like some people love drama in relationships. Like,

03:32:58.000 --> 03:33:03.600
it's like, why the hell, why, why'd you do this? That could be exciting. I could imagine companies

03:33:03.600 --> 03:33:08.640
selling updates to their companion robots that just basically generate negative surprise just to

03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:13.360
just spice things up a bit. Yeah. It's the push and pull. That's, that's one of the components

03:33:13.440 --> 03:33:18.720
of love. As you said, love is a complicated thing. Oh, beauty. I wanted to mention this because

03:33:18.720 --> 03:33:22.960
you also tweeted, I think this was Sarah. No, it might have been Lee. I don't remember,

03:33:22.960 --> 03:33:29.600
but it was a survey published in nature showing that scientists find, yeah. Anyway, there's a,

03:33:29.600 --> 03:33:36.960
there's a plot published in nature of what scientists find beautiful in their work and it

03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:42.880
separates biologists and physicists. It'd be nice if you showed the full plot and there's simplicity,

03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:48.720
elegance, hidden order, interlogic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony, and so on.

03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:55.120
Is there any interesting things that stand out to you? I think the fact that biologists like

03:33:55.120 --> 03:34:01.680
complexity and pleasing colors. Oh, there's pleasing colors on there? Yeah. Yeah. Or shapes.

03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:06.400
Or shapes. Pleasing colors. And then physicists obviously love simplicity above all else. Simplicity

03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:13.520
and elegance. Simplicity and elegance. Yeah. They love symmetry and the biologists love complexity

03:34:14.640 --> 03:34:19.360
and, or they just love a little bit less. They love everything a little bit less,

03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:24.000
but complexity a little bit more. A little bit more. That's so interesting. And pleasing colors

03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:28.640
or shapes. Do you think it's a useful, I forget what your tweet was that this is missing some of

03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:36.640
something? No, I think it's because I think about how explanations become causal to our future. So

03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:44.720
I have this whole philosophy that the theories we build and the way we describe reality should be

03:34:45.680 --> 03:34:53.360
have the largest breadth of possibilities for the future of what we can accomplish. So in some

03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:58.480
sense, it's not like Occam's razor is not for simplicity. It's for optimism or the kind of

03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:04.480
future you can build. And so I think, I think you have to think this way when you're thinking about

03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:09.120
life and alien life, because ultimately we're trying to build, I mean, science is just basically

03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:13.600
our narratives about reality. And now you're building a narrative that is what we are as physical

03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:18.160
systems. It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible, because it's basically going to shape

03:35:18.160 --> 03:35:21.600
the future trajectory where we're going. And we don't use that as a heuristic

03:35:21.600 --> 03:35:27.440
in theory building, because we think theories are about predicting features of the world,

03:35:27.440 --> 03:35:30.960
not causing them. But if you look at the history of all of the development of human

03:35:30.960 --> 03:35:35.520
thought, it's caused the things that happen next. So it's not just about looking at the world and

03:35:35.520 --> 03:35:42.960
observing it, it's about actually that feedback loop that's missing. And it's not in any of those

03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:52.800
categories. What do you think is the most beautiful idea in the physics of life, in the

03:35:52.800 --> 03:35:58.240
chemistry of life, in this, through all your exploration with assembly theory,

03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:10.480
what is the thing that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful or potentially beautiful?

03:36:10.480 --> 03:36:17.360
For me, it's that the universe is a creative place. I guess I want to think, and whether it's

03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:24.800
true or not, is that we are special in some way, and it's not like an arbitrary added-on epiphenomenon

03:36:24.800 --> 03:36:28.720
or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist, but it's something deep and intrinsic to the

03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:35.040
structure of reality. And to me, the most beautiful idea that come out of that is that the reason we

03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:41.600
exist is for the universe to generate more things and to think about itself and use that as a

03:36:42.240 --> 03:36:52.000
mechanism for creating more stuff. That's for me. So the life that this however

03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:59.840
common it is, is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part of this universe, at least that we live in.

03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:06.720
It's always interesting to me because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity, and

03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:11.120
they're supposed to be our most fundamental theories right now. And they describe things

03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:16.160
like the interaction of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate, or all these kind of

03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:21.200
features. And they're these really deep theories, and they tell us a lot about how reality works,

03:37:21.200 --> 03:37:26.080
but they're completely agnostic to our existence. And I can't help but think that whatever

03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:32.960
describes us has to be even deeper than that. And I think incorporating memory, I guess,

03:37:33.600 --> 03:37:38.480
of causality, whatever the term you want to use into the physics of the world might be.

03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:43.120
That's the easiest way to do it. It's the cleanest- so here we go again with the physicists,

03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:48.080
I'm a physicist. I was going to say the simplest, most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of

03:37:48.080 --> 03:37:55.040
ways that we have these paradoxes associated with life when you- it's not that life is not

03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:02.000
current physics is not incompatible with life, but it doesn't explain life. And then you want to

03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:07.200
know where are the explanatory gaps. And this idea that we have an assembly, that time is

03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:13.040
fundamental and objects actually are extended in time, and have physical extent in time is the

03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:20.000
cleanest way of resolving a lot of the explanatory gaps. So I've been- I struggle with assembly theory

03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:27.600
for many years, because I could see this gap. And I think when I first met Sarah, and we realized

03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:34.480
we were kind of talking about the same problem, but we were- we understood none of the language,

03:38:34.480 --> 03:38:37.680
it was quite hilarious actually, because it's like, look, I've no idea what you're talking about,

03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:42.880
but I think it's- seems right. So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory is I

03:38:42.880 --> 03:38:48.000
realized the assembly theory explains why the universe- why life is the universe developing a

03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:53.840
memory, but not only that poetically, I could actually go measure it. And I was like,

03:38:54.880 --> 03:39:00.800
holy shit, we just- we physically measured this thing, this abstract thing, and we could measure

03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:06.560
it. And not only could we measure it, but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.

03:39:08.240 --> 03:39:14.800
And because, I mean, you know, I think as a kind of inventing this together with Sarah and her team,

03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:20.640
you know, I thought there was a quite a high chance that, you know, we're doing science,

03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:27.040
there's such a high probability we're wrong, you know, on this. And I remember kind of trying to go

03:39:27.040 --> 03:39:36.160
to hard physicists, mathematicians, complexity theorists, and everyone just kind of giving

03:39:36.160 --> 03:39:40.720
me such a hard time about it. And so, you know, this is kind of- this is- you've just done this,

03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:47.120
you've just done that, you know, you've just recapitulated an old theory. And I was unable,

03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:53.200
I lacked the language to really explain, and I had to- it was a real struggle. So this realization

03:39:53.200 --> 03:40:00.080
that life- what life does that physics cannot understand or chemistry is a universe develops

03:40:00.080 --> 03:40:07.040
a memory that's causally actionable. And then we can measure it, but it isn't just one thing,

03:40:07.040 --> 03:40:11.040
there is this intrinsic property of all the objects in the universe. Like I've said before,

03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:15.360
but you know, me holding up this water bottle isn't any other water bottle, but it is a sum total

03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:22.560
of all the water bottles that have existed, right? And will likely change the future of water bottles

03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:29.040
and for other objects. So it's this kind of- so for me, assembly theory explains the soul

03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:35.680
in stuff. But it- The monology. But it is monology. It's not like Sheldrake's Morphic

03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:41.200
Resonance, where we have this kind of wooey thing permeating the universe. It is the interaction of

03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:47.760
objects with other objects. And some objects have more instantaneous causal power. That's life,

03:40:48.480 --> 03:40:54.240
living things. And some objects are the instantaneous output of that causal power,

03:40:54.240 --> 03:40:58.320
dead objects, but they're part of the lineage. And that for me is fascinating and really beautiful.

03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:04.160
And I think that even if we're determined to be totally wrong, I think it will help us

03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:09.520
help, hopefully understand what life is and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the lab.

03:41:10.160 --> 03:41:13.520
How does that make you feel, by the way? Does it make you feel less special

03:41:13.520 --> 03:41:18.080
that you're so deeply integrated, interconnected to the lineage?

03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:22.000
I mean, I came on one level. I just wanted it in my life as a scientist. I wanted to have an

03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:26.800
interesting idea just once or an original idea. I mean, it was like, you know,

03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:32.400
so I think that was cool that we had this idea and we were playing with it. And I think also that

03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:38.640
I kind of, I mean, it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had the same kind of form,

03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:41.600
coming towards the same formulation, just from a completely different point.

03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:47.120
But no, it makes me feel special. And it also makes me feel connected to the universe. It

03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:53.440
also makes me feel not just humble about, you know, being a living object in the universe,

03:41:53.440 --> 03:41:57.040
but the fact that it makes me really optimistic about what the universe is going to do in the

03:41:57.040 --> 03:42:04.320
future, because we're not just isolated phenomena, we are connected. I will be able to have,

03:42:04.320 --> 03:42:09.040
you know, one of my small objectives in life is to change the future of the universe in some

03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:13.840
profound way just by existing. Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.

03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:23.200
I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely, because I just realize I'm not like,

03:42:23.200 --> 03:42:26.560
I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure, but I have so much overlap with the other

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:31.440
entities I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?

03:42:31.440 --> 03:42:39.760
And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact on the, how this whole thing unrolls

03:42:39.760 --> 03:42:43.440
on the future of the world. As individuals, that's, yeah.

03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:45.760
But I was going to say, local packets of agency.

03:42:45.760 --> 03:42:49.920
I think we all have a profound impact on the future, some more than others, right? All human

03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:54.880
beings, all life. And I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege in a way for, you know,

03:42:54.880 --> 03:43:00.640
to say, to assert some degree of ego and agency, you know, I'm going to make a computer or make

03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:04.960
an original life machine or do this thing. But actually, it's just like, you know, life's probably

03:43:04.960 --> 03:43:09.760
living, if there is a God or there's a soul in everything, it's really laughing at us going,

03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:15.120
I fool these guys by giving them ego. So they strive for this stuff and look what it does for,

03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:17.840
you know, the assembly space of the universe.

03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:22.160
And there's always a possibility that science can't answer all of it. So that part's challenging for

03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:29.680
me. There might be a limit to this thing. Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions,

03:43:29.680 --> 03:43:36.160
and I demand relatively short answers. Ali, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:47.280
Or what's the scary thing that pops to mind? Giving lecture, giving seminars in front of

03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:55.520
other scientists? Yeah, that is terrifying. If I had more time, I would ask you about the most

03:43:55.520 --> 03:44:02.880
embarrassing, but we'll spare you. What about you, Sarah? Scariest thing up there? Some of the

03:44:02.880 --> 03:44:09.120
scary things you've done? Actually, the scariest for me was deciding I wanted to get divorced,

03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:13.840
because it was like a totally radical life. Life transformed me. Yeah, because we had been married

03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:20.160
for a really long time. And I think it was just so much like, I realized so much of my

03:44:20.160 --> 03:44:23.760
individual agency I didn't realize I had before, and that was just really scary,

03:44:23.760 --> 03:44:29.200
like empowering scary, but terrifying. You were living in one way for your whole life,

03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:33.680
and then you realized your life could be a different way. Yeah, there is a between humans.

03:44:35.680 --> 03:44:39.840
The beautiful thing about love is the connection you have, but it's also become the dependency

03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:44.720
in breaking that, whether it's a mentor with your parents, your friends. It's almost like waking up,

03:44:44.720 --> 03:44:50.000
like just there's a different reality. Yeah, that was scary. Reinventing yourself. Okay,

03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:56.560
if you could, Lee, maybe I'll actually alternate. Sarah, if you could be someone else for a day,

03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:02.880
someone alive today, who you haven't met yet, or maybe you could do one who you've met, who would

03:45:02.880 --> 03:45:10.800
it be? Kim Kardashian. No joke. The woman's brilliant. I would just like to expere. I think

03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:17.280
she's got such an interesting and very deep understanding of social reality. But you also

03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:23.520
said you have appreciation of love for fashion. I do, but that's actually the same. I just think

03:45:23.520 --> 03:45:26.800
it's really interesting because we live in a social reality, which is completely artificially

03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:30.640
constructed, and some people are really genius about moving through that, and I think she's

03:45:30.640 --> 03:45:34.800
particularly good at it. I wonder if she's good at understanding her. I think it's very deeply

03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:39.360
intrinsic to her. She's like surfing away. How much cognitive awareness she has of it,

03:45:39.360 --> 03:45:42.960
or how strategic it is, but I think it's deeply fascinating. So I guess that's the first one

03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:48.640
that comes to mind. What about you, Lee, if you could be somebody for a day? Don't say Yosha Bach.

03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:53.760
Don't say Kim Kardashian. Let's do off the table. Off the table.

03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:59.040
No, I was going to say, I would like to be, I have to be here today. I was going to say I'd

03:45:59.120 --> 03:46:06.720
like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be

03:46:06.720 --> 03:46:11.440
the latest arm processor. I would like to understand, I would like to know what it feels like to

03:46:11.440 --> 03:46:17.360
basically... You like being objects. I like being, I've always obsessed with being objects

03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:21.360
ever since I was a kid. What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day? I mean,

03:46:21.360 --> 03:46:25.840
I'd like to understand how I access my memory, what anticipates coming next in clock cycles.

03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:30.080
What about how it feels like? Yeah, I wonder how it feels like to be...

03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:33.520
Yeah, to be useful. Thanks for that.

03:46:37.360 --> 03:46:43.920
All right. If, Lee, if everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left,

03:46:43.920 --> 03:46:47.840
what would your days look like? What would you do? Nobody else left impressed?

03:46:48.720 --> 03:46:54.880
Nobody, no, probably can't really do any real science at scale. What would you do with your

03:46:54.880 --> 03:47:00.480
remaining days out there? Yeah, every possible tool I could and put it in my workshop and just

03:47:00.480 --> 03:47:06.480
make stuff. So try to make stuff. Just try and make stuff. Make companions. I'm probably not making

03:47:06.480 --> 03:47:12.400
companions, probably, yeah. Probably just in the physical space. Yeah. What about you, sir? What

03:47:12.400 --> 03:47:17.040
would you, when you're just left alone on earth, you're the last one? Are there animals in this

03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:24.400
scenario? Nothing. No living beings. No plants? No plants. Oh, interesting. I was going to say,

03:47:25.120 --> 03:47:28.160
I would try to walk the entire planet, at least all the landmass.

03:47:28.800 --> 03:47:35.680
Well, that's true. So you probably don't know if there's stuff. You could be searching for plants

03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:45.440
or other humans. What would I eat? You just have daily just allotment. No, but I would just walk

03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:50.560
all the time. Of soylent. I don't know why I... Just walk. You're the explorer. I would just walk.

03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:55.200
And I guess I would make a goal of covering all of the entire earth, because what else are you

03:47:55.200 --> 03:47:59.920
going to do with your time? What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah, that you haven't done yet,

03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:11.280
but you hope to do? Skydiving. Travel to space. I don't know. You know what's funny with my bucket

03:48:11.280 --> 03:48:15.760
list? I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off. Always check it off. So your bucket

03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:21.680
list is like a fog. It's like a mystery. Yeah. Almost by doing it. Yeah. So it's very subconsciously

03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:26.400
driven. So it's in your subconscious in there? I think so. You're bringing it to the surface.

03:48:26.400 --> 03:48:29.760
I think most of the steering of our agency is in our subconscious anyway. So I just kind of go

03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:36.000
with the flow. But I guess, no, seriously. Yeah, no, I get it. I don't know. I guess that, but I

03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:38.960
would like to go in a submarine, like to the bottom of the ocean. I think that'd be really cool.

03:48:38.960 --> 03:48:43.840
To the bottom of the ocean. Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean? I am. Yeah.

03:48:44.720 --> 03:48:51.120
Yeah. What about you, Lee? What item on your bucket list? I don't have a bucket list,

03:48:51.120 --> 03:48:56.640
but I've just made one. I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars and make drugs off

03:48:56.640 --> 03:49:02.480
world. Be the first chemist to make drugs off world. The first drug manufacturer in space?

03:49:02.480 --> 03:49:06.400
Yeah. Why not? Drugs in space. Do they have to be somehow, like be able to

03:49:06.400 --> 03:49:12.240
have a tape, like be able to survive on that particular space? Or like what's the connection

03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:15.680
between being on Mars and do many things? I just would like to be that. I'd like to take

03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:23.040
the ability to have command and control over chemicals programmatically off earth to somewhere

03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:27.600
else in the universe. That just seems like you like difficulty engineering problems.

03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:32.480
Before I die, if I can do that, that's great. Would you travel to space? Yeah. Yeah, that's

03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:36.720
what I'm saying. I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist. I want to take

03:49:36.720 --> 03:49:40.480
scientific experiment in space and do a thing in space that's never been done before.

03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:47.200
That's a real possibility. Yeah. So that's why there's no point in listing things I can't do.

03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:54.640
All right. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget?

03:49:56.240 --> 03:50:02.480
Small act of kindness, not big. Somebody was just kind to you. Somebody did something sweet.

03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:13.360
When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out with... Basically, I needed a computer.

03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:17.120
I needed some power, computation power, and someone took pity on me and helped me.

03:50:18.240 --> 03:50:22.880
I was really touched. They didn't have to. They were actually quite a disabled scientist.

03:50:22.880 --> 03:50:27.440
They had other things to do rather than help some random PhD student, gave me access,

03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:31.600
taught me a little stuff. Yeah. Actually, when you're a grad student or when you're a student,

03:50:31.600 --> 03:50:37.920
when you're a student, the younger it is, the better. The attention, the support,

03:50:37.920 --> 03:50:42.480
the love you get from an older person, the teacher, something like that is super powerful.

03:50:42.480 --> 03:50:47.120
It's fascinating. And from the perspective of the teacher, they might not realize the impact

03:50:47.120 --> 03:50:54.480
they have, but that little bit, those few words, a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.

03:50:54.480 --> 03:50:59.280
What about you, Sarah? Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point.

03:50:59.280 --> 03:51:04.080
I love free Starbucks. I like it when you're in the line at Starbucks, and somebody buys

03:51:04.080 --> 03:51:07.600
your coffee in front of you, and then you buy the next one. I love those, but that's not my

03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:11.200
example. I love that too. Those are great. It makes me happy. And then my kids get all excited

03:51:11.200 --> 03:51:20.000
when we do it, when we go in, for the first ones in line doing it. I guess I can use a similar

03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:26.960
example about just being a student. Paul Davies is a very well-known theoretical physicist, and I

03:51:29.280 --> 03:51:34.400
was generous enough with his time to take me on as a postdoc. But before I became his postdoc,

03:51:34.400 --> 03:51:37.760
he invited me to a workshop at Arizona State University and the Beyond Center and

03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:42.560
took a walk with me around campus just to talk about ideas after. And I think

03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:50.400
there were two things that were completely generous about that. One is Paul's philosophy is

03:51:50.400 --> 03:51:55.280
always interacting with young people. It's like you interact with a mind in the room. It doesn't

03:51:55.280 --> 03:52:01.440
matter how well-known or whatever. It's like you evaluate the person for the person. But he also

03:52:01.440 --> 03:52:07.040
gave me a book, The Urie Silence, that he had written, and he wrote in it. This is how EE gets

03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:12.960
to ET, which was an anti-meric excess, which I worked on as a PhD student. It was the original

03:52:12.960 --> 03:52:16.960
homochirality, all the way up to what the book was about, which was, are we alone in the university,

03:52:16.960 --> 03:52:23.920
and is there an intelligent life out there? And it was just so much about the questions I wanted

03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:29.040
to ask, because it was just everything about, it was just really, really kind.

03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:34.320
Like that it's okay to ask these questions, and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.

03:52:34.320 --> 03:52:38.400
I think a lot of my career is mostly his encouragement to ask deep questions. He gave

03:52:38.400 --> 03:52:42.880
me the space to do it in ways that a lot of previous mentors had. I mean, I've had a good

03:52:42.880 --> 03:52:47.200
experience with mentors, but it was like go off the deep end to ask the hardest questions.

03:52:47.760 --> 03:52:49.760
And I think that's the best gift you can give somebody.

03:52:50.400 --> 03:52:54.240
What would you, because you're both fascinating minds, and non, I would say,

03:52:55.680 --> 03:53:02.960
non-standard in the best possible way. Is there advice you can give to young folks how to be

03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:06.960
non-standard, how to stand out, novelty, how to generate novelty?

03:53:06.960 --> 03:53:09.280
That's what I want on my tombstone. I have one.

03:53:10.160 --> 03:53:12.400
He generated novelty.

03:53:12.400 --> 03:53:13.200
No, no, how to.

03:53:13.760 --> 03:53:14.000
How to.

03:53:14.960 --> 03:53:23.120
How still. I just love doing science. And so when I was younger, I was just wanted, I mean,

03:53:23.120 --> 03:53:28.000
I'm still not sure I'm a real scientist, right? So I want to try. So my advice for the young people

03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:34.640
is just, if you love asking questions, then don't be afraid to ask the question, even if it pisses

03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:39.040
people off, because if you piss people off, you're probably asking the right question.

03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:43.760
What I would say, though, is don't do what I did, which is just piss everyone off.

03:53:44.400 --> 03:53:51.440
Try and work out how to, you know, I think, if you're, if other people challenge by your questions,

03:53:52.800 --> 03:53:58.320
you will get not only your respect, but people will give you, create space for you,

03:53:58.320 --> 03:54:04.400
because you're doing something really new. I really try to create space in my academic career,

03:54:04.960 --> 03:54:10.080
my team, really try and praise them and push them to do new things. So

03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:16.080
my advice is try to do new things, get feedback, and the universe will help you.

03:54:18.400 --> 03:54:19.840
Because the universe likes novelty.

03:54:19.840 --> 03:54:21.600
I think so. I think so, right?

03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:23.200
This one will keep them around.

03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:29.360
What about you, Sarah? You two like to ask the really out there.

03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:36.080
Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them. So I think it goes back to the love,

03:54:36.080 --> 03:54:39.280
like if you're doing the thing you're supposed to be doing, you should really love it.

03:54:40.400 --> 03:54:43.200
So I always tell people that they should do the thing they're most passionate about,

03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:49.200
but I think a flip side of that is that's when you become in somebody, like not to sound cheesy,

03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:54.000
but like your best version of yourself. So I guess, like for me, as I become more successful

03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:58.560
in my career, I feel like I can be more myself as an individual. And so there's this, I've always

03:54:58.560 --> 03:55:03.520
been following the questions I'm most interested in, which very early on I was discouraged from

03:55:03.520 --> 03:55:07.360
knowing by many people because they thought they were unanswerable questions. And I always just

03:55:07.360 --> 03:55:12.240
thought, well, if no one's even trying to answer them, of course they're going to be unanswerable.

03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:16.720
And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint. But the more I found my way in that space,

03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:21.760
the more I also made a space for myself as a person, because you're basically

03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:29.280
generating the niche that you want to exist in. And so I think that's part of it,

03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:34.320
is not just to follow your passion, but also think about like, who do you want to be and create that?

03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:40.240
Yeah, who am I? Who do you want to be? I mean, I play temporarily with it.

03:55:40.800 --> 03:55:44.480
Yeah, who am I now? Who do I want to be now? But who do I want to be in the future? They're not

03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:52.800
decoupled. Yeah, I always wonder if that's like, if I become something, am I finding myself? Or am

03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:59.120
I creating myself? Yeah. And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing. I do feel often

03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:06.080
like that I was always meant to be this kind of thing. Yeah. But is that created or discovered?

03:56:06.080 --> 03:56:11.600
I don't know. But basically go towards that direction. If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah.

03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:19.200
Excellent. I'm waiting. They come find me. They're on a spaceship. And then they somehow figured

03:56:19.200 --> 03:56:30.160
out the language you speak and ask you, what are you? What explain yourself? Not you, Sarah, but

03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:40.000
the species. Oh. What's life on earth? Like we don't have time or busy grad students from another

03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:46.640
planet. I see. What's interesting about human civilization? What's interesting about you?

03:56:47.600 --> 03:56:51.360
You specifically too. They could be very kind of personal and kind of pushy.

03:56:53.440 --> 03:57:01.120
And yeah, how would you describe? Okay, I have one. Because, you know,

03:57:02.160 --> 03:57:05.680
obviously I self-identify as a scientist and a physicist, but intrinsically I feel more like

03:57:05.680 --> 03:57:09.280
an artist. But it's almost like you're an artist that you don't know what you're painting yet.

03:57:10.160 --> 03:57:17.040
And I guess I feel like that's humanity. Like in some sense, we're creating something I think

03:57:17.040 --> 03:57:21.600
is profound and potentially very beautiful. Like it exists in the universe, but we're just so

03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:28.240
night, like not night. We're just early. We're early. We're young. We don't know what we're doing yet.

03:57:28.240 --> 03:57:32.480
Yeah. What's with the nuclear weapons? There's a big question too. Like what are you guys?

03:57:32.480 --> 03:57:37.040
What are we doing with them? This creativity that you talk about. It sounds very nice, but it's

03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:43.040
we're making things that are like very destructive and like the rockets. This seems very aggressive.

03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:50.480
Yeah, I know. This is my blinders on. I don't know. I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation

03:57:50.480 --> 03:57:55.360
about suffering. I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects of reality into what I want to

03:57:55.920 --> 03:58:01.120
envision. And that's obviously problematic. But, you know, nuclear power has also given us a

03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:09.040
lot of good things. So both human nature, both human beings and the technology we create has

03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:12.560
the capacity for evil and the capacity for good. Yeah. And we can't all be good all the time.

03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:17.600
I mean, there's like this huge misnomer that you need to be liked by everyone universally. And

03:58:17.600 --> 03:58:22.560
obviously that's like an ideal, but it's physically impossible. Like you can't get a group of people

03:58:22.560 --> 03:58:27.360
in the room and have everyone like each other all the time. So I think that kind of tension is

03:58:27.360 --> 03:58:33.040
actually really important that we have different aesthetics, different goals,

03:58:34.800 --> 03:58:42.080
and sometimes conflict comes out of that. Speaking of which, do you and Yosha Bach ever

03:58:42.080 --> 03:58:47.200
say anything nice to each other? Or is it always conflict? We never have conflict. We argue,

03:58:47.200 --> 03:58:52.160
but I don't think they argue. Arguments are bad. I mean, I think the problem I have,

03:58:52.240 --> 03:58:56.000
not problem, I think. Here we go. And he's not here to defend himself.

03:58:56.000 --> 03:59:01.520
No, I just, I don't necessarily understand the, the, I mean, he's just talking at such a high

03:59:01.520 --> 03:59:07.280
level. You know, I'm a dimwit. So I'm like, I spend some, so I think a lot of our conflict,

03:59:07.280 --> 03:59:10.960
it's not conflict, we actually, we actually have a, I think, I mean, I can't speak for Yosha,

03:59:10.960 --> 03:59:16.240
I have a deep appreciation for him. He's brilliant. But I think I'm kind of frustrated and I'm trying

03:59:16.240 --> 03:59:23.440
to, he thinks the universe is a computer and I want to turn the universe into a computer.

03:59:23.440 --> 03:59:27.920
Yeah. That's, that's a small disagreement. So what would you, how would you defend your life

03:59:27.920 --> 03:59:32.800
to an alien when you're being abducted? Would you focus on the specifics of your life?

03:59:32.800 --> 03:59:37.040
No, no, no, I would be, I would try and be as random as possible and try and confuse them.

03:59:37.040 --> 03:59:44.480
Oh, good. Good. Excellent. That might be the wiser choice.

03:59:45.120 --> 03:59:47.680
The Easter eggs in reality? No, I mean, if aliens are abducted,

03:59:47.680 --> 03:59:51.520
No, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible. I would try and do something that

03:59:51.520 --> 03:59:54.720
would surprise the hell out of them, which I thought, I mean, they're probably risking,

03:59:54.720 --> 03:59:56.720
they might kill me, but I think that might be funny.

03:59:57.520 --> 04:00:00.320
Yeah, they might want to study you for prolonged periods of time.

04:00:00.320 --> 04:00:04.960
My reasoning is if I wanted to stay alive, okay, so if the thing is I wasn't going back to Earth

04:00:04.960 --> 04:00:08.800
and the job was to stay alive, if I could be as surprising as possible, they'd keep me around

04:00:08.800 --> 04:00:14.560
like a pet, right? Pet Lee on the aliens. So you'd be okay being a pet?

04:00:14.560 --> 04:00:19.520
Well, no, but I mean, the last human that survives would just be a pet to the alien.

04:00:19.520 --> 04:00:24.960
I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun because then I might get some feedback

04:00:24.960 --> 04:00:28.880
from their curiosity, but yeah. Let me ask you this question, given our

04:00:28.880 --> 04:00:34.800
conversation has a very different meaning, more profoundly perhaps, but would you rather lose

04:00:34.800 --> 04:00:39.040
all of your old memories or never be able to make new ones?

04:00:42.160 --> 04:00:46.480
I would have to lose all my old memories.

04:00:47.520 --> 04:00:52.240
Again, it's the novelty. What about you, Sarah?

04:00:52.240 --> 04:00:57.120
I'm the same because I don't think like it's about the future experience, right? And in some sense,

04:00:57.760 --> 04:01:02.080
like you were saying earlier, most of our lived experience is actually in our memories. So if

04:01:02.080 --> 04:01:05.360
you can't generate new memories, it's like you're not alive anymore.

04:01:07.920 --> 04:01:13.040
What comforts you on bad days? When you look at human civilization, when you look at your own

04:01:13.040 --> 04:01:19.600
life, what gives you hope? What makes you feel good about what we're doing about life at the

04:01:19.600 --> 04:01:24.720
small scale of you as a human and at the big scale of us as a human civilization, maybe the

04:01:24.720 --> 04:01:32.880
big scale of the universe? Children, my kids, but I also mean that in like a grand sense of like,

04:01:33.680 --> 04:01:40.320
not a grand, but like, like future minds in some sense. So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,

04:01:40.320 --> 04:01:44.320
you know, people worry about apocalyptic things like AI existential risk and climate change,

04:01:44.320 --> 04:01:48.480
which children of men, you know, the whole premise of the movie was there can be no

04:01:48.480 --> 04:01:53.520
children born on the entire planet. And the youngest person on the planet is like 18 years old or

04:01:53.520 --> 04:01:59.200
something. Like, can you imagine a world without children? It's just, it's harrowing. That's the

04:01:59.200 --> 04:02:07.760
scariest thing. So I think what gives me hope is always youth and the hope of children and the,

04:02:07.760 --> 04:02:11.760
you know, the possibilities of the future they see. And they grow up in a completely different

04:02:11.760 --> 04:02:19.440
reality than adults do. And I think we have a hard time seeing what their reality actually looks like.

04:02:19.440 --> 04:02:23.040
But I think, I think most of the time it's super interesting.

04:02:23.040 --> 04:02:28.960
Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination, they have this kind of excitement. So it's so

04:02:28.960 --> 04:02:36.560
cool. So fun to watch. And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way of all that

04:02:37.840 --> 04:02:43.440
imagination. What about you, what gives you hope? So when I go back to my eight year old self,

04:02:44.480 --> 04:02:48.800
the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year old self was this world in which technology became

04:02:48.800 --> 04:02:54.320
programmable and there was internet and I get information. And I would expand my consciousness

04:02:54.320 --> 04:03:01.760
by just, you know, getting access to everything that was going on. And this happened in my lifetime.

04:03:01.760 --> 04:03:05.360
I mean, really do have that. I mean, okay, there's some bad things, you know, there's TikTok,

04:03:05.360 --> 04:03:09.120
everyone just don't whatever, all the bad things about social media. But I think,

04:03:12.320 --> 04:03:17.520
I mean, I can't quite believe my luck being born now. So amazing.

04:03:18.080 --> 04:03:20.240
Be able to program reality in some way.

04:03:20.240 --> 04:03:23.760
Yeah. And the thing that I really find fascinating about human beings

04:03:24.720 --> 04:03:30.080
is that just how ingenious they are. I'm, you know, whether it's from my kids,

04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:38.960
my research group, my peers, other companies, just how ingenious everyone is. And I'm pretty

04:03:38.960 --> 04:03:44.640
sure humanity has a, or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital part in the future

04:03:45.360 --> 04:03:48.880
is going to have a lot of fun. And I'm just, yeah, it's just, it's just mind blowing,

04:03:48.880 --> 04:03:55.120
just to watch. And you know, so humans are ingenious. And I hope to help them be more

04:03:55.120 --> 04:04:01.360
ingenious if I can. Well, what gives me hope, what makes me feel good on bad days is the existence

04:04:01.360 --> 04:04:08.240
of wild minds like yours, novelty generators, assembly structures that generate novelty

04:04:08.880 --> 04:04:11.520
and do so beautifully. And then tweet about it.

04:04:12.480 --> 04:04:16.720
Sarah, this, I really, really enjoyed talking to you. I enjoy following you. I'm a huge fan.

04:04:17.440 --> 04:04:21.600
Sarah Lee, I hope, I hope to talk to you many times in the future, maybe with your Shabak.

04:04:21.600 --> 04:04:24.880
You're just incredible people. Thank you for everything you do. You're awesome.

04:04:24.880 --> 04:04:26.560
Thank you for talking today. I really, really appreciate it.

04:04:26.560 --> 04:04:27.360
Just relax. Thanks.

04:04:27.360 --> 04:04:28.640
Yeah, I'm brilliant to be here.

04:04:29.680 --> 04:04:34.320
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin. To support this podcast,

04:04:34.320 --> 04:04:39.200
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

04:04:39.200 --> 04:04:47.760
Arthur C. Clarke. Two possibilities exist. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.

04:04:48.800 --> 04:04:57.360
Both are equally terrifying. And let me, if I may, add to that by saying that both possibilities,

04:04:57.360 --> 04:05:02.960
at least to me, are both terrifying and exciting. And keeping these two feelings in my heart

04:05:02.960 --> 04:05:09.280
is a fun way to explore, to wander, to think, and to live always a little bit on the edge of madness.

04:05:10.080 --> 04:05:18.880
Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
