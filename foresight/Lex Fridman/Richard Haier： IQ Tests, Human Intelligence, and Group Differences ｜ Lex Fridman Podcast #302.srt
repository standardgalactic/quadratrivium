1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Let me ask you to this question.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,160
Well, there's bell curve or any research on race differences.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,080
Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world?

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,520
Can that be used to increase the amount of hate in the world?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:26,200
My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,600
that have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,960
that speak against that, that no, I don't I don't want to give

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,840
racist groups of veto power over what scientists study.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,800
The following is a conversation with Richard Hire on the science of human intelligence.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,920
This is a highly controversial topic, but a critically important one

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,920
for understanding the human mind.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,640
I hope you will join me in not shying away from difficult topics like this.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,720
And instead, let us try to navigate it with empathy, rigor and grace.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,120
If you're watching this on video now, I should mention that I'm recording

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,160
this introduction in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,080
This is Alex Friedman podcast to support it.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,320
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,680
And now, dear friends, here's Richard Hire.

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,760
What are the measures of human intelligence and how do we measure it?

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,320
In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence is just being smart.

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,520
How well you reason, how well you figure things out,

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,640
what you do when you don't know what to do.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,880
Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,520
of how people use the word intelligence.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,920
If you want to do research on intelligence,

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,680
measuring something that you can study scientifically is a little trickier.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,920
And what almost all researchers who study intelligence use

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,360
is the concept called the G factor, general intelligence.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,480
And that is what is common.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,360
That is a mental ability that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,680
What's the origin of the term G factor, by the way?

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,040
It's such a funny word for such a fundamental human thing.

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,320
The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,520
And he noticed, this is like more than 100 years ago,

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,680
he'd noticed that when you tested people with different tests,

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,640
all the tests were correlated positively.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,680
And so he was looking at student exams and things.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,760
And he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,960
And when he used it to look at student performance on various topics,

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,880
he found all the scores were correlated with each other,

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,360
and they were all positive correlations.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,240
So he inferred from this that there must be some common factor

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,240
that was irrespective of the content of the test.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,280
And positive correlation means if you do well on the first test,

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
you're likely to do well on the second test.

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,800
And presumably that holds for tests across even disciplines,

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,240
so not within subject, but across subjects.

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,840
So that's where the general comes in, something about general intelligence.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
So when you were talking about measuring intelligence

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,840
and trying to figure out something difficult about this world

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,680
and how to solve the puzzles of this world, that means generally speaking,

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,120
not some specific test, but across all tests.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,240
Absolutely right.

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,240
And people get hung up on this because they say,

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,840
well, what about the ability to do X isn't that independent?

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,880
And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this,

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,680
but not so good at this, this other thing.

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,880
And so there are a lot of examples like that, but it's a general tendency.

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,920
So exceptions really don't disprove.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,600
Your everyday experience is not the same as what the data actually show.

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,440
And your everyday experience, when you say, oh, I know someone who's good at X,

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,160
but not so good at Y, that doesn't contradict the statement of about it.

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,680
He's not so good, but he's not the opposite.

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,720
He's not, it's not a negative correlation.

67
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,760
Okay, so we're not, our anecdotal data, I know a guy is really good at solving some kind of visual

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,320
thing that's not sufficient for us to understand actually the depths of that person's intelligence.

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,280
So how this idea of G factor, how much evidence is there, how strong,

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,680
you know, given across the decades that this idea has been around,

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,360
how much has it been held up that there is a universal sort of horsepower of intelligence

72
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,080
that's underneath all of it, all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,280
in the depths of the human mind.

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,120
That's a universal stable measure of a person's intelligence.

75
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,480
You used a couple of words in there, stable.

76
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,520
We have to be precise with words.

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,680
I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,480
We can.

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,760
There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research that is poetic.

80
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,720
Science has a kinetic aspect to it and good scientists are very intuitive.

81
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,160
They're not just, hey, hey, these are the numbers.

82
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,040
You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.

83
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:09,320
When it comes to intelligence research, you asked how well has this general concept held up?

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,480
And I think I can say, without fear of being empirically contradicted,

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,280
that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal, psychology, we all know there's a replication

87
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,360
crisis in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn't replicate.

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
That's all true.

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,600
There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying the existence of this general factor.

90
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Let me tell you some things about it.

91
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,040
It looks like it's universal that you find it in all cultures.

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,000
The way you find it, step back one step, the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,720
What battery you choose?

94
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,280
Take a battery of any mental test you want, give it to a large number of diverse people,

95
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:08,920
and you will be able to extract statistically the commonality among all those tests.

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,480
It's done by a technique called factor analysis.

97
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,280
People think that this may be a statistical artifact of some kind.

98
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,600
It is not a statistical artifact.

99
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
What is factor analysis?

100
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,960
Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data and look at the correlation among

101
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,680
the different test scores and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together.

102
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,240
And there are different factors.

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,000
So if you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,240
There may be a numerical factor.

105
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,800
There may be a visual spatial factor.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,640
But those factors have variants in common with each other and that is the common.

107
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,040
That's what's common among all the tests and that's what gets labeled the G factor.

108
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,680
So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests and you extract a G factor from it,

109
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,200
that factor usually accounts for around half of the variants.

110
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,120
It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor.

111
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,000
But it is the most reliable.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
It is the most stable.

113
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,720
And it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.

114
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:32,840
It's very hard to change the G factor with training or drugs or anything else.

115
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,920
You don't know how to increase the G factor.

116
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Okay. You said a lot of really interesting things there.

117
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,240
So first, I mean, just to get people used to it in case they're not familiar with this idea.

118
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,800
G factor is what we mean.

119
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,960
So often there's this term used IQ, which is the way IQ is used.

120
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,240
They really mean G factor in regular conversation.

121
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,600
The way, because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence.

122
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,240
And what we mean by intelligence, we mean general intelligence and general intelligence

123
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,280
in the human mind from a psychology, from a serious rigorous scientific perspective

124
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,800
actually means G factor.

125
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,440
So G factor equals intelligence just in this conversation to define terms.

126
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,200
Okay. So there's this stable thing called G factor.

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:32,840
You said, now, factor, you said factor many times means a measure that's potentially could

128
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,280
be reduced to a single number across the different factors you mentioned.

129
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:46,600
And what you said it accounts for half, half-ish, accounts for half-ish of what?

130
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,760
Of variance across the different set of tests.

131
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,840
So if you do for some reason well on some set of tests, what does that mean?

132
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,800
So that means there's some unique capabilities outside of the G factor that might account for that.

133
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,680
And what are those?

134
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,400
What else is there besides the raw horsepower of the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?

135
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,240
There are test-taking skills.

136
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,720
There are specific abilities.

137
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:30,120
Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things, mathematical concepts,

138
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
even simple arithmetic people.

139
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,200
Some people are much better than others.

140
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,240
You might know people who can memorize and short-term memory is another component of this.

141
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,960
A short-term memory is one of the cognitive processes that's most highly correlated with the G factor.

142
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:01,000
So all those things like memory, test-taking skills account for variability across the test

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,720
performances.

144
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,440
You can run, but you can't hide from the thing that God gave you.

145
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,080
The genetics, so that G factor, science says that G factor is there.

146
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,240
Each one of us has a G factor.

147
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,880
Oh boy.

148
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
Some have more than others.

149
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,760
I'm getting uncomfortable already.

150
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:32,280
Well IQ is a score, and an IQ score is a very good estimate of the G factor.

151
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
You can't measure G directly.

152
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,960
There's no direct measure.

153
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,080
You estimate it from these statistical techniques.

154
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,200
But an IQ score is a good estimate.

155
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Why?

156
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Because a standard IQ test is a battery of different mental abilities.

157
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,640
You combine it into one score, and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,

158
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,040
even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.

159
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,200
Because again, it's what's common to all these mental abilities.

160
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,720
So a good IQ test, and I'll ask you about that, but a good IQ test tries to compress down

161
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
that battery of tests.

162
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,520
Like tries to get a nice selection of variable tests into one test.

163
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,120
And so in that way, it sneaks up to the G factor.

164
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,080
And that's another interesting thing about G factor.

165
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Now you give, first of all, you have a great book on the neuroscience of intelligence.

166
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,000
You have a great course, which is when I first learned, you're a great teacher.

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,720
Let me just say.

168
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:39,880
Thank you.

169
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,720
Your course at the teaching company, I hope I'm saying that correctly.

170
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,000
The intelligent brain.

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,040
The intelligent brain is when I first heard about this G factor.

172
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,680
This mysterious thing that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine a light on.

173
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,960
We're trying to sneak up on.

174
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,480
So the fact that there's this measure, stable measure of intelligence, we can't measure directly.

175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,520
But we can come up with a battery test or one test that includes a battery of

176
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:21,560
variable type of questions that can reliably or attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.

177
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,160
That's a fascinating idea.

178
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,720
So for me as an AI person, it's fascinating.

179
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,160
It's fascinating that there's something stable like that about the human mind,

180
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,240
especially if it's grounded in genetics.

181
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:43,160
It's both fascinating that as a researcher of the human mind and all the human psychological,

182
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,120
sociological, ethical questions that started rising, it makes me uncomfortable.

183
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,800
But truth can be uncomfortable.

184
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,480
You know, I get that a lot about being uncomfortable talking about this.

185
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,480
Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.

186
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,400
It doesn't matter which battery of tests you use.

187
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
So there are countless tests.

188
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,040
You can take any 12 of them at random, extract a G factor and another 12 at random and extract a G

189
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,080
factor and those G factors will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.

190
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,040
So it is a ubiquitous.

191
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,480
It doesn't depend on the content of the test is what I'm trying to say.

192
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,040
It is general among all those tests of mental ability.

193
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,280
And tests of mental abilities include things like G's plain poker.

194
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,560
Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.

195
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,480
Your skill at anything that requires reasoning and thinking, anything from spelling, arithmetic,

196
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,720
more complex things.

197
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,440
This concept is ubiquitous.

198
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,840
And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures, you get the same thing.

199
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,440
So this says something interesting about the human mind that as a computer is designed to be

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,560
general.

201
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,240
So it's not easily made specialized.

202
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,560
Meaning if you're going to be good at one thing, Miyamoto Masashi has this quote.

203
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,840
He's an ancient warrior famous for the book of five rings in the martial arts world.

204
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,120
And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.

205
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:46,200
Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize to everything.

206
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,240
And that's an interesting thing about the human mind.

207
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,560
So that's what the G factor reveals.

208
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,240
Okay.

209
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,840
So what's the difference if you can elaborate a little bit further between IQ and G factor?

210
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,480
Just because it's a source of confusion for people.

211
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,640
And IQ is a score.

212
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,200
People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.

213
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,760
But IQ has a more technical meaning for people who work in the field.

214
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,680
And it's an IQ score, a score on a test that estimates the G factor.

215
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,120
And the G factor is what's common among all these tests of mental ability.

216
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,520
So if you think about, it's not a Venn diagram, but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it.

217
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,920
But the G factor would be really at the core, what's common to everything.

218
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,800
And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order of people on the score.

219
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,840
And this is what makes people uncomfortable.

220
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,480
This is where there's a lot of controversy about whether IQ tests are biased

221
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,720
toward any one group or another.

222
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,000
And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,

223
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,120
but they also have a technical aspect of it that's not so easy to explain.

224
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,040
Well, we'll talk about the fascinating and the difficult things about all of this.

225
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,720
But so by the way, when you say rank order, that means you get a number.

226
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,840
And that means one person you can now compare.

227
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,120
Like you could say that this other person is more intelligent than me.

228
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,960
Well, what you can say is IQ scores are interpreted really as percentiles.

229
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,920
So that if you have an IQ of 140 and somebody else has 70,

230
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,640
the metric is such that you cannot say the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart

231
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,080
as a person with an IQ of 70.

232
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,800
That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.

233
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Now, you may think you know people with zero intelligence,

234
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,880
but in fact, there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale.

235
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,720
It's relative to other people.

236
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,320
So relative to other people, somebody with an IQ score of 140 is in the upper

237
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
less than 1 percent.

238
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,400
Whereas somebody with an IQ of 70 is two standard deviations below the mean.

239
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,520
That's a different percentile.

240
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:25,880
So it's similar to like in chess, you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.

241
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,080
So you can't say it's twice.

242
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,240
One person, if your ELO rating is twice another person, I don't think you're twice as good at chess.

243
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,840
It's not stable in that way, but because it's very difficult to do these kinds of comparisons.

244
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,560
But so what can we say about the number itself?

245
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,800
Is that stable across tests and so on and so on?

246
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,880
There are a number of statistical properties of any test.

247
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,360
They're called psychometric properties.

248
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,040
You have validity, you have reliability, reliability.

249
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,680
There are many different kinds of reliability.

250
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,720
They all essentially measure stability and IQ tests are stable within an individual.

251
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,800
There are some longitudinal studies where children were measured at age 11.

252
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:22,040
And again, when they were 70 years old and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.

253
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,080
This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.

254
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,320
In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test on every single child,

255
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,840
age 11 in the whole country, and they did.

256
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,560
And those records were discovered in an old store room at the University of Edinburgh.

257
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,720
By a friend of mine, Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,

258
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,760
and has done a lot of research on the people who are still alive today from that original study,

259
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,080
including brain imaging research, by the way.

260
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,120
Really, it's a fascinating group of people who are studied.

261
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,480
Not to get ahead of the story, but one of the most interesting things they found

262
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,560
is a very strong relationship between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality,

263
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:30,840
so that 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates,

264
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,160
and they could get death records from everybody.

265
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,440
And Scotland has universal health care for everybody.

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,080
And it turned out, if you divide the people by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles,

267
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,360
and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,

268
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,720
I know this is in the book, I have the graph in the book,

269
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,640
but there are essentially twice as many people alive in the highest IQ quartile

270
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,320
than in the lowest IQ quartile, true in men and women.

271
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,880
Interesting.

272
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,040
So it makes a big difference.

273
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:15,000
Now, why this is the case is not so clear since everyone had access to health care.

274
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,080
Well, there's a lot, and we'll talk about it, just the sentences you used now

275
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,720
could be explained by nature or nurture.

276
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
We don't know.

277
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,560
Now, there's a lot of science that starts to then dig in and investigate that question.

278
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,720
But let me linger on the IQ test.

279
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,320
How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?

280
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,960
Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.

281
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:48,040
What makes a good IQ test question that sneaks up on this g-factor measure?

282
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Well, your question is interesting because you want me to give examples of items that make good

283
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,760
items, and what makes a good item is not so much its content,

284
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,920
but its empirical relationship to the total score that turns out to be valid by other means.

285
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,040
So for example, let me give you an odd example from personality testing.

286
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,560
So there's a personality test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,

287
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,960
MMPI, been around for decades.

288
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,080
I've heard about this test recently because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.

289
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,720
I don't know if you've been paying attention to that, but they had psychologist understand,

290
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,600
and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,

291
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,560
again, I'm learning so much from this trial, they did different battery of tests

292
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,360
to diagnose personality disorders.

293
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,240
Apparently, there's that systematic way of doing so.

294
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,920
And the Minnesota one is one of the ones that there's the most science on.

295
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,720
There's a lot of great papers which were all continuously cited on the stand,

296
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,000
which is fascinating to watch.

297
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
Sorry, a little bit of attention.

298
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,120
It's okay. I mean, this is interesting because you're right.

299
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,480
It's been around for decades.

300
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,840
There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test,

301
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,640
including what it predicts with respect to different categories of personality disorder.

302
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,200
But what I want to mention is the content of the items on that test.

303
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,800
All of the items are essentially true, false items.

304
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,560
True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath.

305
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,040
True or false, I think Lincoln was a better president than Washington.

306
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:49,320
What have all these, what does that have to do with, and the point is the content of these

307
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,160
items, nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything, but empirically they do.

308
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,520
It's a technique of choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism.

309
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,080
That the content doesn't matter, but for some reason, when you get a criterion group of people

310
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,760
with this disorder and you compare them to people without that disorder, these are the

311
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,600
items that distinguish. Irrespective of content, it's a hard concept to grasp.

312
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:31,880
Well, first of all, it's fascinating, but I consider myself part psychologist

313
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,520
because I love human-robot interaction, and that's a problem.

314
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,440
Half of that problem is a psychology problem because there's a human.

315
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,200
Designing these tests to get at the questions is the fascinating part.

316
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,600
What does dust bowl empiricism refer to? Does it refer to the final result?

317
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah, so the test is dust bowl empiricism, but how do you arrive at the battery of questions?

318
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,840
I presume one of the things, now again, I'm going to the excellent testimony in that trial,

319
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:19,000
because they also explain the tests, that a bunch of the questions that kind of

320
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,560
make you forget that you're taking a test, it makes it very difficult for you to somehow figure

321
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:33,960
out what you're supposed to answer. Yes, it's called social desirability,

322
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,040
but we're getting a little far afield because I only wanted to give that example of dust bowl

323
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:48,040
empiricism. When we talk about the items on an IQ test, many of those items in the dust bowl

324
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:55,880
empiricism method have no face validity. In other words, they don't look like they measure anything.

325
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,920
Whereas most intelligence tests, the items actually look like they're measuring some mental

326
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,280
ability. So here's one of the... So you were bringing that up as an example as what it is not?

327
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,760
Yes. Got it. Okay, so I don't want to go too far afield on it.

328
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,000
Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast. So I should mention that.

329
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,480
Far afield. Yeah, so anyway, sorry. So they feel the questions look like they pass the face validity

330
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,960
test and some more than others. So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.

331
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,240
If I... One of the subtests on a standard IQ test is general information.

332
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,200
Let me just think a little bit because I don't want to give you the actual item.

333
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:51,000
But if I said how far is it between Washington DC and Miami, Florida,

334
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,000
within 500 miles plus or minus? Well, it's not a fact most people memorize,

335
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,200
but you know something about geography. You say, well, I flew there once. I know planes fly 500

336
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,400
miles. You can kind of make an estimate. But it also seems like it would be very cultural.

337
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:23,560
So there's that kind of general information. Then there's vocabulary test. What does

338
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:33,320
regatta mean? And I choose that word because that word was removed from the IQ test because

339
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:40,040
people complained that disadvantaged people would not know that word just from their everyday

340
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:48,200
life. Okay. Here's another example from a different kind of subtest. What's regatta,

341
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:56,840
by the way? A regatta is a sailing competition, a competition with boats. Not necessarily sailing,

342
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,840
but the competition with boats. Yep. Yep. I'm probably disadvantaged in that way. Okay. Excellent.

343
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,760
So that was removed. Anyway, what you were saying. Okay. So here's another subtest. I'm going to repeat

344
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,760
a string of numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready? Okay. Seven,

345
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:25,000
four, two, eight, one, six. That's way too many. Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

346
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,720
Okay. You get the idea. Now, the actual test starts with a smaller number,

347
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,920
you know, like two numbers. And then it is people get it right. You keep going,

348
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,960
adding to the string of numbers until they can't do it anymore. Okay. But now try this.

349
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,800
I'm going to say some numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them to me backwards.

350
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:54,120
I quit. Okay. Now, so I gave you some examples of the kind of items on an IQ test. Yes. General

351
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:03,640
information. I can't remember all. General information, vocabulary, digit span, forward

352
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,120
and digit span backward. Well, you said I can't even remember them. That's a good question for me.

353
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,080
What does memory have to do with your culture? Okay. Well, let's hold on.

354
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:24,600
Okay. All right. Let's just talk about these examples. Now, some of those items seem very

355
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:34,760
cultural and others seem less cultural. Which ones do you think scores on which

356
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:42,360
subtest are most highly correlated with the G factor? Well, the G2 advanced is less cultural.

357
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:52,920
Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated. And it turns out that digit span

358
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:02,120
backwards is highly correlated. How do you figure? Now you have decades of research

359
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,520
to answer the question, how do you figure? Right. So now there's like good research that

360
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:17,000
gives you intuition about what kind of questions get at it. Just like there's something I've done,

361
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,320
I've actually used for research, just send me a autonomous vehicle, like whether humans are

362
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,400
paying attention, there's a body of literature that does like end back tests. For example, we have to

363
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,160
put workload on the brain to do recall, memory recall. And that helps you kind of

364
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,080
put some work onto the brain while the person is doing some other task. And this does some

365
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,360
interesting research with that. But that's loading the memory. So there's like research around

366
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,760
stably what that means about the human mind. And here you're saying recall backwards

367
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,720
is a good predictor. It's a transformation. Yeah. So you have to do some,

368
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:11,160
like you have to load that into your brain and not just remember it, but do something with it.

369
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,520
Right. Now here's another example of a different kind of test called the Hick paradigm. And it's

370
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:25,080
not verbal at all. It's a little box. And there are a series of lights arranged in a semi circle

371
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:32,840
at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights

372
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,800
goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights, you take your finger off the home button

373
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,880
and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction

374
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,440
time. Like goes on as quick as you can. You press the button and you get a reaction time

375
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:57,080
from the moment you lift your finger off the button that when you press the button with where the

376
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:05,080
light is, that reaction time doesn't really correlate with IQ very much. But if you change

377
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:13,640
the instructions and you say three lights are going to come on simultaneously, I want you to

378
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:20,760
press the button next to the light that's furthest from the other two. So maybe lights one and two

379
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,520
go on and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger off and you would press the

380
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:35,560
button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task. It's not really hard.

381
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:42,600
Almost everybody gets it all right. But your reaction time to that is highly correlated with

382
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,320
the g-factor. This is fascinating. So reaction time. So it's a temporal aspect to this. So what

383
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,360
rolled this time? Speed of processing. It's the speed of processing. Is this also true for ones

384
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,880
that take longer like five, 10, 30 seconds? Is time part of the measure with some of these ideas?

385
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:09,880
And that is why some of the best IQ tests have a time limit. Because if you have no time limit,

386
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:18,200
people can do better. But it doesn't distinguish among people that well. So that

387
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,040
adding the time element is important. So speed of information processing and reaction time is

388
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,800
a measure of speed of information processing turns out to be related to the g-factor.

389
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,960
But the g-factor only accounts for maybe half or some amount on the test performance. For example,

390
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:50,520
I get pretty bad test anxiety. I just don't enjoy tests. I enjoy going back into my cave

391
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,920
and working it. I've always enjoyed homework way more than tests. No matter how hard the

392
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,080
homework is. Because I can go back to the cave and hide away and think deeply. There's something

393
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,000
about being watched and having a time limit that really makes me anxious. And I could just see the

394
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,080
mind not operating optimally at all. But you're saying underneath there, there's still a g-factor.

395
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,560
And if you get anxious taking a test, many people say, oh, I didn't do well because I'm anxious.

396
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,560
I hear that a lot. They say, well, fine. If you're really anxious during the test,

397
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,800
the score will be a bad estimate of your g-factor. It doesn't mean the g-factor isn't there.

398
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,680
That's right. And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT,

399
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,920
they're essentially intelligence tests. They are highly G-loaded. Now, the people who make the

400
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:54,200
SAT don't want to mention that. They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing. But to

401
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,600
call it an intelligence test is really beyond the pale. But in fact, it's so highly correlated

402
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,040
because it's a reasoning test. The SAT is a reasoning test, a verbal reasoning,

403
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:14,760
mathematical reasoning. And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to G. But if people

404
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,120
go in and take a standardized test, whether it's an IQ test or the SAT,

405
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:27,720
and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever, the score is not going to be a good

406
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,840
estimate of their g. If they retake the test when they're not anxious or less anxious or don't have

407
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:42,360
a fever, the score will go up and that will be a better estimate. But you can't say their g-factor

408
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,840
increased between the two tests. Well, it's interesting. So the question is, how wide of a

409
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,680
battery of tests is required to estimate the g-factor? Well, because I'll give you as my personal

410
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,800
example, I took the SAT and I think it was called the ACT, where I was to also, I took SAT many

411
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,160
times. Every single time, I got a perfect math. And verbal, the time limit on the verbal made me

412
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,320
very anxious. I did not, I mean, part of it, I didn't speak English very well. But honestly,

413
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,800
it was like, you're supposed to remember stuff. And like, I was so anxious. And like, as I'm reading,

414
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:27,080
I'm sweating. I can't, you know, that like, that feeling you have when you're reading a book and

415
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,520
you, you just read a page and you know nothing about what you've read because you zoned out,

416
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,560
that's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to, you're like, no, read and understand. And

417
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:47,000
that anxiety is like, and you start seeing like the typography versus the content of the words.

418
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:55,720
Like that was, I don't, it's interesting because I know that what they're measuring,

419
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,600
I could see being correlated with something. But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance,

420
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,520
sure plays a, plays a factor. And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way. I mean,

421
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,880
this is a broader discussion, but that's like standardized testing, how you sneak up,

422
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,360
how you get at the fact that I'm super anxious and still nevertheless measure some aspect of my

423
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,000
intelligence. I wonder, I don't, I don't know, I don't know if you can say it to that, that time

424
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,040
limit sure is a pain. Well, let me say this, there are two ways to approach the very real problem

425
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,920
that you say that some people just get anxious or not good test takers. By the way, part of,

426
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,040
part of testing is you know the answer, you can figure out the answer, or you can't.

427
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,840
If you don't know the answer, there are many reasons you don't know the answer at that particular

428
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,440
moment. You may have learned it once and forgotten it. You may, it may be on the tip of your tongue,

429
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,080
and you just can't get it because you're anxious about the time limit. You may never have learned

430
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,520
it. You may never, you may have been exposed to it, but it was too complicated and you couldn't

431
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,480
learn it. I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here. But for an individual to interpret your

432
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:26,120
scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score has to take into account various things

433
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,040
that would affect your individual score. And that's why decisions about college admission

434
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:42,200
or anything else where tests are used are hardly ever the only criterion to make a decision.

435
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,680
And I think people are, college admission is letting go of that very much.

436
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:54,280
Oh, yes, there, yeah. But what does that even mean? Because is it possible to design standardized

437
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,280
tests that do get, that are useful to college admissions?

438
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,160
Well, they already exist. The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects of success at college.

439
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,640
Here's the problem. So maybe you could speak to this, the correlation across a population versus

440
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:20,920
individuals. So, you know, our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,

441
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:30,760
well, it's still, there's tragic cases where innocent people go to jail, but you try to avoid

442
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,960
that. In the same way with testing, it just, it would suck for an SAT to miss genius.

443
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:45,400
Yes, and it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely. So it really comes down to

444
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:58,840
do which piece of information maximizes your decision making ability. So,

445
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:07,800
if you just use high school grades, it's okay. But you will miss some people who just

446
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,000
don't do well in high school, but who are actually pretty smart, smart enough to be bored silly in

447
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,520
high school, and they don't care, and they, their high school GPA isn't that good. So you will miss

448
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:26,440
them in the same sense that somebody who could be very able and ready for college just doesn't

449
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:35,960
do well on their SAT. This is why you make decisions with taking in a variety of information.

450
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:43,240
The other thing I wanted to say, I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,

451
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,400
statistically for groups, there are many people who have a disparity between their math score

452
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,800
and their verbal score. That disparity, or the other way around, that disparity is called tilt.

453
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,560
The score is tilted one way or the other, and that tilt has been studied empirically to see what

454
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:14,760
that predicts. And in fact, you can't make predictions about college success based on tilt.

455
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,200
And mathematics is a good example. There are many people, especially non-native speakers of

456
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,800
English who come to this country, take the SATs, do very well on the math and not so well on the

457
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:33,160
verbal. Well, if they're applying to a math program, the professors there who are making the

458
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,440
decision or the admissions officers don't wait so much the score on verbal, especially if it's

459
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,200
a non-native speaker. Well, so yeah, you have to try to, in the admission process, bring in the

460
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,600
context. But non-native isn't really the problem. I mean, that was part of the problem for me.

461
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,600
But it's the anxiety was, which it's interesting. It's interesting.

462
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,760
Boy, reducing yourself down to numbers. But it's still true. It's still the truth.

463
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:19,800
It's a painful truth. That same anxiety that led me to struggle with the SAT verbal tests,

464
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,720
it's still within me in all ways of life. So maybe that's not anxiety. Maybe that's something,

465
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,720
you know, like personality is also pretty stable.

466
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:39,560
Personality is stable. Personality does impact the way you navigate life.

467
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,880
There's no question.

468
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,000
Yeah. And we should say that the G factor in intelligence is not just about some kind of

469
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:58,280
number on a paper. It's also has to do with how you navigate life, how easy life is for you

470
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:05,720
in this very complicated world. So personality is all tied into that in some deep fundamental way.

471
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,040
But now you've hit the key point about why we even want to study intelligence and personality,

472
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,800
I think to a lesser extent, but that's my interest is more on intelligence. I went to

473
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,240
graduate school and wanted to study personality, but that's kind of another story how I got kind

474
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,000
of shifted from personality research over to intelligence research. Because it's not just

475
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,200
a number. Intelligence is not just an IQ score. It's not just an SAT score. It's what those numbers

476
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:47,000
reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life. It has been said that life is one long

477
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:58,520
intelligence test. And who can't relate to that? And if you doubt, see, another problem here is a

478
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,760
lot of critics of intelligence research, intelligence testing tend to be academics who by

479
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:12,040
and large are pretty smart people. And pretty smart people by and large have enormous difficulty

480
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:20,680
understanding what the world is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75. It is a completely different

481
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:30,680
everyday experience. Even IQ scores of 85, 90, you know, there's a popular television program,

482
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:38,280
Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with everyday people with everyday problems, and you can see the full

483
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:45,160
range of problem-solving ability demonstrated there. And sometimes she does it for laughs,

484
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:54,840
but it really isn't funny because people who are, there are people who are very limited in their

485
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:05,400
life navigation, let alone success, by having, by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot

486
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,600
be taught. We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts, you know, the United States

487
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,440
military, which excels at training people. I mean, I don't know that there's a better organization

488
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:23,000
in the world for training diverse people. And they won't take people with IQs under, I think,

489
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:32,840
83 is the cutoff because they have found you, they are unable to train people with lower IQs to do

490
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,600
jobs in the military. So one of the things that G-Factor has to do with is learning? Absolutely.

491
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:46,360
Some people learn faster than others. Some people learn more than others. Now, faster, by the way,

492
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,720
is not necessarily better, as long as you get to the same place eventually.

493
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,640
But, you know, there are professional schools that want students who can learn the fastest

494
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:08,360
because they can learn more, or learn deeper, or all kinds of ideas about why you select people

495
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:15,000
with the highest scores. And there's nothing funnier, by the way, to listen to a bunch of academics

496
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:20,920
complain about the concept of intelligence and intelligence testing. And then you go to a faculty

497
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,960
meeting where they're discussing who to hire among the applicants. And all they talk about is how

498
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,400
smart the person is. We'll get to that. We'll sneak up to that in different ways. But there's

499
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,760
something about reducing a person to a number that in part is grounded to the person's genetics

500
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,760
that makes people very uncomfortable. But nobody does that. Nobody in the field actually does that.

501
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:51,160
That is a worry that is a worry like...

502
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,640
Well, I don't want to call it a conspiracy theory. I mean, it's a legitimate worry,

503
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:05,560
but it just doesn't happen. Now, I had a professor in graduate school who was the only person I ever

504
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:15,000
knew who considered the students only by their test scores. And later in his life, he kind of

505
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,840
backed off that. Let me ask you this. So we'll jump around. I'll come back to a book.

506
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:33,240
I tend to... I've had political discussions with people. And actually, my friend Michael

507
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:42,280
Malis, he's an anarchist. I disagree with him on basically everything except the fact that

508
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,520
love is a beautiful thing in this world. And he says this test about left versus right,

509
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,880
whatever. It doesn't matter what the test is, but he believes... The question is, do you believe that

510
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:05,000
some people are better than others? The question is ambiguous. Do you believe some people are better

511
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:13,560
than others? And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no. It's a poetic question. It's ambiguous

512
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:20,680
question, right? Like, you know, people want to... Maybe the temptation to ask better at what?

513
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:29,160
Better like sports and so on. No. To me, I stand with the sort of the fauny documents of this country,

514
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,120
which is all men are created equal. There's a basic humanity. And there's something about

515
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:44,280
tests of intelligence. Just knowing that some people are different, like the science of

516
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,400
intelligence that shows that some people are genetically, in some stable way across a lifetime,

517
00:48:52,280 --> 00:49:00,360
have a greater intelligence than others. Makes people feel like some people are better than

518
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:07,480
others. And that makes them very uncomfortable. And I... Maybe you can speak to that. The fact that

519
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:17,400
some people are more intelligent than others in a way that cannot be compensated through education,

520
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:25,560
through anything you do in life. What do we do with that? Okay, there's a lot there.

521
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,040
We haven't really talked about the genetics of it yet, but you are correct in that it is

522
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,760
my interpretation of the data that genetics has a very important influence on the g-factor.

523
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:47,640
This is controversial. We can talk about it. But if you think that genetics, that genes are

524
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,720
deterministic, are always deterministic, that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed.

525
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,200
But we know now in the 21st century that many genes are not deterministic, that are probabilistic.

526
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:11,640
Meaning their gene expression can be influenced. Now, whether they're influenced only by other

527
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:19,000
biological variables or other genetic variables or environmental or cultural variables,

528
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:27,000
that's where the controversy comes in. And we can discuss that in more detail if you like.

529
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:36,120
But to go to the question about better, people better, there's zero evidence that smart people

530
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:46,680
are better with respect to important aspects of life, like honesty, even likability.

531
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,320
I'm sure you know many very intelligent people who are not terribly likable or terribly kind

532
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,720
or terribly honest. Is there something to be said? So one of the things I've recently reread

533
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:07,880
for the second time, I guess that's what the word reread means, the rise and fall of the third

534
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:16,440
Reich, which is I think the best telling of the rise and fall of Hitler. And one of the interesting

535
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:32,280
things about the people that, how should I say it, justified or maybe propped up the ideas

536
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:39,160
that Hitler put forward is the fact that they were extremely intelligent. They were in the

537
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:49,400
intellectual class. It was obvious that they thought very deeply and rationally about the world.

538
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,960
So what I would like to say is one of the things that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities

539
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:03,640
in the history of humanity have been committed by very intelligent people. So that means that

540
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:12,680
intelligence doesn't make you a good person. I wonder if there's a g-factor for intelligence.

541
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:19,640
I wonder if there's a g-factor for goodness. The Nietzschean good and evil, of course that's

542
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,200
probably harder to measure because it's such a subjective thing, what it means to be good.

543
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:30,280
And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing because how do we know?

544
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,000
But it's independent, whatever it is, it's independent of intelligence. So I agree with you

545
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,800
about that. But let me say this, I have also asserted my belief that more intelligence is

546
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:55,320
better than less. It doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people, but all things being

547
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:01,160
equal, would you like to be smarter or less smart? So if I had a pill, I have two pills,

548
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,480
I said, this one will make you smarter, this one will make you dumber. Which one would you like?

549
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,760
Are there any circumstances under which you would choose to be dumber? Well, let me ask you this.

550
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,800
That's a very nuanced and interesting question. You know, there's been books written about this,

551
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:23,720
right? Now we'll return to the hard questions, the interesting questions, but let me ask about

552
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:34,200
human happiness. Does intelligence lead to happiness? No. So, okay, so back to the pill then.

553
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:45,720
So why, when would you take the pill? So you said IQ 80, 90, 100, 110, you start going through the

554
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:56,200
quartiles and is it obvious, isn't there diminishing returns and then it starts becoming negative?

555
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:07,400
This is an empirical question. And so that I have advocated in many forums more research

556
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:15,320
on enhancing the g-factor. Right now there's, there have been many claims about enhancing

557
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:21,320
intelligence with, you mentioned the NVAC training, it was a big deal a few years ago,

558
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:27,800
it doesn't work. Data is very clear, it does not work. Or doing like memory tests, like training

559
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:35,160
and so on. Yeah, it may give you a better memory in the short run, but it doesn't impact your g-factor.

560
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,880
It was very popular a couple of decades ago that the idea that listening to Mozart

561
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,080
could make you more intelligent. There was a paper published on this with somebody I knew

562
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:55,800
published this paper, intelligence researchers never believed it for a second, been hundreds of

563
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,480
studies, all the meta-analyses, all the summaries and so on, show it, there's nothing to it,

564
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:11,480
nothing to it at all. But wouldn't it be something, wouldn't it be world-shaking

565
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,840
if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence, which we haven't really talked

566
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:22,360
about yet, but IQ scores and the g-factor is thought to be a normal distribution,

567
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:32,360
and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter. Even a half a standard deviation would

568
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:41,400
be world-shaking, because there are many social problems, many, many social problems that are

569
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:50,280
exacerbated by people with lower ability to reason stuff out and navigate everyday life.

570
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:58,520
I wonder if there's a threshold. So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting

571
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:06,280
of the normal distribution may not be the optimal way of shifting. Maybe it's better to

572
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:13,880
whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions is like really pushing the lower up versus

573
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:20,920
trying to make the people at the average more intelligent. So you're saying that if in fact

574
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,920
there was some way to increase g, let's just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,

575
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:35,160
we should only give it to people at the lower end. No, it's just intuitively I can see that

576
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:42,040
life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased. It becomes less and less, it is

577
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:48,280
a empirical scientific question, but it becomes less and less obvious to me that more intelligence

578
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:57,320
is better. At the high end, not because it would make life easier, but it would make

579
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:05,320
whatever problems you're working on more solvable. And if you are working on artificial

580
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:13,160
intelligence, there's a tremendous potential for that to improve society.

581
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:19,880
I understand. So at whatever problems you're working on, yes, but there's also the problem

582
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:27,720
of the human condition. There's love, there's fear and all of those beautiful things that sometimes

583
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,480
if you're good at solving problems, you're going to create more problems for yourself.

584
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:38,280
It's, I'm not exactly sure. So ignorance is bliss is a thing. So there might be a place,

585
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,640
there might be a sweet spot of intelligence, given your environment, given your personality,

586
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,680
all of those kinds of things. And that becomes less beautifully complicated, the more and more

587
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,600
intelligent you become. But that's a question for literature and not for science perhaps.

588
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:00,600
Well, imagine this, imagine there was an IQ pill and it was developed by a private company.

589
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:08,760
And they are willing to sell it to you. And whatever price they put on it, you are willing

590
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,640
to pay it because you would like to be smarter. Yes. But just before they give you a pill,

591
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:24,120
they give you a disclaimer form to sign. Yes. Don't hold us, you understand that this pill

592
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,440
has no guarantee that your life is going to be better. And in fact, it could be worse.

593
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,360
Well, yes, that's how lawyers work. But I would love for science to answer the question,

594
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,800
to try to predict if your life is going to be better or worse,

595
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,160
when you become more, more or less intelligent. It's a, it's a fascinating question

596
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,560
about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.

597
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:53,240
Some of the things we see as bugs might be actually features may be crucial to our

598
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,960
overall happiness. Our limitations might lead to more happiness than less. But again,

599
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:06,360
more intelligence is better at the lower end. That's more, that's something that's less arguable

600
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:11,560
and, and, and, and fascinating if possible to increase. But you know, there's virtually no

601
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:19,000
research that's based on a neuroscience approach to solving that problem. All the solutions that

602
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,760
have been proposed to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem are essentially based

603
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,960
on the blank slate assumption that, you know, enriching the environment, removing barriers,

604
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,560
all good things, by the way, I'm not against any of those things. But there's no empirical evidence

605
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:47,160
that they're going to improve the general reasoning ability or make people more employable.

606
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,280
Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.

607
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,280
That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.

608
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,480
There are many profound aspects of that story. It was a film that was very good.

609
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,160
The film was called Charlie for the younger people who are listening to this.

610
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,920
You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something, but it was a story about

611
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:22,440
a person with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure in the brain and he slowly

612
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:32,680
became a genius. And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary. It's a fascinating story,

613
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,280
really. That goes in contrast to the basic human experience that each of us individually have,

614
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:45,240
but it raises the question of the full range of people you might be able to be,

615
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,560
given different levels of intelligence. You've mentioned the normal distribution.

616
01:00:52,760 --> 01:01:00,040
So let's talk about it. There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994, written by psychologist

617
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:06,920
Richard Hearnstein and political scientist Charles Murray. Why was this book so controversial?

618
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:15,240
This is a fascinating book. I know Charles Murray. I've had many conversations with him.

619
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:23,800
Yeah, what is the book about? The book is about the importance of intelligence in everyday life.

620
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:32,840
That's what the book is about. It's an empirical book. It has statistical analyses of very large

621
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:41,560
databases that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent are correlated to all kinds of

622
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:51,960
social problems and social benefits. And that in itself is not where the controversy about

623
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:59,240
that book came. The controversy was about one chapter in that book. And that is a chapter about

624
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:05,880
the average difference in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans.

625
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,960
And these are the terms that were used in the book at the time and are still used to some extent.

626
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:26,840
And historically, or really for decades, it has been observed that disadvantaged groups

627
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:38,200
score on average lower than Caucasians on academic tests, tests of mental ability,

628
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:44,200
and especially on IQ tests. And the difference is about a standard deviation, which is about 15

629
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:53,560
points, which is a substantial difference. In the book, Hearnstein and Murray in this one chapter

630
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:04,920
assert clearly and unambiguously that whether this average difference is due to genetics or not,

631
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:12,360
they are agnostic. They don't know. Moreover, they assert they don't care because you wouldn't

632
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:18,440
treat anybody differently knowing that if there was a genetic component or not, because that's a

633
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:25,000
group average finding. Every individual has to be treated as an individual. You can't make any

634
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:32,360
assumption about what that person's intellectual ability might be from the fact of an average

635
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:42,200
group difference. They're very clear about this. Nonetheless, people took away, I'm going to choose

636
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:48,200
my words carefully because I have a feeling that many critics didn't actually read the book,

637
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,880
they took away that Hearnstein and Murray were saying that blacks are genetically inferior.

638
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,280
That was the take home message. And if they weren't saying it, they were implying it because they had

639
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:09,560
a chapter that discussed this empirical observation of a difference. And isn't this horrible?

640
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:22,680
And so the reaction to that book was incendiary. What do we know about from that book and the

641
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:32,360
research beyond about race differences and intelligence? It's still the most incendiary

642
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:40,280
topic in psychology. Nothing has changed that. Anybody who even discusses it is easily called

643
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:47,400
a racist just for discussing it. It's become fashionable to find racism in any discussion

644
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:58,840
like this. It's unfortunate. The short answer to your question is there's been very little

645
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:10,440
actual research on this topic since the Belcher, even before. This really became incendiary in

646
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:17,960
1969 with an article published by an educational psychologist named Arthur Jensen. Let's just

647
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:24,200
take a minute and go back to that to see the bell curve in a little bit more historical perspective.

648
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:34,280
Arthur Jensen was an educational psychologist at UC Berkeley. I knew him as well. And in 1969

649
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:43,000
or 1968, the Harvard Educational Review asked him to do a review article on the

650
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:53,320
early childhood education programs that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.

651
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:01,160
This was before the federally funded Head Start program. Head Start had not really gotten underway

652
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:07,400
at the time Jensen undertook his review of what were a number of demonstration programs.

653
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:15,640
And these demonstration programs were for young children around kindergarten age,

654
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:22,360
and they were specially designed to be cognitively stimulating, to provide lunches,

655
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:31,720
do all the things that people thought would minimize this average gap of intelligence tests.

656
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:39,160
There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists that the cause of the gap was

657
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:46,440
unequal opportunity due to racism, due to all negative things in the society. And if you could

658
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:54,680
compensate for this, the gap would go away. So early childhood education back then was called

659
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:02,280
literally compensatory education. Jensen looked at these programs. He was an empirical guy. He

660
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:12,040
understood psychometrics. And he wrote a, it was over 100 page article detailing these programs

661
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:18,120
and the flaws in their research design. Some of the programs reported IQ gains of

662
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:25,400
on average five points, but a few reported 10, 20, and even 30 point gains. One was called the

663
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:33,560
miracle in Milwaukee. That investigator went to jail ultimately for fabricating data. But the

664
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:39,400
point is that Jensen wrote an article that said, look, the opening sentence of this article is

665
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,120
classic. The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right, but it's,

666
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:51,240
we have tried compensatory education and it has failed. And he showed that these games

667
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:59,720
were essentially nothing. You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all from these

668
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:08,120
really earnest efforts to increase IQ. But he went a step further, a fateful step further.

669
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:15,880
He said, not only have these efforts failed, but because they have had essentially no impact,

670
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:22,040
we have to re-examine our assumption that these differences are caused by environmental things

671
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:29,160
that we can address with education. We need to consider a genetic influence, whether there's

672
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,960
a genetic influence on this group difference. So you said that this is one of the more

673
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:39,640
controversial works ever. I think it's the most infamous paper in all of psychology,

674
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:48,280
I would go on to say. Because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy on this question.

675
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,120
Skimpy and controversial. It's always been controversial, but it was even skimpy and

676
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:59,080
controversial. It's kind of a long story that I go into a little bit in more detail in the book

677
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:06,520
Neuroscience of Intelligence. But to say he was vilified is an understatement. I mean,

678
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:14,040
he couldn't talk at the American Psychological Association without bomb threats clearing the

679
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:21,320
lecture hall. Campus security watched him all the time. They opened his mail. He had to retreat

680
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:30,440
to a different address. This was one of the earliest kinds, this is before the internet,

681
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:42,040
and kind of internet social media mobs. But it was that intense. And I have written that overnight,

682
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:48,920
after the publication of this article, all intelligence research became radioactive.

683
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:59,640
Nobody wanted to talk about it. And then nobody was doing more research. And then

684
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:06,520
the bell curve came along. And the Jensen controversy was dying down. I have stories that

685
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,640
Jensen told me about his interaction with the Nixon White House on this issue. I mean, it was,

686
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,800
this was like a really big deal. It was some unbelievable stories, but he told me this,

687
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:25,480
so I kind of believe these stories. Nonetheless, 25 years later, 25 years later, all the silence

688
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:33,720
basically saying, you know, this nobody wants to do this kind of research. There's so much pressure,

689
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:42,440
so much attack against this kind of research. And here's sort of a bold, stupid, crazy people that

690
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,640
decided to dive right back in. I wonder how much discussion that was, do we include this chapter

691
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:56,200
or not? Murray has said they discussed it, and they felt they should include it. And they were

692
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:05,400
very careful in the way they wrote it, which did them no good. So as a matter of fact, when the

693
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:13,160
bell curve came out, it was so controversial. I got a call from a television show called Nightline,

694
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:19,800
it was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel, who had this evening show, I think it was on late at

695
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:27,080
night, talked about news, it was a straight up news thing. And producer called and asked if I would

696
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:34,920
be on it to talk about the bell curve. And I said, you know, she asked me what I thought

697
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,880
about the bell curve as a book. I said, look, it's a very good book. It talks about the role of

698
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:47,080
intelligence in society. And she said, no, no, what do you think about the chapter on race?

699
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:53,000
That's what we want you to talk about. I remember this conversation. I said, well,

700
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:02,520
she said, what would you say if you were on TV? And I said, well, what I would say is that it's

701
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:09,240
not at all clear if there's any genetic component to intelligence,

702
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:18,760
any differences. But if there were a strong genetic component, that would be a good thing.

703
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:27,000
And, you know, complete silence on the other end of the phone. And she said, well, what do you mean?

704
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:35,160
And I said, well, if it's the more genetic any difference is, the more it's biological. And

705
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:41,720
if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it. I see. That's interesting. She said,

706
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:47,240
would you say that on television? Yes. I said, no. And so that was the end of that.

707
01:12:47,240 --> 01:13:01,240
So that's for more like biology is within the reach of science. And the environment is a public

708
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:09,000
policy, social and all those kinds of things. From your perspective, whichever one you think

709
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:15,560
is more amenable to solutions in the short term is the one that excites you. But you're saying

710
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:30,280
that it's good. The truth of genetic differences, no matter what the between groups is a painful,

711
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:37,960
harmful, potentially, potentially dangerous thing. So let me ask you to this question,

712
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,880
whether it's Bell Curve or any research on race differences,

713
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,760
can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world? Can that be used to increase the

714
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,200
amount of hate in the world? Do you think about this kind of stuff? I've thought about this a lot,

715
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:06,840
not as a scientist, but as a person. And my sense is, there is such enormous

716
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:15,560
reservoirs of hate and racism that have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data

717
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:25,800
that speak against that. No, I don't want to give racist groups of veto power over what

718
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:33,240
scientists study. If you think that the differences, and by the way, virtually no one disagrees that

719
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:40,280
there are differences in scores, it's all about what causes them and how to fix it. So if you

720
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:48,040
think this is a cultural problem, then you must ask the problem, do you want to change anything

721
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:54,040
about the culture? Or are you okay with the culture because you don't feel it's appropriate to change

722
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:59,960
a person's culture? So are you okay with that and the fact that that may lead to disadvantages in

723
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:07,400
school achievement? It's a question. If you think it's environmental, what are the environmental

724
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:15,880
parameters that can be fixed? I'll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the atmosphere,

725
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:23,080
lead in paint, lead in water. That's an environmental toxin that society has the means to

726
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:28,200
eliminate, and they should. Yeah, just to sort of try and define some

727
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:37,640
insight and conclusion to this very difficult topic. Is there been research on environment

728
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,240
versus genetics, nature versus nurture on this question of race differences?

729
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:49,480
No one wants to do this research. First of all, it's hard research to do. Second of all, it's a

730
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,520
minefield. No one wants to spend their career on it. Tenured people don't want to do it,

731
01:15:54,520 --> 01:16:02,360
let alone students. The way I talk about it, well, before I tell you the way I talk about it,

732
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:08,040
I want to say one more thing about Jensen. He was once asked by a journalist straight out,

733
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:15,400
are you a racist? His answer was very interesting. His answer was, I've thought about that a lot,

734
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:23,640
and I've concluded it doesn't matter. Now, I know what he meant by this.

735
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,800
The guts to say that. Wow.

736
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,440
He was a very unusual person. I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome to tell you the

737
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:36,040
truth, because I saw him in many circumstances. He would be canceled on Twitter immediately

738
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:40,680
with that sentence. Yeah, but what he meant was he had a hypothesis,

739
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:47,800
yeah, and with respect to group differences, he called it the default hypothesis. He said,

740
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:53,400
whatever factors affect individual intelligence are likely the same factors that affect group

741
01:16:53,400 --> 01:17:00,200
differences. It was the default, but it was a hypothesis. It should be tested, and if it turned

742
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:05,560
out, empirical test didn't support the hypothesis, he was happy to move on to something else.

743
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:15,160
He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal, that it's an empirical question.

744
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,680
We should look at it, and let's see what happens.

745
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:24,520
The scientific method cannot be racist from his perspective. It doesn't matter what the

746
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:31,960
scientists, if they follow the scientific method, it doesn't matter what they believe.

747
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:38,600
And if they are biased, and they consciously or unconsciously bias the data,

748
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:47,480
other people will come along to replicate it, they will fail, and the process over time will work.

749
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:55,960
So let me push back on this idea, because psychology to me is full of gray areas,

750
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:04,360
and what I've observed about psychology, even replication crisis aside, is that

751
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:10,680
something about the media, something about journalism, something about the virality of

752
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:20,600
ideas in the public sphere, they misinterpret. They take up things from studies willfully or

753
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:28,920
from ignorance misinterpret findings, and tell narratives around that. I personally believe,

754
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:34,680
for me, I'm not saying that broadly about science, but for me, it's my responsibility to

755
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:42,200
anticipate the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted. So I've had, I thought about

756
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:51,720
this a lot, because I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles, and cars, people dying cars.

757
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,840
There's people that have written me letters saying emails, nobody writes letters, I wish they did,

758
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:05,000
that have blood in my hands, because of things that I would say positive or negative, there's

759
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,680
consequences. In the same way, when you're a researcher of intelligence, I'm sure you might get

760
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:18,040
emails, or at least people might believe that finding your study is going to be used by a

761
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:23,880
large number of people to increase the amount of hate in the world. I think there's some

762
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:32,120
responsibility on scientists, but for me, I think there's a great responsibility to anticipate the

763
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:38,840
ways things will be misinterpreted. And there you have to, first of all, decide whether you want

764
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:45,560
to say a thing at all, or do the study at all, publish the study at all, and to the words with

765
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:53,080
which you explain it. I find this on Twitter a lot, actually, which is when I write a tweet,

766
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:01,720
and I'm usually just doing it so innocently, I'll write it, it takes me like five seconds to write

767
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:08,120
it, or whatever, 30 seconds to write it, and then I'll think, all right, I'll close my eyes, open,

768
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:13,080
and try to see how will the world interpret this? What are the ways in which this will be

769
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:20,760
misinterpreted? And I'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see, yeah, so in my mind, it's clear,

770
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,400
but that's because it's my mind from which this tweet came, but you have to think in a fresh

771
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:35,000
mind that sees this, and it's spread across a large number of other minds, how will the interpretation

772
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:41,000
morph? I mean, for a tweet, this is a silly thing, it doesn't matter, but for a scientific

773
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:48,760
paper and study and finding, I think it matters. So I don't know, I don't know what your thoughts

774
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:55,960
about that, because maybe for Jensen, the data is there, what do you want me to do? This is a

775
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:02,120
scientific process has been carried out. If you think the data was polluted by bias,

776
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:11,320
do other studies that reveal the bias, but the data is there? I'm not a poet,

777
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:17,400
I'm not a literary writer, what do you want me to do? I'm just presenting you the data.

778
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,080
What do you think on that spectrum? What's the role of a scientist?

779
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:29,240
The reason I do podcasts, the reason I write books for the public is to explain what I think

780
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:36,680
the data mean and what I think the data don't mean. I don't do very much on Twitter other than to

781
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:43,720
retweet references to papers, I don't think it's my role to explain these because they're complicated,

782
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:54,280
they're nuanced, but when you decide not to do a scientific study or not to publish a result,

783
01:21:54,280 --> 01:22:01,000
because you're afraid the result could be harmful or insensitive,

784
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:09,880
that's not an unreasonable thought, and people will make different conclusions and decisions

785
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:16,920
about that. I wrote about this, I'm the editor of a journal called Intelligence,

786
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:23,080
which publishes scientific papers. Sometimes we publish papers on group differences,

787
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:29,480
those papers sometimes are controversial. These papers are written for a scientific audience,

788
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:35,240
they're not written for the Twitter audience, so I don't promote them very much on Twitter,

789
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:45,800
but in a scientific paper you have to now choose your words carefully also because those papers

790
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:53,800
are picked up by non-scientists, by writers of various kinds, and you have to be available to

791
01:22:53,800 --> 01:23:02,600
discuss what you're saying and what you're not saying. Sometimes you are successful at having

792
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:10,440
a good conversation like we are today that doesn't start out pejorative. Other times I've been asked

793
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:17,400
to participate in debates where my role would be to justify race science. Well, you can see,

794
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:25,000
you start out, and that was a BBC request that I received.

795
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,800
I have so much, it's a love-hate relationship, mostly hate with these shallow journalism

796
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:39,480
organizations, so they would want to use you as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate as to

797
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:45,880
there is race differences between groups and make that into a debate and put you in a role of...

798
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,000
Justifying racism, that's what they're asking me to do.

799
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,480
...forces like educating about this field of the science of intelligence.

800
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:02,840
Yeah, I want to say one more thing before we get off the normal distribution. You also asked me,

801
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:09,480
what is the science after the bell curve? And the short answer is there's not much new work,

802
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:15,240
but whatever work there is supports the idea that there still are group differences.

803
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,360
It's arguable whether those differences have diminished at all or not,

804
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:28,120
and there is still a major problem in underperformance for school achievement.

805
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:36,200
For many disadvantaged and minority students, and there so far is no way to fix it.

806
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:43,640
What do we do with this information? Is this now a task? Now, we'll talk about the future

807
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:51,080
on the neuroscience and the biology side, but in terms of this information as a society,

808
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:55,080
in the public policy, in the political space, in the social space, what do we do with this

809
01:24:55,080 --> 01:25:02,600
information? I've thought a lot about this. The first step is to have people interested in policy

810
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:09,800
understand what the data actually show to pay attention to intelligence data.

811
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:16,680
You can read policy papers about education, and using your word processor, you can search for

812
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:23,080
the word intelligence. You can search a 20,000 word document in a second and find out the word

813
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:31,480
intelligence does not appear anywhere in most discussions about what to do about achievement

814
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,640
gaps. I'm not talking about test gaps. I'm talking about actual achievement gaps in schools, which

815
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:43,080
everyone agrees is a problem. The word intelligence doesn't appear among educators.

816
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,600
That's fascinating. As a matter of fact, in California,

817
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:53,720
there has been tremendous controversy about recent attempts to revise the curriculum for math

818
01:25:54,360 --> 01:26:01,320
in high schools. We had a Stanford professor of education who was running this review

819
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:10,600
assert there's no such thing as talent, a mathematical talent. She wanted to get rid of the

820
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:16,520
advanced classes in math because not everyone could do that. Of course, this has been very

821
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,280
controversial. They've retreated somewhat, but the idea that a university professor was in charge

822
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:33,560
of this who believes that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist, this is rather shocking,

823
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:39,320
let alone the complete absence of intelligence data. By the way, let me tell you something about

824
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:47,000
what the intelligence data show. Let's take a race out of it. Even though the origins of these

825
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:55,320
studies were a long time ago, I'm blocking on the name of the report, the Coleman report was a

826
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:03,480
famous report about education. They measured all kinds of variables about schools, about teachers,

827
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:11,880
and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome. They found the most predictive

828
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:19,000
variables of education outcome where the variables the student brought with him or her

829
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:27,240
into the school, essentially their ability. When you combine the school and the teacher

830
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:32,760
variables together, the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the

831
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:38,120
teachers, their education, you put all the teacher and school variables together, it barely

832
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:48,840
accounted for 10% of the variance. This has been replicated now. The best research we have

833
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:57,320
shows that school variables and teacher variables together account for about 10% of student academic

834
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:05,480
achievement. Now, you want to have some policy on improving academic achievement. How much money

835
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:12,440
do you want to put into teacher education? How much money do you want to put into the quality of

836
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:17,000
the school administration? You know who you can ask? You can ask the Gates Foundation,

837
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:24,120
because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that. At the end of it, because they're

838
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:29,560
measurement people, they want to know the data. They found it had no impact at all,

839
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:40,120
and they've pulled out of that program. Boy, let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's

840
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:46,600
just the two of us. Just the two of us, but I'm going to say some funny and ridiculous things.

841
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:52,840
You're surely not approving of it, but there's a movie called Clerks.

842
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:01,080
I've seen it. There's a funny scene in there where a lovely couple are talking about the

843
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:09,560
number of previous sexual partners they had. The woman says that, I believe she just had a handful,

844
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:14,120
like two or three or something like that, sexual partners, but then she also mentioned

845
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:22,520
that she, what's that called, a fallacious? What's the scientific? She gave a blow job

846
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:34,040
to 37 guys, I believe it is. That has to do with the truth. Sometimes knowing the truth

847
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:41,880
can get in the way of a successful relationship of love of some of the human flourishing.

848
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:48,520
And that seems to me that's at the core here, that facing some kind of

849
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:55,560
truth that's not able to be changed, it makes it difficult to sort of

850
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:04,840
is limiting as opposed to empowering. That's the concern. If you sort of test for intelligence

851
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,520
and lay the data out, it feels like you will give up on certain people. You will

852
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:18,920
sort of start bidding people as like, well, this person is like, let's focus on the average people

853
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,680
or let's focus on the very intelligent people. That's the concern. And there's a kind of

854
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:33,000
intuition that if we just don't measure and we don't use that data, that we would treat everybody

855
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,600
equal and give everybody equal opportunity. If we have the data in front of us, we're likely to

856
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:49,320
misdistribute the amount of sort of attention we allocate, resources we allocate to people.

857
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:57,080
That's probably the concern. It's a realistic concern, but I think it's a misplaced concern

858
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:02,840
if you want to fix the problem. If you want to fix the problem, you have to know what the

859
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:09,560
problem is. Now, let me tell you this. Let's go back to the bell curve, not the bell curve,

860
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:18,440
but the normal distribution. 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,

861
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:25,960
which means they're very hard. If you have an IQ under 85, it's very hard to find gainful

862
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:36,040
employment at a salary that sustains you at least minimally in modern life. Not impossible,

863
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:45,640
but it's very difficult. 16% of the population of the United States is about 51 or 52 million people

864
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:55,640
with IQs under 85. This is not a small issue. 14 million children have IQs under 85.

865
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:03,640
Is this something we want to ignore? Does this have any, what is the Venn diagram between,

866
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:10,680
you know, when you have people with IQs under 85 and you have achievement in school

867
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:19,560
or achievement in life? There's a lot of overlap there. This is why, to go back to the IQ pill,

868
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:31,080
if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end, that would have a big impact.

869
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:36,040
If I could maybe before we talk about the impact on life and so on,

870
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:42,520
some of the criticisms of the bell curve. So Stephen Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve

871
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:47,960
rests on four incorrect assumptions. It would be just interesting to get your thoughts on the four

872
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:53,400
assumptions, which are intelligence must be reducible to a single number, intelligence must

873
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:59,560
be capable of rank ordering people in a linear order, intelligence must be primarily genetically

874
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:06,840
based and intelligence must be essentially immutable. Maybe not as criticisms, but as

875
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,760
thoughts about intelligence. Yeah, we could spend a lot of time on him.

876
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:25,000
Stephen Jay Gould, yeah. He wrote that in what about 1985, 1984. His views were overtly political,

877
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,600
not scientific. He was a scientist, but his views on this were overtly political,

878
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:38,200
and I would encourage people listening to this if they really want to understand his criticisms.

879
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:48,920
They should just Google what he had to say and Google the scientific reviews of his book,

880
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:55,480
the mismeasure of man, and they will take these statements apart. They were wrong,

881
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:03,160
not only were they wrong, but when he asserted in his first book that there was no biological

882
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:11,560
basis essentially to IQ. By the time the second edition came around, there were studies of MRIs

883
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:17,720
of showing that brain size, brain volume were correlated to IQ scores, which he declined to

884
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:26,040
put in his book. I'm learning a lot today. I didn't know the extent of his work. I was just

885
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:30,920
using a few little snippets of criticism. That's interesting. There's a battle here. He wrote

886
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:36,280
a book, Mismeasure of Man, that's missing a lot of the scientific grounding.

887
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:41,960
His book is highly popular in colleges today. You can find it in any college bookstore under

888
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:46,600
assigned reading. It's highly popular. The Mismeasure of Man? Yes, highly influential.

889
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:51,400
Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man? I'm undereducated about this. Is this the book

890
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,600
basically criticizing the ideas in the bulk of it? Yes, where those four things came from.

891
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:06,360
It is really a book that was really taken apart point by point by a number of people who actually

892
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:11,320
understood the data. He didn't care. He didn't care. He didn't modify anything.

893
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:17,960
It's a politically... Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic, like I said, I believe

894
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:29,640
the impact of the work as it is misinterpreted has to be considered because it's not just

895
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,400
going to be scientific discourse. It's going to be political discourse. There's going to be

896
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:40,440
debates. There's going to be politically motivated people that would use messages in

897
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:51,400
each direction, make something like the bulk of the enemy or the support for one's racist beliefs.

898
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:59,640
I think you have to consider that, but it's difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler to

899
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:07,560
justify a lot of his beliefs. It's not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler

900
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:14,440
or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil, but there's a balance there.

901
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:20,680
This is really interesting. I didn't know. Is there any criticism of the book you find compelling

902
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,840
or interesting or challenging to use from a scientific perspective? There were factual

903
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:32,600
criticisms about the nature of the statistics that were used, the statistical analyses. These

904
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:38,600
were more technical criticisms. They were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles where he took

905
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:45,800
all the criticisms and spoke to them. People listening to this podcast can certainly find all

906
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:53,080
those online. It's very interesting, but Murray went on to write some additional books, two in

907
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:59,400
the last couple of years. One about human diversity, where he goes through the data

908
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:09,320
refuting the idea that race is only a social construct with no biological meaning. He discusses

909
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:14,840
the data. It's a very good discussion. You don't have to agree with it, but he presents data in a

910
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:21,480
cogent way. He talks about the critics of that and he talks about their data in a cogent,

911
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:28,840
not personal way. It's a very informative discussion. The book is called Human Diversity.

912
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,400
He talks about race and he talks about gender, same thing, about sex differences.

913
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:41,320
And more recently, he's written what might be his final say on this, a book called Facing Reality,

914
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:50,360
where he talks about this again. He can certainly defend himself. He doesn't need me

915
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:57,480
to do that, but I would urge people who have heard about him and the bell curve

916
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:05,240
and who think they know what's in it. You are likely incorrect and you need to read it for yourself.

917
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:14,120
But it is scientifically, it's a serious subject. It's a difficult subject. Ethically,

918
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:20,680
it's a difficult subject. Everything you said here calmly and thoughtfully is difficult. This

919
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:27,800
is difficult for me to even consider that g-factor exists. I don't mean from like,

920
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:35,160
that somehow g-factors inherently racist or sexist or whatever. It's just, it's difficult in the way

921
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:41,400
that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult, that we are limited by our biology.

922
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:48,760
It's difficult. And it's, at least from an American perspective, you would like to believe

923
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:56,680
that everything is possible in this world. Well, that leads us to what I think we should

924
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:05,480
do with this information. And what I think we should do with this information is unusual.

925
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:13,480
Uh-oh. Because I think what we need to do is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular

926
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:23,640
biology of learning and memory because one definition of intelligence is based on how

927
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:29,960
much you can learn and how much you can remember. Yes. And if you accept that definition of intelligence,

928
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:37,400
then there are molecular studies going on now and Nobel Prize is being won

929
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:43,960
on molecular biology or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory.

930
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:52,040
Now, the step those researchers, those scientists need to take when it comes to intelligence

931
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:02,760
is to focus on the concept of individual differences. Intelligence research has individual

932
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:11,080
differences as its heart because it assumes that people differ on this variable and those

933
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:19,720
differences are meaningful and need understanding. Cognitive psychologists who have morphed into

934
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:26,040
molecular biologists studying learning and memory hate the concept of individual differences

935
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:33,800
historically. Some now are coming around to it. I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner

936
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:42,040
for his work on memory and I asked him about individual differences and he said,

937
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:49,480
don't go there. It'll set us back 50 years. I said, don't you think they're the key though

938
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:55,960
to understand? Why can some people remember more than others? He said, you don't want to go there.

939
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:00,600
I think the 21st century will be remembered by the technology and the science that

940
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:06,760
goes to individual differences because we have now data. We have now the tools to much,

941
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:13,480
much better to start to measure, start to estimate, not just on the sort of through tests and IQ

942
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:19,640
test type of things, sort of outside the body kind of things, but measuring all kinds of stuff

943
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:25,400
about the body. So yeah, truly going to the molecular biology, to the neurobiology, to the

944
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:36,520
neuroscience. Let me ask you about this life. How does intelligence correlate with or lead to

945
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:40,760
or has anything to do with career success? You've mentioned these kinds of things and

946
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,680
is there any data, you had an excellent conversation with Jordan Peterson, for example.

947
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:52,680
Is there any data on what intelligent means for success in life?

948
01:41:53,400 --> 01:42:02,040
Success in life. There is a tremendous amount of validity data that looked at

949
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:13,720
intelligence test scores and various measures of life success. Now, of course, life success is a

950
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:25,320
pretty broad topic and not everybody agrees on what success means, but there's general agreement

951
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:34,360
on certain aspects of success that can be measured. And those including life expectancy,

952
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:44,680
like you said. Life expectancy. Now, there's life success. Life expectancy. I mean,

953
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:52,760
that is such an interesting finding, but IQ scores are also correlated to things like

954
01:42:52,840 --> 01:43:01,960
income. Now, okay, so who thinks income means you're successful? That's not the point. The point

955
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:10,120
is that income is one empirical measure in this culture that says something about your level

956
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:16,920
of success. You can define success in ways that have nothing to do with income. You can define

957
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:29,720
success based on your evolutionary natural selection success. And even that, by the way,

958
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:37,560
is correlated to IQ in some studies. So, however you want to define success,

959
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:46,760
IQ is important. It's not the only determinant people get hung up on. Well, what about personality?

960
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:53,000
What about so-called emotional intelligence? Yes, all those things matter. The thing that matters

961
01:43:53,560 --> 01:44:00,280
empirically, the single thing that matters the most is your general ability, your general mental

962
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:08,280
intellectual ability, your reasoning ability. And the more complex your vocation, the more complex

963
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:16,360
your job, the more G matters. G doesn't matter and a lot of occupations don't require complex thinking.

964
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,520
And there are occupations like that and G doesn't matter. Within an occupation,

965
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:32,760
the G might not matter so much. So that if you look at all the professors at MIT

966
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:42,280
and had a way to rank order them on, you know, there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying,

967
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,160
that, you know... Also, when you get past a certain threshold, then there's impact on wealth,

968
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:54,360
for example, or career success. However, that's defined in each individual discipline, but

969
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:59,480
after a certain point, it doesn't matter. Actually, it does matter in certain things. So,

970
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:08,120
for example, there is a very classic study that was started at Johns Hopkins when I was a graduate

971
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,800
student there. I actually worked on this study at the very beginning, the study of

972
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:20,040
Mathematically and Scientifically Precocious Youth. And they gave junior high school students,

973
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:30,360
age 11 and 12, the standard SAT math exam. And they found a very large number of students

974
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:37,560
scored very high on this exam, not a large number. I mean, they found many students when

975
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:44,200
they cast the net, all of Baltimore, they found a number of students who scored as high on the

976
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:51,960
SAT math when they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins freshmen. And they said, gee, now this

977
01:45:51,960 --> 01:46:01,640
is interesting, what shall we do now? And on a case by case basis, they got some of those kids

978
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:09,320
into their local community college math programs. Many of those kids went on to be very successful.

979
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:16,040
And now there's a 50-year follow-up of those kids. And it turns out,

980
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:25,720
these kids were in the top 1%. Okay, so everybody in this study is in the top 1%. If you take that

981
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:33,720
group, that rarefied group and divide them into quartiles, so that you have the top 25% of the

982
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:47,960
top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%, you can find on measurable variables of success,

983
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:54,840
the top quartile does better than the bottom quartile. In the top 1%, they have more patents,

984
01:46:54,840 --> 01:47:00,440
they have more publications, they have more tenure at universities. And this is based on,

985
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:05,000
you're dividing them based on their score at age 12.

986
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:12,200
I wonder how much interesting data is in the variability, in the differences.

987
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:22,040
That's very interesting, but it's also, I don't know, somehow painful. I don't know why it's so

988
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:31,080
painful, that that's so, that G-Facture so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.

989
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:36,520
This is interesting that you find that painful. Do you find it painful that people with charisma

990
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:42,920
are very successful, can be very successful in life, even though having no other attributes other

991
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:50,280
than their famous and people like them? Do you find that painful? Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.

992
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:56,120
So one of the things, again, this is like I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial,

993
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:03,080
but one of the things the psychologist, the personality psychologist, he can maybe speak

994
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:10,200
to this because he had interest in this for time, is she was saying that personality,

995
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:19,160
technically speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime. It's the thing you're,

996
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,680
I don't know if she was actually implying that you're born with it. Well, it's a trait.

997
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:28,920
It's a trait. It's a trait that's relatively stable over time. I think that's generally correct.

998
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:35,640
So do the degree your personality is stable over time? Yes, that too is painful,

999
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:43,320
because what's not painful is the thing, if I'm fat, not of shape, I can exercise

1000
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:52,360
and become healthier in that way. If my diet is a giant mess and that's resulting in some kind of

1001
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:57,000
conditions that my body is experiencing, I can fix that by having a better diet.

1002
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:05,400
That's sort of my actions, my willed actions can make a change. If charisma is part of the

1003
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:11,480
personality, that's the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that is stable.

1004
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:18,520
Well, yeah, yeah, that's painful too, because it's like, oh, shit, I'm stuck with this. I'm

1005
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:25,160
stuck with this. Well, I mean, this pretty much generalizes to every aspect of your being. This

1006
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:30,360
is who you are. You've got to deal with it. And what it undermines, of course, is a realistic

1007
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:41,320
appreciation for this undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country that if you work

1008
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:48,040
hard, you can be anything you want to be, which has morphed from the original idea that if you

1009
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:57,560
work hard, you can be successful. Those are two different things. And now we have, if you work

1010
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:05,080
hard, you can be anything you want to be. This is completely unrealistic. I'm sorry, it just is.

1011
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:10,920
Now you can work hard and be successful. There's no question. But you know what? I could work

1012
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,960
very hard and I am not going to be a successful theoretical physicist. I'm just not.

1013
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:24,040
That said, I mean, we should, because we had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat

1014
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:31,640
the fact that you're not going to be a theoretical physicist. It's not judgment on your basic

1015
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:39,640
humanity. Returning again to the old men, which means men and women are created equal. So again,

1016
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:44,440
some of the differences we're talking about in quote unquote, success, wealth,

1017
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:54,840
number of, whether you win a Nobel Prize or not, that doesn't put a measure on your basic

1018
01:50:54,840 --> 01:51:03,000
humanity and basic value and even goodness of you as a human being. Because that,

1019
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:12,840
that your basic role and value in society is largely within your control. It's some of these

1020
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:17,880
measures that we're talking about. It's good. It's good to remember this.

1021
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:26,200
One question about the Flynn effect. What is it? Are humans getting smarter over the years,

1022
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:33,480
over the decades, over the centuries? The Flynn effect is, James Flynn passed away about a year

1023
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:46,040
ago, published a set of analyses, going back a couple of decades, when he first noticed this,

1024
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:55,480
that IQ scores, when you looked over the years, seemed to be drifting up. Now, this was not

1025
01:51:55,480 --> 01:52:02,840
unknown to the people who make the test, because they renorm the test periodically, and they have

1026
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:11,400
to renorm the test periodically, because what 10 items correct meant relative to other people

1027
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:19,560
50 years ago is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today. People are getting more

1028
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:26,600
things correct. Now, the scores have been drifting up about three points, IQ scores have been drifting

1029
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:33,320
up about three points per decade. This is not a personal effect. This is a cohort effect.

1030
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:39,800
It's not for an individual, but- The world. How do you explain, so what's the definition?

1031
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:47,000
This has presented intelligence researchers with a great mystery. Two questions. First,

1032
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:53,800
is it effect on the 50% of the variance that's the G factor or on the other 50%

1033
01:52:53,880 --> 01:53:02,920
and there's evidence that it is a G factor effect. Second, what on earth causes this and

1034
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:09,560
doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor cannot be genetic, because the scale of natural

1035
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:19,080
selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. It's been used to try to undermine

1036
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:27,480
the idea that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence, but certainly it can be the

1037
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:34,520
Flynn effect can affect the non-genetic aspects of intelligence, because genes account for maybe

1038
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:43,080
50% of the variance, maybe higher, it could be as high as 80% for adults, but let's just say 50%

1039
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:51,400
for discussion. So, the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery. It's still a mystery. That's

1040
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:55,480
interesting. It's still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out. I told you before I edited

1041
01:53:55,480 --> 01:54:01,160
a journal on intelligence and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn, so I'm

1042
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:08,840
starting to see papers now. I'm really the latest research on this. I think most people who specialize

1043
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:16,680
in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect are coming to the view based on data that

1044
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:25,960
it has to do with advances in nutrition and healthcare. And there's also evidence that the

1045
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:35,080
effect is slowing down and possibly reversing. Oh boy. So, how would nutrition, nutrition would

1046
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:42,680
still be connected to the g-factor? So, nutrition as it relates to the g-factor, so the biology that

1047
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:51,800
leads to the intelligence. Yes. That would be the claim. The hypothesis being tested by the

1048
01:54:51,800 --> 01:55:00,520
research. Yes, and there's some evidence from infants that nutrition has made a difference.

1049
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:07,720
So, it's not an unreasonable connection, but does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence?

1050
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:15,080
Not logically at all. But it is very interesting, so that if you take an IQ test today,

1051
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:25,560
but you take the score and use the tables that were available in 1940, you're going to wind up

1052
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:35,240
with a much higher IQ number. So, are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago? No,

1053
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:43,720
but we might be able to solve problems a little better and make use of our g because of things

1054
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:50,680
like Sesame Street and other curricula in school. More people are going to school,

1055
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:58,360
so there are a lot of factors here to disentangle. It's fascinating though. It's fascinating that

1056
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:05,960
there's not clear answers yet that as a population, we're getting smarter. When you just zoom out,

1057
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:10,120
that's what it looks like as a population getting smarter. It's interesting to see what the effects

1058
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:15,880
of that are. I mean, this raises the question. We've mentioned it many times, but haven't clearly

1059
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:22,040
addressed it, which is nature versus nurture question. So, how much of intelligence is nature?

1060
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:27,640
How much of it is nurture? How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment?

1061
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:33,480
All of it. All of it is genetics. No, all of it is nature and nurture.

1062
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:43,560
So, yes. Okay. But how much of the variance can you apportion to either?

1063
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:52,200
Most of the people who work in this field say that the framing of that, if the question is framed

1064
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:58,520
that way, it can't be answered because nature and nurture are not too independent influences.

1065
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:07,080
They interact with each other and understanding those interactions is so complex that many

1066
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:15,160
behavioral geneticists say it is today impossible and always will be impossible

1067
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:22,280
to disentangle that no matter what kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic

1068
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:30,760
informatics. But there's still to push back on that. That same intuition from behavioral geneticists

1069
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:35,720
would lead me to believe that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor.

1070
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:43,480
It's super complex. Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome,

1071
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:52,360
but because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources of data, not just one study,

1072
01:57:52,360 --> 01:58:02,840
but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the idea that whatever interactions

1073
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:11,320
between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated, they can be studied,

1074
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:19,320
and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of intelligence.

1075
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:27,880
Yes. And we'll do this exact question because doesn't the stability of the G factor give you

1076
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:33,800
at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?

1077
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:42,840
Yes. I think it's clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness

1078
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:55,400
of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain that identical

1079
01:58:55,400 --> 01:59:05,720
twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores. These are all important observations

1080
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:14,120
that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that there's a biological basis. And does anyone

1081
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:20,120
believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain? I mean, it's so obvious.

1082
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:24,440
Well, indirectly definitely has to do with it, but the question is

1083
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:33,720
environment interacting with the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?

1084
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:44,760
Well, some would say that the raw hardware of the brain as it develops from conception

1085
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:52,920
through adulthood or at least through the childhood, that that so-called hardware that you

1086
01:59:52,920 --> 02:00:02,040
are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think, that it is

1087
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:10,280
probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment and other

1088
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:20,520
factors like that, including chance, that chance affects the way the neurons are connecting during

1089
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:31,160
gestation. It's not, hey, it's pre-programmed. So there is pushback on the concept that genes

1090
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:39,640
provide a blueprint, that it's a lot more fluid. Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot, a lot,

1091
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:51,000
happens in the first few months of development. So for in nine months inside the mother's body,

1092
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:58,520
and in the, you know, the months, the few months afterwards, there's a lot of fascinating stuff,

1093
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:06,040
like including chance and luck, like you said, how things connect up. The question is afterwards,

1094
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:09,880
the neuroplasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is relative to the environment,

1095
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:15,960
how much that affects the g-factor, but that's where the whole conclusions of the studies that

1096
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:22,840
we've been talking about is that seems to have less and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly.

1097
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:31,240
Yes, and I do think there is more of a genetic, my view, and I'm not an expert on this, I mean,

1098
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:36,680
genetics is a highly technical and complex subject. I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral

1099
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:46,520
geneticist, but my reading of this, my interpretation of this, is that there is a genetic blueprint

1100
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:54,120
more or less, and that has a profound influence on your subsequent intellectual development,

1101
02:01:54,120 --> 02:02:01,560
including the g-factor. And that's not to say things can't happen to, I mean,

1102
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:09,400
if you think of that genes provide a potential, fine, and that various variables impact that

1103
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:18,600
potential. And every parent of a newborn, implicitly or explicitly, wants to maximize that potential.

1104
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:25,480
This is why you buy educational toys. This is why you pay attention to organic baby food.

1105
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:32,440
This is why you do all these things because you want your baby to be as healthy and as smart as

1106
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:38,680
possible. And every parent will say that. Is there a case to be made? Can you steal me on the case

1107
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:49,240
that genetics is a very tiny component of all this, and the environment is essential?

1108
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:54,760
I don't think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component. I think the data support the

1109
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:59,960
idea that the genetics is a very important, and I don't say component, I say influence.

1110
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:06,760
A very important influence, and the environment is a lot less than people believe.

1111
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:11,480
Most people believe environment plays a big role. I'm not so sure.

1112
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:18,120
I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where, what you just said, it might be wrong?

1113
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:27,000
Can you imagine a world, and what kind of evidence would you need to see to say,

1114
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,360
you know what, the intuition, the study so far, like reversing the direction. So one of the cool

1115
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:37,880
things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data, and the rate of the data is

1116
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:45,880
escalating because of the digital world. So when you start to look at a very large scale of data,

1117
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:51,960
both from the biology side and the social side, we might be discovering some very counterintuitive

1118
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:59,560
things about society. We might see the edge cases that reveal that if we actually scale those edge

1119
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:06,840
cases, and they become like the norm, that we'll have a complete shift in our, like you'll see

1120
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:17,560
g-factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens in later life. So in any case you

1121
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:22,600
can make, or for where your current intuitions are wrong. Yes, and it's a good question because I

1122
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:28,600
think everyone should always be asked, what evidence would change your mind? It's certainly,

1123
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:33,880
not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working on any

1124
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:45,320
aspect of science. I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly by

1125
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:52,120
now. It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early

1126
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:57,800
childhood education, all these things that have been earnestly tried and well-funded,

1127
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:03,960
well-designed studies would show some effect, and they don't. They don't. What if school,

1128
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:10,120
the way we've tried school, compensatory school sucks and we need to do better? That's what

1129
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:16,760
everybody said to Jensen. He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier. Maybe we need not do

1130
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:23,640
pre-kindergarten, but pre-pre-kindergarten. It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't get it

1131
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:33,800
right. But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something would have

1132
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:40,760
worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability level at 0.05

1133
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:47,560
on some means. That's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.

1134
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:57,480
Population level interventions like schooling that you would see, this actually has an effect.

1135
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:05,160
Yes. When you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when those

1136
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:10,600
adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their adoptive

1137
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:16,840
parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents whom they've

1138
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:26,120
never met. These are powerful observations. It would be convincing to you if the reverse was

1139
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:34,280
true. Yes, that would be more. There is some data on adoption that indicates the adopted children

1140
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:44,600
are moving a little bit more toward their adoptive parents. To me, the overwhelming, I have this

1141
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:50,760
concept called the weight of evidence, where I don't interpret any one study too much. The weight

1142
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:55,560
of evidence tells me genes are important. But what does that mean? What does it mean that

1143
02:06:55,560 --> 02:07:02,520
genes are important? Knowing that gene expression, genes don't express themselves in a vacuum.

1144
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:08,520
They express themselves in an environment. The environment has to have something to do with it,

1145
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:15,480
especially if the best genetic estimates of the amount of variance are around 50 or even if it's

1146
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:24,840
as high as 80%, it still leaves 20% of non-genetic. Now, maybe that is all luck. Maybe that's all

1147
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:36,200
chance. I could easily believe that. But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions,

1148
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:42,680
and nothing works, including memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing

1149
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:48,920
computer games, none of that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.

1150
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:57,080
Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?

1151
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:07,080
Yes. And there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents' IQ and the

1152
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:17,160
high IQ parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child in addition to

1153
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:21,880
the genes, it's that environment. So there are all these interactions that,

1154
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:30,840
but think about the number of books in a household. This was a variable that's correlated

1155
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:40,120
with IQ. It is. Yeah. Well, why? Especially if the kid never reads any of the books. It's because

1156
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:46,760
more intelligent people have more books in their house. And if you're more intelligent,

1157
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:55,080
and there's a genetic component to that, the child will get those genes or some of those genes,

1158
02:08:55,080 --> 02:09:02,200
as well as the environment. But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly

1159
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:09,800
impacts the child. So the two scenarios on this are you find that, and this was used to

1160
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:17,000
get rid of the SAT test, or the SAT scores highly correlated with the social economic status of the

1161
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:24,040
parents. So all you're really measuring is how rich the parents are. Okay, well, why are the parents

1162
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:35,720
rich? Yes. And so you could, the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright

1163
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:44,360
make more money. They can afford homes in better neighborhoods, so their kids get better schools.

1164
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:50,200
Now the kids grow up bright. Where in that chain of events does that come from?

1165
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:58,840
Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design, where you look at siblings

1166
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:06,600
that have the same biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that. Most studies

1167
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:14,360
of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed design. So any

1168
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:21,960
conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause of the IQ

1169
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:29,560
is a stretch. And where you do find genetically informative designs,

1170
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:38,760
you find most of the variance in your outcome measures are due to the genetic component,

1171
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:47,080
and sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very much

1172
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:53,880
variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance. So when you actually look at

1173
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:59,800
it in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically informed designs,

1174
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,320
but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.

1175
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:08,520
Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between

1176
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:19,480
fertility or the number of kids that you have and g-factor? So you know the kind of conventional

1177
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:27,800
wisdom is people of maybe higher economic status or something like that or having fewer children.

1178
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:33,880
I just loosely hear these kinds of things. Is there data that you're aware of in one direction

1179
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:38,680
or another on this? Well, strange questions always get strange answers.

1180
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:44,600
Yes. Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?

1181
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:51,640
The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family,

1182
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:59,800
the firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.

1183
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:07,720
It's not clear that those studies hold up over time, and of course what you see also

1184
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:15,160
is that families where there are multiple children, four, five, six, seven, you know,

1185
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:25,560
really big families, the social economic status of those families usually in the modern age is

1186
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:31,880
not that high. Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids,

1187
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:41,240
I'm not sure exactly. But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility,

1188
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:50,360
but I'm not sure that the data are very strong that the firstborn child is always the smartest.

1189
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:54,280
It seems like there's some data to that, but I'm not current on that.

1190
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:57,880
How would that be explained? That would be a nurture.

1191
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:03,320
Well, it could be nurture, it could be in uterine environment. I mean,

1192
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:13,800
and this is why this, you know, like many areas of science, you said earlier that

1193
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:18,600
there are a lot of gray areas and no definitive answers.

1194
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:29,400
This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem, the more questions you get,

1195
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:38,440
not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated. And the idea that we have people

1196
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:46,680
on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, that's pretty amazing.

1197
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:53,080
And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang,

1198
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:58,120
we can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.

1199
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:04,280
I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.

1200
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:09,400
It's unclear to me. I think we over emphasize.

1201
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,920
Well, that's a very humbling statement.

1202
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:17,320
Maybe it's very human centric egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super

1203
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:25,000
complicated, but biology is a trick you want to unravel consciousness. What is that?

1204
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:32,120
I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real

1205
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:40,360
fundamental problems of the human brain. And therefore, I think they must be related.

1206
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:48,920
Part problems like walk together, holding hands, kind of idea.

1207
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:54,200
You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain

1208
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:59,080
imaging, trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off when

1209
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:05,480
someone loses consciousness? And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness

1210
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:11,080
is regained? And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire. He was really brilliant

1211
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:17,400
at this. These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography

1212
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:27,160
long before fMRI. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain,

1213
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:31,640
and the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up. And then you could make

1214
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:40,840
a picture of glucose use in the brain. And he was amazing. He managed to do this in normal

1215
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:49,640
volunteers he brought in and anesthetized as if they were going into surgery. He managed all

1216
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:59,800
the human subjects requirements on this research. And he was brilliant at this. And what we did

1217
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:06,520
is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions. On one occasion, he gave them

1218
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:16,760
enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy. And on another occasion, they came in

1219
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:27,000
and he fully anesthetized them. And he would say, Mike, can you hear me? And the person would say,

1220
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:38,600
oh, yeah. And then we would scan people under no anesthetic condition. So the same person.

1221
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:47,320
And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off. He subsequently

1222
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:53,240
tried to do this with fMRI, which has a faster time resolution. And you could do it in real time

1223
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:57,640
as the person went under and then regained consciousness where you couldn't do that with

1224
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:03,240
PET. You had to have three different occasions. And the results were absolutely fascinating.

1225
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:08,760
We did this with different anesthetic drugs. And different drugs impacted different parts of the

1226
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:15,960
brain. So we were naturally looking for the common one. And it seemed to have something to do with

1227
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:24,760
the thalamus and consciousness. This was actual data on consciousness. Real consciousness, actual

1228
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:31,880
consciousness. What part of the brain turns on? What part of the brain turns off? It's not so clear.

1229
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,880
But maybe it has something to do with the thalamus. The sequence of events seemed to

1230
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:44,280
have the thalamus in it. Boy. Now here's the question. Are some people more conscious than

1231
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:50,680
others? Are there individual differences in consciousness? And I don't mean it in the

1232
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:56,920
psychedelic sense. I don't mean it in the political consciousness sense. I just mean it in everyday

1233
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:02,680
life. Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others? And are those the people

1234
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:09,720
we might actually label more intelligent? So now the other thing I was looking for is whether the

1235
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:14,600
parts of the brain we were seeing in the anesthesia studies were the same parts of the

1236
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:21,240
brain we were seeing in the intelligent studies. Now this is, you know, this was very complicated,

1237
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:26,280
expensive research. We didn't really have funding to do this. We were trying to do it on the fly.

1238
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:33,000
I'm not sure anybody has pursued this. You know, I'm retired now. He's gone on to other things.

1239
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:41,000
But I think it's an area of research that would be fascinating to see the parts. There are a lot

1240
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:47,000
more imaging studies now of consciousness. I'm just not up on them. But basically the question is

1241
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:54,200
which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution, spatial and temporal way,

1242
02:18:54,200 --> 02:19:01,160
which part of the brain lights up when you're doing intelligence tasks? And which parts of the

1243
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:05,000
brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and see the interplay between them?

1244
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:10,920
Try to infer. That's the challenge of neuroscience. Without understanding deeply,

1245
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:18,920
looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole thing works.

1246
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:25,320
Well, imagine this. Here's a simple question. Does it take more anesthetic drug

1247
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:36,920
to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is 140, than a person with an IQ of 70?

1248
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:46,840
That's an interesting way to study it. If the answer to that is a stable yes,

1249
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:53,080
that's very interesting. So I tried to find out. And I went to some anesthesiology textbooks

1250
02:19:53,080 --> 02:20:04,040
about how you dose and they dose by weight. And what I also learned, this is a little bit off

1251
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:13,160
subject, anesthesiologists are never sure how deep you are. And they usually tell by poking you with

1252
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:19,000
a needle and if you don't jump, they tell the surgeon to go ahead. I'm not sure that's literally

1253
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:26,920
true, but it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are. It has to do with

1254
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:33,960
the same kind of measurements that you're doing with the consciousness. It's difficult to know.

1255
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:39,400
So I don't lose my train of thought. I couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by

1256
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:45,880
intelligence. I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know. I said,

1257
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:54,120
can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as a proxy for IQ?

1258
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:58,840
Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make some

1259
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:04,200
inferences as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school. Can we do a chart review?

1260
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:12,040
And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose. And no, he said, no. So to this day,

1261
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:20,280
the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high IQ

1262
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:27,560
or less? Or less? It could go either way. Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of

1263
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:36,920
intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic

1264
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:45,160
and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was negatively

1265
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:51,000
correlated to how well they did on the test, which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis,

1266
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:58,360
which is still being studied today. And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain

1267
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:09,080
information processing is more related to intelligence than just more activity.

1268
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:14,520
Yeah, it'll be interesting. Again, it's the total hypothesis of how much in the relationship between

1269
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:22,280
intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those two, if there's correlation, they could

1270
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:33,640
be inversely correlated. Wouldn't that be funny? If you, the consciousness factor, the C factor

1271
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:42,600
plus the G factor equals one. It's a nice trade off. You get a trade off, how deeply you experience

1272
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:49,640
the world versus how deeply you're able to reason through the world. What a great hypothesis.

1273
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:53,800
Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.

1274
02:22:53,800 --> 02:23:00,280
Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from an AI

1275
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:09,080
perspective. I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but there's the famous touring

1276
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:17,400
test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation of

1277
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:26,840
intelligence that Alan Turing proposed. Basically conversation being, if you can fool a human to

1278
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:36,360
think that a machine is a human that passes the test, I suppose you could do a similar thing

1279
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:46,680
for humans. If I can fool you that I'm intelligent, then that's a good test of intelligence,

1280
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:59,480
like you're talking to two people, and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.

1281
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,440
It's an interesting test because yeah, maybe charisma can be very useful there,

1282
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:11,080
and you're only allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.

1283
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:19,320
All that to say is, what are good tests of intelligence for machines? What do you think

1284
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:22,520
it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?

1285
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:31,320
I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things, I rapidly reach

1286
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:42,760
the limits of my knowledge and imagination. When Alexa first came out, and I think

1287
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:49,720
there was a competing one, well, there was Siri with Apple, and Google had Alexa.

1288
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:52,280
No, Amazon had Alexa.

1289
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:54,760
Amazon had Alexa. Google has Google.

1290
02:24:55,640 --> 02:25:01,880
Something. I propose to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each,

1291
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:05,880
and then ask it questions from the IQ test.

1292
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:16,360
But it became apparent that they all search the internet, so they all can find answers to

1293
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:23,400
questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me. Now, I don't know if

1294
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:31,000
you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers backwards to me. I don't know what would

1295
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:37,880
happen. I've never done it. One answer to your question is, you're going to try it right now.

1296
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:40,440
Let's try it. Let's try it. No, no, no.

1297
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:47,240
Yes, Siri. It would actually probably go to Google search, and it would be all confusing

1298
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:50,200
kind of stuff. It would fail.

1299
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:53,640
Well, then I guess there's a test that it would fail.

1300
02:25:54,520 --> 02:26:03,560
Well, but that has to do more with the language of communication versus the content.

1301
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:09,400
So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English, and the test was administered in

1302
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:11,560
English, that's not really the test of thought.

1303
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:15,080
Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.

1304
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:20,840
Yeah, so that's because I happen to know how those are programmed.

1305
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:24,600
There's a very hard coded, and there's definitely a lack of intelligence there.

1306
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:35,080
There's something like IQ tests. There's a guy, artificial intelligence researcher,

1307
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:40,760
Francois Chollet. He's a Google. He's one of the seminal people in machine learning.

1308
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:45,480
He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.

1309
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:48,760
Oh, I haven't heard that. I'd just like to know about that.

1310
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:53,160
I'll actually email you this because it'd be very interesting for you.

1311
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:57,000
It doesn't get much attention because people don't know what to do with it,

1312
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:04,280
but it deserves a lot of attention, which is it basically does a pattern type of tests

1313
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:11,160
where you have to do one standard one. You're given three things,

1314
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:16,760
and you have to do a fourth one, that kind of thing. You have to understand the pattern here,

1315
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:21,000
and for that, it really simplifies to...

1316
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:31,640
So the interesting thing is he's trying not to achieve high IQ. He's trying to achieve

1317
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:37,240
pretty low bar for IQ. Things that are kind of trivial for humans,

1318
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:45,000
and they're actually really tough for machines, which is playing with these concepts of

1319
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:53,720
symmetry, of counting. If I give you one object, two objects, three objects, you'll know the last

1320
02:27:53,720 --> 02:28:00,040
one is four objects. You can count them. You can cluster objects together. It's both visually and

1321
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:06,200
conceptually. We could do all these things with our mind that we take for granted, the object-ness

1322
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:14,920
of things. We can figure out what spatially is an object and isn't, and we can play with those

1323
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:22,600
ideas, and machines really struggle with that. So he really cleanly formulated these IQ tests.

1324
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:28,360
I wonder what that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it'd be a very low IQ.

1325
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:35,000
But that's exactly the kind of formulation like, okay, we want to be able to solve this. How do we

1326
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,080
solve this? And he does this as a challenge, and nobody's been able to... It's similar to the Alexa

1327
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:48,680
Prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational challenge. Nobody's been able to do well on his.

1328
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:54,680
But that's an interesting... Those kinds of tests are interesting, because we take for granted all

1329
02:28:55,480 --> 02:29:05,880
the ability of the human mind to play with concepts and to formulate concepts out of novel

1330
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:14,600
things. Things we've never seen before. We were able to use that. I've talked to a few people that

1331
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:21,800
design IQ tests online. They write IQ tests, and I was trying to get some questions from them,

1332
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:25,960
and they spoke to the fact that we can't really share questions with you, because

1333
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:32,360
part of the... First of all, it's really hard work to come up with questions.

1334
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:39,000
It's really, really hard work. It takes a lot of research, but it also takes a lot of novelty

1335
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:47,080
generating. You're constantly coming up with really new things. And part of the point is that

1336
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:53,400
they're not supposed to be public. They're supposed to be new to you when you look at them.

1337
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:57,240
It's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness of the problem,

1338
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:03,000
at least a part of what makes the problem hard, as you've never seen it before.

1339
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:07,960
Right. That's called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what's called crystallized

1340
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:15,720
intelligence, which is your knowledge of facts. You know things, but can you use those things

1341
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:24,920
to solve a problem? Those are two different things. I don't want to miss opportunity to

1342
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:30,280
talk about this. I spoke about the neurobiology, the molecular biology of intelligence. Do you

1343
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:39,640
think one day we'll be able to modify the biology or the genetics of a person to

1344
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:44,920
modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence? We started this conversation

1345
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,080
by talking about a pill you could take. Do you think that such a pill would exist?

1346
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:57,160
Metaphorically, I do. And I am supremely confident that it's possible because I am

1347
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:00,840
supremely ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology.

1348
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:04,920
Ignorance is bliss.

1349
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:08,760
Well, I have written that the nightmares of neurobiologists,

1350
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:17,160
understanding the complexities, this cascade of events that happens at the synaptic level,

1351
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:27,240
that these nightmares are what fuel some people to solve. So some people, you have to be

1352
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:33,640
undaunted. I mean, yeah, this is not easy. Look, we're still trying to figure out cancer.

1353
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:39,160
Yeah. It was only recently that they figured out why aspirin works.

1354
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:48,760
You know, these are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective of the history of science

1355
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:56,360
is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.

1356
02:31:57,400 --> 02:31:58,600
It seemed impossible at the time.

1357
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:00,920
And seemed impossible at the time.

1358
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:06,520
And so one of the things you look at at companies like Neuralink, you have brain,

1359
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:11,800
computer interfaces, you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines,

1360
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:19,880
measuring, but also sending signals to the human mind. You start to wonder what impact that has on

1361
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:25,880
the g-factor. Modifying in small ways or in large ways, the functioning,

1362
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:33,400
the mechanical electrical chemical functioning of the brain.

1363
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:39,640
I look at everything about the brain. There are different levels of explanation.

1364
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:46,840
On one hand, you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry and then you have

1365
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:56,440
neurons. And then you have dendrites. And then you have synapses. And then you have

1366
02:32:57,480 --> 02:33:06,840
the neurotransmitters and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals. And then you have

1367
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:13,960
all the things that influence neurotransmitters. And then you have the individual differences

1368
02:33:13,960 --> 02:33:25,160
among people. Yeah, it's complicated. But 51 million people in the United States have IQs

1369
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:36,600
under 85 and struggle with everyday life. Shouldn't that motivate people to take a look at this?

1370
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:46,360
Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that we have to remember that the science of

1371
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:54,920
intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition. The thing

1372
02:33:54,920 --> 02:34:03,000
that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world is perhaps loosely

1373
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:11,240
correlated, but it's not dependent entirely on intelligence. Absolutely. I certainly agree with

1374
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:22,680
that. So for anyone sort of listening, I'm still not convinced that more intelligence is always

1375
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:28,360
better if you want to create beauty in this world. I don't know. Well, I didn't say more

1376
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:34,280
intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty. I just said all things being equal,

1377
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:40,200
more is better than less. That's all I mean. Yeah, but that's sort of that I just want to

1378
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:47,800
sort of say because to me, one of the things that makes life great is the opportunity to create

1379
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:53,400
beautiful things. And so I just want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what

1380
02:34:54,120 --> 02:35:00,520
some IQ test says. At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people.

1381
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:06,840
And to also inspire us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.

1382
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:13,080
Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college,

1383
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:20,680
whether they're thinking about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of? Is

1384
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:28,760
there advice you can give? Whether they're in the they want to pursue psychology or biology

1385
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:32,760
or engineering or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?

1386
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:43,320
I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is. But I can't say if you're

1387
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:48,840
interested in psychology or if you're interested in science and the science

1388
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:59,080
around the big questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness.

1389
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:05,480
We haven't really talked about brain illnesses and what we might learn from,

1390
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:10,920
you know, if you are trying to develop a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease,

1391
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:19,560
you are trying to develop a drug to impact learning and memory, which are core to intelligence.

1392
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:26,520
So it could well be that the so-called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical company trying

1393
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:31,320
to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease. Because that's exactly what you're trying to do, right?

1394
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:37,160
Yeah. Well, what will that what will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have Alzheimer's

1395
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:45,960
disease? So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology, who are interested in

1396
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:58,440
science to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions. And the most important thing

1397
02:36:58,440 --> 02:37:05,240
I can tell you, if you're going to be in kind of a research environment, is you got to follow

1398
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:10,440
the data where the data take you. You can't decide in advance where you want the data to go.

1399
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:15,160
And if the data take you to places that you don't have the technical expertise to follow,

1400
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:22,120
like, you know, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I'm not going to

1401
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:29,400
become a molecular biologist now, but I know people who are. And my job is to get them interested

1402
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:37,160
to take their expertise into this direction. And that it's not so easy, but and if the data

1403
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:42,440
takes you to a place that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in this world,

1404
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:54,040
no, I would say it's probably a good idea to still push forward boldly, but to communicate

1405
02:37:54,040 --> 02:38:02,040
the interpretation of the results with skill, with compassion, with a greater

1406
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:08,120
breadth of understanding of humanity, not just the science of the impact of the results.

1407
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:16,360
One famous psychologist wrote about this issue that somehow a balance has to be found between

1408
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:21,960
pursuing the science and communicating it with respect to people's sensitivities,

1409
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:29,480
the legitimate sensitivities. Somehow he didn't say how somehow somehow. And this is every part

1410
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:37,880
of that sentence somehow and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader. Let me ask

1411
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:44,520
you, you said big questions, the biggest or one of the biggest. We already talked about

1412
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:48,360
consciousness and intelligence, one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest questions.

1413
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:54,440
But let's talk about the why. Why are we here? What's the meaning of life?

1414
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:56,120
Oh, I'm not going to tell you.

1415
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:02,600
You know, you're not going to tell me. This is very, I'm going to have to wait for your next book.

1416
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:09,160
The meaning of life, you know, we do the best we can to get through the day.

1417
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:16,680
And then there's just a finite number of the days. Are you, are you afraid of the

1418
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:24,760
finiteness of it? You think about it more and more as I get older. Yeah, I do. And it's one of

1419
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:33,800
these human things that it is finite. We all know it. Most of us deny it and don't want to think

1420
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:40,680
about it. Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning. You try to do the rational

1421
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:46,840
thing. Sometimes you, it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited

1422
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:57,160
and you want to get things done. I don't know where I am on that. It is just one of those things

1423
02:39:57,160 --> 02:40:02,120
that's always in the back of my mind. And I don't think that's uncommon.

1424
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:10,040
Well, it's just like g-factor and intelligence. It's a hard truth that's there. And sometimes

1425
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:15,240
you kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at it, but it's still there.

1426
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:23,640
Yeah. Yes, you can escape it. And think about the g-factor and intelligence is everybody

1427
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:33,240
knows this is true on a personal daily basis. Even if you think back to when you were in school,

1428
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:42,280
you know who the smart kids were. When you are on the phone talking to a customer service

1429
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:49,320
representative that in response to your detailed question is reading a script back to you and

1430
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:56,040
you get furious at this. Have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person

1431
02:40:56,040 --> 02:41:01,480
a moron? You're not listening to me. Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people

1432
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:09,160
who they think are not at their level. It's just common because that's the way human beings are.

1433
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:16,920
That's the way life is. But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence. We have a

1434
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:23,720
poor and we're not always a great. Our judgment of human character of other people is not as good

1435
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:34,760
as a battery of tests. That's where bias comes in. That's where our history, our emotions,

1436
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:40,680
all of that comes in. So people on the internet, there's such a thing as the internet and people

1437
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:49,160
on the internet will call each other dumb all the time. That's the worry here is that

1438
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:58,200
we give up on people. We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small

1439
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:03,560
number of interactions as if that's it. They're hopeless. That's just in their genetics. But

1440
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:11,320
I think no matter what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should not

1441
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:18,600
have compassion for our fellow man. That's exactly what the science does say. It's not

1442
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:26,520
opposite of what the science is. Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned

1443
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:34,440
about intelligence, everything points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat

1444
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:42,200
people as individuals respectfully and with compassion. Because through no fault of their own,

1445
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:49,400
some people are not as capable as others and you want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to come up

1446
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:57,320
with theories about why that might be true. Fine. I would like to fix some of it as best I can.

1447
02:42:57,880 --> 02:43:05,080
And everybody is deserving of love. Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.

1448
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:11,000
I'm just getting warmed up here. I know. I know you can go for another

1449
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:16,520
many hours, but to respect your extremely valuable time, this is an amazing conversation.

1450
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:23,240
Thank you for the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the

1451
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:28,280
neuroscience of intelligence, just the work you're doing. It's a difficult topic. It's a

1452
02:43:28,280 --> 02:43:35,000
topic that's controversial and sensitive to people and to push forward boldly. And in that nuanced way,

1453
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,120
just thank you for everything you do. And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence,

1454
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:45,480
of consciousness. Well, thank you for asking me. I mean, there's nothing like good conversation

1455
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:50,840
on these topics. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Hire. To support this

1456
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:55,800
podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some

1457
02:43:55,800 --> 02:44:03,000
words from Albert Einstein. It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.

1458
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:07,960
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
