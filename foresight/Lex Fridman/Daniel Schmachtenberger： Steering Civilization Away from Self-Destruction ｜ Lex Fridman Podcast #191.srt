00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
The following is a conversation with Daniel Schmacktenberger, a founding member of the

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,000
Consilience Project that is aimed at improving public sense-making and dialogue. He is interested

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,160
in understanding how we humans can be the best version of ourselves as individuals and as

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,520
collectives at all scales. Quick mention of our sponsors, Groud News, Netsuite, FourSigmatic,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,480
Magic Spoon, and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,040
As a side note, let me say that I got a chance to talk to Daniel on and off the

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,560
mic for a couple of days. We took a long walk the day before our conversation. I really enjoyed

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,000
meeting him just on a basic human level. We talked about the world around us with words that carried

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,880
hope for us individual ants actually contributing something of value to the colony. These conversations

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,560
are the reasons I love human beings, our insatiable striving to lessen the suffering in the world.

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,600
But more than that, there's a simple magic to two strangers meeting for the first time

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,480
and sharing ideas, becoming fast friends and creating something that is far greater than

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,120
the sum of our parts. I've gotten to experience some of that same magic here in Austin with

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,280
a few new friends and in random bars in my travels across this country, where a conversation leaves

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,280
me with a big stupid smile on my face and a new appreciation of this too short, too beautiful life.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,920
This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Daniel Schmacktenberger.

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,400
If aliens were observing Earth through the entire history just watching us and we're tasked with

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
summarizing what happened until now, what do you think they would say? What do you think they

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,080
would write up in that summary? Like it has to be pretty short, less than a page. Like in The

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,640
Tracker's Guide, there's, I think, like a paragraph or a couple sentences.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,800
How would you summarize, sorry, how would the alien summarize, do you think, all of human

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,360
civilization? My first thoughts take more than a page. They'd probably distill it.

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,480
Because if they watched, well, I mean, first I have no idea if their senses are even attuned to

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
similar stuff to what our senses are attuned to or what the nature of their consciousness is like

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,320
relative to ours. And so let's assume that they're kind of like us, just technologically more advanced

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,000
to get here from wherever they are. That's the first kind of constraint on the thought experiment.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,800
And then if they've watched throughout all of history, they saw the burning of Alexandria. They

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,800
saw that 2000 years ago in Greece, we were producing things like clocks, the anti-Catharea

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,320
mechanism, and then that technology got lost. They saw that there wasn't just a steady dialectic of

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,040
progress. So every once in a while, there's a giant fire that destroys a lot of things.

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,320
There's a giant like commotion that destroys a lot of things. Yeah, and it's usually self-induced.

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,520
They would have seen that. And so as they're looking at us now as we move past the nuclear

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,120
weapons age into the full globalization, Anthropocene, exponential tech age,

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,120
still making our decisions relatively similarly to how we did in the Stone Age as far as rivalry

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
game theory type stuff, I think they would think that this is probably most likely one of the

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,360
planets that is not going to make it to being intergalactic because we blow ourselves up in

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,800
the technological adolescence. And if we are going to, we're going to need some major progress

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,080
rapidly in the social technologies that can guide and bind and direct the physical technologies

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,280
so that we are safe vessels for the amount of power we're getting.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Actually, Hitchhiker's Guide has an estimation about how much of a risk this particular thing

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,280
poses to the rest of the galaxy. And I think, I forget what it was, I think it was medium or low.

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:10,080
So their estimation would be that this species of ant-like creatures is not going to survive long.

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,120
There's ups and downs in terms of technological innovation. The fundamental nature of their

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,480
behavior from a game theory perspective hasn't really changed. They have not learned in any

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:28,480
fundamental way how to control and properly incentivize or properly do the mechanism design

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,920
of games to ensure long-term survival. And then they move on to another planet. Do you

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,320
think there is in a more slightly more serious question, do you think there's

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,120
some number or perhaps a very, very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there?

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,280
Yes, it would be hard to think otherwise. I know, I think Postrum had a new article not

50
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,000
that long ago on why that might not be the case, that the Drake equation might not be the

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,320
kind of in-story on it. But when I look at the total number of Kepler planets just that we're

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,960
aware of just galactically and also like when those life forms were discovered in Mono Lake,

53
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,600
that didn't have the same six primary atoms that I think you had arsenic replacing phosphorus as one

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,720
of the primary aspects of its energy metabolism, we get to think about that the building blocks

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,040
might be more different. So the physical constraints even that the planets have to have might be more

56
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:37,040
different. It seems really unlikely not to mention interesting things that we've observed that are

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,160
still unexplained as you've had guests on your show discussing tic-tac. Oh, the ones that have visited.

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,360
Yeah. Well, let's dive right into that. What do you make sense of the rich human psychology

59
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,440
of there being hundreds of thousands, probably millions of witnesses of UFOs of different kinds

60
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,240
on earth, most of which I presume are conjured up by the human mind through the perception system?

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,880
Some number might be true. Some number might be reflective of actual physical objects, whether

62
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,080
it's, you know, drones or testing military technology that's secret or otherworldly technology.

63
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,200
What do you make sense of all of that? Because it's gaining quite a bit of popularity recently.

64
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:37,040
There is some sense in which that's, that's us humans being hopeful and dreaming of otherworldly

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:45,520
creatures as a way to escape the juroriness of our of the human condition. But in another sense,

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,800
it could be, it really could be something truly exciting that science should turn its eye towards.

67
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,640
So what do you, where do you place it? Speaking of turning eye towards, this is one of those

68
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,880
super fascinating, actually super consequential, possibly topics that I wish I had more time to

69
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
study and just haven't allocated. So I don't have firm beliefs on this because I haven't

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,760
got to study it as much as I want. So what I'm going to say comes from a superficial assessment.

71
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:20,400
While we know there are plenty of things that people thought of as UFO sightings that we can

72
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,440
fully write off, we have other better explanations for them. What we're interested in is the ones

73
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,800
that we don't have better explanations for, and then not just immediately jumping to

74
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,280
a theory of what it is, but holding it as unidentified and being being curious and earnest.

75
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,040
I think the, the tic-tac one is quite interesting and made it in major media recently, but I don't

76
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,320
know if you ever saw the disclosure project. Guy named Stephen Greer organized a bunch of mostly

77
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:58,400
U.S. military and some commercial flight. People who had direct observation and classified information

78
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,240
disclosing it at a CNN briefing. And so you saw high-ranking generals, admirals, fighter pilots,

79
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,840
all describing things that they saw on radar with visual, with their own eyes or cameras,

80
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,880
and also describing some phenomena that had some consistency across different people. And

81
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,120
I find this interesting enough that I think it would be silly to just dismiss it.

82
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,840
And specifically, like we can, we can ask the question, how much of it is natural phenomena,

83
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,080
ball lightning or something like that? And this is why I'm more interested in what fighter pilots

84
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,480
and astronauts and people who are trained in being able to identify flying objects and

85
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,920
atmospheric phenomena have to say about it. I think the thing, then you could say, well,

86
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:01,280
are they more advanced military craft? Is it some kind of human craft? The interesting thing that

87
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,040
a number of them describe is something that's kind of like right angles at speed, or not right

88
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
angles, acute angles at speed, but something that looks like a different relationship to inertia

89
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,600
than physics makes sense for us. I don't think that there are any human technologies that are

90
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,760
doing that, even in really deep underground black projects. Now, one could say, okay, well,

91
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,960
could it be a hologram? Well, would it show up on radar if radar is also seeing it? And so,

92
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't know. I think there's enough, I mean, and for that to be a massive coordinated psi op,

93
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:44,960
is it as interesting and ridiculous in a way as the idea that it's UFOs from some extra planetary

94
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,400
source? So, it's up there on the interesting topics. To me, if it is at all alien technology,

95
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,960
it is the dumbest version of alien technology. It's so far away, it's like the old, old crappy VHS

96
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,880
tapes of alien technology. These are like crappy drones that just floated, or even like space,

97
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,640
to the level of like space junk, because it is so close to our human technology. We talk about

98
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,560
it moves in ways that's unlike what we understand about physics, but it still has very similar

99
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,840
kind of geometric notions and something that we humans can perceive with our eyes, all those

100
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,240
kinds of things. I feel like alien technology, most likely, would be something that we would not

101
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,680
be able to perceive, not because they're hiding, but because it's so far advanced that it would be

102
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,000
much, it would be beyond the cognitive capabilities of us humans. Just as you were saying, as per your

103
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,600
answer for aliens summarizing Earth, it's the starting assumption is they have similar perception

104
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,040
systems, they have similar cognitive capabilities, and that very well may not be the case.

105
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,480
Let me ask you about staying in aliens for just a little longer, because I think it's a good

106
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:18,720
transition talking about governments and human societies. Do you think if a US government or

107
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,480
any government was in possession of an alien spacecraft, or of information related to alien

108
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:38,880
spacecraft, they would have the capacity, structurally would they have the processes, would

109
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:47,200
they be able to communicate that to the public effectively, or would they keep it secret in a

110
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,000
room and do nothing with it, both of to try to preserve military secrets, but also because of

111
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,800
the incompetence that's inherent to bureaucracies, or either?

112
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,320
Well, we can certainly see when certain things become declassified 25 or 50 years later that

113
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,200
there were things that the public might have wanted to know that were kept secret for a very

114
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,560
long time, for reasons of at least supposedly national security, which is also a nice source

115
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:28,080
of plausible deniability for people covering their ass for doing things that would be problematic and

116
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:42,160
other purposes. There are, there's a scientist at Stanford who supposedly got some material that

117
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,800
was recovered from Area 51 type area did analysis on it using, I believe, electron microscopy and

118
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,880
a couple other methods and came to the idea that it was a nanotech alloy that was something we

119
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,560
didn't currently have the ability to do was not naturally occurring. So there, I've heard some

120
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,080
things and again, like I said, I'm not going to stand behind any of these because I haven't

121
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:15,120
done the level of study to have high confidence. I think what you said also about would it be

122
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,520
super low tech alien craft? Like would they necessarily move their atoms around in space?

123
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,360
Or might they do something more interesting than that? Might they be able to

124
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,200
have a different relationship to the concept of space or information or consciousness or

125
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,080
one of the things that the craft supposedly do is not only accelerate and turn in a way that looks

126
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,120
not inertial but also disappear. So there's a question as to like the two are not necessarily

127
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,280
mutually exclusive and it could be possible to, some people run a hypothesis that they

128
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,760
create intentional amounts of exposure as an invitation of a particular kind.

129
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,880
Who knows? Interesting field. We tend to assume like SETI that's listening out for aliens out there.

130
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I've just been recently reading more and more about gravitational waves and you have

131
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,720
orbiting black holes that orbit each other. They generate ripples in space time

132
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,840
on my for fun at night when I lay in bed. I think about what it would be like to ride those waves

133
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,240
when they, not the low magnitude they are as when they reach earth but get closer to the black holes

134
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,880
because they'll basically be shrinking and expanding us in all dimensions, including time.

135
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,840
So it's actually ripples through space time that they generate.

136
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,600
Why is it that you couldn't use that? It travels at the speed of light.

137
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,000
It travels at a speed which is a very weird thing to say when you're

138
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,880
morphing space time. You could argue it's faster than the speed of light.

139
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
So if you're able to communicate by

140
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,760
to summon enough energy to generate black holes and to force them to orbit each other,

141
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:20,240
why not travel as the ripples in space time? Whatever the hell that means somehow combined

142
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,560
with wormholes. So if you're able to communicate through like we don't think of gravitational

143
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,560
waves as something you can communicate with because the the radio will be have to be a very

144
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,960
large size of very dense but perhaps that's it. You know perhaps that's one way to communicate.

145
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:46,800
It's a very effective way and that would explain like we wouldn't even be able to make sense of that

146
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,640
of the physics that results in an alien species that's able to control gravity at that scale.

147
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,400
I think he just jumped up the Kardashev scale so far. You're not just harnessing the power of

148
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:07,040
a star but harnessing the power of mutually rotating black holes. That's way above my

149
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,320
physics pay grade to think about including even non-rotating black hole versions of

150
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:22,320
transwarp travel. I think you know you can talk with Eric more about that. I think he has better

151
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,200
ideas on it than I do. My hope for the future of humanity mostly does not rest in the near term

152
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,200
on our ability to get to other habitable planets in time. And even more than that in the list of

153
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,040
possible solutions of how to improve human civilization orbiting black holes is not in

154
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,960
on the first page for you. Not on the first page. Okay I bet you did not expect us to start this

155
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:55,680
conversation here but I'm glad the places it went. I am excited under my smaller scale of

156
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Mars, Europa, Titan, Venus potentially having very like bacteria like life forms just on a

157
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,840
on a small human level. It's a little bit scary but mostly really exciting that there might be

158
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:22,320
life elsewhere in the volcanoes and the oceans all around us. Teaming, having little societies

159
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,240
and whether there's properties about that kind of life that's somehow different than ours.

160
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,680
I don't know what would be more exciting if those colonies of single cell type organisms

161
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:41,360
what would be more exciting if they're different or they're the same. If they're the same that means

162
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,720
through the rest of the universe there's life forms like us something like us

163
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,320
everywhere. If they're different that's also really exciting because there's

164
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,320
life forms everywhere they're not like us. That's a little bit scary. I don't know what's

165
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,200
scarier actually. It's both scary and exciting no matter what right. The idea that they could

166
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
be very different is philosophically very interesting for us to open our aperture on

167
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,080
what life and consciousness and self-replicating possibilities could look like. The question

168
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,000
on are they different or the same? Obviously there's lots of life here that is the same in

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,200
some ways and different in other ways. When you take the thing that we call an invasive species

170
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,560
is something that's still pretty the same hydrocarbon based thing but co-evolved with

171
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,600
co-selective pressures in a certain environment we move it to another environment it might be

172
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,480
devastating to that whole ecosystem because it's just different enough that it messes up the self

173
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:51,280
stabilizing dynamics of that ecosystem. The question of would they be different in ways

174
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,880
where we could still figure out a way to inhabit a biosphere together or fundamentally not.

175
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,400
Fundamentally the nature of how they operate and the nature of how we operate would be

176
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,240
incommensurable is a deep question. Well we offline talked about memetic theory. It seems

177
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,000
like if there were sufficiently different where we would not even we can coexist on different

178
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,280
planes it seems like a good thing. If we're close enough together to where we'd be competing then

179
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
you're getting into the world of viruses and pathogens and all those kinds of things

180
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,480
to where we would one of us would die off quickly through basically mass murder

181
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,640
without even even accidentally. Even accidentally. If we just had a self replicating single celled

182
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:50,800
kind of creature that happened to not work well for the hydrocarbon life that was here

183
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,440
they got introduced because either output something that was toxic or utilized up the

184
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,120
same resource too quickly and it just replicated faster and mutated faster. It wouldn't be a

185
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,560
memetic theory conflict theory kind of harm it would just be a von Neumann machine a self

186
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,680
replicating machine that was fundamentally incompatible with these kinds of self replicating

187
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,680
systems with faster ootaloops. For one final time putting your alien lies God had on.

188
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:29,200
You look at human civilization do you think about the 7.8 billion people on earth as individual

189
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:39,200
little creatures individual little organisms or do you think of us as one organism with a collective

190
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,400
intelligence? What's the proper framework through which to analyze it again as an alien?

191
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,680
So that I know where you're coming from when you have asked the question the same way

192
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,680
before the industrial revolution before the agricultural revolution when there were half

193
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:01,040
a billion people and no telecommunications connecting them? I would indeed ask the question

194
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:09,360
the same way but I would be less confident about about your conclusions. It would be an

195
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,840
actually more interesting way to ask the question at that time but I was nevertheless asked at the

196
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,680
same way yes. Well let's go back further and smaller than rather than just a single human

197
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:28,400
or the entire human species let's look at a relatively isolated tribe. In the relatively

198
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,440
isolated probably sub Dunbar number sub kind of 150 people tribe do I look at that as one

199
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,600
entity where evolution is selecting for based on group selection or do I think of it as 150

200
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,880
individuals that are interacting in some way? Well could those individuals exist without the group?

201
00:21:49,920 --> 00:22:00,400
No. The evolutionary adaptiveness of humans was involved critically group selection and

202
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,400
individual humans alone trying to figure out stone tools and protection and whatever aren't

203
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:17,120
what was selected for and so I think the or is the wrong frame. I think it's individuals are

204
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,120
affecting the group that they're a part of they're also dependent upon and being affected by the group

205
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,200
that they're part of and so this now starts to get in deep into political theories also which is

206
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,400
theories that orient towards the collective at different scales whether a tribal scale or an

207
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,720
empire or a nation state or something and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and

208
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,640
stuff like that and I think there's very obvious failure modes on both sides and so the relationship

209
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,400
between them is more interesting to me than either of them the relationship between the individual

210
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,200
and the collective and the question around how to have a virtuous process between those so a good

211
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,560
social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism of the group of

212
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,200
individuals is they're both synergistic to each other so what is best for the individuals and

213
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,160
what's best for the whole is aligned but there is nevertheless an individual they're not it's a

214
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:21,600
it's a matter of degrees I suppose but what is what defines a human more the the social network

215
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,600
within a which they've been brought up through which they've developed their intelligence or is

216
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:36,080
it their own sovereign individual self like what's your intuition of how much not just for

217
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,680
evolutionary survival but as intellectual beings how much do we need others for our development

218
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,280
yeah I think we have a weird sense of this today relative to most previous periods of

219
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,320
sapien history I think the vast majority of sapien history is tribal like depending upon your

220
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:06,160
early human model two or three hundred thousand years of homo sapiens in little tribes where

221
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,080
they depended upon that tribe for survival and excommunication from the tribe was was fatal

222
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,280
I think they and our whole evolutionary genetic history is in that environment and the amount

223
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,840
of time we've been out of it is is relatively so tiny and then we still depended upon extended

224
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,720
families and local communities more and the big kind of giant market complex where I can provide

225
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,480
something to the market to get money to be able to get other things from the market where it

226
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,480
seems like I don't need anyone it's almost like disintermediating our sense of need even though

227
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,880
even though you're my ability to talk to each other using these mics and the phones that we

228
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
coordinated on took millions of people over six continents to be able to run the supply chains

229
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,480
that made all the stuff that we depend on but we don't notice that we depend upon them they all

230
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,080
seem fungible um if you take a baby obviously that you didn't even get to a baby without a mom

231
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,640
was it dependent or we depended upon each other right without two two parents at minimum and

232
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,160
they depended upon other people but if we take that baby and we put it out in the wild it obviously

233
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,720
dies so if we let it grow up for a little while the minimum amount of time where it starts to

234
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,160
have some autonomy and then we put it out in the wild and there this has happened a few times

235
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:26,560
it doesn't learn language and it doesn't learn the artic the small motor articulation

236
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,160
that we learn it doesn't learn the type of consciousness that we end up having that is

237
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:39,040
socialized so i think i think we take for granted how much conditioning affects us

238
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:50,560
um it is possible that uh it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole thing the whole thing is

239
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:57,360
the connection between us humans and that we're we're uh no better than apes without our human

240
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,320
connections because that that thinking of it that way forces us to think very differently

241
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,800
about human society and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental i just have

242
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,040
to object to the no better than apes because better here i think you mean a specific thing which

243
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,120
means have capacities that are fundamentally different than i think apes also depend upon

244
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:27,280
troops um yes and i i think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of

245
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,880
ethical sense ends up having heaps of problems we'll table that we can come back to it but

246
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
when we say what is unique about homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals we currently

247
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,480
inhabit the biosphere with and i'm saying it that way because there were other early hominids that

248
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,160
had some of these capacities uh we believe our tool creation and our language creation and our

249
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,720
coordination are all kind of the results of a certain type of capacity for abstraction

250
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,320
and other animals will use tools but they don't evolve the tools they use they keep using the

251
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,640
same types of tools that they basically can find so a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine

252
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,120
that it wants to and it'll even notice that a sharper rock will cut it better and experientially

253
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,640
it'll use the sharper rock and if you even give it a knife it'll probably use the knife because

254
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,400
it's experiencing the effectiveness but it doesn't make stone tools because that requires

255
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,760
understanding why one is sharper than the other what is the abstract principle called sharpness

256
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,360
to then be able to invent a sharper thing that same abstraction makes language and the ability

257
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,800
for abstract representation which makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways

258
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,360
so i do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection

259
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,080
of what we are as a species i wonder if that coordination that connection is actually the

260
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,960
thing that gives birth to consciousness that gives birth to well let's start with self-awareness

261
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,840
more like theory of mind theory of mind yeah you know i i suppose there's experiments that show

262
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,720
that there's other mammals that have a very crude theory of mind i'm not sure maybe dogs

263
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,520
something like that but actually dogs probably has to do with that they co-evolved with humans

264
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,600
see it'd be interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the way we think

265
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,600
about it is the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness i have an

266
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:32,000
inkling sense that that only exists because we're social creatures that that doesn't come

267
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,440
with this with the hardware and the software in the in the beginning that's like that's learned

268
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:47,040
as an effective tool for communication almost like we we think we i think we think that consciousness

269
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:58,000
is fundamental and maybe it's not there's a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that the

270
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,360
illusion of consciousness is consciousness that it is just a facade we use to

271
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,280
to help us construct theories of mind you almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being

272
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:18,560
in that experience you want to reach the experience as an individual person so that i could empathize

273
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:25,040
with your experience i find that notion compelling mostly because it allows you to then create robots

274
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,360
that become conscious not by being quote-unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till

275
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:41,520
they make it is uh creative you know present the facade of consciousness and with it with the task

276
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,000
of uh making that facade very convincing to us humans and thereby it will become conscious

277
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,600
have a sense that in some way that will make them conscious if they're sufficiently convincing to

278
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:08,320
humans is there some element of that that you uh that you find convincing this is a much harder

279
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,360
set of questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the aliens was um we went from

280
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:23,280
aliens to consciousness this is not the trajectory i was expecting nor you but let us walk a while

281
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,920
we can walk a while and i don't think we will do it justice so what do we mean by consciousness

282
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:38,000
versus conscious self-reflective awareness what do we mean by awareness qualia theory of mind

283
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,800
there's a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and um subjectivity

284
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:52,640
first person uh i i don't remember exactly the quote but i remember when reading when sam

285
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,440
harris wrote the book free will and then denet critiqued it and then there was some writing

286
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,080
back and forth between the two because normally they're on the same side of kind of arguing

287
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,000
for critical thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against um supernatural

288
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,440
ideas and here denet believed there is something like free will he is a determinist compatible

289
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,040
list but no consciousness and radical limitivist and sam was saying no there is consciousness

290
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,160
but there's no free will and that's like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they

291
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,880
disagreed on but neither of them could say it was because the other one didn't understand the

292
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,600
philosophy of science um or logical fallacies and and they kind of spoke past each other and at the

293
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,840
end if i remember correctly sam said something that i thought was quite insightful which was to

294
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,960
the effect of it seems to because they weren't making any progress and shared understanding

295
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,440
it seems that we simply have different intuitions about this and what you could see was that

296
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,040
what the words meant right at the level of symbol grounding might be quite different

297
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,440
one of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being

298
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,240
referenced and then also different associations of what the words mean this is why when trying to

299
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,360
address these things charles sanders per said the first philosophy has to be semiotics because

300
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,160
if you don't get semiotics right we end up importing different ideas and bad ideas right into the

301
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,320
nature of the language that we're using and then it's very hard to do epistemology or ontology

302
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,000
together uh so i'm saying this to say why i don't think we're going to get very far is i think

303
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,280
we would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental

304
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,760
concepts um well and also allowing our minds to drift together for a time so there are

305
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,280
definitions of these terms aligned i think there's some there's a beauty that some people

306
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:58,000
enjoy with sam that he is quite stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing

307
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,920
that definition so in his mind he can like he could sense that he can deeply understand what he

308
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,680
means exactly by a term like free will and consciousness and you're right he's very he's

309
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:16,960
very specific in fascinating ways that not only does he think that free will is an illusion

310
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,280
he thinks he's able not thinks he says he's able to just remove himself from the experience of free

311
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:34,560
will and just be like for minutes at a time hours at a time like really experiences if he has no

312
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:44,720
free will like he's a leaf flowing down the river and given that he's very sure that consciousness

313
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,800
is fundamental so here's a this conscious leaf that's subjectively experiencing the floating

314
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,200
and yet there's no ability to control and make any decisions for it for itself it's only a

315
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,120
the decisions have all been made there's some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps

316
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,800
is the problem so that's a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the

317
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
vedantic tradition and some of the buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described

318
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,000
similar experiences and somewhat similar conclusions some slightly different

319
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:27,760
there are other types of phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure agency

320
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,160
and you know like the the catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist ter dishardan describes

321
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,240
this and that rather than a creator agent god in the beginning there's a creative impulse or a

322
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,280
creative process and he was would go into a type of meditation that identified as the pure essence

323
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,680
of that kind of creative process and I think the types of experiences we've had and then

324
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,400
one the types of experiences we've had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol grounding

325
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,520
the other thing is the types of experiences we have can't not be interpreted through our existing

326
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,000
interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are unknown even to us

327
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,720
some of them and so this is a tricky this is a tricky topic so I guess there's a bunch of

328
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,600
directions we could go with it but I want to come back to what the impulse was that was

329
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,960
interesting around what is consciousness and how does it relate to us as social beings and how

330
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,200
does it relate to the possibility of consciousness with it ai's right you're keeping us on track

331
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,560
which is which is wonderful you're a wonderful hiking partner okay yes let's go back to the

332
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,400
initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social impulse connect to consciousness

333
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,400
is consciousness a consequence of that social connection I'm gonna state a position and not

334
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,360
argue it because it's honestly like it's a long hard thing to argue and we can totally do it another

335
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:08,080
time if you want I don't subscribe to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural

336
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:17,040
networks obviously a lot of people do obviously the the philosophy of science orient towards that

337
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:29,440
in not absolutely but largely I think of the nature of first person the universe of first person

338
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:39,520
of of qualia as experience sensation desire emotion phenomenology the but the the felt

339
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,920
sense not the we say emotion and we think of a neurochemical pattern or an endocrine pattern

340
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,800
but all of the physical stuff the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge and

341
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,280
stuff like that that is measurable repeatable I think of the nature of first person and third

342
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,920
person as ontologically orthogonal to each other not reducible to each other there are different

343
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,160
kinds of stuff and so I think about the evolution of third person that we're quite used to thinking

344
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,440
about from subatomic particles to atoms to molecules to on and on I think about a similar

345
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,720
kind of and corresponding evolution in the domain of first person from the way whitehead talked about

346
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,160
kind of prehension or proto qualia in earlier phases of self-organization and to higher orders

347
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,720
of it and that there's correspondence but that neither like the like the idealists do we reduce

348
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,840
third person to first person which is what idealists do or neither like the physical lists or do we

349
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:45,040
reduce first person to third person obviously bone talked about an implicate order that was

350
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,920
deeper than and gave rise to the explicate order of both nagle talks about something like that I

351
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,560
have a slightly different sense of that but again I'll just kind of not argue how that occurs for

352
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,920
a moment and say so rather than say does consciousness emerge from I'll talk about do

353
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:08,720
higher capacities of consciousness emerge in relationship with so it's not first person as

354
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,600
a category emerging from third person but increased complexity within the nature of first person

355
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:20,480
and third person co-evolving do I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural

356
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,520
networks have deeper phenomenology more complex where it goes just from basic sensation to

357
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,800
to emotion to social awareness to abstract cognition to self-reflexive abstract cognition

358
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,960
yeah but I wouldn't say that's the emergence of consciousness I would say it's increased

359
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,600
complexity within the domain of first person corresponding to increased complexity and the

360
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,000
correspondence should not automatically be seen as causal we can get into the arguments for why

361
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,880
that often is the case so what I say that obviously the sapien brain is pretty unique

362
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,600
and a single sapien now has that right even if it took sapiens evolving in tribes based on group

363
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,040
selection to make that brain so the group made it now that brain is there now if I take that a

364
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,360
single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise them in a box they'll still not be

365
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,600
very interesting even with the brain but the brain does give hardware capacities that if conditioned

366
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:25,680
in relationship can have interesting things emerge so do I think that the the human biology

367
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,560
types of human consciousness and types of social interaction all co-emerged and co-evolved yes

368
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,880
as a smaller side as you're talking about the biology let me comment that I spent this is what

369
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,160
I do this is what I do with my life this is why we'll never accomplish anything is I spent much of

370
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,160
the morning trying to calculate trying to do research on how many computations the brain performs

371
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:57,360
and how many how much energy it uses versus the state of the rcpus and gpus now arriving at

372
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:06,000
about 20 quadrillion so that's 2 to the 10 to the 16 computations so synaptic firings per second

373
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,040
that the brain does and that's about a million times faster than the uh

374
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:21,840
the let's say the 20 thread state of the arts intel cpu the the 10th generation and then

375
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:28,640
there's similar calculation for the for the for the gpu and all ended up also trying to compute

376
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,400
that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about and then what does that mean in terms of calories per

377
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,160
day killer calories that's about two for an average human brain that's

378
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:49,040
250 to 300 calories a day and so it ended up being a calculation where you're doing about

379
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,840
20 quadrillion calculations that that are fueled by something like depending on your diet three

380
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,280
bananas so three bananas results in uh in a computation that's about a million times more

381
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,920
powerful than the current state of the art computers now let's take that one step further

382
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,360
there's some assumptions built in there the assumption is that one what the brain is doing

383
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,200
is just computation two the the relevant computations are synaptic firings and that there's

384
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,600
nothing other than synaptic firings that we have to to factor so I'm forgetting his name

385
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,960
right now there's a very uh famous neuroscientist at stanford just passed away recently who did a

386
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,320
lot of the pioneering work on glial cells and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge

387
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,640
amount of the thinking not just neurons and it opened up this entirely different field of like

388
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,880
what the brain is and what consciousness is you look at demasio's work on embodied cognition

389
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,680
and how much of what we would consider consciousness or feeling is happening outside of the nervous

390
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,160
system completely happening in endocrine process involving lots of other cells and

391
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,680
signal communication uh you talk to somebody like penrose who you've had on the show and even

392
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,240
though the penrose hammerhoff conjecture is probably not right is there something like that

393
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,920
that might be the case where we're actually having to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum

394
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,120
computation of microtubules I'm not arguing for any of those I'm arguing that we don't know how big

395
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,720
the unknown unknown set is well at the very least this is this has become like an infomercial for

396
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,480
the human brain at the very but wait there's more at the very least the three bananas buys you a

397
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,280
million times at the very least at the very least and then you could have uh and then the synaptic

398
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,360
firings we're referring to is strictly the electrical signals that could be the mechanical

399
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,440
transmission of information like this chemical transmission of information there's there's all

400
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,720
kinds of other stuff going on and there's memory that's built in that's also all tied in not to

401
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,040
mention which I'm learning more and more about it's not just about the uh the neurons it's also

402
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,960
about the immune system that's somehow helping with the computation so the entirety and the entire

403
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,640
body is helping with the computation so the three bananas they could buy you a lot it could buy you

404
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:21,440
a lot but on the topic of sort of the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness

405
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,800
I think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain

406
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:38,240
just looking at systems or simple rules create incredible complexity uh not create incredible

407
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:45,520
complexity emerges so one of the simplest things to do that with is uh cellular automata

408
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,600
and there's I don't know what it is and maybe you can speak to it we can certainly we will

409
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:02,400
certainly talk about the implications of this but there's so few things that are as awe inspiring to

410
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,640
me as knowing the rules of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks like and it

411
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:16,720
creates incredibly beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on looks like there's actual organisms

412
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:27,680
doing things that are much uh that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying mechanism

413
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,880
so with cellular automata that's cells that are born and die born or die and they only know about

414
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,200
each other's neighbors and there's simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death

415
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:45,440
and then they create at scale organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands of cells

416
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,160
and they're moving they're moving around they're communicating they're sending signals to each other

417
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:59,440
and you forget at moment of time before you remember that the simple rules on cells is all

418
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:09,760
that it took to create that that's it's sad in that we can't come up with a simple description of that

419
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:20,000
system that generalizes the behavior of the large organisms we can only come up with

420
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,240
can only hope to come up with the thing the fundamental physics or the fundamental rules

421
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,040
of that system i suppose it's sad that we can't predict everything we know about the mathematics

422
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,640
of those systems it seems like we can't really in a nice way like economics tries to do to predict

423
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,640
how this whole thing will unroll but it's beautiful because how simple it is underneath it all

424
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:49,920
so what do you make of the emergence of complexity from simple rules what the hell is that about

425
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,560
yeah well we can see that something like flocking behavior the murmuration can can be computer

426
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,680
coded it's not a very hard set of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of

427
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,920
complexity and the whole field of complexity science and some of the sub disciplines like

428
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,480
stigmer g are are studying how following fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant

429
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,640
colonies do this amazing thing where the what what you might describe as the organizational

430
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,600
or computational capacity of the colony is so profound relative to what each individual

431
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,560
ants is doing i am not um anywhere near as well versed in the cutting edge of cellular

432
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,200
automatas i would like unfortunately i in terms of topics that i would like to get to and haven't

433
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:42,640
like uh et's more um all forms a new kind of science i have only skimmed and read reviews of

434
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,680
and not read the whole thing or his newer work since um but his idea of the four basic kind of

435
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,480
categories of uh emergent phenomena that can come from cellular automata and that one of them is

436
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:03,760
kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity rather than just chaos or homogeneity or um

437
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:13,120
self-termination or whatever i think this is very interesting it does not instantly make

438
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,560
me think that uh biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules and or that human

439
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:28,080
consciousness is i'm i'm not that reductionistly oriented and um so if you look at say santa fe

440
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,560
institute one of the co-founders stewart kaufman um his work he should you should really get him on

441
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,240
your show so a lot of the questions that you like one of kaufman's you know more recent books after

442
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,840
investigations and some of the real fundamental stuff was called reinventing the sacred and it

443
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,520
had to do with some of these exact questions uh in kind of non-reductionist approach but that is not

444
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,600
just silly hippie ism um and he was very interested in highly non-argodic systems where

445
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,080
you couldn't take a lot of behavior over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of

446
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:03,840
subsets over a longer period of time would do um and then going further someone who spent

447
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,600
some time at santa fe institute and then kind of made a whole new field that you should have on

448
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:13,360
dave snowden who some people call the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity

449
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,600
unique to humans uh he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really

450
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:26,320
doesn't cut it like we we we don't respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using

451
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,800
stigmer g like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors but it really

452
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,520
doesn't work for trying to make sense of the sistine chapel and picasso and general relativity

453
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:42,400
creation and stuff like that and it's because the the termites are not doing abstraction forecasting

454
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,720
deep into the future and making choices now based on forecasts of the future not just adaptive

455
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,680
signals in the moment and evolutionary code from history that's really different right like making

456
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:59,120
choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future um and with humans our uniqueness

457
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,840
one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli is much higher than it is with a termite

458
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,440
um one of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely low they're basically

459
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,120
fungible within a class right there's different classes but within a class they're basically

460
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:20,000
fungible and their system uses that very high numbers and lots of um loss right lots of death

461
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,880
the termite feels that way don't you think we humans are deceiving ourselves about our uniqueness

462
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,160
perhaps it doesn't just isn't there some sense in which this emergence just creates different

463
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,120
higher and higher levels of abstraction where every at every layer each organism feels unique

464
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,920
is that possible that we're all equally dumb but at different scales no i think uniqueness is evolving

465
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:51,280
hmm i think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells of the same type are and

466
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,080
i think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are and i think that highly

467
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,920
k selected species are more unique than r selected species so they're different evolutionary

468
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,560
processes the r selected species where you have a whole a lot of death and very high birth rates

469
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:16,320
you're not looking for as much individuality within or individual possible expression to cover

470
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,320
the evolutionary search space within an individual you're looking at it more in terms of a numbers

471
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,720
game um so yeah i would say there's probably more difference between one orca and the next

472
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,680
than there is between one cape buffalo and the next given that it would be interesting to get

473
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,400
your thoughts about mimetic theory where we're imitating each other

474
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,880
in the context of this idea of uniqueness how much truth is there to that how compelling is

475
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:56,880
this world view to you of gerardian mimetic theory of desire where maybe you can explain it from

476
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,800
your perspective but it seems like imitating each other is the fundamental property of the

477
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,840
behavior of human civilization well imitation is not unique to humans right monkeys imitate

478
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:18,800
so a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans humans do more of it

479
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,920
it's actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment um monkeys can learn new behaviors new

480
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,000
we've even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching other apes sign language

481
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,600
so that's a kind of mimesis right kind of learning through imitation and that needs to happen if they

482
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,040
need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded by their genetics right so within the

483
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,800
same genome they're learning new things based on the environment and so based on someone else learn

484
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,000
something first and so let's pick it up uh how much a creature is the result of just its genetic

485
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,120
programming and how much it's learning is a very interesting question and i think this is a place

486
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:08,800
where humans really show up radically different than everything else and you can see it in the

487
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:16,960
in the neoteny how long we're basically fetal um that a the closest ancestors to us if we look at a

488
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,520
chimp a chimp can hold on to its mother's fur while she moves around day one and obviously we see

489
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,440
horses up and walking within 20 minutes the fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it

490
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,200
takes a horse 20 minutes and you say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year like that's

491
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,040
a long period of helplessness that it wouldn't work for a horse right like they or anything else

492
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:46,320
and and not only could we not hold on to mom in the first day it's three months before we can move

493
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:53,360
our head volitionally um so it's like why why are we embryonic for so long basically it's like

494
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,680
like it's still fetal on the outside had to be because couldn't keep growing inside and actually

495
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:06,480
ever get out with big heads and narrower hips from going upright um so here's a place where

496
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,960
there's a coevolution of the pattern of humans specifically here are our neoteny and what that

497
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:20,880
portends to learning with our being toolmaking and environment modifying creatures which is because

498
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,760
we have the abstraction to make tools we change our environments more than other creatures change

499
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:31,920
their environments the next most environment modifying creature tusks is like a beaver and then

500
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,600
you wear an la you fly into lax and you look at the just orthogonal grid going on forever in all

501
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,640
directions and you know we we've recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the

502
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,040
earth is changing more from human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you're

503
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,160
like okay wow we're really in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying yeah um so as

504
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:02,080
soon as we started toolmaking we were able to change our environments much more radically we

505
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,640
could put on clothes and go to a cold place right and this is really important because

506
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,000
we actually went and became apex predators in every environment we functioned like apex predators

507
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,440
but polar bear can't leave the Arctic right and the the lion can't leave the savannah and an orca

508
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,720
can't leave the ocean and we went became apex predators in all those environments because of

509
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,640
our tool creation capacity we could become better predators than them adapted to the environment or

510
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,760
at least with our tools adapted to the environment so then every aspect towards any organism in any

511
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,960
environment were incredibly good at becoming apex predators yes and nothing else can do that kind

512
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,880
of thing there there is no other apex predator that you see the other apex predator is only getting

513
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,880
better at being a predator through evolutionary process that's super slow and that super slow

514
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,360
process creates co-selective process with their environment so as the predator becomes a tiny

515
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,080
bit faster it eats more of the slow prey the genes of the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes

516
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,920
faster and so there's this kind of balancing and we in because of our tool making we increased our

517
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,040
predatory capacity faster than anything else could increase its resilience to it as a result we

518
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,400
started out stripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools and going and

519
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,680
becoming apex predator everywhere this is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because

520
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,480
we're not an apex predator we're an apex predator but we're something much more than that um like

521
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:28,720
just for an example the the top apex predator in the world in orca an orca can eat one big fish at

522
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,200
a time like one tuna and it'll miss most of the time or one seal and we can put a mile long drift

523
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:41,360
net out on a single boat and pull up an entire school of them right we can deplete the entire

524
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:46,240
oceans of them that's not an orca right like that's not an apex predator um and that's not even

525
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,360
including that we can then genetically engineer different creatures we can extinct species we can

526
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,280
devastate whole ecosystems we can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just

527
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,840
human built worlds we can build new types of natural creatures synthetic life so we are much

528
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,760
more like little gods than we are like apex predators now but we're still behaving as apex

529
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,320
predators and little gods that behave as apex predators causes a problem kind of core to my

530
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:15,760
assessment of the world so what does it mean to be a predator so a predator is uh somebody that

531
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:24,320
effectively can mine the resources from a place so for their survival or is it also just purely

532
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:31,760
like higher level objectives of violence and what is can predators be predators towards

533
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,640
the same each other towards the same species like are we think are we using the word predator

534
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,040
sort of generally which then connects to conflict and uh military conflict violent conflict

535
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,480
in the space of uh human species obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of

536
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,720
their environment in a particular way using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals

537
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,640
out of the soil and nitrogen and carbon out of the air and like that um and we can say herbivores

538
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,280
are being able to mine and concentrate that so I wouldn't say mining the environment is unique

539
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,400
to predator predator is you know uh

540
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:19,600
generally being defined as mining other animals right we don't consider herbivores predators

541
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:26,880
but um animal which requires some type of violence capacity because animals move plants don't move

542
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,160
so requires some capacity to overtake something that can move and try to get away

543
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,680
we'll go back to the juridzing then we'll come back here why are we neoteness why are we embryonic

544
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:47,040
for so long because are we did we just move from the savannah to the arctic and we need to learn

545
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,560
new stuff if we came genetically programmed we would not be able to do that are we throwing

546
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,360
spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain or are we texting what

547
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,640
is the adaptive behavior horses today in the wild and horses 10 000 years ago are doing pretty

548
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,880
much the same stuff and so since we make tools and we evolve our tools and then change our

549
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,040
environment so quickly and other animals are largely the result of their environment but

550
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,320
we're environment modifying so rapidly we need to come without too much programming so we can

551
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:25,120
learn the environment we're in learn the language right which is uh gonna be very important learn

552
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:31,280
the tool making learn the um and so we have a very long period of relative helpless of helplessness

553
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,840
because we aren't coded how to behave yet because we're imprinting a lot of software on how to

554
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,440
behave that is useful to that particular time so our mimesis is not it's not unique to humans but

555
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,960
the total amount of it is really unique and this is also where the uniqueness can go up right is

556
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,760
because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning

557
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,440
through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of it's almost like our hardware

558
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,960
selected for software right like if evolution is kind of doing these think of as a hardware

559
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,200
selection i have problems with computer metaphors for biology but i'll use this one here um that

560
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,880
we have not had hardware changes since the beginning of sapiens but our world is really

561
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,680
really different and that's all changes in software right changes in on the same fundamental genetic

562
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,520
substrate what we're doing with these brains and minds and bodies and social groups and like that

563
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:40,640
and so um now giord specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking so we

564
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,240
learn language you and i would have a hard time learning mandarin today or it'd take a lot of

565
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,920
work we'd be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff but a baby learns it instantly without

566
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,520
anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis so it's a it's a powerful thing

567
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,360
they're obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they're doing that and all their

568
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,520
attention is allocated to that but they're also learning how to move their bodies and

569
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,760
they're learning all kinds of stuff through mimesis one of the things that giord says is

570
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,800
they're also learning what to want and they learn what to want they learn desire by watching

571
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,840
what other people want and so intrinsic to this people end up wanting what other people want

572
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:20,160
and if we can't have what other people have without taking it away from them then that

573
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,000
becomes a source of conflict so the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict

574
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,920
and then the conflict energy within a group of people will build over time this is a very very

575
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,120
crude interpretation of the theory can we just pause on that for people who are not familiar

576
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:44,320
and for me who hasn't i'm loosely familiar but haven't internalized it but every time i think

577
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:49,040
about it's a very compelling view of the world whether it's true or not it's quite

578
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,680
it's like when you take everything Freud says as truth it's a very interesting way to think about

579
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:05,120
the world and in the same way thinking about the memetic theory of desire that everything we want

580
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:14,400
is imitation of other people's wants we don't have any original wants we're constantly imitating

581
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:22,080
others and so and not just others but you know others we're exposed to so there's these like

582
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:28,560
little local pockets however defined local of people like imitating each other and one that's

583
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:34,240
super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join like what what do you want to

584
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:40,560
imitate it's it's uh it's the old like you know whoever your friends are that's what your life

585
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,560
is gonna be like that's really powerful i mean it's depressing that we're so unoriginal but it's

586
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:53,680
also liberating in that if this holds true that we can choose our life by choosing the people we

587
01:01:53,680 --> 01:02:00,000
hang out with so okay thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they're more absolute

588
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,720
than they actually are end up also being dangerous we want communism i'm i'm gonna discuss here where

589
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,000
i think we need to amend this particular theory but specifically you just said something that

590
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,800
everyone who's paid attention knows is true experientially which is who you're around

591
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:24,160
affects who you become and as as libertarian and self-determining and sovereign as we'd like to be

592
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,040
everybody i think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison aspects of your

593
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,360
personality would have to adapt or you wouldn't survive there right you would become different if

594
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,080
you were if if you grew up in dar four versus finland you would be different with your same

595
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:46,400
genetics like just just no real question about that um and that even today if you hang out in a

596
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:53,520
place with ultramarathoners as your roommates or um all people who are obese as your roommates

597
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,280
the statistical likelihood of what happens to your fitness is pretty clear right like the

598
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,560
behavioral science of this is pretty clear so uh the whole saying we are the average of the five

599
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,800
people we spend the most time around i think the more self-reflective someone is and the more time

600
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,280
they spend by themselves in self-reflection the less this is true but it's still true so one of the

601
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,960
best things someone can do to become more self-determined is be self-determined about the

602
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,200
environments they want to put themselves in because to the degree that there is some self-determination

603
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,600
and some determination by the environment don't be fighting an environment that is predisposing

604
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,440
you in bad directions try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things

605
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,240
that you want in turn try to affect the environment in ways to predispose positive things for those

606
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,520
around you or perhaps also to there's probably interesting ways to play with this you could

607
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:47,040
probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension in all directions to

608
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,760
where you're actually free to decide whatever the heck you want because the set of wants

609
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,320
within your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you're free to choose whichever

610
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,880
one so if there's enough tension as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds

611
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,160
yeah i mean you definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced

612
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:17,280
so if you have someone who is extremely oriented to self-empowerment and someone who is extremely

613
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,600
oriented to kind of empathy and compassion both the dialectic of those is better than either of

614
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:27,760
them on their own if you have both of them inhabiting being inhabited better than you by

615
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,200
the same person spending time around that person will probably do well for you i think the thing

616
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,280
you just mentioned is super important when it comes to cognitive schools which is

617
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:45,200
i think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their learning and they're not just

618
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:52,480
cognitive learning but their meaningful problem solving communication and civic capacity capacity

619
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,360
to participate as a citizen with other people and making the world better is to be seeking

620
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:03,120
dialectical synthesis all the time and so in the hegelian sense if you have a thesis

621
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,280
you have an antithesis so maybe we have libertarianism on one side and marxist kind

622
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:16,960
of communism on the other side and one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice and so

623
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,480
we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they make more

624
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,160
agentic choices it'll produce a better hole for everybody the other side saying well the

625
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,680
individuals are conditioned by their environment who would choose to be born into darfur rather

626
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:38,080
than finland so we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because that the

627
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:43,360
environment conditions the individuals so you have a thesis and an antithesis and then hegel's

628
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,440
ideas you have a synthesis which is a kind of higher order truth that understands how those

629
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,560
relate in a way that neither of them do and so it is actually at a higher order of complexity

630
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,960
so the first part would be can i steal man each of these can i argue each one well enough

631
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,680
that the proponents of it are like totally you got that and not just argue it rhetorically but

632
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,800
can i inhabit it where i can try to see and feel the world the way someone seeing and feeling the

633
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:11,680
world that way would because once i do then i don't want to screw those people because there's

634
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,000
truth in it right and i'm not going to go back to war with them i'm going to go to finding solutions

635
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,160
it could actually work at a higher order if i don't go to a higher order then there's war

636
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:26,080
and but then the higher order thing would be well it seems like the individual does affect

637
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,280
the commons and the collective and other people it also seems like the collective conditions

638
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,680
individuals at least statistically and i can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto

639
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,720
and pulled himself up by his bootstraps but i can also say statistically that most people born

640
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,960
into the ghetto show up differently than most people born into the hamptons and so unless you

641
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,480
want to argue that and have you take your child from the hamptons and put them in the ghetto then

642
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,560
like come on be realistic about this thing so how do we make we don't want social systems that make

643
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:03,840
weak dependent individuals right the welfare argument but we also don't want no social system

644
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:10,720
that supports individuals to do better we want we don't want individuals where their self-expression

645
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,920
and agency fucks the environment and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever so can

646
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,760
we make it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning other

647
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,800
individuals can we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty

648
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:32,240
right that would be the synthesis so the thing that i'm coming to here is if people have that as

649
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,560
a frame and sometimes it's not just thesis nante thesis it's like eight different views right

650
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,480
can i steal man each view this is not just can i take the perspective but am i seeking them am i

651
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:49,120
actively trying to inhabit other people's perspective then can i really try to essentialize

652
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,920
it and argue the the best points of it both the sense making about reality and the values

653
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,160
why these values actually matter then just like i want to seek those perspectives then i want to

654
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:07,840
seek is there a higher order set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize

655
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,840
the sense making of all of them simultaneously maybe i won't get it but i want to be seeking it

656
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,880
and i want to be seeking progressively better ones so this is perspective seeking driving

657
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:28,080
perspective taking and then seeking synthesis i think that that one cognitive disposition might

658
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:35,040
be the most helpful thing would you put a title dialectic synthesis on that process because that

659
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:42,720
seems to be such a part so like this rigorous empathy like like it's not just empathy it's

660
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:48,320
empathy with rigor like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews and

661
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:54,720
then try to find a higher order synthesis okay so i remember last night you told me when we first

662
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:00,720
met uh you said that you looked in somebody's eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some

663
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,680
ways that they had suffered and so you could trust them shared pathos right creates a certain sense

664
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,800
of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy so empathy is actually feeling the suffering of

665
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,840
somebody else and feeling the the depth of their sentience so i don't want to fuck them anymore

666
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,000
and i mean i hurt them i don't want to behave in a i don't want my proposition to go through

667
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,000
when i go and inhabit the perspective of the other people they feel that's really going to

668
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,600
mess them up right and so the rigorous empathy it's different than just compassion which is i

669
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,480
generally care like i have a generalized care but i don't know what it's like to be them i can

670
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,800
never know what it's like to be them perfectly and that there's a humility you have to have which is

671
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:45,280
my most rigorous attempt is still not it my most rigorous attempt mine to know what it's like to

672
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,960
be a woman is still not it i have no question that if i was actually a woman it would be different

673
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,600
than my best guesses i have no question if i was actually black it's be different than my best guesses

674
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,560
so there's a humility in that which keeps me listening because i don't think that i know fully

675
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,600
but i want to and i'm going to keep trying better to and then i want to across them and

676
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,240
then i want to say is there a way we can forward together and not have to be in more it has to

677
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,960
be something that could meet the values that everyone holds it could reconcile the partial

678
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:19,040
sense making that everyone holds and they could offer a way forward that is more agreeable than

679
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:24,000
the partial perspectives at war with each other but the so the more you succeeded this empathy

680
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,160
with humility the more you're carrying the burden of their of other people's pain essentially

681
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,840
now this goes back to the question of do i see us as one being or 7.8 billion

682
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,600
i think them

683
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:47,920
if i'm overwhelmed with my own pain i can't empathize that much because i don't have the bandwidth i

684
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,320
don't have the capacity if i don't feel like i can do something about a particular problem

685
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:57,200
in the world it's hard to feel it because it's just too devastating and so a lot of people go numb

686
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:02,880
and even go nihilistic because they just don't feel the agency so as i actually become more empowered

687
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,840
as an individual and have more sense of agency i also become more empowered to be more empathetic

688
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,880
for others and be more connected to that shared burden and want to be able to make choices on

689
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:22,320
behalf of and in and in benefit of so this way of living seems like a way of living that would

690
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:29,360
solve a lot of problems in society from a cellular automata perspective so if you have a bunch of

691
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,960
little like little agents behaving in this way my intuition there'll be interesting complexities

692
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,880
that emerge but my intuition is it will create a society that's very different and recognizably

693
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:48,640
better than the one we have today how much um like oh wait hold that question because i want

694
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,480
to come back to it but this brings us back to jarred which we didn't answer the conflict theory

695
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,480
yes because about how to get past the conflict theory yes you know the robert for us poem about

696
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,560
the two paths he never had enough time to return back to the other we're gonna have to do that

697
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:08,400
quite a lot we're gonna be uh living that poem over and over again but yes how how to uh let's

698
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,520
return back okay so the rest of the argument goes you learn to want what other people want

699
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,160
therefore fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has

700
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,240
and then people are can they're in conflict over trying to get the same stuff power status

701
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:30,400
attention physical stuff a mate whatever it is and then the we learn the conflict by watching

702
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,080
and so then the conflict becomes a medic so the and you know we become on the palestinian side of

703
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,840
the israeli side of the communist the capitalist side or the left or right politically or whatever

704
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:46,800
it is and until eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type of

705
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,600
violence is needed to get the bad guy whoever it is that we're going to blame and you know jarred

706
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,240
talks about why scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount of violence let's blame

707
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,720
let's blame it a a scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were but if we all

708
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,280
believe it then we can all kind of calm down with the conflict energy it's a really interesting

709
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,240
concept by the way i mean you went you beautifully summarized it but the idea that there's a scapegoat

710
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,680
that there's a this kind of thing naturally still conflict and then they find the other some group

711
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:21,440
that's the other that's either real artificial as the cause of the conflict well it's always

712
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,080
artificial because the cause of the conflict in jarred is the mimesis of desire itself and how

713
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:31,600
do we attack that how do we attack that it's our own desire so this now gets to something more like

714
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,600
buddha said right which was desire is the cause of suffering um jarred and buddha would kind of

715
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:45,280
agree in this way so and so but that's that explains i mean again it's a compelling description

716
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:52,960
of human history that we do tend to come up with the other and uh okay kind of i just i just had

717
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,640
such a funny experience with someone critiquing jarred the other day in such a elegant and

718
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:09,120
beautiful and simple way it's a a friend who's uh grew up aboriginal australian uh as a scholar of

719
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:16,560
aboriginal social technologies and he's like nah man jarred just made shit up about how tribes

720
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,520
worked like we come from a tribe we've got tens of thousands of years and we didn't have increasing

721
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,440
conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone we'd have a little bit of conflict and then we would

722
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,600
dance and then everybody'd be fine like we'd dance around the campfire everyone would like

723
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,440
kind of physically get the energy out we'd look in each other's eyes we'd have positive bonding

724
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:39,600
and then we're fine and nobody nobody no scapegoats and i think that's called the joe rogan theory of

725
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,640
desire which is uh he's like all all of human problems have to do with the fact that you don't

726
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,320
do enough hard shit in your day uh so maybe maybe just dance it because he says like doing

727
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,320
exercise and running on that treadmill gets gets all the demons out maybe just dance and gets all

728
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,440
the demons out so this is why i say we have to be careful with taking an idea that seems too

729
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,640
explanatory and then taking it as a given and then saying well now that we're stuck with the fact that

730
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,000
conflict is inexorable because human because mimetic desire and therefore how do we deal with

731
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence well no the whole thing might

732
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,800
be actually gibberish meaning it's only true in certain conditions and other conditions it's not

733
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,120
true so the deeper question is under which conditions is that true under which conditions is

734
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,960
it not true what do those other conditions make possible and look like and in general we should

735
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:33,440
stay away from really compelling models of reality because there's something about about our brains

736
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,320
that these models become sticky and we can't even think outside of them so it's not that we stay away

737
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:43,040
from them it's that we know that the model of reality is never reality that's the key thing

738
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,680
humility again it goes back to just having the humility that you don't have a perfect model of

739
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:53,840
reality there's an the model of reality could never be reality the process of modeling is inherently

740
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:01,520
information reduction and i can never show that the unknown unknown set has been factored

741
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:10,480
it's back to the cellular automata you can't you can't put the genie back in the bottle like

742
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,200
when you realize it's unfortunately sadly impossible to

743
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,000
to create a model of cellular automata even if you know the basic rules

744
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:31,440
that predict to even any degree of accuracy what how that system will evolve which is fascinating

745
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,440
mathematically sorry i i think about it quite a lot it's very annoying wolfram has this rule 30

746
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:45,600
like you should be able to predict it it's so simple but you can't predict what's going to be

747
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:51,280
like there's a there's a problem he defines like try to predict some aspect of the middle

748
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,000
middle column of the system just anything about it what's going to happen in the future and you

749
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:05,040
can't you can't it sucks because then we can't make sense of this world you know really in a

750
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:11,840
reality in a definitive way it's always like in the striving like it we're always striving

751
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:17,120
yeah i don't think this sucks that so that's a feature not a bug

752
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:23,680
well that's assuming a designer um i would say i don't think it sucks i think it's

753
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:32,160
not only beautiful but maybe necessary for beauty the mess so you're uh so you're

754
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:36,480
you're just a great jordan pierce and you should clean up your room so you like the rooms messy

755
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:44,480
it's uh it's essential for the for beauty it's not it's not that it's okay i take i have no idea

756
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:49,440
if it was intended this way and so i'm just interpreting it a way i like the commandment

757
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:57,760
about having no false idols to me the way i interpret that is meaningful is that reality

758
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,960
sacred to me i have a reverence for reality but i know my best understanding of it is never complete

759
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:11,920
i know my best model of it is a model where i tried to make some kind of predictive capacity

760
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,560
by reducing the complexity of it to a set of stuff that i could observe and then a subset

761
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,640
of that stuff that i thought was the causal dynamics and then some set of you know mechanisms

762
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,160
that are involved and what we find is that it can be super useful like newtonian gravity can

763
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:31,120
help us do ballistic curves and all kinds of super useful stuff and then we get to the place where it

764
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:38,160
doesn't explain what's happening at the cosmological scale or at a quantum scale and at each time what

765
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:45,040
we're finding is uh we exclude itself and it also doesn't explain the reconciliation of gravity

766
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,920
with quantum mechanics and the other kind of fundamental laws and the so models can be useful

767
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,800
but they're never true with a capital t meaning they're never an actual real full they're never

768
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,720
a complete description of what's happening in real systems they can be a complete description

769
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:05,040
of what's happening in an artificial system that was the result of applying a model so the model

770
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,560
of a circuit board and the circuit board are the same thing but i would argue that the model of a

771
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:15,120
cell and the cell are not the same thing and i would say this is key to what we call complexity

772
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:22,320
versus the complicated which is a distinction davis noden made well in defining the difference

773
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:28,320
between simple complicated complex and chaotic systems but one of the definers in complex systems

774
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,240
is that no matter how you model the complex system it will still have some emergent behavior

775
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:37,840
not predicted by the model can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated complicated

776
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,640
means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can do we can program it

777
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,840
all human not all for the most part human built things are complicated they don't self organize

778
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,520
they don't self repair they're not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them

779
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:01,680
where sorry for human systems for human technologies human technologies sorry it's okay so so

780
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:08,640
non that are basically the application of models right right and engineering is kind of applied

781
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:16,880
science science as the modeling process and but with but humans are complex complex stuff with

782
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:22,320
biological type stuff um and sociological type stuff it more has generator functions

783
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:28,800
and even those can't be fully explicated then it has or our explication can't prove that it

784
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,800
has closure of what would be in the unknown unknown set where we keep finding like oh it's

785
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,560
just the genome oh well now it's the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the

786
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,040
epigenome because of the proteome and then there's mitochondrial dna and then virus is affected and

787
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:47,440
fuck right so it's like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing so on facebook you

788
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,440
know how you can list your relationship is complicated it should actually say it's it's

789
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:57,440
complex that's the more accurate description you uh self terminating is a really interesting idea

790
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:06,080
that you talk about quite a bit first of all what is a self terminating system and i think you have

791
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:12,640
a sense correct me if i'm wrong that human civilization as it currently is is a self terminating

792
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:20,400
system why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what's of self terminating

793
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:32,880
means okay so if we look at human societies historically human civilizations uh it's not

794
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,880
that hard to realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don't

795
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:42,000
exist anymore so they had a life cycle they died for some reason so we don't still have any

796
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,440
the early egyptian empire or inka or maya or aztec or any of those right and so

797
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,960
they they terminated sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside in war

798
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,920
sometimes it seems like they self terminate when we look at easter island it was a self

799
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:01,600
termination um so let's go ahead and take an island situation if i have an island

800
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,760
and we are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources can replicate

801
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,000
themselves and there's a finite space there that system is going to self terminate it's not

802
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,480
gonna be able to keep doing that thing because you'll get to a place of there's no resources left

803
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:20,800
and then you get uh so now if i'm utilizing the resources faster than they can replicate

804
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,600
or faster than they can replenish and i'm actually growing our population in the process

805
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:31,680
so i'm even increasing the rate of the utilization of resources i might get an exponential curve and

806
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:36,240
then hit a wall and then just collapse the exponential curve rather than do an s curve

807
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:44,560
or some other kind of thing um so self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate

808
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:50,160
system that is debasing its own substrate that is debasing what it depends upon

809
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,960
so you're right that uh if you look at empires they rise and fall throughout human history

810
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:03,520
but but not this time bro where this one's gonna last forever that's

811
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,360
i like that idea i think that if we don't understand why all the previous ones failed we

812
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,760
can't ensure that and so i think it's very important to understand it well so that we can

813
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:20,800
have that be a designed outcome with some what decent probability so we're it's sort of in terms

814
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,920
of consuming the resources on the island we're a clever bunch and we keep coming up

815
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:35,040
especially when the on the horizon there is a termination point we keep coming up with clever

816
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:41,600
ways of avoiding disaster of avoiding collapse of constructing this is where technological

817
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,640
innovation this is where growth comes in coming up with different ways to improve productivity and

818
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:51,760
the way society functions such that we consume less resources or get a lot more from the resources we

819
01:23:51,760 --> 01:24:01,680
have so there's some sense in which there's a human ingenuity is a source for optimism

820
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:08,000
about the future of this particular system that uh that may not be self terminating if if there's

821
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:16,480
more innovation than there is consumption so um over consumption of resources just one way I think

822
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:25,040
can self-terminate we're just kind of starting here but um there are reasons for optimism and

823
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:29,200
pessimism then they're both worth understanding and there's failure modes on understanding either

824
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:37,040
without the other um as we mentioned previously there there's what I would call naive techno

825
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,960
optimism naive techno capital optimism that says uh stuff just has been getting better and better

826
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,320
and we wouldn't want to live in the dark ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and

827
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:52,160
we know the proponents of those models and that stuff is going to kind of keep getting better

828
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,760
of course there are problems but human ingenuity rises to its apply and demand will solve the

829
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,520
problems whatever would you put rick or as well on that or in that bucket is there some

830
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,680
specific people you have in mind or naive optimism is truly naive to where you're

831
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:12,480
essentially just have an optimism that's blind to any kind of realities of the way technology

832
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:22,400
progresses I don't think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about it is perfectly naive

833
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:28,080
gotcha but there might play time it's a platonic ideal there there might be a bias in the nature

834
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:34,560
of the assessment I would also say there's kind of naive techno pessimism and there are

835
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:45,280
um critics of technology I mean you read the unabomber's manifesto on why technology can't

836
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:49,680
not result in our self termination so we have to take it out before it gets any further um

837
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:57,440
but also if you read a lot of the ex-risk community you know boss drum and friends uh it's like our

838
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:02,240
total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up

839
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:12,000
and so I think that there are we have to hold together where our positive possibilities and

840
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,280
our risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities to be

841
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:23,840
realized long term all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen any of the catastrophic risks

842
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:29,280
happening is enough to keep that positive outcome from occurring so how do we ensure that none of

843
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:34,000
them happen if we want to say let's have a civilization that doesn't collapse so again

844
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,120
collapse theory it's worth looking at books like um the collapse of complex societies by

845
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:48,480
joseph tainter it does an analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional

846
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:54,800
decay civilizational decay reasons um baudrillard in simulation in simulacra looks at a very different

847
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,880
way of looking at how institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and

848
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,840
it becomes kind of more internally parasitic on itself um obviously jarrod diamond made a more

849
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:09,600
popular book called collapse um and as we were mentioning the anti-catharia mechanism has been

850
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,520
getting attention in the news lately but it's like a 2000 year old clock right like like metal gears

851
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:24,480
and does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress um and from a society that

852
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:32,720
was relatively technologically advanced um so what i'm interested in here is being able to say okay

853
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:41,120
well why did previous societies fail can we understand that abstractly enough that we can

854
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:47,680
make a civilizational model that isn't just trying to solve one type of failure but solve the

855
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:53,360
underlying things that generate the failures as a whole are there some underlying generator functions

856
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:58,720
or patterns that would make a system self-terminating and can we solve those and have that be the

857
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,720
kernel of a new civilizational model that is not self-terminating and can we then be able to actually

858
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:09,280
look at the categories of extras we're aware of and see that we actually have resilience in the

859
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:15,440
presence of those not just resilience but anti fragility and i would say for the optimism to

860
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:21,280
be grounded it has to actually be able to understand the risk space well and have adequate solutions

861
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:31,840
for it so can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying sources of catastrophic

862
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:37,680
failures of the system and overconsumption that's built in into self-terminating systems so both

863
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:43,840
the overconsumption which is like the slow death and then then there's the fast death of nuclear

864
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,840
war and all those kinds of things a agi biotech bioengineering nanotechnology nano my favorite

865
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:59,680
nano bots okay nano bots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me that i could just know

866
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:04,400
that i would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead in building them without

867
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,160
sufficiently thinking about the negative consequence i would definitely be i would be

868
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:17,440
podcasting all about the negative consequences but when i go back home i'd be i just in my heart

869
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:25,840
know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant of ape no offense to apes uh so i want to backtrack

870
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:36,640
on my previous comments about uh negative comments about apes uh that i have that sense of excitement

871
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:42,000
that would result in problems so sorry a lot of things said but what's can we start to pull

872
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:49,600
it a thread because you've also provided kind of a beautiful general approach to this which is this

873
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:56,320
dialectic synthesis or just rigorous empathy whatever whatever word we want to put to it

874
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,680
that seems to be from the individual perspective is one way to sort of live in the world as we

875
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:07,920
try to figure out how to construct non-self-terminating systems so what what are some underlying sources

876
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:16,720
yeah first i have to say uh i i actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing gray goo and

877
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:23,760
engines of creation back in the day um to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to

878
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,280
the risks of the the nanotech um as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be

879
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,280
there's definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and

880
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:46,720
don't focus on the risks or pretend there aren't risks um because they get to market first um and

881
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,920
then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is to the commons

882
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,120
or wherever happen to have it other people are going to have to solve those but now they have

883
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,880
the power and capital associated the person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design

884
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:04,320
and go slower um is probably not going to move into positions of as much power influence as quickly

885
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,720
so this one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the the bad game theoretic dispositions

886
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:15,120
in the system relative to its own um stability and the key aspect to that sorry to interrupt is

887
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:21,520
the externalities generated yes what flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here

888
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,560
what's your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream so mine is coconut nobody seems to like

889
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:35,360
coconut ice cream uh so ice cream aside what's uh what do you most worry about there's a catastrophic

890
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:43,040
risk that will help us kind of um make concrete the the the discussion we're having about how

891
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,640
to fix this whole thing yeah i think it's worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just

892
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:54,000
kind of orient everyone to it we don't have to um go all the way back to the aliens who've seen all

893
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,480
of civilization but to just recognize that um for all of human history as far as we're aware

894
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:08,480
there were existential risks to civilizations and they happened right like there were civilizations

895
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,840
that were killed in war um that tribes that were killed in tribal warfare whatever so

896
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,960
people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with it's just those were local

897
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,160
phenomena right they it wasn't a fully global phenomena so an empire could fall in surrounding

898
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:32,080
empires didn't fall maybe they came in filled the space um the first time that we were able to

899
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,440
think about catastrophic risk not from like a solar flare or something that we couldn't control but

900
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,840
from something that humans would actually create at a global level was world war two in the bomb

901
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,240
because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually

902
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,560
mess up everything at a global level that could mess up habitability we just weren't

903
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,720
powerful enough to do that before it's it's not that we didn't behave in ways that would have

904
01:32:54,720 --> 01:33:00,880
done it we just only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect and so it's important to get

905
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:06,080
that there's the entire world before world war two where we don't have the ability to make a

906
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:11,520
non-habitable biosphere non-habitable for us and then there's world war two and the beginning

907
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:17,280
of a completely new phase where global human-induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing

908
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:23,200
and that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way

909
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:28,320
which is you know when you study history it's amazing how big a percentage of history is

910
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:33,360
studying war right in the the history of wars you study european history and whatever it's generals

911
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:39,360
and wars and empire expansions and and so the the major empires near each other never had really

912
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,840
long periods of time where they weren't engaged in war or preparation for war or something like

913
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:50,640
that was humans don't have a good precedent in the post-tribal phase the civilization phase of

914
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:56,560
being able to solve conflicts without war for very long world war two was the first time where

915
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,960
we could have a war that no one could win and so the superpowers couldn't fight again they couldn't

916
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,920
do a real kinetic war they could do diplomatic wars and cold war type stuff and they could fight

917
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,240
proxy wars through other countries that didn't have the big weapons and so mutually assured

918
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:17,600
destruction and like coming out of world war two we actually realized that nation states couldn't

919
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,360
prevent world war and so we needed a new type of of supervening government in addition to nation

920
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:29,200
states which was the whole bread and woods world the united nations the world bank the imf the

921
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:35,280
globalization trade type agreements mutually assured destruction that was how do we have

922
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:39,680
some coordination beyond just nation states between them since we have to stop war between at

923
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:47,200
least the superpowers and it was pretty successful given that we've had like 75 years of no superpower

924
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:54,080
on superpower war um we've had lots of proxy wars during that time we've had you know cold war

925
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:02,000
and i would say we're in a new phase now where the bread and wood solution is basically over

926
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:09,200
almost over being described the bread was solution yeah so the bread and woods the series of agreements

927
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:17,680
for how the nations would be able to engage with each other in a solution other than war

928
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:24,640
was these igos these intergovernmental organizations and was the idea of globalization

929
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,600
since we could have global effects we needed to be able to think about things globally

930
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,320
where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable

931
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,320
to war with each other it'd be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other so our own

932
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:44,080
self-interest was you know going to drive our non-war interest um and so this started to look like

933
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:48,640
and obviously this this couldn't have happened that much earlier either because industrialization

934
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:53,360
hadn't gotten far enough to be able to do massive global industrial supply chains and ships stuff

935
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:58,160
around you know quickly but like we were mentioning earlier almost all the electronics that we

936
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:03,040
used today just basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents made in many countries there's

937
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,120
no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that we have and from the

938
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:13,520
raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the you know etc and so the idea

939
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:19,040
the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive gdp growth we

940
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:25,200
could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow stuff with the rapid gdp growth

941
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:29,440
there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without having to take each other stuff

942
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:35,920
and so that that was part of kind of the the breton woods post world war two model the other was

943
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,680
that we would be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up would never make sense

944
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:49,200
that worked for a while now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster the

945
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,720
unrenovable use of resource and turning those resources into pollution on the other side of

946
01:36:54,720 --> 01:37:02,400
the supply chain so obviously that faster gdp growth meant uh the overfishing of the oceans

947
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:08,000
and the cutting down of the trees and the climate change and the uh mining toxic mining tailings

948
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,920
going into the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things that's the

949
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:18,080
overall consumption side of the of the risk that we're talking about and so the answer of let's do

950
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:26,880
positive gdp is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously accelerated the planetary boundary side

951
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:31,600
and that started to be that that was thought about for a long time but it started to be modeled

952
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:39,440
with the club of rome and limits of growth um and it but it's just very obvious to say if you

953
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:44,080
have a linear materials economy where you take stuff out of the earth faster whether it's fish or

954
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:48,720
trees or or or and you take or oil and you take it out of the earth faster than it can replenish

955
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,760
itself and you turn it into trash after using it for a short period of time you put the trash in

956
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,880
the environment faster than it can process itself and there's toxicity associated with both sides

957
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:04,960
of this you can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever

958
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,920
that's not a hard thing to figure out and it has to be exponential if there's an exponentiation

959
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:15,680
the monetary supply because of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to

960
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:19,760
keep up with the growing monetary supply you have to have growth of goods and services and so that's

961
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:26,960
that kind of thing that has happened um but you also see that when you get these supply chains

962
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,600
that are so interconnected across the world you get increased fragility because a a collapse or

963
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,760
problem in one area then affects the whole world in a much bigger area as opposed to the issues

964
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:42,640
being local right so we got to see with covid and an issue that started in one part of china

965
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:48,480
affecting the whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened before breton woods right

966
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:53,120
before international travel supply chains you know that whole kind of thing and with a bunch of

967
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,000
second and third order effects that people wouldn't have predicted okay we have to stop

968
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:03,360
certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants but the countries doing agriculture depend upon

969
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,960
fertilizer they don't produce that is shipped into them and depend upon pesticides they don't

970
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,240
produce so we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in northern

971
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:15,680
africa and iran and things like that because they couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so then you

972
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:22,160
get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain shutdowns so you

973
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:27,360
get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can end up leading to cascade

974
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:39,440
effects and also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon to now that same

975
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:47,040
catastrophe weapon is there's more countries that have it eight or nine countries that have it and

976
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:52,480
there's a lot more types of catastrophe weapons we now have catastrophe weapons with

977
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:57,440
weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets with bio with in fact every new type of

978
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:03,440
tech has created an arms race so we have not with the un or the other kind of intergovernmental

979
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:08,560
organizations we haven't been able to really do nuclear deproliferation we've actually had more

980
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:13,600
countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes the race to hypersonics and things like that

981
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:21,520
um and every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race and so you

982
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:26,000
can't do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with two agents

983
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:32,080
two agents it's a much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that's forced but the ability

984
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,480
to modern say if these guys shoot who do i shoot do i shoot them do i shoot everybody do i and so

985
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,720
you get a three-body problem you get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple agents and

986
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,880
multiple different types of catastrophe weapons including ones that can be much more easily

987
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,320
produced than nukes nukes are really hard to produce there's only uranium in a few areas

988
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:54,800
uranium enrichment is hard icbm's are hard but weaponized drones hitting smart targets is not

989
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,640
so hard there's a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture

990
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:04,400
them is going way way down to where even non-state actors can have them and so when we talk about

991
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:10,160
exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech what that means is

992
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:16,400
decentralized catastrophe weapon capacity and especially in a world of increasing numbers of

993
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:24,960
people feeling disenfranchised frantic whatever for different reasons so uh i would say where the

994
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,440
Bretton Woods world doesn't prepare us to be able to deal with lots of different agents having

995
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:33,520
lots of different types of catastrophe weapons you can't put mutually assured destruction on

996
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,960
where you can't keep doing growth of the materials economy in the same way because

997
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:44,320
of hitting planetary boundaries and where the fragility dynamics are actually now their own

998
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:49,200
source of catastrophic risk so now we're so like there was all the world until world war two and

999
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:53,440
world war two is just from a from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago

1000
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,560
it seems like a long time but it is really not we get a short period of relative peace at the

1001
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,560
level of superpowers while building up the military capacity for much much much worse

1002
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:09,040
war the entire time and then now we're at this new phase where the things that allowed us to make

1003
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,760
it through the nuclear power are not the same systems that will let us make it through the next

1004
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:22,240
stage so what is this next post Bretton Woods how how do we become safe vessels safe stewards

1005
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:29,200
of many different types of exponential technology is uh a key question when we're thinking about

1006
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:38,160
x-risk okay so and i'd like to try to answer the how a few thought a few ways but first

1007
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:46,000
on the mutually assured destruction do you give credit to the idea of two superpowers

1008
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:52,320
not blowing each other up with nuclear weapons to the simple game theoretic model of mutually

1009
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:58,960
assured destruction or something you've said previously this idea of inverse correlation

1010
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:06,480
which i tend to believe between the now you were talking about tech but i think it's

1011
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:14,160
maybe broadly true the inverse correlation between competence and propensity for destruction so

1012
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:22,080
the better the the the bigger your weapons not because you're afraid of mutually assured

1013
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:28,880
self-destruction but because we're human beings and there's a deep moral fortitude there that's

1014
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:34,880
somehow aligned with competence and being good at your job that like it's very hard to be uh

1015
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:46,880
a psychopath and be good at killing at scale is do you share any of that intuition kind of

1016
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:53,360
i think most people would say that alexander the great and gang is con and napoli and were

1017
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:59,920
effective people that were good at their job uh that were actually maybe asymmetrically

1018
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:06,720
good at being able to organize people and do certain kinds of things that were

1019
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,920
pretty oriented towards certain types of destruction or pretty willing to

1020
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,080
maybe they would say they were oriented towards empire expansion but pretty willing to

1021
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,680
commit certain acts of destruction in the name of it what are you worried about the gang is con

1022
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:30,240
or you could argue he's not a psychopath uh that are you worried about gang is con are you

1023
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:38,080
worried about hitler are you worried about a terrorist who is has a very different ethic which

1024
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:47,520
is not even for uh it's not trying to preserve and build and expand my community it's more about

1025
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:54,240
just destruction in itself is the goal i think the thing that you're looking at that i do agree

1026
01:44:54,240 --> 01:45:00,880
with is that there's a psychological disposition towards construction right and a psychological

1027
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:05,120
disposition more towards destruction obviously everybody has both and can toggle between both

1028
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,480
and oftentimes one is willing to destroy certain things we have this idea of creative destruction

1029
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:15,920
right willing to destroy certain things to create other things and utilitarianism and trolley

1030
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:21,280
problems are all about exploring that space and the idea of war is all about that and i am trying

1031
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:25,840
to create something for our people and it requires destroying some other people um

1032
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,920
sociopathy is a funny topic because it's possible to have very high fealty to your in group and work

1033
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:39,600
on perfecting the methods of torture to the out group um at the same time because you can dehumanize

1034
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:50,480
and then remove empathy um and i would also say that there are types so the reason the thing that

1035
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:56,080
gives hope about the orientation towards construction and destruction being a little different in

1036
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:02,560
psychologies is what it takes to build really catastrophic tech even today where it doesn't

1037
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:08,240
take what it took to make a new a small group people could do it takes still some real technical

1038
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:14,000
knowledge that required having studied for a while and some then building capacity and

1039
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:19,040
there's a question of is that psychologically inversely correlated with the desire to

1040
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:29,440
damage civilization meaningfully uh a little bit a little bit i think um i think a lot i think

1041
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:34,960
it's actually i mean this is the conversation i had like what i think offline with dan carlin

1042
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:42,240
which is like it's pretty easy to come up with ways that any competent like i can come up with a

1043
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:48,240
lot of ways to hurt a lot of people and it's pretty easy like i alone could do it and

1044
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:56,960
like there's a lot of people as smarter smarter than me at least in the creation of explosives

1045
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:04,400
why are we not seeing more insane mass murder i i think there's something

1046
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:12,880
fascinating and beautiful about this yes and it does have to do with some deeply pro-social types

1047
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:20,960
of characteristics in humans and um but when you're dealing with very large numbers you don't

1048
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:25,760
need a whole lot of a phenomena and so then you start to say well what's the probability that x

1049
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,720
won't happen this year then won't happen in the next two years three years four years and then how

1050
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:34,960
many people are doing destructive things with lower tech and then how many of them can get

1051
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:42,080
access to higher tech that they didn't have to figure out how to build so uh when i can get

1052
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:47,840
commercial tech and maybe i don't understand tech very well but i understand it well enough to

1053
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:55,200
utilize it not to create it and i can repurpose it when we saw that commercial drone with a homemade

1054
01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:00,320
thermite bomb hit the ukraine ukrainian munitions factory and do the equivalent of an incendiary

1055
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:09,200
bomb level of damage that's just home tech that's just simple kind of thing and so the question is

1056
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:16,000
not what is does it stay being a small percentage of the population the question is does can you

1057
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:25,040
bind that phenomena nearly completely and especially now when you as you start to get into

1058
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:31,440
bigger things crisper gene drive technologies and various things like that um can you bind it

1059
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:38,160
completely long term over what period of time not perfectly though that's the thing i'm trying i'm

1060
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:46,880
trying to say that there is some let's call it uh let's uh a random word love that's inherent in

1061
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:55,760
that's core to human nature that's preventing destruction at scale and you're saying yeah

1062
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:01,120
but there's a lot of humans there's going to be eight plus billion and then there's a lot of seconds

1063
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:06,640
in the day to come up with stuff there's a lot of pain in the world that can lead to uh distorted

1064
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:11,120
view of the world such that you want to channel that pain into the destruction all those kinds of

1065
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:16,080
things and it's only a matter of time that anyone individual can do large damage especially as we

1066
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:23,120
create uh more and more democratized decentralized ways to deliver that damage even if you don't

1067
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:30,560
know how to build the initial weapon you can but the thing is it seems like it's a race between

1068
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:40,960
the cheapening of destructive weapons and the capacity of humans to express their love

1069
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:49,760
towards each other and it's a race that's so far i know on twitter you it's not popular to say but

1070
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:56,800
love is winning okay so what is the argument that love is going to lose here against nuclear

1071
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:06,080
weapons of biotech and and ai and uh and drones okay i'm gonna comment the end of this to a how

1072
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:11,600
love wins so i just want you to know that that's where i'm oriented that's the end but i'm i'm

1073
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:20,160
gonna argue against why that is a given because it because it's not a given i don't believe and

1074
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:25,520
i think this is like a good romantic comedy so you're gonna create drama right now but it will

1075
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,760
end with a happy ending well it's because it's only a happy ending if we actually understand

1076
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:34,480
the issues well enough and take responsibility to shift it do i believe like there's a reason why

1077
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:40,080
there's so much more dystopic sci-fi than protopic sci-fi and the in the summer protopic sci-fi

1078
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:48,240
usually requires magic is because or at least magical tech right dilithium crystals and warp

1079
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:54,720
drives and stuff because it's very hard to imagine people like the people we have been in the history

1080
01:50:54,720 --> 01:51:04,160
books with exponential type technology and power that don't eventually blow themselves up they

1081
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:08,800
make good enough choices as stewards of their environment and their comments and and each

1082
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,120
other and etc so like it's easier to think of scenarios where we blow ourselves up than it

1083
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:16,640
is to think of scenarios where we avoid every single scenario where we blow ourselves up and

1084
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:21,680
when i say blow ourselves up i also i mean the environmental versions the terrorist versions

1085
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:29,920
the war versions the cumulative externalities versions um can i and i'm sorry if i'm interrupting

1086
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:36,480
your flow of thought but why is it easier is it could it be a weird psychological thing where we

1087
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:42,400
either i was just more capable to visualize explosions and destruction and then the sicker

1088
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,960
thought which is like we kind of enjoy for some weird reason thinking about that kind of stuff

1089
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,480
even though we wouldn't actually act on it it's almost like some weird uh like i love playing

1090
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:58,560
shooter games you know uh first person shooters and like especially if it's like murdering zombie

1091
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:04,800
and doom you're shooting demons i play one of my favorite games diabolus like slashing through

1092
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:10,320
different monsters and the screaming and pain and the hellfire and then i go out into the real world

1093
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,840
to eat my coconut ice cream and i'm all about love so like i

1094
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:21,200
can we trust our ability to visualize how all it all goes to shit as an actual rational way of

1095
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:28,720
thinking i think it's a fair question to say to what degree is there just kind of perverse fantasy

1096
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:34,720
and um morbid exploration and whatever else that happens in our imagination uh

1097
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:42,080
but i don't think that's the whole of it i think there is also a reality to the combinatorial

1098
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:47,680
possibility space and the difference in the probabilities that there's a lot of ways i could

1099
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:53,440
try to put the 70 trillion cells of your body together that don't make you there's not that

1100
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,800
many ways i can put them together that make you there's a lot of ways i could try to connect the

1101
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:02,480
organs together that make some weird kind of group of organs on a on a desk but that doesn't

1102
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:08,560
actually make a functioning human and and you can kill an adult human in a second but you

1103
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:13,040
can't get one in a second takes 20 years to grow one and a lot of things to happen right i could

1104
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:19,360
destroy this building in a couple minutes with demolition but it took a year or a couple years

1105
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:26,320
to build it there is uh calm down co this is just an example it's not he doesn't mean it

1106
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:34,320
there's a there's a gradient where entropy is easier and that there's a lot more ways to

1107
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:38,800
put a set of things together that don't work than the few that really do produce higher order

1108
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:50,800
synergies and so when we look at a history of war and then we look at exponentially more powerful

1109
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:54,480
warfare an arms race that drives that in all these directions and when we look at a history

1110
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:58,320
of environmental destruction and exponentially more powerful tech that makes exponential

1111
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:02,240
externalities multiplied by the total number of agents that are doing it in the cumulative

1112
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:07,680
effects there's a lot of ways the whole thing can break like a lot of different ways and for

1113
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:14,960
it to get ahead it has to have none of those happen and so there's just a probability space

1114
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:20,000
where it's easier to imagine that thing so what so to say how do we have a pro-topic future we

1115
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:26,080
have to say well one criteria must be that it avoids all of the catastrophic risks so can we

1116
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:30,000
understand can we inventory all the catastrophic risks can we inventory the patterns of human

1117
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:36,480
behavior that give rise to them and could we try to solve for that and could we have that be the

1118
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:41,200
the essence of the social technology that we're thinking about to be able to guide bind and

1119
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:46,240
direct a new physical technology because so far our physical technology like we were talking about

1120
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:51,760
the Genghis Khan's and like that that obviously use certain kinds of physical technology and armaments

1121
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:58,080
and also social technology and unconventional warfare for a particular set of purposes but

1122
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:05,280
we have things that don't look like warfare like Rockefeller and Standard Oil and it looked like a

1123
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:14,080
constructive mindset to be able to bring this new energy resource to the world and it did and the

1124
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:21,840
second order effects of that are climate change and all of the oil spills that have happened and

1125
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:28,800
will happen and all of the wars in the Middle East over the oil that have been there and the

1126
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:34,480
massive political clusterfuck and human life issues that are associated with it and on and on

1127
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:44,240
right um and so it's also not just the orientation to construct a thing can have a narrow focus on

1128
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:48,080
what I'm trying to construct but be affecting a lot of other things through second and third order

1129
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:54,880
effects I'm not taking responsibility for and you you often another tangent mentioned second

1130
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:02,480
third and fourth order effects and order and cascading which is really fascinating like starting

1131
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:10,160
with the third order plus it gets really interesting because we don't we don't even acknowledge

1132
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:16,000
like the second order effects right but like thinking because those it could get bigger and

1133
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,360
bigger and bigger in ways we're not anticipating so how do we make those so it sounds like part of the

1134
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:28,480
part of the thing that you are thinking through in terms of a solution how to create

1135
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:34,640
an anti fragile a resilient society is to make explicit

1136
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:42,880
acknowledge understand the externalities the second order third order fourth order and the

1137
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:49,360
order effects how do we start to think about those effects yeah the war application is harm

1138
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:54,880
we're trying to cause or that we're aware we're causing right um the externality is harm that

1139
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:59,920
at least supposedly we're not aware we're causing or at minimum it's not our intention right maybe

1140
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,840
we're either totally unaware of it or we're aware of it but it is a side effect of what our

1141
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:09,520
intention is it's not the intention itself there are catastrophic risks from both types the direct

1142
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:17,200
application of increased technological power to a rival risk intent which is going to cause

1143
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:21,440
harm for some out group for some in group to win but the out group is also working on growing the

1144
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:26,080
tech and if they don't lose completely they reverse engineer the tech upregulated come back

1145
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:33,360
with more capacity so there's the exponential tech arms race side of in group out group rivalry

1146
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:40,480
using exponential tech that is one set of risks and the other set of risks is the application of

1147
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:47,280
exponentially more powerful tech not intentionally to try and beat an out group but to try to achieve

1148
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:52,880
some goal that we have but to produce a second and third order effects that do have harm to

1149
01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:01,040
the commons to other people to environment to other groups uh that might actually be bigger

1150
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:04,160
problems than the problem we were originally trying to solve with the thing we were building

1151
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:11,520
when facebook was building a dating app and then building a social app where people could tag pictures

1152
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:21,360
they weren't trying to build a democracy destroying app uh that would maximize time on site

1153
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:28,560
as part of its ad model through ai optimization of a news feed to the thing that made people spend

1154
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:33,120
most time on site which is usually them being limbically hijacked more than something else

1155
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:38,240
which ends up appealing to people's cognitive biases and group identities and creates no

1156
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:41,920
sense of shared reality they weren't trying to do that but it was a second order effect

1157
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:50,240
and it's a pretty fucking powerful second order effect um and a pretty fast one because the rate

1158
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:56,400
of tech is obviously able to get distributed to much larger scale much faster and with a bigger jump

1159
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:00,560
in terms of total vertical capacity then that's what it means to get to the verticalizing part

1160
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:08,640
of an exponential curve so um just like we can see that oil had these second order environmental

1161
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:15,840
effects and also social and political effects war and so much of the whole like the total

1162
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:21,920
amount of oil used is has a proportionality to total global gdp and this way we have this you

1163
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:29,840
know the petrodollar and um and so the the oil thing also had the externalities of a major

1164
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:35,120
aspect of what happened with military industrial complex and things like that so but we can see

1165
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:40,400
the same thing with with more current technologies with facebook and google um and and other things

1166
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:47,520
so i don't think we can run and the more powerful the tech is we build it for

1167
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:53,920
reason x whatever reason x is maybe x is three things maybe it's one thing right we

1168
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,280
we're doing the oil thing because we want to make cars because it's a better method of individual

1169
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,240
transportation we're building the facebook thing because we're going to connect people

1170
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:08,960
socially in the personal sphere but it it interacts with it interacts with complex systems with

1171
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:14,960
ecologies economies psychologies cultures and so it has effects on other than the thing we're

1172
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:21,120
intending some of those effects can end up being negative effects but because this technology

1173
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:26,560
if if we make it to solve a problem it has to overcome the problem the problem's been around

1174
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:30,000
for a while it's going to overcome in a short period of time so it usually has greater scale

1175
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,440
greater rate of magnitude in some way that also means that the externalities that it creates

1176
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:40,400
might be bigger problems and you can say well but then that's the new problem and humanity will

1177
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:44,480
innovate its way out of that well i don't think that's paying attention to the fact that we can't

1178
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:50,960
keep up with exponential curves like that nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities forever

1179
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:58,000
and this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking well no i think

1180
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,880
we're totally screwed and unless we can make a benevolent ai singleton that rules all of us

1181
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:08,320
you know guys like boss drum and and others uh thinking in those directions because they're like

1182
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:16,800
how do humans try to do multi polarity and make it work and i i have a different answer of what

1183
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:21,600
i think it looks like that does have more to do with the love but some applied social

1184
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:27,520
tech aligned aligned with love because i have a bunch of really dumb ideas i'd prefer to uh

1185
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:32,880
i'd like to hear i'd like to hear some of them first i think the idea i would have is uh to be

1186
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:41,760
a bit more rigorous in trying to measure the amount of love you add or subtract from the world

1187
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:49,520
in second third fourth fifth order effects it's actually i think especially in the world of tech

1188
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:56,880
quite doable you know you just might not like you know the the shareholders may not like that

1189
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:05,360
kind of metric but it's pretty easy to measure like that's not even uh i'm perhaps half joking

1190
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:09,600
about love but we could talk about just happiness and well-being long-term well-being

1191
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:15,040
that's pretty easy from facebook for youtube for all these companies to measure that

1192
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,120
they do a lot of kinds of surveys they could do i mean there's very simple solutions here

1193
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:27,520
that you could just survey how i mean servers are in some sense use useless because they're um

1194
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:34,320
a subset of the population you're just trying to get a sense it's very loose kind of understanding

1195
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:39,520
but integrated deeply as part of the technology most of our tech is recommender systems most

1196
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:46,080
of the sorry net tech uh online interaction is driven by recommender systems that learn

1197
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:52,400
very little data about you and use that data based on mostly based on traces of your previous

1198
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:57,200
behavior to suggest future things this is how twitter this has facebook works this is how

1199
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,920
adsense for google adsense works is how netflix youtube work and so on and and for them to just

1200
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:10,960
track as opposed to engagement how much you spend in a particular video particular site is also

1201
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:18,000
track give you the technology to do self-report of what makes you feel good what makes you grow as

1202
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:28,800
a person of what makes you uh you know the best version of yourself the the the the rogan uh idea

1203
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:35,600
of the hero of your movie and just add that little bit of information if you you have people you

1204
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:41,920
have this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five days how would you report

1205
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:46,240
your experience you can lay out the set of videos this is kind of fascinating to me i don't know if

1206
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:51,280
you ever look at youtube the history of videos you've looked at it's fascinating it's very embarrassing

1207
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:58,000
for me like you'll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that i don't want anyone to know

1208
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,240
about which is which is which will be like uh i don't know maybe like five videos in a row where

1209
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:08,320
it looks like i watched the whole thing which i probably did i bought like how to cook a steak

1210
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:14,160
even though or just like the best chefs in the world cooking steaks and i'm just like sitting

1211
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:20,240
there watching it for no purpose whatsoever wasting away my life or like funny cat videos are like

1212
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:26,560
legit that that's that's an that's always a good one and i could look back and rate which videos

1213
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:33,280
made me a better person and not and i mean on a more serious note there's a bunch of conversations

1214
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:38,640
podcasts or lectures i've watched which made me a better person and some of them made me a worse

1215
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:45,760
person uh quite honestly not for stupid reasons like i feel dumber but because i do have a sense

1216
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,680
that that started me on a path of um

1217
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,240
um

1218
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:57,840
of not being kind to other people for example i'll give you uh for my own and i'm sorry for

1219
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:03,760
rantic but maybe there's some usefulness to this kind of exploration of self when i focus on

1220
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:13,520
creating i'm programming on science i become a much deeper thinker and a kinder person to others

1221
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:17,760
when i listen to too many a little bit is good but too many

1222
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:27,120
podcasts or videos about how how our world is melting down or criticizing ridiculous people

1223
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:33,520
the worst of the quote unquote woke for example all there's all these groups that are misbehaving

1224
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:39,840
in fascinating ways because they've been corrupted by power the more i watch the more i watch criticism

1225
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:48,000
of them the worse i become and i'm aware of this but i'm also aware that for some reason

1226
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:54,720
it's pleasant to watch those sometimes and so for for me to be able to self report that to the youtube

1227
02:05:54,720 --> 02:06:00,400
algorithm to the systems around me and they ultimately try to optimize to make me the best

1228
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:06,000
person the best version of myself which i personally believe would make youtube a lot more money

1229
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,960
because i'd be much more willing to spend time i need to have been given youtube a lot more a lot

1230
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:16,880
more of my money that's a that's great for business and great for humanity because it'll make me a

1231
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:25,040
kinder person it'll increase the the love quotient the love metric and uh it'll make them a lot of

1232
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:29,920
money i feel like everything's aligned and so you you should do that not just for youtube algorithm

1233
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:35,600
but also for military strategy and for the to go to war or not because one externality you can think

1234
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:41,920
of about going to war which i think we talked about offline is we often go to war with kind of

1235
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:49,600
governments with that with not with the people you have to think about the kids of countries

1236
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:59,120
that see a soldier and because of what they experience the interaction with the soldier

1237
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:05,840
hate is born when you're like eight years old six years old you lose your dad you lose your mom

1238
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:12,240
you lose a friend somebody close to you that want to really powerful externality that could be

1239
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:19,680
reduced to love positive and negative is uh the hate that's born when you make decisions and that's

1240
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:26,160
going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree that then leads to the kind

1241
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:33,920
of destruction that we talk about so but in my sense it's possible to reduce everything to

1242
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:41,920
measure of how much love does this add to the world all that to say do you have ideas of how we

1243
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:51,120
practically build systems that that that create a resilient society there are a lot of good things

1244
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:56,480
that you shared where there's like 15 different ways that we could enter this that are all

1245
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:01,760
interesting so i'm trying to see which one will probably be most useful pick the the one or two

1246
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:09,920
things that are least ridiculous when you're mentioning if we could see some of the second

1247
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,240
order effects or externalities that we aren't used to seeing specifically the one of a kid

1248
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:18,720
being radicalized somewhere else which engenders enmity and them towards us which decreases our

1249
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:22,480
own future security even if you don't care about the kid if you care about the kids the whole other

1250
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:30,480
thing um yeah i mean i think when we saw this when jane fonda and others went to vietnam and took

1251
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:35,360
photos and videos of what was happening and you got to see the pictures of the kids with napalm on

1252
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:42,960
them uh that like the anti-war effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn't have been without

1253
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:49,440
that there's there's a until we can see the images you can't have a mere neuron effect in the same

1254
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:55,200
way and when you can that starts to have a powerful effect i think there's a deep principle that you're

1255
02:08:55,200 --> 02:09:06,160
sharing there which is that if we we can have a rival risk intent where our in group whatever it is

1256
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:11,280
maybe it's our political party wanting to win within the u.s maybe it's our nation state wanting to

1257
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:18,080
win in a a war or an economic war over resource or whatever it is that if we don't obliterate the

1258
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:24,000
other people completely they don't go away they're they're not engendered to like us more

1259
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:29,840
they're they didn't become less smart so they have more enmity towards us and whatever technologies

1260
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:35,280
we employed to be successful they will now reverse engineer make iterations on and come back

1261
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:42,160
and so you you drive in arms race which is why you can see that the wars were over history

1262
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:51,200
employing more lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic war um the information war and the narrative

1263
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:58,160
war and the economic war right like it's just increased capacity in all of those fronts um

1264
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:04,400
and so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses in

1265
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:08,560
the long term and what's even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned

1266
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:13,120
with everyone else because we inter-affect each other and I think the thing about globalism

1267
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:18,080
globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which we affect each other and the rate at which

1268
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:25,360
we affect the biosphere that we're all affected by is that this this kind of proverbial spiritual

1269
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:30,800
idea that we're all interconnected and need to think about that in some way that was easy for

1270
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:36,000
tribes to get because everyone in the tribe so clearly saw their interconnection independence

1271
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:43,520
on each other but in terms of a global level the the speed at which we are actually interconnected

1272
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:49,040
the speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or a new

1273
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:52,880
technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue or whatever

1274
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:59,120
is making it to where we either actually all get not as a spiritual idea just even as physics

1275
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:04,000
right we all get to the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that

1276
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,520
and see how to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere in that becoming

1277
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:13,760
decreased quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere don't you think people

1278
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:18,640
are beginning to experience that at the individual level so governments are resisting it they're

1279
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:22,560
trying to make us not empathize with each other feel connected but don't you think people are

1280
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:27,680
beginning to feel more and more connected like isn't that exactly what the technology is enabling

1281
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:33,760
like social networks we tend to criticize them but isn't there a sense which we're

1282
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:39,840
experiencing you know when you watch those videos that are criticizing whether it's

1283
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:48,000
the woke antifa side or the QAnon Trump supporter side does it seem like they

1284
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,200
have increased empathy for people that are outside of their ideology camp not at all so I may be

1285
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:59,760
I may be conflating my own experience of the world and that of

1286
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:06,080
that of the populace I I tend to see those videos

1287
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:13,600
as feeding something that's a relic of the past they figured out that drama

1288
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:22,400
fuels clicks but whether I'm right or wrong I don't know but I tend to sense that that is not

1289
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:28,560
that hunger for drama is not fundamental to human beings that we want to actually

1290
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:37,120
that we want to understand antifa and we want to like empathize we want to take radical ideas

1291
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:46,960
and be able to empathize with them and synthesize it all okay let's look at cultural outliers

1292
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:53,840
in terms of violence versus compassion we can see that a lot of cultures have

1293
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:59,680
relatively lower in-group violence bigger out-group violence and there's some variants in

1294
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,360
them and variants of different times based on the scarcity or abundance of resource and other things

1295
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:12,000
but you can look at say janes whose whole religion is around non-violence so much

1296
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:15,760
so that they don't even hurt plants they only take fruits that fall off them and stuff

1297
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:22,000
or to go to a larger population you take buddhists where for the most part with a few exceptions

1298
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,040
for the most part across three millennia and across lots of different countries and geographies and

1299
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:34,240
whatever you have 10 million people plus or minus who don't hurt bugs the whole spectrum of genetic

1300
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:39,920
variants that is happening within a culture of that many people and head traumas and whatever

1301
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:45,440
and nobody hurts bugs and then you look at a group where the kids grew up as child soldiers

1302
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:50,720
in libiria or darfur were to make it to adulthood pretty much everybody's killed people hand to hand

1303
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:58,000
and killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people and you say okay so we were very

1304
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:04,000
neoteness we can be conditioned by our environment and humans can be conditioned where almost all

1305
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,680
the humans show up in these two different bell curves it doesn't mean that the buddhists had no

1306
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:11,520
violence it doesn't mean that these people had no compassion but the they're very different

1307
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:19,600
Gaussian distributions and so I think one of the important things that I like to do is look at

1308
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:24,800
the examples of the populations what buddhism shows regarding compassion or what

1309
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:31,440
Judaism shows around education the average level of education that everybody gets because of a

1310
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:36,960
culture that is really working on conditioning it or various cultures what are the positive deviants

1311
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:44,320
outside of this statistical deviants to see what is actually possible and then say what are the

1312
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:49,040
conditioning factors and can we condition those across a few of them simultaneously and could

1313
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:54,560
we build a civilization like that becomes a very interesting question so there's this kind of real

1314
02:14:54,560 --> 02:15:01,200
politic idea that humans are violent large groups of humans become violent they become

1315
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:06,240
irrational specifically those two things rivalrous and violent and irrational and so in order to

1316
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:10,720
minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions they need ruled somehow and

1317
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:15,680
that not getting that is some kind of naive utopianism that doesn't understand human nature

1318
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:22,000
yet this gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing I think the idea of the masses

1319
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,760
is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the classes that control

1320
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:38,080
um to popularize the idea that most people are too violent lazy undisciplined and irrational

1321
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:43,760
to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some kind of way I think

1322
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:50,000
that if we look back at these conditioning environments we can say okay so the kids

1323
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:58,720
they go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like Exeter Academy

1324
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:02,720
there's still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric

1325
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:09,040
but on average they become senators and the worst ones become high-end lawyers or whatever

1326
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:12,720
and then I look at an inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see a very

1327
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:16,240
very differently displaced Gaussian distribution but a very different set of conditioning factors

1328
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:20,560
so then I say the masses well if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses got to

1329
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:26,000
go to Exeter and have that family and whatever would they still be the masses um could we actually

1330
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:33,360
condition more social virtue more civic virtue more orientation towards dialectical synthesis

1331
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:43,120
more empathy more rationality widely yes would that lead to better capacity for something like

1332
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:47,840
participatory governance democracy or republic or some kind of participatory governance

1333
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:57,920
yes yes is it necessary for it actually yes and is it good for class interests not not really

1334
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:02,720
by the way when you say class interest this is the powerful leading over the

1335
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:08,560
less powerful that kind of idea anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power

1336
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:15,920
or doesn't necessarily benefit from decreasing those asymmetries of power and kind of increasing

1337
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:26,800
the capacity of people more widely and so when we talk about power we're talking about asymmetries

1338
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:32,560
in agency influence and control you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature

1339
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:36,240
I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff so like

1340
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:44,080
this this this pickup line that I use at a bar off which is power crops and absolute power crops

1341
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:50,640
absolutely is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say in modern society there's something

1342
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:58,560
to be said have we changed as societies over time in terms of how much we crave power that there is

1343
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:04,320
an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned one way or the other yes

1344
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:09,360
but you can see that Buddhist society does a very different thing with it at scale that you don't

1345
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:17,200
end up seeing the emergence of the same types of sociopathic behavior and particularly then

1346
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:27,040
creating sociopathic institutions and so it's like is eating the foods that were rare in our

1347
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,880
evolutionary environment to give us more dopamine hit because they were rare and they're not anymore

1348
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:36,560
salt fat sugar is there something pleasurable about those where humans have an orientation

1349
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:41,680
to overeat if they can well the fact that there is that possibility doesn't mean everyone will

1350
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:48,480
obligately be obese and I have obesity right like it's possible to have a particular impulse and to

1351
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:56,400
be able to understand it have other ones and be able to balance them and so to say that power

1352
02:18:56,400 --> 02:19:02,080
dynamics are are obligate in humans and we can't do anything about it is very similar to me to saying

1353
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:07,920
like we could everyone is going to be obligately obese yeah so there's some degree to which those

1354
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:12,880
the control those impulses has to do with the conditioning early in life yes and the culture

1355
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:18,240
that creates the environment to be able to do that and then the recursion on that okay so what

1356
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:24,480
if we were to uh bear with me just asking for a friend if we were to kill all humans on earth

1357
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,480
and then start over

1358
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:34,240
is their ideas about how to build up okay we don't have to kill let's leave the humans on earth

1359
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:41,120
they're fine and go to mars and start a new society is there ways to construct systems of

1360
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:51,760
conditioning education of how we live with each other that would that would incentivize us properly

1361
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:56,560
to not seek power not to not construct systems that are

1362
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:03,280
of asymmetry of power and to create systems that are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks

1363
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:10,880
to the all kinds of destructions I believe so so is there some inklings we get of course you

1364
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:16,240
probably don't have the ant all the answers but you have insights about what that looks like I mean

1365
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:23,440
is it just rigorous practice of dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes of

1366
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:28,480
various flavors until they're not assholes anymore because you've become a deeply empathetic with

1367
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:36,560
their experience okay so there's a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to

1368
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:43,600
this like what is the basis of rivalry what how do you bind it how does it relate to tech if you

1369
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:48,880
have a culture that is doing less rivalry does it always lose in war to those who do war better and

1370
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:54,160
how do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here great great so what's

1371
02:20:54,160 --> 02:21:01,280
rivalry why is is rivalry bad or good is so is another word for rivalry competition

1372
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:11,040
yes I think roughly yes I think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here good for some

1373
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:18,960
things bad for other things for some contexts and others even that okay let me give you an example

1374
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:24,240
that relates back to the facebook measuring thing you were mentioning a moment ago first

1375
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:27,920
I think what you're saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what I want to get

1376
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:35,600
to in a moment but it's not the devil is in the details here so I enjoy praise feeds my ego I grow

1377
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:40,880
stronger so I appreciate that I will make sure to include one piece every 15 minutes as we go thank you

1378
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:48,160
so it's easier to measure

1379
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,040
there are problems with this argument but there's also utility to it so let's take it

1380
02:21:55,040 --> 02:22:01,920
for the utility it has first it's harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort

1381
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:10,800
uh we can measure with technology that the shocks in a car are making the car bounce less that the

1382
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:17,680
bed is um softer and you know material science and those types of things and happiness is actually

1383
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:24,240
hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there's certain kinds of overcoming

1384
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:27,920
suffering that are necessary for happiness there's happiness it feels more like contentment and

1385
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,680
happiness it feels more like passion does is passion the source of all suffering or the

1386
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:35,920
source of all creativity like that there's deep stuff and it's mostly first person not

1387
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:40,640
measurable third person stuff even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to some degree

1388
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:45,200
but we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the worst environments

1389
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:49,440
who end up finding happiness right where the third person stuff looks to be less conducive and there's

1390
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:55,840
some victor frankle nelson mendela whatever um but it's pretty easy to measure comfort and it's

1391
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:01,600
pretty universal and i think we can see that the industrial revolution started to replace happiness

1392
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:06,640
with comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for and we can see that when increased

1393
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:12,880
comfort is given maybe because of the evolutionary disposition that expending extra calories when

1394
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:17,680
for the majority of our history we didn't have extra calories was not a safe thing to do who knows

1395
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:24,800
why um when extra comfort is given it's very easy to take that path even if it's not the

1396
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:33,680
path that supports overall well-being long-term and um so we can see that you know when you when

1397
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:40,320
you look at the techno-optimist idea that we have better lives than egyptian pharaohs and kings and

1398
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:46,560
whatever what they're largely looking at is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable

1399
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:50,240
the transportation systems are and things like that in which case is massive improvement but

1400
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:54,640
we also see that in some of the nations where people have access to the most comfort suicide

1401
02:23:54,640 --> 02:24:00,720
and mental illness are the highest and we also see that some of the happiest cultures are actually

1402
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:05,520
some of the ones that are in materially lame environments and so there's a very interesting

1403
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:11,600
question here and if i understand correctly you do cold showers and joe rogan was talking about how

1404
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:19,040
he needs to do some fairly intensive kind of um struggle that is a non-comfort to actually induce

1405
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:26,240
being better as a person this concept of hormesis that it's actually stressing an adaptive system

1406
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:32,400
that increases its adaptive capacity and that there's something that the happiness of a system has

1407
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:36,960
something to do with its adaptive capacity its overall resilience health well-being which requires

1408
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:44,880
a decent bit of discomfort and yet in the in the presence of the comfort solution it's very hard to

1409
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:49,280
not choose it and then as you're choosing it regularly to actually down regulate your overall

1410
02:24:49,280 --> 02:25:00,400
adaptive capacity and so when we start saying can we make tech where we're measuring for the things

1411
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:06,640
that it produces beyond just the measure of gdp or whatever particular measures look like the

1412
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:13,840
revenue generation or profit generation of my business are all the meaningful things measurable

1413
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:20,400
and what are the right measures and what are the externalities of optimizing for that

1414
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:24,080
measurement set what meaningful things aren't included in that measurement set that might

1415
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:28,080
have their own externalities these are some of the questions we actually have to take seriously

1416
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:33,520
yeah and we i think they're answerable questions right progressively better not perfect right so

1417
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,520
so first of all let me throw out happiness and comfort out of the discussion those

1418
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:43,440
seem like useless the distinction so i because i said they're useful well-being is useful but

1419
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:52,800
i think i take it back i knew i proposed new metrics in this brainstorm session which is

1420
02:25:54,080 --> 02:26:02,800
so one is like personal growth which is intellectual growth i think we're able to

1421
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:10,560
make that concrete for ourselves like you're a better person than you were a week ago or a

1422
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:16,880
worse person than you were a week ago i think we can ourselves report that and and and understand

1423
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:21,760
what that means it's this gray area and we try to define it but i think we humans are pretty

1424
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:26,480
good at that because we have a sense an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become

1425
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:31,440
we we all dream of becoming a certain kind of person and i think we have a sense of getting

1426
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:37,680
closer and not towards that person maybe this is not a great metric fine the other one is love

1427
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:45,120
actually fuck if you're happy or not or you're comfortable or not how much love do you have

1428
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:50,560
towards your fellow human beings i feel like if you try to optimize that and increasing that that's

1429
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:59,280
going to have that's a good metric how many times a day sorry if i can make quantify how many times

1430
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:04,000
a day have you thought positively of another human being just put that down as a number

1431
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:12,720
and increase that number i think the process of saying okay so let's not take gdp or gdp per

1432
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:17,360
capita is the metric we want to optimize for because gdp goes up during war and it goes up with

1433
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:21,200
more healthcare spending from sicker people and various things that we wouldn't say correlate

1434
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:27,520
to quality of life addiction drives gdp awesomely um by the way when i said growth i wasn't referring

1435
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:32,720
i know i'm give i'm giving an example now of the primary metric we use and why it's not

1436
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:37,200
an adequate metric and because we're exploring other ones so the idea of saying what would the

1437
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:44,000
metrics for a good civilization be if i had to pick a set of metrics what would the best ones be

1438
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:50,160
if i was going to optimize for those and then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply

1439
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:56,240
and say okay so what happens if we optimize for that try to think through the first and second

1440
02:27:56,480 --> 02:28:01,840
third order effects of what happens it's positive and then also say what negative things can happen

1441
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:06,640
from optimizing that what actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining

1442
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:11,680
it because love versus number of positive thoughts per day i could just make a long list of names

1443
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:16,720
and just think say positive thing about each one it's all very superficial not include animals

1444
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:21,840
with the rest of life have a have a very shallow total amount of it but i'm optimizing the number

1445
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:26,560
if i get some credit for the number so the and this is when i said the model of reality isn't

1446
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:33,440
reality when you make a set of metrics they were going to optimize for this whatever reality is

1447
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:38,560
that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs which is why i would say

1448
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:51,120
that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices beyond what metrics-based

1449
02:28:51,120 --> 02:29:03,040
optimization would offer yeah but another way to say that is wisdom is uh constantly expanding

1450
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:09,200
an evolving set of metrics which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new

1451
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:13,760
metric that's important that isn't part of that metric set so there's a certain kind of connection

1452
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:20,240
discernment awareness and this is an iterative game theory there's a girdles and completeness

1453
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:24,240
theorem right which is if the system if the set of things is consistent it won't be complete so

1454
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:28,880
we're going to keep adding to it which is why we were saying earlier i don't think it's not beautiful

1455
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,200
and especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at the individual

1456
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:37,280
level is becoming right that we're becoming more well that's then becomes true for the civilization

1457
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:42,480
and our metrics as well yeah and our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a

1458
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:46,960
meaningful civilization i can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are what's that

1459
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:55,440
well love is obviously not a metric it's like you could bench yeah it's a good metric yeah i want

1460
02:29:55,440 --> 02:30:04,400
to optimize that across the entire population starting with infants um so in the same way that

1461
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:07,840
love isn't a metric but you could make metrics that look at certain parts of it the thing i'm

1462
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:12,240
about to say isn't a metric but it's a it's a consideration because i thought about this a lot

1463
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:18,800
i don't think there is a metric a right one um i think that every metric by itself without this

1464
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:23,520
thing we talked about of the continuous improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer i think that's why

1465
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:30,080
what the idea of false idle means in terms of the model of reality not being reality then my

1466
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:35,360
sacred relationship is to reality itself which also binds me to the unknown forever to the known

1467
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:40,080
but also to the unknown and there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates

1468
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:44,400
an epistemic humility that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing i know but to learn new

1469
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:49,680
stuff and to be open to perceive reality directly so my model never becomes sacred my model is useful

1470
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:57,120
my so the model can't be the false idle correct yeah and this is why the first verse of the

1471
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:01,760
Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not the eternal Tao the naming then can become the

1472
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:05,600
source of the ten thousand things that if you get too carried away with it can actually obscure you

1473
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:11,280
from paying attention to reality beyond in the models it sounds a lot a lot like Stephen Wolf

1474
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:17,680
from but in a different language much more poetic i can't imagine that no i'm referring i'm joking

1475
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:22,800
but there's echoes of cellular automata which you can't name you can't construct a good model

1476
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:29,520
cellular automata you can only watch in awe i apologize i'm distracting your train of thought

1477
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:33,600
horribly and miserably making a difference by the way something robots aren't good at

1478
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:39,520
and uh dealing with the uncertainty of uneven ground you've been okay so far you've been doing

1479
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:44,160
wonderfully so what's your favorite metrics okay so i know you're not so i have a fascinating

1480
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:50,640
so one metric and there are problems with this but one metric that i like to just as a thought

1481
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:57,760
experiment to consider is because you're actually asking where i mean i know you ask your guests

1482
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:01,520
about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're deciding when you're saying what is a

1483
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:07,280
desirable civilization you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful human life and

1484
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:13,520
and to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to that right um

1485
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:21,040
and then you have whatever your answer is how do you know what is the what is the

1486
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:26,800
epistemic basis for for postulating that um there's also a whole nother reason for asking

1487
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:32,640
that question i don't i mean but that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever which is it's

1488
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:42,080
interesting how few people have been asked questions like it we we we joke about these

1489
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:49,760
questions is silly right it's it's funny to watch a person and if i was more of an asshole i would

1490
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:56,560
really stick on that question right it's a silly question in some sense but like we haven't really

1491
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:01,680
considered what it means just a more concrete version of that question is what is what is a

1492
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:06,640
better world what is the kind of world we're trying to create really i think well have you

1493
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:11,680
really thought okay i'll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me

1494
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:18,400
but let me do the societal indices first because they're fun yes we should take a note of this

1495
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:22,560
meaningful thing because it's important to come back to um are you reminding me to ask you about

1496
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:30,960
the meaning of life noted i know let me jot that down yeah so um well because i think i stopped

1497
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:40,240
tracking it like 25 open threads um okay let it all burn one index that i find very interesting is

1498
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:47,360
the inverse correlation of addiction within the society the more a society produces addiction

1499
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:53,920
within the people in it the less healthy i think the society is as a pretty fundamental metric

1500
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:59,280
and so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things

1501
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:04,640
in compelling them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values

1502
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:10,720
and in so far as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it

1503
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:19,920
the inverse of addiction um oddly defined addiction what's yeah compulsive behavior that

1504
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,400
is destructive towards things that we value

1505
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:30,960
yeah i think that's a very interesting one to think about that's a really interesting one yeah

1506
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:34,400
and this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close

1507
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:40,320
and the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed

1508
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:46,720
to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and needing

1509
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:53,680
that hypernormal stimuli which does involve a kind of hormesis so i do think the civilization

1510
02:34:53,680 --> 02:35:04,960
of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort and um ritualized discomfort

1511
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:11,040
yeah i think that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and the

1512
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:15,600
ayahuasca journey and the sundance were i think it's even a big part of what yoga asana was

1513
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:23,680
is to make beings that are resilient and strong they have to overcome some things to make beings

1514
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:28,960
that can control their own mind and fear they have to face some fears but we don't want to

1515
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:34,160
put everybody in war or real trauma and yet we can see that the most fucked up people we know

1516
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,800
had childhoods of a lot of trauma but some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods

1517
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:43,120
of a lot of trauma whether or not they happen to make it through and overcome that or not

1518
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:49,760
so how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever

1519
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:54,640
that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people a certain kind of ritualized

1520
02:35:55,440 --> 02:36:02,720
discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves but overcome it together with

1521
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:06,400
each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the other people are there so it's both

1522
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:12,240
a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding so i think we'll keep getting

1523
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:17,120
more and more comfortable stuff but we have to also develop resilience in the presence of that

1524
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:24,640
for the anti-addiction direction and the fullness of character and the trustworthiness to others

1525
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:30,480
so you have to be consistently injecting discomfort into the system ritualize

1526
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:35,680
i mean this sounds like uh you have to imagine sycophus happy you have to

1527
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:38,720
uh imagine sycophus with this rock

1528
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:49,440
optimally resilient from a metrics perspective in society so we want we want to constantly

1529
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:55,360
be throwing rocks at ourselves not constantly uh you didn't have to frequently

1530
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:00,880
periodically periodically and there's different levels of intensity different

1531
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:06,880
period of disease now i do not think this should be imposed by states uh i think it should emerge

1532
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:12,240
from cultures and i think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of

1533
02:37:12,240 --> 02:37:18,800
it so the people so there is both a cultural cohesion to it but there's also a voluntarism

1534
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:22,720
because the people value the thing that is being developed they understand it and that's what

1535
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:28,480
condition so it's conditioning it's conditioning some of these some of these values and conditioning

1536
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:33,360
is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty but when we recognize the language

1537
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:38,400
that we speak and the words that we think in and the and the patterns of thought built into

1538
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:42,720
that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just based on

1539
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:47,200
where we're born you can't not condition people so all you can do is take more responsibility

1540
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:50,640
for what the conditioning factors are and then you have to think about this question of what is a

1541
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:55,200
meaningful human life because we're unlike the other animals born into environment that they're

1542
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:59,600
genetically adapted for we're building new environments that we were not adapted for and

1543
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:04,320
then we're becoming affected by those so then we have to say well what kinds of environments

1544
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:10,640
digital environments physical environments social environments would we want to create

1545
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:16,880
that would develop the healthiest happiest most moral noble meaningful people and what are even

1546
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:21,840
those sets of things that matter so you end up getting deep existential consideration at the

1547
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:26,160
heart of civilization design when you start to rise how powerful we're becoming and how much

1548
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:32,080
what we're building it in service towards matters before I pull it I think three threads you just

1549
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:36,880
lay down is there another metric index a year and I'll tell you one more that I really like

1550
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:42,480
there's a there's a number but the one the next one that comes to mind is

1551
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:47,760
I have to make a very quick model

1552
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:58,480
of healthy human bonding say we were in a tribal type setting my positive emotional states and your

1553
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:03,840
positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated your negative emotional states in

1554
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:11,840
mind and so you start laughing I start laughing you start crying my eyes might tear up and we would

1555
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:19,440
call that the compassion compersion access I would this is a model I find useful so compassion is

1556
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:24,240
when you're feeling something negative I feel some pain I feel some empathy something in relationship

1557
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:29,200
compersion is when you do well I'm stoked for you right like I actually feel happiness right

1558
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:34,640
down I like compersion yeah the fact that it's such an uncommon word in English is actually a

1559
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:39,600
problem culturally um because I feel that often and I think that's a really good feeling to feel

1560
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:44,480
and maximize for actually that's actually the metric I'm gonna say oh is the compassion

1561
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:50,960
compersion at access is the thing I would optimize for now there is a state where my emotional

1562
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:57,920
states and your emotional states are just totally decoupled and that is like sociopathy I don't want

1563
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:02,240
to hurt you but I don't care if I do or for you to do well or whatever but there's a worse state

1564
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:08,080
and it's extremely common which is where they're inversely coupled where my positive emotions

1565
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:14,720
correspond to your negative ones and vice versa and that is the I would call it the jealousy

1566
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:21,440
sadism access the jealousy access is when you're doing really well I feel something bad I feel

1567
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:32,080
taken away from less than upset envious whatever and that's so common but I think of it as kind of

1568
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:38,880
a low-grade psychopathology that we've just normalized the idea that I'm actually upset at

1569
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:42,480
the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like a profoundly fucked up thing

1570
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:46,960
no we shouldn't shame it and repress it so it gets worse we should study it where does it come

1571
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:52,000
from and it comes from our own insecurities and stuff and but then the next part that everybody

1572
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:58,400
knows is really fucked up is just on the same axis it's the same inverted which is so the jealousy

1573
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:04,240
or the envy is the I feel badly when you're doing well the sadism side is I actually feel good when

1574
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:08,480
you lose or when you're in pain I feel some happiness that's associated and you can see when

1575
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:13,920
someone feels jealous sometimes they feel jealous with a partner and then they feel they want that

1576
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:20,480
partner to get it revenge comes up or something so sadism is really like jealousy is one step on

1577
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:26,000
the path to sadism from the healthy compassion conversion access so I would like to see a

1578
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:33,440
society that is inversely that is conditioning sadism and jealousy inversely right the lower

1579
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:37,760
that amount and the more the compassion conversion and if I had to summarize that very simply I'd

1580
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:45,520
say it would optimize for compersion which is because notice that's not just saying love

1581
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:51,040
for you where I might be self-sacrificing and miserable and I love people but I kill myself

1582
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:54,560
which I don't think anybody thinks a great idea or happiness where I might be sociopathically

1583
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:59,600
happy where I'm causing problems all over the place or even sadistically happy but it's a coupling

1584
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:04,640
right that I'm actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship

1585
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:10,720
where I my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too that's actually speaking of

1586
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:18,400
another pickup line that's quite honestly what I this is a guy who's single this is going to come

1587
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:22,800
out very ridiculous because it's like oh yeah where's your girlfriend bro but

1588
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:32,800
that's what I look for in a relationship because it's like it's so much it's so it's such an amazing

1589
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:39,920
life where you actually get joy from another person's success and they get joy from your success

1590
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:45,280
and then it becomes like you don't actually need to succeed much for that to have a like a

1591
02:42:46,160 --> 02:42:53,040
a loop like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially it's weird

1592
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:58,720
so like just be just enjoying the the happiness of others this success of others so this this is

1593
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:04,800
like the let's call this because the first person that drilled this into my head is Rogan Joe Rogan

1594
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:12,720
he was the embodiment of that because I saw somebody who is successful rich and non-stop

1595
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:19,360
true I mean you could tell when somebody's full of shit and somebody's not really genuinely

1596
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:24,960
enjoying the success of his friends that that was weird to me that was interesting and I mean the way

1597
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:31,920
you're kind of speaking to it the reason Joe stood out to me is I guess I haven't witnessed

1598
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:39,040
genuine expression of that often in this culture I've just real joy for others I mean part of

1599
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:44,720
that has to do with there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or listen to people

1600
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:49,440
being their authentic selves so I'm sure there's a bunch of people who live life with compersion

1601
02:43:49,440 --> 02:43:56,640
they probably don't seek public attention also but the that that was yeah if there was any word

1602
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:01,680
that could express what what I've learned from Joe why he's been a really inspiring figure is that

1603
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:12,480
compersion and I wish our world was had a lot more of that because then it I mean my own

1604
02:44:12,480 --> 02:44:19,920
sorry to go in a small tangent but like you're speaking how society should function but I feel

1605
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:26,880
like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life you're going to live a truly

1606
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:31,520
fulfilling life I don't know what the right word to use but that's a really good way to live life

1607
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:37,840
you will also learn what gets in the way of it right and how to work with it that if you wanted

1608
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:42,720
to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential technologies to do that

1609
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:50,000
you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes and this is you know as you

1610
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,760
mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you get stoked on other people doing well and

1611
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:57,360
then they have a similar relationship to you and everyone is in the process of building each other

1612
02:44:57,360 --> 02:45:04,160
up and this is what I would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy

1613
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:10,640
version the healthy version right the the root I believe it's a Latin word that means to strive

1614
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:16,480
together and it's that impulse of becoming where I want to become more but I recognize that there's

1615
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:21,760
actually a hormesis there's a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that but that

1616
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:25,920
means that yes there's an impulse where I'm trying to get ahead maybe I'm even trying to win but I

1617
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:30,720
actually want a good opponent and I want them to get ahead too because that is where my ongoing

1618
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:35,840
becoming happens and the win itself will get boring very quickly the ongoing becoming is

1619
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:40,000
where there's a liveness and for the ongoing becoming they need to have it too and that's

1620
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,600
the strive together the so in the healthy competition I'm stoked when they're doing really

1621
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:49,120
well because my becoming is supported by it now this is actually a very nice segue into

1622
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:57,360
a model I like about what a meaningful human life is if you want to go there

1623
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:07,360
let's go there what I have I have three things I'm going elsewhere with but if we were first

1624
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:14,640
let us take a short stroll through the park of the meaning of life Daniel what is a meaningful life

1625
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:23,120
I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning and the

1626
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:29,760
word purpose almost interchangeably and they'll think kind of what is the meaning of my life what

1627
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:34,000
is the meaning of human life what is the meaning of life what's the meaning of the universe and

1628
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:39,120
what is the meaning of existence rather than non-existence so there's a lot of kind of existential

1629
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:44,240
a lot of kind of existential considerations there and I think there's some cognitive mistakes

1630
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:51,440
that are very easy like taking the idea of purpose which is like a goal which is a utilitarian

1631
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:55,760
concept the purpose of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed

1632
02:46:55,760 --> 02:47:03,280
value and to say what is the purpose of everything well it's a purpose is too small of a question

1633
02:47:03,280 --> 02:47:06,800
it's fundamentally a relative question within everything what is the purpose of one thing

1634
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:09,920
relative to another what is the purpose of everything and there's nothing outside of it

1635
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:16,000
with which to say it you actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose

1636
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,440
it doesn't mean it's purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless it

1637
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:25,920
means the concept is too small which is why you end up getting to you know like in Taoism talking

1638
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:32,480
about the nature of it rather the there's a fundamental what where the why can't go deeper

1639
02:47:32,480 --> 02:47:39,920
is the nature of it but I'm gonna try to speak to a much simpler part which is when people

1640
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:44,800
think about what is a meaningful human life and kind of if we were to optimize for something at

1641
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:50,240
the level of individual life but also how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual

1642
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:58,000
life lead to the best society for insofar as people living that way affects others and long

1643
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:03,520
term the world as a whole and how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think about

1644
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:11,520
these things because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there's value on two

1645
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:20,640
sides individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push harder

1646
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:27,680
and whatever and there's failure modes on both sides and so when you were starting to say okay

1647
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:31,200
individual happiness you're like wait fuck say this can be happy while hurting people it's not

1648
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:35,680
individual happiness it's love but wait some people can self-sacrifice out of love in a way

1649
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:41,840
that actually ends up just creating codependency for everybody or okay so so how do we think about

1650
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:52,000
all those things together one like this kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate

1651
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:58,800
to it is that a meaningful life involves the mode of being the mode of doing and the mode of

1652
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:07,600
becoming and it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes

1653
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:13,920
on their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life the mode of being the way I

1654
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:23,680
would describe it if if we're talking about the essence of it is about taking in and appreciating

1655
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:30,320
the beauty of life that is now it's a mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being

1656
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:36,080
with what is it's fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of

1657
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:42,720
experience the prima facia meaningfulness of when I'm having this experience I'm not actually asking

1658
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:47,600
what the meaning of life is I'm actually full of it I'm full of experiencing it the momentary

1659
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:56,560
experience yes so taking in the beauty of life doing is adding to the beauty of life I'm going

1660
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,000
to produce some art I'm going to produce some technology that will make life easier more

1661
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:06,800
beautiful for somebody else I'm going to do some science that will end up leading to better

1662
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:10,800
insights or others people's ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand

1663
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:14,880
more about it or whatever it is or protect it right I'm going to protect it in some way but

1664
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:20,800
that's adding to or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing and becoming

1665
02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:25,760
is getting better at both of those being able to deepen our being which is to be able to take in

1666
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:32,160
the beauty of life more profoundly be more moved by it touched by it and increasing our capacity

1667
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:41,040
with doing to add to the beauty of life more and so I hold that a meaningful life has to be all

1668
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:48,480
three of those and where they're not in conflict with each other ultimately it grounds in being

1669
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:53,920
it grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness of experience and then my doing is ultimately

1670
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:58,720
something that will be able to increase the possibility of the quality of experience for others

1671
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:05,440
and my becoming is a deepening on those so it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary

1672
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:15,120
possibility of experience and the point is to oscillate between these never getting stuck on

1673
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:22,640
anyone yeah or I suppose in parallel well you can't really attention is a thing you can only allocate

1674
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:32,000
attention I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I'm not thinking about what to do

1675
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:39,520
next yeah and then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn't come from what's in

1676
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:47,600
it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already and then it's like how can I how can

1677
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:52,480
make life better for other people that don't have as much opportunities I had how can I add

1678
02:51:52,480 --> 02:51:59,440
something wonderful how can I just be in the creative process and so I think where the doing

1679
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:04,080
comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness of being it's inherently going to be

1680
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:09,760
paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented to do that than if it comes from some

1681
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:14,000
emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that is willing to cause sacrifices other places

1682
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:20,640
and where a chunk of its attention is internally focused and so when Buddha said desires the cause

1683
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:26,240
of all suffering then later the vow of the bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient

1684
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:34,000
beings in universe forever is a pretty intense thing like desire I would say there's a kind of

1685
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,760
desire if we think of desire as a basis for movement like a flow or a gradient there's a

1686
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:42,880
kind of desire that comes from something missing inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world

1687
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:48,320
that ends up being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering but there's also not just

1688
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:53,520
non-desire there's a kind of desire that comes from feeling full at the beauty of life and wanting

1689
02:52:53,520 --> 02:53:00,000
to add to it that is a flow this direction and I don't think that is the cause of suffering I think

1690
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:05,120
that is you know and the western traditions right the eastern traditions focused on that

1691
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:09,440
and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them in the moment outside of time western

1692
02:53:09,440 --> 02:53:14,000
traditions said no actually desires the source of creativity and we're here to be made in the

1693
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:19,840
image and likeness of the creator we're here to be fundamentally creative but creating from where

1694
02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:24,080
and in service of what creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness and service

1695
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:30,880
of the well-being of all of it is very different which is back to that compassion compersion axis

1696
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:35,200
being doing becoming it's pretty powerful

1697
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:41,760
also could potentially be algorithmatized into a robot just saying

1698
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:45,680
where does um

1699
02:53:49,360 --> 02:53:51,440
where does death come into that

1700
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:59,920
being is forgetting I mean the the the concept of time completely there's a there's a sense to

1701
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:07,920
doing and becoming that has a deadline and built in the urgency built in do you think

1702
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:13,360
death is fundamental to this to a meaningful life uh

1703
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:18,160
acknowledging or um

1704
02:54:20,400 --> 02:54:26,800
feeling the terror of death like Ernest Becker or just acknowledging the uncertainty the mystery the

1705
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:32,480
the melancholy nature of the fact that the ride ends is that part of this equation

1706
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:38,880
or not necessary okay look at how it could be related I've experienced fear of death

1707
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:41,520
I've also experienced

1708
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:49,760
times where I thought I was gonna die it felt extremely peaceful and beautiful and

1709
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:51,520
um

1710
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:59,920
it's funny because if we we can be afraid of death because we're afraid of hell or battery

1711
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:03,520
incarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have or we're projecting

1712
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:07,440
some kind of sentient suffering but if we're afraid of just non-experience

1713
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:13,600
I noticed that every time I stay up late enough that I'm really tired

1714
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:19,760
I'm longing for deep deep sleep and non-experience right like I'm actually longing for experience

1715
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:28,240
to stop and it's not morbid it's not a bummer it's and and I don't mind falling asleep and I

1716
02:55:28,240 --> 02:55:33,920
sometimes when I wake up want to go back into it and then when it's done I'm happy to come out of it

1717
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:35,200
so um

1718
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:44,960
when we think about death and having finite time here and we could talk about if we live for

1719
02:55:44,960 --> 02:55:48,240
a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that it'll still be finite time

1720
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:53,600
the one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start to

1721
02:55:53,600 --> 02:56:02,560
emotionally mature just shortly before they die but there's

1722
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:10,720
if I get to live forever I I can just stay focused on what's in it for me forever

1723
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:20,400
and if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and

1724
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:26,080
adding to it and becoming continues my life doesn't but my life can have effects that continue

1725
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:32,640
well beyond it then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than my life my life gets

1726
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:38,240
to be a part of it and in service to and the whole thing about when old men plant trees the

1727
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:45,040
shade of which they'll never get to be in um I remember the first time I read this poem by

1728
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:52,640
Hafez the the Sufi poet written in like 13th century or something like that and he talked about

1729
02:56:53,680 --> 02:57:00,080
that if you're lonely to think about him and he was kind of leaning his spirit um into years

1730
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:05,520
across the distance of a millennium and would come for you with these poems and he's thinking

1731
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:09,680
about people millennium from now and caring about their experience and what they'd be suffering if

1732
02:57:09,680 --> 02:57:14,800
they'd be lonely and could he offer something that could touch them and it's just fucking beautiful

1733
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:20,560
and so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with something that transcends what's

1734
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:28,080
in it for me and death forces you to that so not not only does death create the urgency it uh

1735
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:36,960
urgency of doing it you're very right it does have a sense in which it uh incentivizes the

1736
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:45,440
compersion and the compassion and the widening you remember Einstein had that quote something to

1737
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:49,040
the effect of it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate

1738
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:56,160
things there's this one thing we call universe and uh something about us being inside of a

1739
02:57:56,160 --> 02:58:02,160
prison of perception that can only you know see a very narrow little bit of it but

1740
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:10,320
but this this might be just some weird disposition of mine but when I think about the future after

1741
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:18,640
I'm dead and I think about consciousness I think about young people falling in love for the first

1742
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:22,720
time in their their experience and I think about people being awed by sunsets and I think about

1743
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:32,480
and I think about all of it right I can't not feel connected to that do you feel some sadness

1744
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:39,040
to the very high likelihood that you will be forgotten completely by all of human history

1745
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:47,840
you Daniel the name that that which cannot be named systems like to self-perpetuate

1746
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:56,480
egos do that the idea that I might do something meaningful that future people appreciate of

1747
02:58:56,480 --> 02:59:02,480
course there's like a certain sweetness to that idea but I know how many people did something

1748
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:07,200
did things that I wouldn't be here without and that my life would be less without whose names

1749
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:14,160
I will never know and I feel a gratitude to them I feel a closeness I feel touched by that and I

1750
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:21,520
think to the degree that the future people are conscious enough there is a you know a lot of

1751
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:25,840
traditions had this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond

1752
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:32,720
the names I think that's a very healthy idea but let me return to a much less beautiful

1753
02:59:32,720 --> 02:59:38,480
and much less pleasant conversation you mentioned prison back to x-risk okay

1754
02:59:38,560 --> 02:59:45,200
and conditioning you mentioned something about the state

1755
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:56,400
so what role let's talk about companies governments parents all the mechanisms that

1756
02:59:56,400 --> 03:00:02,720
can be a source of conditioning which flavor of ice cream do you like do you think the state

1757
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:08,480
is the right thing for the future so governments that are elected democratic systems that are

1758
03:00:08,480 --> 03:00:16,000
representing representative democracy is there some kind of political system of governance

1759
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:24,240
that you find appealing is it parents meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that's

1760
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:32,400
the most essential and then you and michael malice would happily agree that it's anarchy

1761
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:39,440
where the state should be dissolved or destroyed or burned to the ground if you're michael malice

1762
03:00:39,440 --> 03:00:49,360
giggling holding the torch as the fire burns so which which is it is the state can the state be good

1763
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:58,800
or is the state bad for the condition of a beautiful world a or b this is like an sd test

1764
03:00:58,800 --> 03:01:05,760
you like to give these simplified good or bad things um would i like the state that we live in

1765
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:10,560
currently the united states federal government to stop existing today no i would really not like

1766
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:17,840
that um i think that would be not quite bad for the world in a lot of ways uh do i think that it's a

1767
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:24,160
optimal social system and maximally just and humane and all those things and i wanted to

1768
03:01:24,160 --> 03:01:29,920
continue as is no also not that um but i am much more interested in it being able to evolve to a

1769
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:37,280
better thing without going through um the catastrophe phase that i think it's just non-existence would

1770
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:45,760
give so what size of state is good in a sense like do we should be as a human society as this

1771
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:52,080
world becomes more globalized should we be constantly striving to reduce the we can we can

1772
03:01:52,080 --> 03:02:00,160
put on a map like right now literally like the the the centers of power in the world some of them

1773
03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:05,760
are tech companies some of them are governments should we be trying to as much as possible

1774
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:12,880
decentralize the power to where it's very difficult to point on the map the centers of power and that

1775
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:19,760
means making the state however there's a bunch of different ways to make the government much smaller

1776
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:28,480
that could be reducing in the united states reducing the the funding for the government

1777
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:33,840
all those kinds of things there's a set of responsibilities the the set of powers it could be

1778
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:41,920
i mean this is far out but making more nations or maybe nations not in a space that are

1779
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:47,200
defined by geographic location but rather in the space of ideas which is what anarchy is about

1780
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:53,040
so anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set of ideas and doing so dynamically not

1781
03:02:53,040 --> 03:03:00,720
based on where you were born and so on i think we can say that the natural state of humans if we

1782
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:07,600
want to describe such a thing was to live in tribes that were below the dunbar number

1783
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:14,720
meaning that for a few hundred thousand years of human history all of the groups of humans mostly

1784
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:19,520
stayed under that size and whenever we'd get up to that size it would end up cleaving and so it seems

1785
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:23,840
like there's a pretty strong but there weren't individual humans out in the wild doing really

1786
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:28,560
well right so we were a group animal but with groups that had a specific size so we could say

1787
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:33,040
in a way humans were being domesticated by those groups they were learning how to have

1788
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:37,200
certain rules to participate with the group without which you'd get kicked out but that

1789
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:43,520
that's still the wild state of people and and maybe it's useful to do as a side statement

1790
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:48,720
which i've recently looked at a bunch of papers around Dunbar's number where the mean is actually

1791
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:54,000
150 if you actually look at the original paper it's a range it's really a range so it's actually

1792
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:58,880
some somewhere under a thousand so it's a range of like two to five hundred or whatever it is

1793
03:03:58,960 --> 03:04:05,760
but like you could argue that the i think it actually is exactly to two the range is two to

1794
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:12,320
five hundred and twenty something like that and this is the mean that's taken crudely it's not a

1795
03:04:12,320 --> 03:04:19,680
very good paper the in terms of the actual numerical numerically speaking but it'd be

1796
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:25,600
interesting if there's a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for particular environments

1797
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:30,720
particular conditions so on it is very true that they're likely to be something small you know

1798
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:36,400
under a million but it'd be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will

1799
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:40,080
change the fabric of this conversation i just want to kind of throw that in there i don't know

1800
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:44,720
the if the 150 is baked in somehow in the heart into the hardware we can talk about some of the

1801
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:50,640
things that it probably has to do with up to a certain number of people and this is going to

1802
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:55,280
be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to some degree we can talk about that

1803
03:04:55,600 --> 03:05:03,600
in a minute up to a certain number of people everybody can know everybody else pretty intimately

1804
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:07,760
so let's go ahead and just take 150 as a as an average number

1805
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:18,720
everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly

1806
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:23,040
it's your extended family and you're stuck living with them and you know who they are and there's

1807
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:30,800
no anonymous people there's no just them and over there and that's one part of what leads to a

1808
03:05:30,800 --> 03:05:34,080
kind of tribal process where it's good for the individual and good for the whole has a coupling

1809
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:41,280
also below that scale everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing there's not

1810
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:47,760
groups that are very siloed and as a result it's actually very hard to get away with bad behavior

1811
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:52,560
there's a forced kind of transparency and so you don't need kind of like the state

1812
03:05:53,680 --> 03:05:58,960
in in that way but lying to people doesn't actually get you ahead sociopathic behavior

1813
03:05:58,960 --> 03:06:05,680
doesn't get you ahead because it gets seen and so there's a conditioning environment where the

1814
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:10,320
individuals behaving in a way that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned

1815
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:17,200
when it gets to be a much larger system it becomes easier to hide certain things from the

1816
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:21,360
group as a whole as well as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people

1817
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:28,400
I would say there's also a communication protocol where up to about that number of people

1818
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:34,000
we could all sit around a tribal council and be part of a conversation around a really big decision

1819
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:38,880
do we migrate do we not migrate do we you know some something like that do we get rid of this person

1820
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:47,600
and why why would I want to agree to be a part of a larger group where everyone can't be part of

1821
03:06:47,600 --> 03:06:54,320
that council and so I am going to now be subject to law that I have no say in if I could be part

1822
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:58,160
of a smaller group that could still survive and I get a say in the law that I'm subject to so I

1823
03:06:58,160 --> 03:07:03,440
think the cleaving and in a way we can look at it beyond the Dunbar number two is we can look at

1824
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:08,800
that a civilization has binding energy that is holding them together and has cleaving energy and

1825
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:13,600
if the binding energy exceeds the cleaving energy that civilization will last and so there are things

1826
03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:17,280
that we can do to decrease the cleaving energy within the society things we can do to increase

1827
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:21,840
the binding energy I think naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size

1828
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:28,240
kind of tribalism that ended with a few things it ended with people having migrated enough that

1829
03:07:28,240 --> 03:07:34,080
when you started to get resource wars you couldn't just migrate away easily and so tribal warfare

1830
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:39,360
became more obligated it involved the plow in the beginning of real economic surplus there were

1831
03:07:39,360 --> 03:07:47,280
so there were a few different kind of um forcing functions but we're talking about what size should

1832
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:53,520
it be right what size should a society be and I think the idea like if we think about your body

1833
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:59,120
for a moment as a self-organizing complex system that is multi-scaled we think about body is a

1834
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:07,440
wonderland our body is a wonderland yeah uh you have you that's a john mayer song I apologize

1835
03:08:07,440 --> 03:08:12,880
but yes so if we think about our our body and the billions of cells that are in it well you don't

1836
03:08:12,880 --> 03:08:18,320
have like think about how ridiculous it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells

1837
03:08:18,320 --> 03:08:24,480
in it with no internal organization structure right just like a sea of protoplasm it would work your

1838
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:31,760
democracy and so you have cells and tissues and then you have tissues and organs and organs and

1839
03:08:31,760 --> 03:08:36,320
organ systems and so you have these layers of organization and then obviously the individual

1840
03:08:36,320 --> 03:08:43,440
in a tribe in a ecosystem and each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers but

1841
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:48,800
also influencing them I think the future of civilization will be similar which is there's

1842
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:53,680
a level of governance that happens at the level of the individual my own governance of my own choice

1843
03:08:54,480 --> 03:08:59,040
I think there's a level that happens at the level of a family we're making decisions together

1844
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:04,080
we're inter influencing each other and affecting each other taking responsibility for the idea of

1845
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:07,920
an extended family and you can see that like for a lot of human history we had an extended family

1846
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:12,640
we had a local community a local church or whatever it was we had these intermediate structures

1847
03:09:13,280 --> 03:09:19,040
whereas right now there's kind of like the individual producer consumer taxpayer voter

1848
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:24,240
and the massive nation state global complex and not that much in the way of intermediate

1849
03:09:24,240 --> 03:09:28,240
structures that we relate with and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics all

1850
03:09:28,240 --> 03:09:38,080
impersonalized made fungible and so I think that we have to have global governance meaning

1851
03:09:38,080 --> 03:09:42,480
I think we have to have governance at the scale we affect stuff and if if anybody is messing up

1852
03:09:42,480 --> 03:09:46,880
the oceans that matters for everybody so that that can't only be national or only local

1853
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:51,200
everyone is scared of the idea of global governance because we think about some top

1854
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:55,840
down system of imposition that now has no checks and balances on power I'm scared of that same

1855
03:09:55,840 --> 03:10:00,880
version so I'm not talking about that kind of global governance it's why I'm even using the

1856
03:10:00,880 --> 03:10:08,320
word governance as a process rather than government as an imposed phenomena and so I think we have to

1857
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:12,000
have global governance but I think we also have to have local governance and there has to be

1858
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:17,760
relationships between them that each where there are both checks and balances and power flows of

1859
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:24,320
information so I think governance at the level of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than

1860
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:30,160
governance at the level of nation states because I think nation states are largely fictitious things

1861
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:36,000
that are defined by wars and agreements to stop wars and like that I think cities are based on

1862
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:40,800
real things will keep being real where the proximity of certain things together the physical

1863
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:46,160
proximity of things together gives increased value of those things so you look at like Jeffrey West's

1864
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:51,760
work on scale and finding that companies and nation states and things that have a kind of

1865
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:57,200
complicated agreement structure get diminishing return of production per capita as the total

1866
03:10:57,200 --> 03:11:01,200
number of people increases beyond about the tribal scale but the city actually gets increasing

1867
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:06,800
productivity per capita but it's not designed it's kind of this organic thing right so there

1868
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:10,560
should be governance at the level of cities because people can sense and actually have some

1869
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:15,440
agency there probably neighborhoods and smaller scales within it and also verticals and some of

1870
03:11:15,440 --> 03:11:19,520
it won't be geographic it'll be network based right networks of affinities so I don't think the

1871
03:11:19,520 --> 03:11:25,840
future is one type of governance now what we can say more broadly is say when we're talking about

1872
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:30,240
groups of people that inter-effect each other the idea of a civilization is that we can figure out

1873
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:35,920
how to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with each other and hopefully increase total

1874
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:41,040
productive capacity in a way that's good for everybody division of labor and specialties

1875
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:47,280
so we all get more better stuff and whatever but it's a it's a coordination of our choice making

1876
03:11:49,680 --> 03:11:55,280
I think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not having enough coordination of

1877
03:11:55,280 --> 03:11:59,120
choice making so they fail on the side of chaos and then they cleave and an internal war comes

1878
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:05,760
about or whatever or they can't make smart decisions and they overuse their resources or whatever

1879
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:14,640
it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition via force and so it fails on the

1880
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:21,440
side of oppression which ends up being for a while functional ish for the thing as a whole but

1881
03:12:21,440 --> 03:12:26,000
miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of revolt or because it can't

1882
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:31,840
innovate enough or something like that and so there's this like toggling between order via

1883
03:12:31,840 --> 03:12:38,640
oppression and chaos and I think the idea of democracy not the way we've implemented it but

1884
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:42,960
the idea of it whether we're talking about a representative democracy or a direct digital

1885
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:49,520
democracy liquid democracy republic or whatever the idea of an open society participatory governance

1886
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:56,880
is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren't stuck with chaos

1887
03:12:57,680 --> 03:13:02,240
and infighting and inability to coordinate and we're also not stuck with oppression

1888
03:13:03,360 --> 03:13:10,640
and what would it take to have emergent order this is the most kind of central question for me

1889
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:18,400
these days because if we look at what different nation states are doing around the world and

1890
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:24,560
we see nation states that are more authoritarian that in some ways are actually coordinating

1891
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:32,320
much more effectively so for instance we can see that China has built high-speed rail not just

1892
03:13:32,320 --> 03:13:36,640
through its country but around the world and the US hasn't built any high-speed rail yet

1893
03:13:36,640 --> 03:13:41,360
you can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we've had increasing

1894
03:13:41,360 --> 03:13:48,400
economic inequality happening you can see like that if there was a single country that could make

1895
03:13:48,400 --> 03:13:53,040
all of its own stuff if the global supply chains failed China would be the closest one to being able

1896
03:13:53,040 --> 03:14:01,520
to start to go closed loop on fundamental things uh belt and road initiative supply chain on rare

1897
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:06,640
earth metals transistor manufacturing that is like oh they're actually coordinating more effectively

1898
03:14:06,640 --> 03:14:14,960
in some important ways in the last call at 30 years and that's imposed order imposed order

1899
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:22,400
and we can see that if in the US if let's look at why real quick

1900
03:14:24,480 --> 03:14:29,360
we know why we created term limits so that we wouldn't have forever monarchs that's the thing

1901
03:14:29,360 --> 03:14:33,280
we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances on power and that

1902
03:14:33,280 --> 03:14:38,000
kind of thing but that also has created a negative second order effect which is nobody

1903
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:42,960
does long-term planning because somebody comes in who's got four years they want re-elected

1904
03:14:42,960 --> 03:14:46,640
they don't do anything that doesn't create a return within four years that will end up getting

1905
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:52,480
them elected re-elected and so the 30-year industrial development to build high-speed trains or

1906
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:58,320
the new kind of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn't get invested in and then if you have

1907
03:14:58,320 --> 03:15:03,600
left versus right where whatever someone does for four years then the other guy gets in and

1908
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:08,560
undoes it for four years and most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other this

1909
03:15:08,560 --> 03:15:13,280
system is just dissipating as heat right like it's just burning up as heat and the system that

1910
03:15:13,280 --> 03:15:17,360
has no term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they got rid of those people

1911
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:26,720
can actually coordinate better but I would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic

1912
03:15:26,720 --> 03:15:32,080
properties that are not the thing we want so the goal is to accomplish to create a system that does

1913
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:38,800
long-term planning without the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there for the

1914
03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:52,640
long term and accomplish that through not through the imposition of a single leader but through

1915
03:15:53,360 --> 03:16:00,960
emergent so doesn't that perhaps first of all the technology in itself seems to maybe

1916
03:16:00,960 --> 03:16:08,240
maybe disagree a lot for different possibilities here which is make primary the system not the humans

1917
03:16:08,240 --> 03:16:18,320
so the the the basic the medium on which the democracy happens like like a platform

1918
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:26,640
or where people can make decisions do the choice making the coordination of the choice making

1919
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:33,760
where emerges some kind of order to where like something that applies at the scale of the family

1920
03:16:33,760 --> 03:16:41,680
the extended family the city the the country the the continent the whole world and then

1921
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:46,480
does that so dynamically constantly changing based on the needs of the people sort of always

1922
03:16:46,480 --> 03:16:55,680
evolving and it would all be owned by google like doesn't the doesn't this is there a way to

1923
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:02,320
so first of all you optimistic that you could basically create the technology can save us

1924
03:17:02,320 --> 03:17:07,840
technology at creating platforms by technology I mean like software and network platforms

1925
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:15,600
that allows humans to deliberate like make government together dynamically without the need

1926
03:17:15,680 --> 03:17:22,640
for a leader that's on a podium screaming stuff that's one and two if you're optimistic about that

1927
03:17:23,200 --> 03:17:31,600
are you also optimistic about the CEOs of such platforms the idea that technology is values

1928
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:38,160
neutral values agnostic it and people can use it for constructive or destructive purposes but it

1929
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:46,240
doesn't predispose anything it's just it's just silly naive technology elicits patterns of human

1930
03:17:46,240 --> 03:17:50,800
behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead end up behaving differently because of their

1931
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:55,760
utilization of it and then other people then they end up shaping the world or other people race to

1932
03:17:55,760 --> 03:18:01,280
also get the power of the technology and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the

1933
03:18:01,280 --> 03:18:04,720
effect on social systems and the minds of people of the change in our tooling

1934
03:18:05,680 --> 03:18:10,240
Marvin Harris's work called cultural materialism looked at this deeply obviously Marshall McLuhan

1935
03:18:10,240 --> 03:18:14,320
looked specifically at the way that information technologies change the nature of our beliefs

1936
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:22,800
minds values social systems I will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics will

1937
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:28,240
disagree on the subtle details but I'll do it kind of like illustratively you think about the

1938
03:18:28,240 --> 03:18:32,320
emergence of the plow the ox drawn plow in the beginning of agriculture that came with it or

1939
03:18:32,400 --> 03:18:37,840
before that you had hunter gather and then you had horticulture kind of a digging stick but not

1940
03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:43,440
the plow well that the world changed a lot with that right and and

1941
03:18:46,640 --> 03:18:54,800
a few of the changes that at least some theorists believe in is when the ox drawn plow started

1942
03:18:54,800 --> 03:18:58,880
to proliferate any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually cultivate grain because

1943
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:02,000
just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it to matter grain was a

1944
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,880
storable caloric surplus they could make it through the famines they could grow their

1945
03:19:04,880 --> 03:19:09,120
population so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate and everybody

1946
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:16,080
used it that corresponding with the use of a plow animism went away everywhere that it existed

1947
03:19:16,080 --> 03:19:20,320
because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while beating the cow all day long to

1948
03:19:20,320 --> 03:19:25,280
pull a plow so the moment that we do animal husbandry of that kind we have to beat the cow

1949
03:19:25,280 --> 03:19:29,520
all day you have to say it's just a dumb animal man has dominion over earth and the nature of even

1950
03:19:29,520 --> 03:19:34,960
our religious and spiritual ideas change you went from women primarily using the digging stick to

1951
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:39,840
do the horticulture or gathering before that men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the

1952
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:43,600
plow because the upper body strength actually really mattered women would have miscarriages when

1953
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:47,920
they would do it when they were pregnant so all the caloric supply started to come from men where

1954
03:19:47,920 --> 03:19:52,880
it had been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods

1955
03:19:52,880 --> 03:20:01,200
following that obviously we went from very that particular line of thought then also says that

1956
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:09,840
feminism followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism in the west started to follow women

1957
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:15,440
being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential

1958
03:20:15,440 --> 03:20:21,920
once the internal combustion engine was much stronger and we can drive a tractor so I don't

1959
03:20:21,920 --> 03:20:26,880
think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea so I think this is a reductionist

1960
03:20:26,880 --> 03:20:35,040
view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values agnostic is silly technology

1961
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:40,160
codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior and believing in them

1962
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:44,240
that the plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene right it was the beginning of us

1963
03:20:44,240 --> 03:20:49,360
changing the environment radically to to clear cut areas to just make them useful for people which

1964
03:20:49,360 --> 03:20:54,560
also meant the change of the view of where the the web of life were just a part of it etc so

1965
03:20:54,560 --> 03:21:02,480
all those types of things um so that's brilliantly put but by the way that was just brilliant but

1966
03:21:02,480 --> 03:21:08,720
the question is so it's not agnostic but so we have to look at what the psychological effects of

1967
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:15,360
specific tech applied certain ways are and be able to say it's not just doing the first order thing

1968
03:21:15,360 --> 03:21:22,400
you intended it's doing like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal

1969
03:21:22,400 --> 03:21:26,400
culture in the beginning of empire and the class systems that came with that not like we can go on

1970
03:21:26,400 --> 03:21:31,360
and on about what the plow did the beginning of surplus was inheritance which then became the

1971
03:21:31,360 --> 03:21:38,000
capital model and like lots of things so we have to say when we're looking at the tech how is what

1972
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:43,120
are the values built into the way the tech is being built that are not obvious right so you

1973
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:46,480
always have to consider externalities yes this is no matter what and the externalities are not

1974
03:21:46,480 --> 03:21:49,760
just physical to the environment they're also to how the people are being conditioned and

1975
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:53,920
how the relationality between them is being conditioned question i'm asking you so i personally

1976
03:21:53,920 --> 03:22:00,160
would rather be led by a plow and a tractor than stalling okay that's the question i'm asking you

1977
03:22:00,160 --> 03:22:09,200
is uh in creating an emergent government where people where there's a democracy that's dynamic

1978
03:22:09,200 --> 03:22:19,200
that makes choices that does governance at at like a very kind of liquid like uh there's a

1979
03:22:19,200 --> 03:22:26,480
bunch of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales right and

1980
03:22:26,480 --> 03:22:33,760
doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate and impose rule

1981
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:41,360
okay that's the stalling version i'm saying isn't there the uh the isn't the alternative

1982
03:22:41,360 --> 03:22:50,080
that's emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and the tractor which is the modern

1983
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:56,640
version of that is like the internet the the digital space where we can the monetary system

1984
03:22:56,640 --> 03:23:01,760
where you have the current currency and so on but you have much more importantly to me at least

1985
03:23:01,760 --> 03:23:06,080
is just basic social interaction the mechanisms of human transacting with each other in this

1986
03:23:06,080 --> 03:23:13,200
base of ideas isn't so yes it's not agnostic definitely not agnostic you've had a brilliant

1987
03:23:13,200 --> 03:23:18,480
rant there the tractor has effects but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system

1988
03:23:19,360 --> 03:23:22,560
of governance yes but i wouldn't say we're on track

1989
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:30,400
you haven't seen anything promising but it's not that i haven't seen anything promising

1990
03:23:30,400 --> 03:23:34,240
is that to be on track requires understanding and guiding some of the things differently than

1991
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:38,800
is currently happening and it's possible that's actually what i really care about so

1992
03:23:41,920 --> 03:23:47,040
you couldn't have had a stall in without having certain technologies emerge he couldn't have ruled

1993
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:52,880
such a big area without transportation technologies without the train without the uh

1994
03:23:52,880 --> 03:23:58,720
communication tech that made it possible so when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow than

1995
03:23:58,720 --> 03:24:06,000
a stall and there's a relationship between them that is more recursive which is new physical

1996
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:13,840
technologies allow rulers to rule with more power over larger distances historically and

1997
03:24:16,480 --> 03:24:21,040
but some things are more responsible for that than others like stalling also eats

1998
03:24:21,040 --> 03:24:25,760
stuff for breakfast but the thing he ate for breakfast is less responsible for the starvation

1999
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:30,720
of millions than than the train the train is more responsible for that and then the

2000
03:24:30,720 --> 03:24:36,240
weapons of war are more responsible so some technology like let's not throw it all in the

2001
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:42,400
you're saying like technology has a responsibility here but some is better than others i'm saying

2002
03:24:42,400 --> 03:24:48,240
that people's use of technology will change their behavior so it has behavioral dispositions built

2003
03:24:48,240 --> 03:24:53,360
in the change of the behavior will also change the values in the society it's very complicated

2004
03:24:53,360 --> 03:24:58,640
it will also as a result both make people who have different kinds of predispositions with

2005
03:24:58,640 --> 03:25:04,880
regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities and so we have to think about these

2006
03:25:04,880 --> 03:25:11,760
things it's kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism

2007
03:25:11,760 --> 03:25:18,320
ended feudalism and created kind of nation states so one thing i would say as a long trend

2008
03:25:19,120 --> 03:25:25,280
that we can look at is that whenever there is a step function a major leap in technology physical

2009
03:25:25,280 --> 03:25:31,920
technology the the underlying techno industrial base with which we do stuff it ends up coding for

2010
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:37,040
it ends up predisposing a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social

2011
03:25:37,040 --> 03:25:42,800
system what had not emerged to try to solve and so it usually ends up breaking the previous social

2012
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:46,720
systems the way the plow broke the tribal system the way that the industrial revolution broke the

2013
03:25:46,720 --> 03:25:52,960
feudal system and then new social systems have to emerge that can deal with that the new powers the

2014
03:25:52,960 --> 03:25:58,160
new dispositions whatever with that tech obviously the nuke broke nation state governance being

2015
03:25:58,160 --> 03:26:03,840
adequate and said we can't ever have that again so then it created this in international governance

2016
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:20,960
apparatus world so i guess what i'm saying is that the solution is not exponential tech following

2017
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:26,000
the current path of what the market incentivizes exponential tech to do market being a previous

2018
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:38,720
social tech i would say that exponential tech if we look at different types of social tech so let's

2019
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:47,120
just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing right at least that's

2020
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:57,360
the story and which is and this is why if you look at this important part to build first it's

2021
03:26:57,360 --> 03:27:02,880
kind of doing it it's just doing it poorly you're saying i mean that's it is emergent order in some

2022
03:27:02,880 --> 03:27:07,920
sense i mean that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government correct i mean i i said

2023
03:27:07,920 --> 03:27:12,320
at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves early on it doesn't do it

2024
03:27:12,320 --> 03:27:19,680
for all classes equally etc but the the idea of democracy is that is participatory governance

2025
03:27:20,400 --> 03:27:26,320
and so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the european enlightenment and

2026
03:27:26,320 --> 03:27:31,680
specifically because the idea that a lot of people some huge number not a tribal number a huge number

2027
03:27:31,680 --> 03:27:36,480
of anonymous people who don't know each other are not bonded to each other who believe different

2028
03:27:36,480 --> 03:27:40,480
things who grew up in different ways can all work together to make collective decisions well

2029
03:27:40,480 --> 03:27:44,320
that affect everybody and where some of them will make compromises and the thing that matters to

2030
03:27:44,320 --> 03:27:49,040
them for what matters to other strangers that's actually wild like it's a wild idea that that

2031
03:27:49,040 --> 03:27:55,840
would even be possible and it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we

2032
03:27:55,840 --> 03:28:03,360
could all do the philosophy of science and we could all do the hegelian dialectic those ideas

2033
03:28:03,360 --> 03:28:11,120
had emerged right and it was that we we could all so our choice making because we said a society is

2034
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:14,880
trying to coordinate choice making the emergent order is the order of our of the choices that

2035
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:18,160
we're making not just at the level of the individuals but what groups of individuals

2036
03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:24,080
corporations nation states whatever do um our choices are based on our choice making is based

2037
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:28,320
on our sense making and our meaning making our sense making is what do we believe is happening

2038
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:31,840
in the world and what do we believe the effects of a particular thing would be our meaning

2039
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:34,880
making is what do we care about right our values generation what do we care about that

2040
03:28:34,880 --> 03:28:39,120
we're trying to move the world in the direction of if you ultimately are trying to move the world

2041
03:28:39,120 --> 03:28:43,200
in a direction that is really really different than the direction i'm trying to we have very

2042
03:28:43,200 --> 03:28:48,080
different values we're gonna have a hard time and if you think the world is a very different world

2043
03:28:48,080 --> 03:28:54,080
right if you think that systemic racism is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems

2044
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:59,040
and i think it's not even a thing if you think climate change is almost existential and i think

2045
03:28:59,040 --> 03:29:03,920
it's not even a thing we're gonna have a really hard time coordinating and so we have to be able

2046
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:09,680
to have shared sense making of can we come to understand just what is happening together

2047
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:14,480
and then can we do shared values generation okay maybe i'm emphasizing a particular value

2048
03:29:14,480 --> 03:29:18,400
more than you but i can see how i can take your perspective and i can see how the thing that you

2049
03:29:18,400 --> 03:29:23,280
value is worth valuing and i can see how it's affected by this thing so can we take all the

2050
03:29:23,280 --> 03:29:27,920
values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all of them better than the proposition

2051
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:32,320
i created just to benefit these ones that harms the ones that you care about which is why you're

2052
03:29:32,320 --> 03:29:37,440
opposing my proposition yeah we don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently

2053
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:42,800
to see and this is the reason that the proposition when we vote on it gets half the vote almost all

2054
03:29:42,800 --> 03:29:47,760
the time it almost never gets 90% of the votes is because it benefits some things and harms other

2055
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:53,040
things we can say all theory of trade-offs but we didn't even try to say could we see what everybody

2056
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:59,360
cares about and see if there is a better solution so how do we fix that try i i wonder is it is it

2057
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:05,920
as simple as the social technology education well no it's that the proposition crafting and

2058
03:30:05,920 --> 03:30:11,760
refinement process has to be key to a democracy or part of the government and it's not currently

2059
03:30:11,760 --> 03:30:19,040
but it's the isn't that the humans creating that situation so one way there's two ways to fix that

2060
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:23,600
one is to fix the individual humans which is the education early in life

2061
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:30,240
and the second is to create somehow systems that yeah it's both so i understand the education part

2062
03:30:30,240 --> 03:30:34,800
but creating systems that's why that's why i mentioned the technologies is creating

2063
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:39,040
yes social networks essentially yes that's actually necessary okay so let's go to the first part and

2064
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:45,840
then we'll come to the second part so democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we

2065
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:52,480
could all do a dialectic and come to understand what other people valued and so that we could

2066
03:30:52,480 --> 03:30:58,800
actually come up with a cooperative solution rather than just fuck you we're gonna get our

2067
03:30:58,800 --> 03:31:02,640
thing in war right and that we could sense make together we could all apply the philosophy of

2068
03:31:02,640 --> 03:31:06,720
science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on what the speed of sound is if we measured it

2069
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:10,800
and we found out what it was and there's a unifying element to the objectivity in that way

2070
03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:17,200
and so this is why i believe jefferson said if you could give me a perfect newspaper and a

2071
03:31:17,200 --> 03:31:21,360
broken government or in paraphrasing or broken government perfect newspaper i wouldn't hesitate

2072
03:31:21,360 --> 03:31:24,800
to take the perfect newspaper because if the people understand what's going on they can make

2073
03:31:24,800 --> 03:31:28,320
build a new government if they don't understand what's going on they can't possibly make good

2074
03:31:28,320 --> 03:31:35,840
choices and um washington i'm paraphrasing again first president said the number one aim of the

2075
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:40,160
federal government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of

2076
03:31:40,240 --> 03:31:44,080
government science of government was the term of art think about what that means right science of

2077
03:31:44,080 --> 03:31:50,400
government would be game theory coordination theory history it wouldn't call game theory yet

2078
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:56,480
history sociology economics right all the things that lead to how we understand human coordination

2079
03:31:57,200 --> 03:32:02,320
i think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government is rule

2080
03:32:02,320 --> 03:32:08,400
of law and he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies because if the number one

2081
03:32:08,400 --> 03:32:12,640
aim was to protect the border from enemies it could do that as military dictatorship

2082
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:18,640
quite effectively and if the goal was rule of law it could do it as a dictatorship as a police

2083
03:32:18,640 --> 03:32:24,960
state and so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of all

2084
03:32:24,960 --> 03:32:29,600
the citizens in the science of government it won't stay democracy long you can see so both

2085
03:32:29,600 --> 03:32:34,480
education and the fourth estate the fourth estate being the so education can i make sense of the

2086
03:32:34,480 --> 03:32:38,160
world am i trained to make sense of the world the fourth estate is what's actually going on currently

2087
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:43,200
the news do i have good unbiased information about it those are both considered prerequisite

2088
03:32:43,200 --> 03:32:48,800
institutions for democracy to even be a possibility and then at the scale it was initially suggested

2089
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:54,800
here the town hall was the key phenomena where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a

2090
03:32:54,800 --> 03:32:58,800
proposition and the first thing i ever saw was the proposition to know anything about it and i

2091
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:02,880
got a vote yes or no it was in the town hall we all got to talk about it and the proposition could

2092
03:33:02,880 --> 03:33:07,920
get crafted in real time through the conversation which is why there was that founding father's

2093
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:12,560
statement that that voting is the death of democracy voting fundamentally is polarizing the

2094
03:33:12,560 --> 03:33:17,680
population in some kind of sublimated war but the and we'll do that as the last step but what we

2095
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:21,920
want to do first is to say how does the thing that you care about that seems damaged by this

2096
03:33:21,920 --> 03:33:27,120
proposition how could that turn into a solution to make this proposition better where this proposition

2097
03:33:27,120 --> 03:33:30,960
still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to that better can we work on this together

2098
03:33:30,960 --> 03:33:35,840
and that in a town hall we could have that as the scale increased we lost the ability to do that

2099
03:33:35,840 --> 03:33:40,240
now as you mentioned the internet could change that the fact that we had representatives that

2100
03:33:40,240 --> 03:33:45,200
had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do that we

2101
03:33:45,200 --> 03:33:51,520
stopped having this kind of developmental um propositional development process when the town

2102
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:57,760
hall ended the fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between

2103
03:33:57,760 --> 03:34:07,520
insane and aligned with class interests i would push back to say that the internet has those things

2104
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:12,880
it just has a lot of other things i feel like the internet has places where that encouraged

2105
03:34:12,880 --> 03:34:20,640
synthesis of competing ideas and sense making which is what we're talking about is just that it's

2106
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:26,400
also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing it under current incentives

2107
03:34:26,400 --> 03:34:33,280
perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market is the linux is awesome right and wikipedia and

2108
03:34:33,280 --> 03:34:38,400
places where you have and they have problems but places where you have open source sharing of

2109
03:34:38,400 --> 03:34:43,280
information vetting of information towards collective building is that building something like

2110
03:34:44,080 --> 03:34:50,240
like how much has that affected our court systems or our policing systems or our military systems

2111
03:34:50,400 --> 03:34:56,160
first of all i think a lot but not not enough i i think that's something i told you offline yesterday

2112
03:34:56,160 --> 03:35:03,200
is uh perhaps there's a whole nother discussion but i i don't think we're quite quantifying the

2113
03:35:03,200 --> 03:35:10,720
impact on the world the positive impact of wikipedia you said the policing that i mean i just i just

2114
03:35:10,720 --> 03:35:21,920
think the amount of empathy that what could like knowledge i think can't help but lead to empathy

2115
03:35:22,800 --> 03:35:28,560
just knowing okay just knowing okay i'll i'll give you some pieces of information

2116
03:35:28,560 --> 03:35:33,200
knowing how many people died in various awards that already that delta when you have millions

2117
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:38,800
of people have that knowledge it's like it's a little like slap in the face like oh like

2118
03:35:39,600 --> 03:35:45,040
my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people

2119
03:35:45,040 --> 03:35:50,400
were tortured you know like just a little bit and when a lot of people know that because of wikipedia

2120
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:57,120
or the effect their second order effect of wikipedia which is it's not that necessarily

2121
03:35:57,120 --> 03:36:06,160
people read wikipedia it's like youtubers who don't really know stuff that well will thoroughly

2122
03:36:06,160 --> 03:36:11,200
read a wikipedia article and create a compelling video describing that wikipedia article that then

2123
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:16,720
millions of people watch and they understand that holy shit a lot of there was such first of all

2124
03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:22,240
there was such a thing as world war two and world war one okay like they can at least like learn about

2125
03:36:22,240 --> 03:36:27,600
it they can learn about this was like recent they can learn about slavery they can learn about all

2126
03:36:27,600 --> 03:36:34,560
kinds of injustices in the world and that i think has a lot of effects to our to the way

2127
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:41,200
whether you're a police officer a lawyer a judge in the jury or just a regular

2128
03:36:42,320 --> 03:36:50,000
civilian citizen the way you approach the every other communication you engage in

2129
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:54,080
even if the system of that communication is very much flawed so i think there's a huge

2130
03:36:54,080 --> 03:36:58,720
positive effect on wikipedia that's my case for wikipedia so you should donate to wikipedia

2131
03:36:59,520 --> 03:37:07,040
i'm a huge fan but there's very few systems like it which is sad to me so i think it's it would be a

2132
03:37:07,040 --> 03:37:16,800
useful exercise for any listener of the show to really try to run the dialectical synthesis process

2133
03:37:16,800 --> 03:37:27,280
with regard to a topic like this and take the techno concern perspective with regard to

2134
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:33,920
information tech that folks like tristan harris take and say what are all of the things that

2135
03:37:33,920 --> 03:37:39,040
are getting worse and what and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much

2136
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:47,200
worse how quickly could that be and then and do that fully without mitigating it then take

2137
03:37:47,200 --> 03:37:52,400
the techno optimist perspective and see what things are getting better in a way that curse well

2138
03:37:52,400 --> 03:37:58,160
or diamondus or someone might do and try to take that perspective fully and say are some of those

2139
03:37:58,160 --> 03:38:02,000
things exponential what what could that portend and then try to hold all that at the same time

2140
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:11,520
and i think there are ways in which depending upon the metrics we're looking at things are getting

2141
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:15,680
worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different metrics at the

2142
03:38:15,680 --> 03:38:21,920
same time which which i hold is the destabilization of previous system and either an emergence to a

2143
03:38:21,920 --> 03:38:30,320
better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible and so i want my optimism not to be

2144
03:38:30,320 --> 03:38:35,680
about my assessment i want my assessment to be just as fucking clear as it can be i want my

2145
03:38:35,680 --> 03:38:43,040
optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that clear assessment so i never i never want

2146
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:48,800
to apply optimism in the sense making right i want to just try to be clear if anything i want to make

2147
03:38:48,800 --> 03:38:54,720
sure that the challenges are really well understood but that's in service of an optimism that

2148
03:38:56,240 --> 03:39:00,640
there are good potentials even if i don't know what they are that are worth seeking right there's

2149
03:39:00,640 --> 03:39:05,600
kind of a there is a some sense of optimism that's required to even try to innovate really hard

2150
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:12,320
problems but then i want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see is that solution

2151
03:39:12,320 --> 03:39:16,800
not going to work does it have second order effects and then not get not get upset by that

2152
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:21,680
because i then come back to how to make it better so that just a relationship between optimism and

2153
03:39:21,680 --> 03:39:28,720
pessimism and the dialectic of how they how they can work so when i of course we can say that wikipedia

2154
03:39:28,720 --> 03:39:36,400
is a pretty awesome example of a thing we can look at the places where it has limits or has failed

2155
03:39:36,400 --> 03:39:43,920
where um on a celebrity topic or corporate interest topic you can pay wikipedia editors to

2156
03:39:43,920 --> 03:39:48,240
edit more frequently and various things like that but you can also see where there's a lot of

2157
03:39:48,240 --> 03:39:52,960
information that was kind of decentralized created that is good information that is more easily

2158
03:39:52,960 --> 03:39:56,800
accessible to people than everybody buying their own encyclopedia britannica or walking down to the

2159
03:39:56,800 --> 03:40:04,640
library and that can be updated in real time faster and i think you're very right that the

2160
03:40:04,640 --> 03:40:12,080
business model is a big difference because wikipedia is not a for-profit corporation it is a

2161
03:40:12,640 --> 03:40:17,600
it's tending to the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other than tending to

2162
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:24,800
the information commons and i think the two master's issue is a tricky one when i'm trying to optimize

2163
03:40:24,800 --> 03:40:31,680
for very different kinds of things um where i have to sacrifice one for the other and i can't

2164
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:36,960
find synergistic satisfies which one and if i have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder

2165
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:41,520
uh profit maximization and you know what what does that end up creating

2166
03:40:43,280 --> 03:40:50,160
i think the ad model that silicon valley took um i think jaren laney or i don't know if you've

2167
03:40:50,160 --> 03:40:56,640
had him on the show but he has interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model um silicon

2168
03:40:56,640 --> 03:41:03,440
valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but uh also the

2169
03:41:03,440 --> 03:41:08,080
belief that information should be free and also the network dynamics where the more people you

2170
03:41:08,080 --> 03:41:12,880
got on you got increased value per user per capita as more people got on so you didn't want to do

2171
03:41:12,880 --> 03:41:18,160
anything to slow the rate of adoption um some places actually you know pay pal paying people

2172
03:41:18,160 --> 03:41:23,280
money to join the network because the uh value of the network would be there'd be a metcalflike

2173
03:41:23,280 --> 03:41:29,360
dynamic proportional to the square of the total number of users so um the ad model made sense of

2174
03:41:29,440 --> 03:41:35,760
how do we make it free but also be a business get everybody on but not really thinking about

2175
03:41:35,760 --> 03:41:40,320
what it would mean to and this is now the whole idea that if you aren't paying for the product

2176
03:41:40,320 --> 03:41:46,800
you are the product um if the if they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder

2177
03:41:46,800 --> 03:41:54,000
maximize profit their customer is the advertiser the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral

2178
03:41:54,000 --> 03:41:59,920
mod for them for advertisers that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech

2179
03:41:59,920 --> 03:42:04,480
could have been if applied with a different business model or a different purpose um

2180
03:42:05,680 --> 03:42:14,480
i think there's because facebook and google and other information and communication platforms

2181
03:42:14,480 --> 03:42:19,360
end up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are

2182
03:42:19,360 --> 03:42:25,440
in a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information than

2183
03:42:27,600 --> 03:42:31,840
even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in a different setting they

2184
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:37,120
basically are accessing privileged information there should be a fiduciary responsibility

2185
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:42,800
and in normal fiduciary law if there's this principal agent thing if you are a

2186
03:42:44,080 --> 03:42:48,960
uh principal and i'm an agent on your behalf i don't have a game-theoretic relationship with

2187
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:52,960
you right if you're sharing something with me and i'm the priest or i'm the therapist i'm never

2188
03:42:52,960 --> 03:42:58,960
going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is but facebook is

2189
03:42:58,960 --> 03:43:04,240
gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to modify people's behavior for a

2190
03:43:04,240 --> 03:43:08,960
behavior that they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior but what the corporation did so i think

2191
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:15,760
this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous social tech

2192
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:20,560
where it's being shaped in particular ways and here unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the

2193
03:43:21,520 --> 03:43:27,200
information commons this evolved for fulfilling particular agentic purpose most people when

2194
03:43:27,200 --> 03:43:31,200
they're on facebook think it's just a tool that they're using they don't realize it's an agent

2195
03:43:31,200 --> 03:43:36,960
right it is a corporation with a profit motive and and as i'm interacting with it it has a

2196
03:43:36,960 --> 03:43:41,600
goal for me different than my goal for myself and i might want to be on for a short period of time

2197
03:43:41,600 --> 03:43:48,000
its goal is maximize time on site and so there's a rivalry that is take but where there should be

2198
03:43:48,000 --> 03:43:54,880
a fiduciary contract i think that's actually a huge deal and i think if we said could we apply

2199
03:43:54,880 --> 03:44:07,840
facebook like technology to develop people's citizenry capacity right to develop their personal

2200
03:44:07,840 --> 03:44:13,840
health and well-being and habits as well as their cognitive understanding the complexity

2201
03:44:13,840 --> 03:44:21,360
with which they can process the health of their relationships that would be amazing to start

2202
03:44:21,360 --> 03:44:28,400
to explore and this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is

2203
03:44:28,400 --> 03:44:34,080
a major step function in the physical tech it absolutes the previous social tech and the new

2204
03:44:34,080 --> 03:44:39,520
social tech has to emerge what i would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the

2205
03:44:39,520 --> 03:44:46,640
world today the more top-down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to

2206
03:44:46,640 --> 03:44:52,400
emerge the digital technology started to emerge they were in a position for better long-term

2207
03:44:52,400 --> 03:44:58,160
planning and better coordination and so the authoritarian state started applying the exponential

2208
03:44:58,160 --> 03:45:02,480
tech intentionally to make more effective authoritarian states and that's everything

2209
03:45:02,480 --> 03:45:08,160
from like an internet of things surveillance system going into machine learning systems to

2210
03:45:08,160 --> 03:45:13,680
the sesame credit system to all those types of things and so they're upgrading their social

2211
03:45:13,680 --> 03:45:20,880
tech using the exponential tech otherwise within a nation state like the us but democratic open

2212
03:45:20,880 --> 03:45:26,960
societies the countries the states are not directing the technology in a way that makes

2213
03:45:26,960 --> 03:45:31,680
a better open society meaning better emergent order they're saying well the corporations are

2214
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:36,160
doing that and the state is doing the relatively little thing it would do aligned with the previous

2215
03:45:36,160 --> 03:45:40,000
corporate law that no longer is relevant because there wasn't fiduciary responsibility for things

2216
03:45:40,000 --> 03:45:45,120
like that there wasn't antitrust because this creates functional monopolies because of network

2217
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:50,960
dynamics right where youtube has more users than bimio and every other video player together amazon

2218
03:45:50,960 --> 03:45:55,520
has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together you get one

2219
03:45:55,520 --> 03:46:01,120
big dog per vertical because of network effect which is a kind of organic monopoly that the previous

2220
03:46:01,200 --> 03:46:06,400
antitrust law didn't even have a place that wasn't a thing anti monopoly was only something that

2221
03:46:06,400 --> 03:46:13,120
emerged in the space of government contracts so um so what we see is the new exponential

2222
03:46:13,120 --> 03:46:17,520
technology is being directed by authoritarian nation states to make better authoritarian

2223
03:46:17,520 --> 03:46:22,880
nation states and by corporations to make more powerful corporations the powerful corporations

2224
03:46:22,880 --> 03:46:26,960
when we think about the scottish enlightenment when the idea of markets was being advanced the

2225
03:46:26,960 --> 03:46:34,080
modern kind of ideas of markets the biggest corporation was tiny compared to what the biggest

2226
03:46:34,080 --> 03:46:40,240
corporation today is so the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny and the asymmetry now in

2227
03:46:40,240 --> 03:46:44,880
terms of the total technology it employs total amount of money total amount of information

2228
03:46:44,880 --> 03:46:52,320
processing is so many orders of magnitude and rather than there be demand for an authentic thing

2229
03:46:53,280 --> 03:46:58,640
that creates a basis for supply as supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the

2230
03:46:58,640 --> 03:47:02,640
demand wasn't coordinated because you don't have a labor union of all the customers working together

2231
03:47:02,640 --> 03:47:06,480
but you do have a coordination on the supply side supply started to recognize that it could

2232
03:47:06,480 --> 03:47:10,400
manufacture demand it could make people want shit that they didn't want before that maybe wouldn't

2233
03:47:10,400 --> 03:47:14,960
increase their happiness in a meaningful way might increase addiction addiction is a very good way

2234
03:47:14,960 --> 03:47:23,360
to manufacture demand and so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and

2235
03:47:23,360 --> 03:47:28,720
you have to have it for status or whatever it is the intelligence of the market was breaking

2236
03:47:28,720 --> 03:47:32,960
now it's no longer a collective intelligence system that is up regulating real desire for

2237
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:37,280
things that are really meaningful you're able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather

2238
03:47:37,280 --> 03:47:41,680
than the higher ones the addictive patterns drive those and have people want shit that doesn't

2239
03:47:41,680 --> 03:47:47,920
actually make them happier make the world better and so we really also have to we have to update

2240
03:47:47,920 --> 03:47:53,200
our theory of markets because a behavioral econ showed that homo economicus the rational actor

2241
03:47:53,200 --> 03:47:57,920
is not really a thing but particularly at greater and greater scale can't really be a thing

2242
03:47:57,920 --> 03:48:02,320
voluntarism isn't a thing where if my corporate if my company doesn't want to advertise on facebook

2243
03:48:02,320 --> 03:48:06,720
i just will lose to the companies that do because that's where all the fucking attention is and so

2244
03:48:06,720 --> 03:48:10,320
then i can say it's voluntary but it's not really if there's a functional monopoly

2245
03:48:11,760 --> 03:48:17,680
same if i'm going to sell on amazon or things like that so um what i would say is that these

2246
03:48:17,680 --> 03:48:23,840
corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states in some ways and

2247
03:48:27,360 --> 03:48:34,800
they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states the open societies so the democracies

2248
03:48:34,800 --> 03:48:40,720
are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of new tech companies that are kind

2249
03:48:40,720 --> 03:48:45,360
of a new feudalism tech feudalism because it's not a democracy inside of a tech company or the

2250
03:48:45,360 --> 03:48:51,280
supply and demand relationship when you have manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type

2251
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:56,720
functions and so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech and authoritarian

2252
03:48:56,720 --> 03:49:02,480
nation states controlling it and those attractors are both shitty and so i'm interested in the

2253
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:08,880
application of exponential tech to making better social tech that makes emergent order possible

2254
03:49:09,920 --> 03:49:15,760
and where then that emergent order can bind and direct the exponential tech in fundamentally

2255
03:49:15,760 --> 03:49:21,920
healthy not x-risk oriented directions i think the relationship of social tech and physical tech

2256
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:26,240
can make it i think we can actually use the physical tech to make better social tech but it's not

2257
03:49:26,240 --> 03:49:31,760
given that we do if we don't make better social tech then i think the physical tech empowers

2258
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:37,280
really shitty social tech that is not a world that we want i don't know if it's a road we want to go

2259
03:49:37,280 --> 03:49:42,080
down but i tend to believe that the market will create exactly the thing you're talking about

2260
03:49:42,080 --> 03:49:49,600
which i feel like there's a lot of money to be made in creating a social tech

2261
03:49:51,520 --> 03:49:56,080
that creates a better citizen that creates a better human being

2262
03:49:56,080 --> 03:50:05,520
this this uh the your description of facebook and so on which is a system that creates addiction

2263
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:14,640
which manufactures demand is not obviously inherently the consequence of the market like i

2264
03:50:14,640 --> 03:50:19,920
feel like that's the first stage of us like baby deer trying to figure out how to use the internet

2265
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:25,600
i i feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates

2266
03:50:27,520 --> 03:50:34,800
compersion and love honestly i mean i i really from we can have this i can make the business

2267
03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:39,680
case for it i don't know i don't think we want to really have that discussion but don't do you

2268
03:50:39,680 --> 03:50:45,120
have some hope that that's the case and i guess if not then how do we fix the system of markets

2269
03:50:45,120 --> 03:50:51,040
that work so well for the united states for so long like i said every social tech worked for a

2270
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:56,800
while like tribalism worked well for two or three hundred thousand years i think social tech has to

2271
03:50:56,800 --> 03:51:02,720
keep evolving the social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to

2272
03:51:02,720 --> 03:51:08,880
keep evolving as our physical tech does um so i think the thing that we call markets

2273
03:51:08,880 --> 03:51:17,280
of course we can try to say oh even biology runs on markets and but the thing that we call

2274
03:51:17,280 --> 03:51:23,920
markets the underlying theory homo economicist demand driving supply that thing broke it broke

2275
03:51:23,920 --> 03:51:30,480
with scale in particular um and a few other things so it needs updated in a really fundamental way

2276
03:51:31,840 --> 03:51:35,440
um i think there's something even deeper than making money happening

2277
03:51:36,400 --> 03:51:38,880
that in some ways will obsolete money making

2278
03:51:41,600 --> 03:51:44,240
i think capitalism is not about business

2279
03:51:46,400 --> 03:51:50,880
so if you think about business i'm going to produce a good or a service that people want

2280
03:51:50,880 --> 03:51:55,760
and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service that's the world

2281
03:51:55,760 --> 03:52:02,000
of business but that's not capitalism capitalism is the management and allocation of capital

2282
03:52:02,960 --> 03:52:08,320
which financial services was a tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of

2283
03:52:08,320 --> 03:52:13,280
the total market it's a different creature so if i was in business and i was producing a good

2284
03:52:13,280 --> 03:52:17,600
or service and i was saving up enough money that i started to be able to invest that money and gain

2285
03:52:17,600 --> 03:52:23,440
interest or do things like that i could start realizing i'm making more money on my money

2286
03:52:23,440 --> 03:52:27,360
than i'm making on producing the goods and services so i stop even paying attention to

2287
03:52:27,360 --> 03:52:32,000
goods and services and start paying attention to making money on money and how do i utilize

2288
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:37,200
capital to create more capital and capital gives me more optionality because i can buy anything with

2289
03:52:37,200 --> 03:52:42,880
it than a particular good or service that only some people want um capitalism

2290
03:52:46,160 --> 03:52:52,160
more capital ended up meaning more control i could put more people under my employment i could buy

2291
03:52:52,160 --> 03:52:58,000
larger pieces of land novel access to resource mines and put more technology under my employment

2292
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:04,960
so it meant increased agency and also increased control i think attentionalism is even more powerful

2293
03:53:07,520 --> 03:53:14,720
so rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in the

2294
03:53:14,720 --> 03:53:20,240
least work they can there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable than slavery

2295
03:53:20,320 --> 03:53:24,880
right have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead

2296
03:53:25,520 --> 03:53:28,960
and nobody has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever

2297
03:53:30,560 --> 03:53:37,360
this is a cynical take but a meaningful take um so people

2298
03:53:39,280 --> 03:53:46,400
so capital is a being a way to influence human behavior right and yet where people still feel

2299
03:53:46,480 --> 03:53:51,760
free in some meaningful way they they're not feeling like uh they're going to be punished by

2300
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:55,760
the state if they don't do something it's like punished by the market be a homelessness or

2301
03:53:55,760 --> 03:54:00,080
something but the market is this invisible thing i can't put an agent on so it feels like free

2302
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:10,240
and so if if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free

2303
03:54:10,240 --> 03:54:14,960
capital ends up being a way to do that but i think affecting their attention is even deeper

2304
03:54:15,680 --> 03:54:21,760
because if i can affect their attention i can both affect what they want and what they believe

2305
03:54:21,760 --> 03:54:25,760
and what they feel and we statistically know this very clearly facebook has done studies that

2306
03:54:25,760 --> 03:54:32,720
based on changing the feed it can change beliefs emotional dispositions etc and so i think there's

2307
03:54:32,720 --> 03:54:39,040
a way that the the harvest and directing of attention is even a more powerful system than

2308
03:54:39,040 --> 03:54:43,920
capitalism it is effective in capitalism to generate capital but i think it also generates

2309
03:54:43,920 --> 03:54:55,440
influence beyond what capital can do and so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type

2310
03:54:55,440 --> 03:55:04,720
of tech to direct other people's attention if so um towards what towards what metrics of what a good

2311
03:55:04,720 --> 03:55:09,200
civilization and good human life would be what's the oversight process what is the

2312
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:16,480
transparency i can i can i can answer all the things you're mentioning uh i i can build i guarantee

2313
03:55:16,480 --> 03:55:23,040
you if i am not such a lazy ass i'll be part of the many people doing this as transparency and

2314
03:55:23,040 --> 03:55:33,360
control i'll get to giving control to individual people okay so maybe the corporation has coordination

2315
03:55:33,360 --> 03:55:38,800
on its goals that all of its customers or users together don't have so there's some asymmetry

2316
03:55:38,800 --> 03:55:45,920
where it's uh asymmetry of its goals but maybe i could actually help all of the customers to

2317
03:55:45,920 --> 03:55:52,480
coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating them adequately about

2318
03:55:52,480 --> 03:55:57,360
the effects the externalities on them if this is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the

2319
03:55:57,360 --> 03:56:02,800
atmosphere it's their their minds their beings their families their relationships um such that

2320
03:56:02,800 --> 03:56:12,000
they will in group change their behavior and um i think the i one way of saying what you're

2321
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:20,640
saying i think is that you think that you can rescue homo economicus from uh the the rational

2322
03:56:20,640 --> 03:56:24,800
actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose the best one at the best price the kind

2323
03:56:24,800 --> 03:56:29,680
of rand von mises hayek that you can rescue that from dan arielli and behavioral econ that says

2324
03:56:29,680 --> 03:56:33,600
that's actually not how people make choices they make it based on status hacking largely

2325
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:39,600
whether it's good for them or not in the long term and the large asymmetric corporation can run

2326
03:56:39,600 --> 03:56:44,160
propaganda and narrative warfare that hits people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and

2327
03:56:44,160 --> 03:56:50,320
their lots of other things in ways that they can't even perceive that are happening um they're not

2328
03:56:50,320 --> 03:56:54,560
paying attention to that the site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever

2329
03:56:54,560 --> 03:57:01,040
else so you're saying i think we can recover homo economicus and not just through a single

2330
03:57:01,040 --> 03:57:07,120
like mechanism technology there's there's the uh not to keep mentioning the guy but platforms like

2331
03:57:07,120 --> 03:57:16,800
georogan and so on that that make help make viral the ways that the education of negative

2332
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:26,480
externalities can become viral in this world so interestingly i actually agree with you that

2333
03:57:28,000 --> 03:57:34,800
got him that we four and a half hours in that we can tech can do some good all right well see

2334
03:57:34,800 --> 03:57:39,440
what you're talking about is the application of tech here broadcast tech where you can speak to a

2335
03:57:39,440 --> 03:57:43,440
lot of people and that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken

2336
03:57:43,440 --> 03:57:47,120
too differently which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more

2337
03:57:47,120 --> 03:57:51,680
like facebook's tech but nonetheless we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then

2338
03:57:51,680 --> 03:57:57,600
the word of mouth is a powerful thing you need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like

2339
03:57:57,600 --> 03:58:02,960
lands a catapult of whatever i don't know what the right weapon is but then it just spreads the word

2340
03:58:02,960 --> 03:58:07,760
of mouth through all kinds of tech including facebook so let's come back to the fundamental

2341
03:58:07,760 --> 03:58:14,640
thing the fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting

2342
03:58:14,640 --> 03:58:22,720
parts of ourselves actually having more harmony than they might have to family extended family

2343
03:58:22,720 --> 03:58:28,240
local all the way up to global we want emergent order where our choices

2344
03:58:30,480 --> 03:58:37,040
have more alignment right we want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than

2345
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:40,320
we want fundamentally different things or make totally different sense of the world where

2346
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:47,360
warfare of some kind becomes the only solution emergent order requires us in our choice making

2347
03:58:47,360 --> 03:58:53,120
requires us being able to have related sense making and related meaning making processes

2348
03:58:54,880 --> 03:59:02,560
can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity

2349
03:59:02,560 --> 03:59:06,320
to do that where the technology called a town hall the social tech that we'd all get together and

2350
03:59:06,320 --> 03:59:11,760
talk obviously is very scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than networks of

2351
03:59:11,760 --> 03:59:17,920
aligned interest can we build new better versions of those types of things and going back to the

2352
03:59:18,800 --> 03:59:24,000
idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive education in the

2353
03:59:24,000 --> 03:59:28,160
science of government which include being able to understand things like asymmetric information

2354
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:34,080
warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize adequately can you utilize

2355
03:59:34,080 --> 03:59:40,640
some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive education of the people

2356
03:59:41,200 --> 03:59:46,240
and maybe comprehensive informativeness so both fixing the decay in both education and the fourth

2357
03:59:46,240 --> 03:59:52,640
estate that have happened so the people can start self-organizing to then influence the corporations

2358
03:59:52,640 --> 03:59:58,000
the nation states to do different things and or build new ones themselves yeah fundamentally

2359
03:59:58,000 --> 04:00:02,720
that's the thing that has to happen we the exponential tech gives us a novel problem

2360
04:00:02,720 --> 04:00:08,160
landscape that the world never had the nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required

2361
04:00:08,160 --> 04:00:13,600
this whole breton woods world the exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape our

2362
04:00:13,600 --> 04:00:18,640
existing problem solving processes aren't doing a good job we have had more countries get nukes we

2363
04:00:18,640 --> 04:00:23,440
haven't a nuclear deproliferation we haven't achieved any of the un sustainable development goals

2364
04:00:24,400 --> 04:00:28,800
we haven't kept any of the new categories of tech for making arms races so our global coordination

2365
04:00:28,880 --> 04:00:35,120
is not adequate to the problem landscape so we need fundamentally better problem solving processes a

2366
04:00:35,120 --> 04:00:39,520
market or a state is a problem solving process we need better ones that can do the speed and

2367
04:00:39,520 --> 04:00:44,800
scale of the current issues right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we

2368
04:00:44,800 --> 04:00:50,320
regulated ddt out of existence or cigarettes not for people under 18 they'd already killed so many

2369
04:00:50,320 --> 04:00:56,320
people and we let the market do the thing but as elon has made the point that won't work for ai by

2370
04:00:56,320 --> 04:01:01,840
the time we recognize afterwards that we have an autopoietic ai that's a problem you won't be able

2371
04:01:01,840 --> 04:01:06,080
to reverse it that there's a number of things that when you're dealing with tech that is either

2372
04:01:06,080 --> 04:01:11,440
self replicating and disintermediate humans to keep going doesn't need humans to keep going

2373
04:01:11,440 --> 04:01:18,000
or you have tech that just has exponentially fast effects your regulation has to come early it can't

2374
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:23,440
come after the effects have happened the negative effects have happened if because the negative

2375
04:01:23,440 --> 04:01:28,000
effects could be too big too quickly so we basically need new problem solving processes that do

2376
04:01:29,120 --> 04:01:34,960
better at being able to internalize externality solve the problems on the right timescale and the

2377
04:01:34,960 --> 04:01:42,160
right geographic scale and those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting

2378
04:01:42,160 --> 04:01:47,760
them and being able to participate in their development which is what i would call kind of a

2379
04:01:47,760 --> 04:01:52,480
new cultural enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen where people start understanding

2380
04:01:52,480 --> 04:01:58,960
the new power that exponential tech offers the way that it is actually damaging

2381
04:01:59,680 --> 04:02:05,520
current governance structures that we care about and creating an extra-risk landscape but could also

2382
04:02:05,520 --> 04:02:12,320
be redirected towards more protopic purposes and then saying how do we rebuild new social

2383
04:02:12,320 --> 04:02:17,280
institutions what are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at scale

2384
04:02:17,280 --> 04:02:25,040
in time and how can the people actually participate to build those things i the the solution that i

2385
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:34,160
see working requires a process like that and the result maximizes love so again elan would be right

2386
04:02:34,160 --> 04:02:41,600
that love is the answer let me take it back from the scale of societies to the scale that's far far

2387
04:02:41,600 --> 04:02:49,040
more important which is the scale of family you've written a blog post about your dad

2388
04:02:49,920 --> 04:02:58,800
we have various flavors of relationships with our fathers what have you learned about life when

2389
04:02:58,800 --> 04:03:06,640
your dad well people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual things that i learned that

2390
04:03:06,640 --> 04:03:15,280
i really appreciated um if i was to kind of summarize at a high level um i had a really

2391
04:03:15,280 --> 04:03:23,920
incredible dad like very very unusually uh positive set of experiences he was committed

2392
04:03:23,920 --> 04:03:28,880
we were homeschooled and he was committed to work from home to be available and like prioritize

2393
04:03:28,880 --> 04:03:40,080
fathering in a really deep way um and you know as a super gifted super loving very unique man

2394
04:03:40,080 --> 04:03:44,000
he also had his unique issues that were part of what crafted the unique brilliance and those

2395
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:50,560
things often go together and i say that because i think i had i had some unusual gifts and also

2396
04:03:50,560 --> 04:03:56,400
some unusual difficulties and i think it's useful for everybody to know their path probably has

2397
04:03:56,400 --> 04:04:05,280
both of those um but uh if i was to say kind of at the the essence of one of the things my dad

2398
04:04:05,280 --> 04:04:12,800
taught me across a lot of lessons was like a the intersection of self-empowerment ideas and practices

2399
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:19,920
that self-empower towards collective good uh towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self

2400
04:04:20,720 --> 04:04:25,840
and he both said that a million different ways taught it in a million different ways when we

2401
04:04:25,840 --> 04:04:32,240
were doing construction and he was teaching me how to uh build a house we were putting the wires

2402
04:04:32,240 --> 04:04:36,480
to the walls before the drywall went on he made sure that the way that we put the wires through

2403
04:04:36,480 --> 04:04:43,600
is beautiful like the the that the height of the holes was similar that we twisted the wires in a

2404
04:04:43,600 --> 04:04:48,320
particular way that and it's like no one's ever going to see it and he's like if a job's worth

2405
04:04:48,320 --> 04:04:52,240
doing it's worth doing well and excellence is its own reward and those types of ideas and if there

2406
04:04:52,240 --> 04:04:56,000
was a really shitty job to do he'd say see the job do the job stay out of the misery just don't

2407
04:04:56,000 --> 04:05:01,920
indulge any negativity do the things that need done and so there's like a there's an empowerment

2408
04:05:01,920 --> 04:05:11,840
and a nobility together um and yeah extraordinarily fortunate is there ways you think you could have

2409
04:05:11,840 --> 04:05:20,480
been a better song is there things you regret it's an interesting question let me get first say

2410
04:05:21,360 --> 04:05:29,680
just as a bit of a criticism that uh what kind of man do you think you are not wearing a suit and

2411
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:38,320
tie a real man should exactly uh i grew with your dad on that point you mentioned offline that uh he

2412
04:05:38,320 --> 04:05:46,240
suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie but outside of that is there ways you could have

2413
04:05:46,240 --> 04:05:53,600
been a better son maybe next time on your show i'll wear a suit and tie my dad would be happy about

2414
04:05:53,600 --> 04:06:06,960
that um please

2415
04:06:12,400 --> 04:06:18,960
i can answer the question later in life not early um i had just a huge amount of respect

2416
04:06:18,960 --> 04:06:24,320
and reverence for my dad when i was young so i was asking myself that question a lot so i

2417
04:06:24,320 --> 04:06:33,600
learned a lot of things i knew that i wasn't seeking to apply um there was a phase when i went

2418
04:06:33,600 --> 04:06:41,120
through my kind of individuation differentiation where i had to make him excessively wrong about

2419
04:06:41,200 --> 04:06:49,680
too many things um i don't think i had to but i did and he had a lot of kind of non-standard

2420
04:06:49,680 --> 04:06:58,320
model beliefs about things whether early kind of ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary

2421
04:06:58,320 --> 04:07:07,280
theory or alternate models of physics and and they weren't irrational but they didn't all have the

2422
04:07:07,360 --> 04:07:16,400
standard of epistemic proof that i would need and i went through and some of them were kind of

2423
04:07:16,400 --> 04:07:28,240
spiritual ideas as well i went through a phase in my early 20s where i kind of had that the

2424
04:07:28,240 --> 04:07:37,680
attitude that Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens has that can kind of be um like excessively

2425
04:07:37,680 --> 04:07:44,240
certain and sanctimonious uh applying their reductionist philosophy of science to everything and

2426
04:07:44,240 --> 04:07:50,160
um i'm kind of brutally dismissive uh i'm embarrassed by that phase um

2427
04:07:50,400 --> 04:07:58,160
i'm not to say anything about those men in their path but for myself and so during that time

2428
04:07:59,120 --> 04:08:05,760
i was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than i would have liked to have been

2429
04:08:06,560 --> 04:08:10,320
i gotta correct that later apologize for it but that's the first thought that came to mind

2430
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:19,440
you've written the following i've had the experience countless times making love watching

2431
04:08:19,440 --> 04:08:28,160
a sunset listening to music feeling the breeze that i would sign up for this whole life and all

2432
04:08:28,160 --> 04:08:35,280
of its pains just to experience this exact moment this is a kind of worldless knowing

2433
04:08:37,120 --> 04:08:43,040
it's the most important and real truth i know that experience itself is infinitely meaningful

2434
04:08:43,840 --> 04:08:49,760
and pain is temporary and seen clearly even the suffering is filled with beauty

2435
04:08:50,560 --> 04:08:58,160
i have experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life such an unreasonable fortune

2436
04:09:00,320 --> 04:09:06,080
a few words of gratitude from you beautifully written is there some beautiful moments now you

2437
04:09:06,080 --> 04:09:11,920
have uh experienced countless lives worth of those moments but there's some things that uh

2438
04:09:14,000 --> 04:09:20,960
if you could uh in your darker moments you can go to to relive to remind yourself that the whole

2439
04:09:20,960 --> 04:09:28,720
ride is worthwhile maybe skip the making love part we don't know about that i mean i i feel

2440
04:09:28,720 --> 04:09:43,440
i feel unreasonably fortunate that it is a such a humongous list because i mean i feel fortunate

2441
04:09:43,440 --> 04:09:48,880
to have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of seeing things it makes

2442
04:09:48,880 --> 04:09:54,320
me see things that way so i can take responsibility for seeing things in that way and not taking for

2443
04:09:54,320 --> 04:09:58,480
granted really wonderful things but i can't take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that

2444
04:09:58,560 --> 04:10:09,440
even gave me that possibility um you know it's not just with my wife it's with every person who

2445
04:10:09,440 --> 04:10:14,320
i really love when we're talking i look at their face i in the context of a conversation feel

2446
04:10:14,320 --> 04:10:19,840
overwhelmed by how lucky i am to get to know them and like that there's never been someone like them

2447
04:10:19,840 --> 04:10:23,280
in all of history and there never will be again and then they might be gone tomorrow i might be

2448
04:10:23,280 --> 04:10:27,760
gone tomorrow and like i get this moment with them and when you take in the uniqueness of that

2449
04:10:27,760 --> 04:10:30,320
fully and the beauty of it it's overwhelmingly beautiful

2450
04:10:33,440 --> 04:10:41,600
and you know i remember the first time i did a big dose of mushrooms and i was looking at a tree

2451
04:10:42,160 --> 04:10:47,040
for a long time and i was just crying with overwhelming how beautiful the tree was and

2452
04:10:47,040 --> 04:10:50,800
it was a tree outside the front of my house that i'd walked by a million times and never looked at

2453
04:10:50,800 --> 04:10:57,840
like this and it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where i was hallucinating like where the tree was

2454
04:10:57,840 --> 04:11:02,320
purple like the tree still looked like if i had to describe it it's green and it has leaves looks

2455
04:11:02,320 --> 04:11:08,560
like this but it was way fucking more beautiful like like capturing than it normally was and i'm

2456
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:13,200
like why is it so beautiful if i would describe it the same way and i realized i had no thoughts

2457
04:11:13,200 --> 04:11:18,400
taking me anywhere else yeah like what it seemed like the mushrooms were doing was just actually

2458
04:11:18,400 --> 04:11:21,760
shutting the narrative off that would have me be distracted so i could really see the tree

2459
04:11:22,640 --> 04:11:25,520
and then i'm like fuck when i get off these mushrooms i'm gonna practice seeing the tree

2460
04:11:26,160 --> 04:11:30,640
because it's always that beautiful and i just miss it and so i practice being with it and

2461
04:11:30,640 --> 04:11:35,680
quieting the rest of the mind and then being like wow and if it's not mushrooms like people have

2462
04:11:35,680 --> 04:11:42,240
peak experiences where they'll see life and how incredible it is it's always there it's funny

2463
04:11:42,240 --> 04:11:49,120
that i had this exact same experience and the un quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone

2464
04:11:49,120 --> 04:11:55,120
and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it appreciating the beauty undistorted beauty of

2465
04:11:55,120 --> 04:12:02,320
it and it's funny to me that here's two humans very different with very different journeys

2466
04:12:02,320 --> 04:12:06,000
where at some moment in time both looking at a tree like idiots for hours

2467
04:12:06,640 --> 04:12:13,920
and just in awe and and happy to be alive and yeah and uh even just that moment alone is

2468
04:12:13,920 --> 04:12:20,080
is worth living for but you did say humans and we have a moment together as two humans

2469
04:12:20,960 --> 04:12:27,840
and you mentioned shots well i have to ask what uh what are we looking at when i went to go

2470
04:12:28,720 --> 04:12:32,480
get a smoothie before coming here i got you a keto smoothie that you didn't want because

2471
04:12:32,560 --> 04:12:37,520
you're not just keto but fasting but i saw the thing with you and your dad where you did

2472
04:12:38,080 --> 04:12:43,440
shots together yeah and this place happened to have shots of um ginger turmeric cayenne

2473
04:12:44,800 --> 04:12:49,040
juice of some kind and so i with some Himalayan salt i didn't necessarily plan it for being on the

2474
04:12:49,040 --> 04:12:54,320
show but i just brought it wow but we can we can do it that way i think we should we shall uh

2475
04:12:54,400 --> 04:13:01,600
we shall toast like heroes daniel it's a huge honor what do we toast to what do we toast to

2476
04:13:01,600 --> 04:13:07,280
we toast to this moment this this this unique moment that we get to share together i'm very

2477
04:13:07,280 --> 04:13:11,840
grateful to be here in this moment with you and uh yeah i'm grateful that you invited me here

2478
04:13:12,560 --> 04:13:18,240
we met for the first time and i will never be the same for the good and the bad

2479
04:13:19,120 --> 04:13:21,120
i am

2480
04:13:22,720 --> 04:13:27,440
that is really interesting that feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and i were drinking

2481
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:34,000
so i feel like a better man already daniel this is one of the best conversations i've ever had

2482
04:13:34,000 --> 04:13:39,360
i can't wait to have many more likewise this has uh it's been an amazing experience thank you for

2483
04:13:39,360 --> 04:13:45,280
wasting all your time today i want to say in terms of what you're mentioning about like the

2484
04:13:46,240 --> 04:13:52,960
that you work in machine learning and the optimism that wants to look at the issues but

2485
04:13:52,960 --> 04:13:58,160
wants to look at how this increased technological power could be applied to solving them and that

2486
04:13:59,040 --> 04:14:04,080
even thinking about the broadcast of like can i help people understand the issues better and

2487
04:14:04,080 --> 04:14:10,720
help organize them like fundamentally you're you're oriented like wikipedia what i see to

2488
04:14:10,720 --> 04:14:16,480
really try to tend to the information commons without another agentic interest distorting it

2489
04:14:17,760 --> 04:14:19,520
and for you to be able to get guys like

2490
04:14:21,280 --> 04:14:27,040
lee smolen and roger pennrose and like the the the greatest thinkers of that are alive and you

2491
04:14:27,040 --> 04:14:31,440
know have them on the show and most people would never be exposed to them and talk about it in a

2492
04:14:31,440 --> 04:14:36,320
way that people can understand uh i think it's an incredible service i think you're doing great

2493
04:14:36,320 --> 04:14:42,080
work so i was really happy to hear from you thank you daniel thanks for listening to this
