00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The following is a conversation with Sean Kelly, a philosopher at Harvard specializing in existentialism and the philosophy of mind.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And now, here's my conversation with Sean Kelly.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Your interests are in postcontain European philosophy, especially phenomenology and existentialism. So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So it's a hard question. I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You are.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am, yeah. Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I mean, the traditional thing to say about what existentialism is, is that it's a movement in mid 20th century, mostly French, some German philosophy.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And some of the major figures associated with it are people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, maybe Martin Heidegger.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But that's a weird thing to say about it, because most of those people denied that they were existentialists.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And in fact, I think of it as a movement that has a much longer history.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So when I try to describe what the core idea of existentialism is, it's an idea that you find expressed in different ways in a bunch of these people.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:42,000
One of the ways that it's expressed is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the view that there is no God and at least his form of existentialism.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He calls it atheistic existentialism. There is no God.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And since there is no God, there must be some other being around who does something like what God does.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any possibility for significance in a life.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And that being is us. And the feature of us, according to Sartre and the other existentialists, that puts us in the position to be able to play that role is that we're the beings for whom, as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's the catchphrase for existentialism. And then you have to try to figure out what it means.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is existence? What is presence? And what does precedes mean?

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, exactly. What is existence? What is essence? And what is precedes?

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it and other people will talk about it differently.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But here's the way Sartre thinks about it. This is not, I think, the most interesting way to think about it, but I'll get you started.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sartre says, there's nothing true about what it is to be you until you start existing, until you start living.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is to be existing, the way we do, is to be making decisions, to be making choices in your life, to be sort of taking a stand on what it is to be you by deciding to do this or that.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And the key feature of how to do that right, for Sartre, is to do it in the full recognition of the fact that when you make that choice, nobody is responsible for it other than you.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So you don't make the choice because God tells you to. You don't make the choice because some utilitarian calculus about what it's right to do tells you to do.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't make the choice because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it. There's literally nothing on the basis of which you make the choice other than the fact that in that moment, you're the one making it.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You are conscious thinking being that made a decision. So all the questions about physics and free will are out the window.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, that's right. If you were a determinist about the mind, if you were a physicalist about the mind, if you thought there was nothing to your choices other than the activity of the brain that's governed by physical laws, then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate like you're not the ground of that choice.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The ground of that choice was the physical universe and the laws that govern it, and then you'd have no responsibility.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special about us, used to be special about God, is that we're responsible for becoming the being that makes the choices that we do.

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And Sartre thinks that that's simultaneously empowering. I mean, it practically puts us in the place of God and also terrifying because what responsibility? How can you possibly take on that responsibility?

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And he thinks it's worse than that. He thinks that it's always happening. Everything that you do is the result of some choice that you've made, the posture that you sit in, the way you hold someone's gaze when you're having a conversation with them or not,

34
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the choice to make a note when someone says something or not make a note. Everything that you do presents you as a being who makes decisions and you're responsible for all of them.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So it's constantly happening. And furthermore, there's no fact about you independent of the choices and actions you've performed.

36
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So you don't get to say, Sartre's example, I really am a great writer, just haven't written my great book yet. If you haven't written your great book, you're not a great writer.

37
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And so it's terrifying. It puts a huge burden on us. And that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism, human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to become someone through making them. And we can't get away from that.

39
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But to him, it's terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating.

40
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous individual to be liberated by it. Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.

41
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition. But what's liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain way, you're the ground of your own being.

42
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You become what you do through existing. So that's one form of existentialism. That's a stark atheistic version of it. There's lots of other versions.

43
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But it's somehow organized around the idea that it's through living your life that you become who you are. It's not facts that are sort of true about you, independent of your living your life.

44
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But then if there's no God in that view, does any of the decisions matter? So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Good. Okay. Great question. There was two different ways that you're asking it. Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering.

46
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Or is there any way that you can criticize someone for doing, for living the way they do if you're an existentialist?

47
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Including yourself.

48
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Including yourself, yeah. Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make of yourself or of others.

49
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And it's the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for your choices.

50
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He gives these two sort of amazing examples. I don't know if it reads as well as for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris, but it's about a waiter.

51
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He gives this in his big book Being and Nothingness.

52
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And he says, so waiters played still do, I think, in a certain way in Paris. A big role in Parisian society to be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity, being a certain way.

53
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Taking control of and charge of the experience of the people that you're waiting on, but also really being the authority, like knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go.

54
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it that he's doing it because he believes that's the way a waiter should act.

55
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So there's some sense in which he's passing off the responsibility for his actions onto some idea of what those actions should be. He's not taking responsibility for it.

56
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other than him.

57
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So he starts acting in bad faith. And that's criticisable because it's acting in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.

58
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So you're not taking responsibility. So that's one example. And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager, you've known someone who does that.

59
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If teenagers try on roles, they think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool. So I'll dress like this. Or if I spoke like this or acted like this.

60
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out what their identity is to go through a phase like that. But if you continue to do that, then you're really passing.

61
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's one example. And the other example he gives is an example, not of passing off responsibility by pretending that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all.

62
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So he says, you're always everything you do is a result of your choices. And so he gives this other example. There you are on the first date, first date. And the date, the evening reaches moments when might be appropriate for one person to hold the hand of the other.

63
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's the moment in the date where you are. And so you make a choice. You decide, I think it's that time and you hold the hand. And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on SART's view. Either they reject the hand, not that time.

64
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I'm taking responsibility for that. Or they grasp the hand back. That's a choice. But there's a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the hand there cold, dead and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.

65
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And SART says, that's also bad faith. That's also acting as if we're kind of being that we're not, because it pretends that it's possible not to make a choice. And we're the beings who are always making choices. That was a choice. And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing that you don't have to take responsibility for.

66
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So both of the examples you've given, there's some sense in which the social interactions between humans is the kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a human in the view of existentialism should take on.

67
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So like, isn't the basic conversation a delegation of responsibility? Just holding a hand there. You're putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person. And for the waiter, if you're existing a society, you are generally trying on a role.

68
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:34,000
All of us are trying on a role. Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try as opposed to walking around naked all the time. There's like standards of how you operate. And that's a decision that's not my own. That's me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them.

69
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, exactly. So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that. Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue to how you should live well. So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.

70
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why is hell other people for Sartre? Well, because other people are making choices also. And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice they made is one that I should copy or one that I should sort of promote.

71
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But if I do it because they did it, then I'm in bad faith for Sartre. So it is as if Sartre's view is like we would be better if we were all alone. I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position. And this is really just mostly Sartre in a certain period of his formation. But anyhow, we can imagine that view. And I think there's something to the idea that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in the mid 40s.

72
00:13:44,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Can you dig into hell as other people? Is there some, obviously it's kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly to really explore that point. But is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience of what it means to be human?

73
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this. Like, it's not just that you wear clothes because people wear clothes in our society. Like you have a particular style. You wear a particular kind of clothes. And for Sartre, to have that style authentically in good faith rather than in bad faith, it has to come from you. You have to make the choice.

74
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But other people are making choices also. And like you're looking at their choices and you're thinking, that guy looks good. Maybe I could try that one on. And if you try it on because you were influenced by the fact that you thought that guy was doing it well, then there's some important sense in which, although that's a resource for a choice for you, it's also acting in bad faith.

75
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And God wouldn't do that, right? God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions. And if that's the model, then that's, I think that's the sense in which he thinks hell is other people.

76
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What do you think parenting is then? It's like what, because God doesn't have a parent.

77
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

78
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Aren't we significantly influenced first of all in the first few years of life?

79
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Absolutely.

80
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And even the teenager is resisting, learning through resistance.

81
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Absolutely.

82
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre's aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal.

83
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And there's many ways in which we're not like the traditional view of what God was.

84
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
One is that we're not self-generating. We have parents.

85
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We're raised into traditions and social norms.

86
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And we're raised into an understanding of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do.

87
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I think that's a deep intuition. I think that's exactly right.

88
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks he's sort of taking this from,

89
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger's German phenomenological view.

90
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our thrownness.

91
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We're thrown into a situation. We're thrown into history.

92
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We're thrown into our parental lineage. And we don't choose it.

93
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's stuff that we don't choose. We couldn't choose.

94
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we're not.

95
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning that we never chose.

96
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We have an end that we're often trying to resist or put off or something.

97
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And in between, there's a whole bunch of stuff that organizes us without our ever having made the choice

98
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and without the kind of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.

99
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We have a complicated relationship to that stuff.

100
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And I think we should talk about that at a certain point.

101
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But the first move is to say, Sartre's just got a sort of descriptive problem.

102
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's missed this basic fact that there has to be an awful lot about us

103
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that's settled without our having made the choice to settle it that way.

104
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Right. The thrownness of life.

105
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

106
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's a fundamental part of life. You can't just escape it.

107
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Exactly. You can't escape it altogether.

108
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Altogether.

109
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah, exactly. You can't escape it altogether.

110
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But nevertheless, you are riding a wave and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.

111
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can't control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it,

112
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you should be making certain kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.

113
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So why does this matter at all?

114
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The chain of decisions you make.

115
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Good. Well, because they constitute you, they make you the person that you are.

116
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So what's the opposite view?

117
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What's this view against?

118
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward.

119
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Plato says in the Republic, it's a kind of myth, but he says people will understand their condition.

120
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Well, if we tell them this myth, he says, look, when you're born, there's just a fact about you.

121
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze.

122
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Those are the three kinds of people there are, and you're born that way.

123
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king.

124
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And if your soul is silver, well, you're not going to be a philosopher king.

125
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior and we should make you that.

126
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer or laborer or something like that.

127
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of anything you do about it.

128
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And so that's the alternative view.

129
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And you could have modern versions of it.

130
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ or your genetic makeup or the percentage of fast-switch muscle fibers you've got or whatever.

131
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It could be something totally independent of any choice that you've made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could make a choice.

132
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And it categorizes you.

133
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It makes you the person that you are.

134
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against.

135
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you can make.

136
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.

137
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.

138
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Radical freedom.

139
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, radical freedom.

140
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we got to understand the way in which our freedom is limited by certain things.

141
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We're limited by certain aspects of the kind of being that we are.

142
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense.

143
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And sort of these folks start with the idea that, look, whatever we are, that's a kind of limit point that we're not going to reach.

144
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So what are the ways in which we're constrained that that being the way the medieval's understood him wasn't constrained?

145
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?

146
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes, good.

147
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Excellent.

148
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before him is Nietzsche.

149
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Nietzsche is writing in the end of the 19th century in various places where he published things.

150
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition of the modern world as nihilistic.

151
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And that's a descriptive claim.

152
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's looking around him, trying to figure out what it's like to be us now.

153
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And he says it's a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century BCE.

154
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:38,000
In 1300, like what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God.

155
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's the way they understood themselves.

156
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden.

157
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And to have the project of trying to understand how as a sinful being, you could nevertheless live a life of virtuous life.

158
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
How could you do that?

159
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And it had to do with for them getting in the right relation to God.

160
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Nietzsche says, that doesn't make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century.

161
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.

162
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And what does that mean?

163
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves as a culture isn't a role that God can play anymore.

164
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And so Nietzsche says, the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence.

165
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.

166
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And Nietzsche says, the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn't make sense anymore.

167
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's like Sartre's atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.

168
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And so the question is, what does ground our existence?

169
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And the answer is, nihil, nothing.

170
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing outside of us that grounds our existence.

171
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?

172
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How do we live?

173
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that.

174
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.

175
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Nietzsche emphasizes something else.

176
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He says, we're artists of life.

177
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they're responding to something.

178
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what's going to make sense of the situation.

179
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This is what I have to write.

180
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is the way I have to dance.

181
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is the way I've got to play the music.

182
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.

183
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living itself.

184
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And there's a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this.

185
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist when Nietzsche was writing,

186
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but I think Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation.

187
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I mean, he talks about improvisation.

188
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There's classical improvisation.

189
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.

190
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I mean, he was a composer and a pianist.

191
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.

192
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite a while in the 60s,

193
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:42,000
tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative.

194
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And that gives us a certain kind of freedom.

195
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But we don't have the radical freedom that starts things.

196
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So what's the story?

197
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things were great, he says.

198
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He's a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master.

199
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And he says, I'm playing the, I'm back in the solo and I'm playing these chords.

200
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord.

201
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
He's like, it just, like, that's what you got to say.

202
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It didn't work right there.

203
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, you know, I screwed up, we were tight, everything was working.

204
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.

205
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And he said, Miles paused for a moment.

206
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And then all of a sudden he went on in a way that made my chord right.

207
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And I think that idea that, like, you could be an artist who responds to what's thrown at you in such a way as to make it right.

208
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
By what measure?

209
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Everyone could hear it is all you can say.

210
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Everyone knew, wow, that really works.

211
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And I think that's not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there.

212
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
He couldn't have just played anything.

213
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible.

214
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But the constraints aren't like pre-existing.

215
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They're sort of what's happening now in the moment for these listeners and these performers.

216
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is.

217
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We're involved, but we're not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it the way Sartre thinks.

218
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Our choices have to be responsive to our situation.

219
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And they have to make the situation work.

220
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They have to make it right.

221
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And there's something about music, too.

222
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So you basically have to make music of all the moments of life.

223
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And there is something about music.

224
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Why is music so compelling?

225
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And when you listen to it, something about certain kinds of music, it connects with you.

226
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It doesn't make any sense.

227
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical masterpiece.

228
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Exactly.

229
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I think what's interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force there?

230
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There's a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God.

231
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
God creates ex nihilo out of nothing.

232
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo,

233
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because it's about how there's nothing at our ground.

234
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don't create out of nothing.

235
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Miles Davis, it wasn't nothing.

236
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That situation pre-existed him.

237
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It was given to him.

238
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever.

239
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But he was responding to that situation in a way that made it right.

240
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He wasn't just creating out of nothing.

241
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He was creating out of what was already there.

242
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated.

243
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Because you're given a climbing hand, you're going to have to make art and music out of that.

244
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Exactly.

245
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's the responsibility for both of them.

246
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for his day, because you have to create.

247
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So the emphasis isn't just on making decisions.

248
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's on creating.

249
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But also on listening, right?

250
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I mean, Miles Davis was listening.

251
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He heard that.

252
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
He knew it was wrong.

253
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?

254
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?

255
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What do you mean by that statement?

256
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah.

257
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
What's in your sense the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that our world today provides?

258
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Good.

259
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So I mean, I think that there's something super perceptive about Nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition at the end of the 19th century.

260
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So not so far from the condition that I think we're currently in.

261
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And I think there's an interesting question, what we're supposed to respond, what we're supposed to do in response.

262
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But what is the condition that we're currently in?

263
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:28,000
When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for us anymore as a culture.

264
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology, but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.

265
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They say we live in a secular age.

266
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Our age is a secular age.

267
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And so what do people mean when they say that?

268
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.

269
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It could be wrong.

270
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?

271
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?

272
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Well, first thing is, it doesn't mean there are no religious believers because there are plenty.

273
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There are lots of people who go to church or synagogue or mosque, you know, every week or more.

274
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And there are people who really find that to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.

275
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But it does mean that for those people, the role that their religious belief plays in their life isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.

276
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So what's that role?

277
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We'll go back to the High Middle Ages.

278
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That was clearly not a secular age.

279
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That was a religious age.

280
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And so there we are in 1300.

281
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Dante is writing the Divine Comedy or something.

282
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?

283
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Well, it meant not just that the default was that you were a Christian in the West, but that your Christianity, your religious belief, your religious affiliation justified certain assumptions about people who didn't share that religious belief.

284
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So you're a Christian in the West in 1300 and you meet someone who's a Muslim and the fact that they don't share your religious belief justifies the conclusion that they're less than human.

285
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And that was the ground of the crusades.

286
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That was the religious wars of the High Middle Ages.

287
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
To say that we live in a secular age is to say that there aren't a lot of people who have religious belief, there are.

288
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But it's to say that their religious belief doesn't justify that conclusion.

289
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:02,000
If you're a religious believer and you meet me and suppose I'm not a religious believer, learning that about me doesn't justify your concluding that I'm less than human.

290
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.

291
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Most of the time we think that's a good thing.

292
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We let a thousand flowers bloom.

293
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There are lots of ways to live a good life.

294
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive kind of liberal thought.

295
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But it's also true that it's an undermining thought because it means if you're a religious believer now, your belief can't ground your understanding of what you ought to be aiming at in the life in the way it used to be able to.

296
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You can't say, as a religious believer, I know it's right to do this because you also know that if you meet someone who doesn't share that religious belief and so doesn't think it's right to do that necessarily or does but for different reasons, you can't conclude that they've got it wrong.

297
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.

298
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude as a public statement to others, but within your own mind, it's almost like an existentialist version of belief, which is like you create the world and around you.

299
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It doesn't matter what others believe.

300
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's actually almost like empowering thought as opposed to the more traditional view of religion where it's like a tribal idea, where you share that idea together.

301
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Here you have the full, back to Sartre, full responsibility of your beliefs as well.

302
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Good, good.

303
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But what you're describing is not a religious believer.

304
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You're describing someone who's found in themselves the ground of their existence rather than in something outside of themselves.

305
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I mean, if you go full Sartrean, then well, you're not in a position to criticize others for the choices that they make, but you are in a position to criticize them for the way in which they make them, either taking responsibility or not taking responsibility.

306
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But the religious believer used to be able to say, look, the choices that I make are right because God demands that I make them.

307
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And nowadays, and so it would be wrong to make any others.

308
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age, say, well, you can't quite do that and be a religious believer.

309
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Your religious belief can't justify that move, and so it can't ground your life in the way it does.

310
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So it's sort of unsettling.

311
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I think that's one of the interpretations of what Nietzsche might have meant when he said God is dead.

312
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
God can't play the role for religious believers in our world that he used to.

313
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But we nevertheless find meaning.

314
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I mean, you don't see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas that are overtaken modern culture.

315
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So a secular world is still full of meaning.

316
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Good.

317
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Well, I think that's the interesting question.

318
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think it's certainly possible for a secular world to be a world in which we live meaningful lives, worthwhile lives,

319
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:23,000
lives that are sort of worthy of respect and that we can be proud of aiming to live.

320
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But I think it is a hard question what we're doing when we do that.

321
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And that is the question of existence.

322
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So what does it mean to exist in a way that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?

323
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's the question for existentialism.

324
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important existentialist to understand for others?

325
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?

326
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Maybe other existentialists, not just one.

327
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah, good.

328
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So Sartre is the grounding, strong, atheistic existentialism statement.

329
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Who else is there?

330
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm teaching an existentialism course now and I think the tradition goes back at least to the 17th century.

331
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And I'll just tell you some of the figures that I'm teaching there.

332
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We could talk about any of them that you like.

333
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The figure I start with is Pascal.

334
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Pascal, French mathematician from the 17th century.

335
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
He died.

336
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm terrible with dates, but I think 1661 or something like that, middle of the 17th century.

337
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Brilliant polymath.

338
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Sort of we have computer languages named after him.

339
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He built the first mechanical calculating machine.

340
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But he was also deeply invested in his understanding of what Christianity was.

341
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And he thought that everyone before him had really misunderstood what Christianity was.

342
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That they'd really attempted to think about it, not as a way of living a life, but as a set of beliefs that you can have and which you can justify.

343
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And I think that's the first move that's really pretty interesting.

344
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky developed that move.

345
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And all of those take themselves to be defending an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity, an existential interpretation of Christianity.

346
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And then I think there are other figures, other theistic figures, figures like Camus and Fanon, who are mid-20th century figures.

347
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And then I'll just mention the figure who I think is the most interesting is Martin Heidegger.

348
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
He's a complicated figure.

349
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
By the way, when you said Camus, you meant atheistic.

350
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist.

351
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.

352
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So we've got sports cards, we have the different existentialists.

353
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So maybe let's go to Dostoevsky.

354
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
All right, okay, let's do it.

355
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.

356
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.

357
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And I love the optimism and the love the main character has for the world.

358
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.

359
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Knows from underground as well.

360
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think are existentialist?

361
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?

362
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Excellent.

363
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So let me talk about the brother's Karimovsov.

364
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Partly because that's the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.

365
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.

366
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Maybe the best.

367
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.

368
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So I'm super excited about it.

369
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But what is the brother's Karimovsov about?

370
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.

371
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Spoiler alert.

372
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah.

373
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?

374
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I mean, the father gets murdered.

375
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And the question is who did it?

376
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Who's responsible for it?

377
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.

378
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But it's responsibility for a murder.

379
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That's what we're talking about.

380
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And there's a bunch of brothers, each of whom has pretty good motivation

381
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
for having murdered the father.

382
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The father's a jerk.

383
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I mean, he's, you know, if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy.

384
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He's a force of chaos.

385
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And he's nasty in all sorts of ways.

386
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But still, it's not good to murder people.

387
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So what's the view of Dostoyevsky?

388
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I mean, it's this intense exploration of what it means to be involved in various ways

389
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
with an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.

390
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?

391
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?

392
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And how even through this kind of action, you can achieve some kind of salvation?

393
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's Dostoyevsky's word for it.

394
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You can, but salvation here and now, not like you live some afterlife

395
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
where you're, you know, paradise for eternity.

396
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Who cares about that?

397
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Says one of the characters.

398
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That doesn't make my life now any good.

399
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And it doesn't justify any of the bad things that happen in my life now.

400
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What matters is, can we live well in the face of these things that we do

401
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and have to take responsibility for?

402
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So it's this intense exploration of notions and gradations of guilt

403
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and responsibility and the possibility of love and salvation in the face of those.

404
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It is incredibly human work.

405
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I think Dostoyevsky is the opposite of Sartre.

406
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And let me just, I think it's so fascinating.

407
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't know anybody else who notices this, but Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoyevsky

408
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
when he's developing his view.

409
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's close to a passage.

410
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It doesn't appear quite in this way.

411
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.

412
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's in the form of an argument.

413
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Sartre puts it in the form of an argument.

414
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
He says, look, there's a conditional statement is true.

415
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

416
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And then there's a second premise.

417
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
There is no God.

418
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's Sartre's view.

419
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I mean, he's an atheist.

420
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
There is no God.

421
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Conclusion?

422
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Everything is permitted.

423
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And that's Sartre's radical freedom.

424
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And if you think about the structure of the brothers Karamazov,

425
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I think Dostoyevsky, though he never says it this way,

426
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
would run the argument differently.

427
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's a modus tolens instead of a modus bonens.

428
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The argument for Dostoyevsky would go like this.

429
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah, conditional statement.

430
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

431
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But look at your life.

432
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Not everything is permitted.

433
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You do horrible, atrocious things.

434
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Like, be involved in the death of your father.

435
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And there is a price to pay.

436
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's not a livable moment to take, to have to take responsibility,

437
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
to have to recognize that you're at fault,

438
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
or you're somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you were

439
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and letting that happen or bringing it about that it does happen,

440
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
is to pay a price.

441
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way that everything is permitted.

442
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Look at the facts of your existence.

443
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So not everything is permitted.

444
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Therefore, there is a God.

445
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And the presence of a God for Dostoyevsky, I think, is just found

446
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
in this fact that when we do bad things, we feel guilty for them.

447
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We find ourselves to be responsible for things,

448
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
even when we didn't intend to do them,

449
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
but we just allowed ourselves to be involved in them.

450
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And the nature of God for Dostoyevsky is, I mean, unclear.

451
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I mean, it's a very complex exploration in itself.

452
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And he basically, God speaks through several of his characters in complicated ways.

453
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So it's not like a trivial version of God.

454
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's totally not trivial.

455
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And it's not a being that exists outside of time.

456
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
None of that is sort of relevant for Dostoyevsky.

457
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.

458
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to us,

459
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
which is the mood of joy?

460
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but so I'm a Russian speaker.

461
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And one of the, I kind of listened to my heart.

462
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And what my heart says is I need to take on this project.

463
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So there's a couple of famous translators of Dostoyevsky and Dostoyevsky

464
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
that live in Paris currently.

465
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So I'm going to take the journey.

466
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoyevsky, about Dostoyevsky

467
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and like a series of conversations.

468
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And the reason I fell in love with this idea is I just realized,

469
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
in translating from Russian to English, how deep philosophical,

470
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
how much deep philosophical thinking is required.

471
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Just like single sentences, they spent like weeks debating single sentences.

472
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So, and all of that is part of a journey to Russia for several reasons.

473
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But I just, I want to explore something in me that long still understand

474
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and to connect with the roots where I come from.

475
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So, maybe can you comment, whether it's on the Russian side

476
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
or the German side or other French side,

477
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
is there something in your own explorations of these philosophies

478
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
that you find that you miss because you don't deeply know the language?

479
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Or like how important is it to understand the language?

480
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Good. I think it's super important.

481
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I'm always embarrassed that I don't know more languages

482
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and don't know the languages I know as well as I would like to.

483
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But there's a way in.

484
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So I do think different languages allow you to think in different ways.

485
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
There's a sort of a mode of existence, a way of being that's captured by a language

486
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
that it makes certain ways of thinking about yourself or others more natural.

487
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And it closes off other ways of thinking about yourself and others.

488
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.

489
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The Heidegger, who is this philosopher that I'm interested in says at one point,

490
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
language is the house of being.

491
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And I think that means something like it's by living in a language

492
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that you come to understand or that possibilities for understanding

493
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
what it is to be you and others and anything are opened up.

494
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And different languages open up different possibilities.

495
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce

496
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories.

497
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin

498
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
to truly to help you understand maybe fall in love with the words.

499
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of the language.

500
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's understanding something much deeper.

501
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The music of the language or something.

502
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The music of the ideas.

503
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Absolutely. Something like that.

504
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's very hard to say exactly what that is.

505
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce, read some sentences.

506
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They have a different cadence.

507
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
They have a different tonality.

508
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They have different music to use your word.

509
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And all of a sudden you think about them differently.

510
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you when they're read in certain ways.

511
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That's what great actors can do.

512
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But I think language is rich like that.

513
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language

514
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
when we think about its logical form.

515
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
When we think about the sort of claims of philosophical logic that you can make

516
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
or how do you translate this proposition into some symbolic form.

517
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think that's part of what goes on in language.

518
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can

519
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
when great poets or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect

520
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
it's way more than that.

521
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in.

522
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is

523
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I feel like some of the ideas that are conveyed through language

524
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
actually can be put outside of language.

525
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian

526
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
but for an English audience and not rely purely on translators.

527
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
There would of course be translators there that help me dance through this mess of language.

528
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But also like my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian to English back and forth

529
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
for an English speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience.

530
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So not this pure, this is Russian, it's going to be translated to English

531
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
or this is English, it's going to be translated to Russian.

532
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But dance back and forth and try to share with people who don't speak one of the languages

533
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
the music that they're missing and sort of almost hear that music

534
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
because if you're sitting in another room and you hear the music through the wall

535
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I get a sense of it.

536
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human being.

537
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And I wonder whether it's possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas

538
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
in a way that can be conveyed to people who don't speak that particular language.

539
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I think it's a super exciting project.

540
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I look forward to following it.

541
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'll tell you one thing that does happen.

542
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So we read Dostoevsky in translation.

543
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room which is super helpful.

544
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But I also encourage my students to some of them will have different translations than others.

545
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And that can be really helpful for the non-native speaker

546
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:51,000
because by paying attention to the places where translators diverge in their translations

547
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
of a given word or a phrase or something like that

548
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have in English

549
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated.

550
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And then you can start to ask about what those differences are.

551
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And I think there's a kind of magic to it.

552
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be

553
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
for people who really grew up in them especially who speak them as natives.

554
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And that's a really powerful thing that actually doesn't exist enough of

555
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:33,000
is, for example, for Dostoevsky most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators.

556
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And there's a lot of discussions about who did it better and so on.

557
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But I would love to, I'm a computer science person, I would love to do a diff

558
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
where you automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying

559
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and use that like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences.

560
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.

561
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I heard the individual translators and interviews and blog posts

562
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and articles discuss particular phrases that they differ on

563
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
but like to do that for an entire book, that's a fascinating exploration.

564
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
As an English speaker, just to read the differences in the translations

565
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,000
you probably can get some deep understanding of ideas in those books

566
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
by seeing the struggle of the translators to capture that idea.

567
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That's a really interesting idea.

568
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Absolutely.

569
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And you can do that for other projects and other languages too.

570
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
One of the, I don't know, I have this weird huge range of interests

571
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
and some days I'll find myself reading about something.

572
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
At one point I was interested in 14th century German mysticism.

573
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Okay, turns out there's somebody who's written volumes and volumes about this.

574
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
He's fantastic.

575
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And I was interested in reading Meister Eckhart.

576
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I wanted to know what was interesting about him.

577
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who's the great scholar of this period, made

578
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this,

579
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
he translated Christianity into the vernacular.

580
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He started giving sermons in German to the peasants.

581
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Sermons used to be in Latin and nobody could speak Latin.

582
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don't know?

583
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So he translated it into German.

584
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
But in doing it, the resources of the German language are different from the resources

585
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
of the Latin language.

586
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And there's a word in Middle High German, Grund, which we translated as ground.

587
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And it's got this earthy feel to it.

588
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out of

589
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty to it.

590
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And there's no Latin word for that.

591
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But in Eckhart's interpretation of Christianity, Grund, that's like the fundamental thing.

592
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You don't understand God until you understand the way in which he is our ground.

593
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets a kind of German cant that makes sense to the people who speak German

594
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and that reveals something totally different about what you could think that form of existence was

595
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done in Latin.

596
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah, that's fascinating.

597
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So, okay, we talked about Dostoyevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature.

598
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as a way to explore human nature.

599
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So he is probably my favorite existentialist, probably one of the more accessible existentialists.

600
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And like you said, one of the people who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.

601
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So what are your thoughts about Camus?

602
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What role does he play in the story of existentialism?

603
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So, I find Camus totally fascinating.

604
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I really do.

605
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And for years, I didn't teach Camus because the famous thing that you're referring to, the myth of Sisyphus,

606
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
which is a sort of essay, it's published as a book, super accessible, really fascinating.

607
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
He's a great writer, really engaging.

608
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
The opening line is something like, there is but one truly significant philosophical question.

609
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And that is the question of suicide.

610
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And I thought, I can't teach my 18-year-olds of, you know, like how...

611
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah.

612
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I just thought, that's terrible.

613
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Like, how can I...

614
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I mean, it's not wrong.

615
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Like, that's a...

616
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But do I want to bring that into the classroom?

617
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And so I read it...

618
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I read the essay.

619
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I avoided it for a long time because...

620
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Just because of that line.

621
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And I thought, I'm not going to be able to make sense of this in a way that will be helpful for anyone.

622
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I sat down to read it.

623
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I thought, I've got to really confront it.

624
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And I read it and it's incredibly engaging.

625
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I mean, it's really, really beautiful.

626
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And Camus was against suicide, which just turns out to be good.

627
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I was happy about that.

628
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence amounts to.

629
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.

630
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And it's being absurd as a kind of technical term for him.

631
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole presents itself to you as if it's got a meaning.

632
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
But really it doesn't.

633
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So there's this tension between the way things seem to be on their surface

634
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and what really turns out to be true about them.

635
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And he gives these great examples.

636
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You probably remember these.

637
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He says, there you are.

638
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You're walking along the street and there's a plate glass window in a building.

639
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And through the window, you see somebody talking on a cell phone.

640
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I mean, I imagine it as a cell phone, but Camus for didn't.

641
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But you see somebody talking on a cell phone and he's animated.

642
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
He's talking a lot as if things really meant something.

643
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And yet Camus says, it's a dumb show.

644
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And it's not dumb in the sense, just in the sense that it's stupid.

645
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
It's dumb in the sense that it's silent.

646
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It presents itself as if it's got some significance and yet its significance is withheld from you.

647
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And he says, that's what our lives are like.

648
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Everything in our lives presents themselves to us as if it's got a significance, but it doesn't.

649
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's absurd.

650
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And then he says, really what our lives are like?

651
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
They're like the lives of Sisyphus.

652
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Just day after day.

653
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You do the same thing.

654
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You wake up at a certain time.

655
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You get on the bus.

656
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You go to work.

657
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You take your lunch break.

658
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You get off.

659
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I have a colleague who once said to me something like this.

660
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It was about October or so in the fall semester.

661
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I said, how's it going, Dick?

662
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
He said, well, you know how it is.

663
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I'm just going through.

664
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And that's the way my life is.

665
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And Camus thinks that experience, which you can sometimes have, reveals something true

666
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
about what human lives are like.

667
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus who rolls this boulder up the hill

668
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
from morning till night.

669
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And then at night he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom.

670
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Over the course of the night he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.

671
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life.

672
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Like we're condemned to our lives, but we do have one bit of freedom and it's the only

673
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
thing that we can hang on to.

674
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It's the freedom to stick it to the gods who put us in this position by embracing this

675
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
existence rather than giving up and committing suicide.

676
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And I thought, well, it's kind of a happy ending.

677
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But I also thought it's a dim view of what our existence amounts to.

678
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So I think there's something fascinating about that.

679
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But what I came to believe and I tried to write about this once, I know you read the thing

680
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
about a liveness that I published once.

681
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
That's secretly a criticism of Camus.

682
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't think I mentioned Camus in there.

683
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong or he's missed some important aspect of it.

684
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Because in Camus' view, when you experience your day as sort of going on in this deadening way

685
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and you're just doing the things that you always do, the way you always do them.

686
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
For Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.

687
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
But I think there's some aspect, at least for me.

688
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And maybe he just didn't feel this or didn't have access to it.

689
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Maybe others don't.

690
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But for me, there's an extra part to it, which is somehow that, yes, that's the way things are.

691
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And it's inadequate.

692
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And there's something that's missing from that aspect of our existence that could be there.

693
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And it feels like our lives are not about just putting up with that and sticking it to the gods by embracing it.

694
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
But seeking that absent part of it.

695
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The part that's recognizable in its absence in your experience of that.

696
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And that's what I think.

697
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when you feel truly alive.

698
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And that's what you mean by the word aliveness, which is a fascinating and a powerful word.

699
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah, that's what I mean by it.

700
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I mean, I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when they really felt alive.

701
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And it could happen in a moment when, I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord.

702
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Or maybe you feel it in that moment where you grab for the hand on the first date and the gesture is reciprocated.

703
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Or maybe you feel it in some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing or watching somebody else do a peak athletic thing.

704
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But I think there are moments when it feels like it's not like the way Camu is describing things.

705
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And it's better because of that.

706
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about going to a darker territory, is to think about suicide.

707
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And I've known people in my life who suffer from clinical depression.

708
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And, you know, whatever the chemistry is in our brain, there is a certain kind of feeling that is to be depressed.

709
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Where you look in the mirror and ask, do I want to kill myself today?

710
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,000
This is the question that Camu asks, this question, this philosophical question.

711
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And there is people who, when they're depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill myself or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter.

712
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is, that's chemistry in our mind.

713
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And then on the flip side of that, for me, I've had some low points, but I've been very fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression.

714
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great music or any of that.

715
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.

716
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Like, as you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it's cold.

717
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And for some reason, the coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration.

718
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I don't know, there was a joy in that.

719
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I can't put it into words, but I just felt great.

720
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there's a nice breeze and it's amazing.

721
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.

722
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:54,000
That seems like I'm getting some nice dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life.

723
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And that is the source of aliveness.

724
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:05,000
However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.

725
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And so the one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression.

726
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of suicide.

727
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today?

728
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way often.

729
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Like basically every day is, you know, what if I die today?

730
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's more like contemplating your mortality every single day.

731
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day.

732
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You know, it just reminds me how amazing life is.

733
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And that's chemistry. I don't know what that is, but that's certainly not some kind of philosophical decision I made.

734
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I've been given of the dopamine.

735
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So that question of suicide.

736
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
By the way, do you find that formulation of the question of existentialism?

737
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I know you didn't want to teach it because obviously suicide is a very difficult word, especially for young minds.

738
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But do you think that's a useful formulation of the question of existentialism?

739
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide.

740
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I think there is something to it.

741
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:42,000
If you read the question as the question, what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?

742
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
That's a deep question.

743
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah, that's a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they ought to continue to live that life.

744
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
The famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending execution.

745
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I think there's something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness and the vulnerability of one's existence

746
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
is super important.

747
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And I think that if we didn't have that, our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.

748
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
If they weren't risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose.

749
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And it's only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance that they do.

750
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So yeah, I think not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the questions at the core of existentialism.

751
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it.

752
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is an action.

753
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn't make sense because you know, imagine you're in like a hotel and you're saying the room I'm in sucks.

754
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But like there's other rooms, so like maybe explore those other rooms, maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms.

755
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Like basically embracing the fact that you don't know everything and there's, you need time to explore everything.

756
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It's like once you've explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision, but it's unfair to make a decision.

757
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's, I would say, unethical to make a decision until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel.

758
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah. And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.

759
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:47,000
There's one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide.

760
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
He's asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that's worth living in.

761
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And I think that character is, as you say, very ill.

762
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And it's possible and often because, as you say, of, you know, brain chemistry, physiology.

763
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So there's certainly a physical ground to that situation, to that condition.

764
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
But I think it is possible for someone to be in that situation.

765
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I think that Ivan Karamazov, who's the character who's asking this question, is, you know, maybe let's say chemically depressed or something like that.

766
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But I think there's more to it too.

767
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And I think that Dostoevsky's real view is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on its own.

768
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Like the way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves from others.

769
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:57,000
The way we care for the lives that we lead affects the chemistry of our brain, which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.

770
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved, is going to come through the love of his brother Alyosha.

771
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.

772
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors is Herman Hesse.

773
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Do you ever include him in our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?

774
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I haven't.

775
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Maybe I should.

776
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
What should I read?

777
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
What should I think about including?

778
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
No, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.

779
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
There's a existentialist ideal pervading most of his work.

780
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But there's more of like with Siddhartha, there's more almost like a Buddhist sort of like watch the river and become the river.

781
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
This kind of idea that what it means to truly experience the moment.

782
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
There is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it's not just about,

783
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,000
we've been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen, like you said, from Nietzsche.

784
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Like what it means to really take in the world and experience the moment.

785
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:23,000
So he's very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience the full absurdity of the moment.

786
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And for him, I'm starting to forget, Steppenwolf I think is humor.

787
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's part of the absurdity, which I think modern day internet explores very well with memes and so on.

788
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that's able to deal with absurdity.

789
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You got to like laugh at it.

790
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you're absolutely right.

791
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Kierkegaard, who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and then so on, is actually an incredibly funny writer.

792
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school who left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer.

793
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
He's a very successful guy.

794
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And then he came back 25 years later and wrote, finished his dissertation.

795
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
And I was the reader on the dissertation.

796
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
There may be a conflict of interest, I'm not quite sure.

797
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But his dissertation was about, he called it Kierkegaard and the funny, which is kind of a funny title.

798
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yeah.

799
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading, Kierkegaard does have this idea that there's something destabilizing about humor

800
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:48,000
that's crucial to the sort of the important possibilities for us.

801
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And so there's the idea that there's a moment when a joke is being set up, when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground.

802
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And then the punchline comes and the rug is pulled out from under you.

803
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And for a moment, it's like you're falling.

804
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:17,000
There's nothing supporting you until you're captured by your totally new understanding of what was going on.

805
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to it.

806
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And that's like the riskiness.

807
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.

808
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,000
If there aren't risks in your life, if your life is totally safe, then there's no possibility of significance.

809
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And so I think on Eric's reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning

810
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:54,000
with the experience of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant.

811
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it's got a kind of salience for you.

812
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Speaking of jokes and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature.

813
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So existentialism in film and literature.

814
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism, was experienced in the great work of art, modern work of art called Big Lebowski.

815
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't know if you've ever seen that film, but there's a group of nihilists in that film.

816
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
They're just like, they don't care about anything.

817
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I think they happen to be German, at least they have German accents.

818
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,000
So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film?

819
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And if you would all ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play.

820
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context.

821
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And I did actually re-watch it not so long ago.

822
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
We have kids.

823
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I thought maybe it's time.

824
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It wasn't really time for the 11-year-old.

825
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
No.

826
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So somewhat inappropriate.

827
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
But I have never taught that film, so I'd have to think more.

828
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
We could talk about it.

829
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.

830
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Okay.

831
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
So I would love to because there is a, feels like there's a philosophical depth to that film.

832
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So there's a person that just the main character.

833
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The Jeff Bridges character.

834
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Jeff Bridges character.

835
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah.

836
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:27,000
He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians and he just kind of walks around in a very relaxed way.

837
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And irradiates both a love for life, but also just an acceptance of like it is what it is kind of philosophy.

838
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And then there's a bunch of characters that have very busy lives trying to do some big projects that are dramatic in some way.

839
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Make some huge amounts of money.

840
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot by Esteschi in a certain kind of sense.

841
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And then there's these players, I mean they're phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don't care to enjoy life.

842
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
They want to mess with life in some kind of way.

843
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And of course there's interesting personalities that, what is it, Jesus, the bowler.

844
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless.

845
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And then there's the John Goodman character that's talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely and so on.

846
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world.

847
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.

848
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Okay.

849
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
All right.

850
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Good.

851
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Well, that's helpful.

852
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Thank you for reminding me of all that.

853
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I think, so one thing to say is that the nihilists, the group of nihilists who call themselves nihilists,

854
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I think they've got a bad misinterpretation of what nihilism is supposed to be.

855
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And this happened actually in the 20s.

856
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:16,000
There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot of Nietzsche.

857
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Nietzsche, you know, was a kind of hero for the Nazis even, I think based on a pretty bad misunderstanding of what he was up to.

858
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first and they were students.

859
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
They'd read a lot of Nietzsche and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.

860
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The only way that there's any significance in life is through our will to sort of powerfully bring something about.

861
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And if we're going to do that in a way that reflects the fact that nothing means anything, then what we should do is take these things, these actions that people always thought were bad,

862
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and do them and show that there's nothing wrong with doing them.

863
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And so they decided they would murder someone, not because they were angry at them, just someone they'd never met.

864
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It was important that it was someone they'd never met.

865
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It was a totally unmotivated act.

866
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And they thought, we'll embrace nihilism by showing that we can act in such a way as to do something that morality thinks is bad and through our will bring it about that we desire to do it.

867
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
For no reason that has anything to do with its potentially being interpretable as good.

868
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And I think that's a terrible misreading of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism is.

869
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I mean, I think read that against the Miles Davis thing.

870
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Miles Davis' aim is to creatively bring it about that something works well in a situation where he is kind of constrained.

871
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
So they thought two things.

872
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:01,000
One, there are no constraints at all, not even the constraints of the situation that we find ourselves in.

873
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And two, we only become the beings that we really are when we act against what you might have thought the constraints were.

874
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And I just think that's a bad misreading of what that kind of nihilism is up to.

875
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski has got that kind of bad misreading.

876
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
But then the major characters are much more interesting.

877
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Go ahead, if you want to say something.

878
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So there's some kind of apathy to their particular nihilism.

879
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy as a philosophy part of that nihilism?

880
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Sort of like from an existentialist perspective, how important is it to care about stuff, like really take on life?

881
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:56,000
What does existentialism have to say about just sitting back and just not caring?

882
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Excellent.

883
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
So apathy is like a really important word.

884
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The Greek word is apathy.

885
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It means without passions.

886
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier, really thought that passions are what get in the way if you're living well.

887
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Because to live well, you have to think clearly about what you should do.

888
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And you shouldn't let your resentments and your angers and your petty animosities direct your behavior.

889
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.

890
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So Stoicism, again, huge caricature.

891
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
But it's an aim not to care because caring is bad.

892
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And there's certain forms of existentialism, certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoyevsky and Heidegger and Sart in his own way.

893
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing, where what's crucial about us is that we do care.

894
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Heidegger says care is the being of Dasein.

895
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Dasein is his name for us.

896
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.

897
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And you can't not do that.

898
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
You can pretend you're not doing it, but you're just caring in a different way.

899
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It's like Sart saying you can pretend you're not taking responsibility.

900
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Or you could pretend that you don't have to make a decision.

901
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
That is making a decision.

902
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Not caring is a way of caring.

903
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in think that we do care.

904
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That's constitutive of what it is to be us.

905
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And so they all think that the Stoics got it wrong.

906
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:49,000
But that leaves open a huge range of moves about how we inhabit that existence well.

907
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Let me ask about Ayn Rand.

908
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Okay.

909
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So it just so happens that I've gotten, she's entered a few conversations in this podcast.

910
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And just looking at academic philosophy or just philosophers in general, they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.

911
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Do you have a sense of why that is?

912
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Does she ever come into play, her ideas of objectivism come into play of discussions of a good life from the perspective of existentialism?

913
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
In how you teach it and how you think about it?

914
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Is she somebody who you find it all interesting?

915
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
So no, I don't think she is.

916
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.

917
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I read it in high school.

918
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I read The Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged.

919
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
But that's at this point a very long time ago.

920
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I think I read something about objective epistemology or something too.

921
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So, you know, my view about her could be based on a total misunderstanding of what she's up to.

922
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But sort of my caricature of her and tell me if I've got it wrong is that she's sort of motivated by a kind of,

923
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism, but maybe let's, in the context of our discussion, tie it back to Sartre,

924
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:22,000
a kind of view according to which we're the being who has to contend with the fact that we're radically free to do stuff.

925
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And we're just not being courageous or brave enough when we don't do that.

926
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And the people to admire are the people who make stuff out of nothing.

927
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So maybe that's a bad caricature.

928
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
No, no, no.

929
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I think, no, I think that's pretty accurate.

930
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I'm not, again, very knowledgeable about the full depth of her philosophy.

931
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But I think she takes a view of the world that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions,

932
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:59,000
but makes stronger statements about epistemology that, first of all, everything is knowable.

933
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And there's some, you should always operate through reason.

934
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Like reason is very important.

935
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's like you start with a few axioms and you build on top of that.

936
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And the axioms that everybody should operate on are the same.

937
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Again, reality is objective.

938
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It's not subjective.

939
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So from that, you can derive the entirety of how humans should behave at the individual level and at the societal level.

940
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And there's a few conclusions.

941
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
She would talk about virtue of selfishness and sort of a lot of people use that to dismiss her look.

942
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
She's very selfish and so on.

943
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
She actually meant something very different.

944
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's more like the Sartre thing.

945
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Take responsibility for yourself.

946
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Understand what forces you're operating under and make the best of this life.

947
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And that's how you can be the best member of societies by making the best life you can.

948
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Just focus on yourself, fix your own problems first and then that will make you the best member of society,

949
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.

950
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think the reason she's disliked, obviously on the philosophy side, she's disliked because a little bit like Nietzsche,

951
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
she's like, she's literary.

952
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I think the reason she's publicly disliked in sort of public conversations is because of how sure she is of herself.

953
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
So that which is some of the philosophy been known to do, like make very strong statements like hell is other people,

954
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
but she was making very strong statements about basically everything.

955
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:54,000
The reason I bring her up is she is an influential thinker that is not for some reason often brought up as such.

956
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's not acknowledged how influential she is.

957
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I was recently looking at like a list of the most important women of the 20th century in terms of thought,

958
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
not science, but like thought and she wasn't in that list.

959
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I see this time and time again and it doesn't make sense to me why she's so kind of dismissed

960
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,000
because clearly she's an author of some of the most read books ever

961
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and she clearly had very strong ideas that should be contended with.

962
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:40,000
That's why it kind of didn't make sense to me because she's also a creature of her time and an important one.

963
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
She's a creation of the Soviet Union, somebody who left because of that.

964
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:55,000
So some of the strength of her ideas has to do with how much she dislikes that particular philosophy and way of life.

965
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,000
But also she's a creature of like Sartre and like that whole like Nietzsche and so on.

966
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Now one of the other criticisms is she doesn't integrate herself into this history.

967
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
She keeps basically kind of implying that she's purely original in all her thoughts

968
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
even though she's kind of citing a lot of other people.

969
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing as if they are truly original and they're not.

970
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It is interesting and also what's interesting about her is she is a woman.

971
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
She is a strong feminist and it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir,

972
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:42,000
it seems like she's a very important person in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.

973
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Interesting.

974
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Yeah.

975
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Well, so I mean, I don't have a lot to add.

976
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I will just say this.

977
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I mean, the way she and Beauvoir seemed to me from your description of her and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago,

978
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
they seem pretty opposite from one another.

979
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Like one of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir is that she takes seriously the thing that Sartre didn't,

980
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:20,000
which is our thrownness, which is the sense in which we're born into a situation that's already got a significance for her.

981
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman.

982
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints or at least there shouldn't be.

983
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
We're pretty close as privileged white males.

984
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

985
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
If we just get rid of the last bits of them, we would be God like we're supposed to be.

986
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah.

987
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.

988
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I think she reckons, one's not born but becomes a woman, she says.

989
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So how does that happen?

990
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Well, you're thrown into your culture and your culture starts treating you in a certain way because of your gender.

991
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And that starts to form your understanding and your experience of things.

992
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And by the time you're grown up, well, you're pretty well formed by that.

993
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
That seems a fact.

994
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It's a fact about Sartre too, though it was harder for him to notice it because he was formed into his privilege.

995
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
But the world reminds us of our thrownness for some more than others.

996
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yes, absolutely.

997
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And for people who have to contend on a daily basis with the fact that the social position they're thrown into is one that negates them.

998
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Or one that oppresses them.

999
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Or one that sort of pushes them to the side in some way or another.

1000
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I mean, the black experience is interesting in this respect too.

1001
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
France Fanon, who's a contemporary of Sartre and Beauvoir's, writes about it.

1002
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And it's very familiar, the things that he's saying now, but he writes back in the 50s about being a black man in Paris and getting on an elevator with a woman alone.

1003
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And how her reaction to him, not knowing him, not having any views about any reason to have any views about him, sort of puts him in a particular social position with respect to her.

1004
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And if you don't have that experience, it's much harder to recognize the way in which what we're thrown into is something we might not have chosen.

1005
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:40,000
So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence, which as you describe Ayn Rand's views, she sounds more like Sartre.

1006
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:47,000
She sounds more like either it's not an aspect of our existence, or at least we ought to sort of aim at it's not being.

1007
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Yeah, almost act as if it's not.

1008
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

1009
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Act as if it's not.

1010
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And so I think from my point of view, I don't pretend that I'm explaining the public reception of her.

1011
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her in this intellectual context.

1012
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
From my point of view, that's something big to miss.

1013
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And the ambition to think that really what's happening is that we're all the same.

1014
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
We're all rational beings.

1015
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:25,000
We're all beings who if we just got the axioms of our existence right and made good judgments and reasoned in an appropriate way would optimize ourselves.

1016
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:33,000
That feels to me like a kind of natural end point of the philosophical tradition.

1017
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view that helps us in that direction and the enlightenment moves us further in that direction.

1018
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:52,000
But from my point of view, that movement has led us astray because it's missed something really important that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.

1019
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Yeah, it misses the music.

1020
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Exactly.

1021
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It misses the music.

1022
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Let's talk about thrownness.

1023
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.

1024
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Yeah.

1025
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So can we talk about Heidegger?

1026
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Okay.

1027
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So who is this philosopher?

1028
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
What are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?

1029
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Okay.

1030
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
So Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.

1031
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I do know when he was born, 1889.

1032
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I know that only by accident.

1033
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein and Austrian philosopher was born and the same year that Hitler was born.

1034
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
So if I've remembered my dates right and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.

1035
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.

1036
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And it's interesting that the three of them were born at the same time.

1037
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities.

1038
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
But then it's also interesting that Heidegger was a Nazi.

1039
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I mean, this is a very disturbing fact about his personal political background.

1040
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And so it's something that anyone who thinks that things that he said might be interesting has got to contend with.

1041
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria.

1042
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Wittgenstein is Austria also.

1043
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:14,000
But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi, you have to remember, I mean, there was millions of Nazis too.

1044
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So they're parts of their, that's the history of the world.

1045
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:26,000
There's a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis in that part of history.

1046
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Absolutely.

1047
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And one of the discussion points is, well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?

1048
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I mean, he went to parties with them and stuff.

1049
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Or did he really believe in the ideology?

1050
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And that's a choice point.

1051
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And we could talk about it if you want.

1052
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
He held a political position.

1053
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
That's one of the relevant parts.

1054
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.

1055
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
That's like the president of the university.

1056
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And that was in Germany, all the universities are state universities.

1057
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And so that's a political appointment.

1058
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Can we just pause on this point?

1059
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah.

1060
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:13,000
From an existentialist perspective, what's the role for standing up to evil?

1061
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So, I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say about these things because he was a bit of a political figure.

1062
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Like, do you have a responsibility not just for your decisions, but if the world you see around you is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside is ethical.

1063
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Do you have a responsibility to stand up to that even if it costs you your life or your well-being?

1064
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:50,000
You ask from an existential perspective and there's lots of different positions that you could have.

1065
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So, let me tell you something in the area of what I think I might believe, which comes out of this tradition.

1066
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And it's this.

1067
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:13,000
If you live in a community where people are being dragged down by the norms of the community rather than elevated, then there's two things that you have to recognize.

1068
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:19,000
One is that you bear some responsibility for that, not necessarily because you chose it.

1069
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Maybe you reviled it.

1070
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Maybe you were against it.

1071
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:29,000
But there's some way in which we all act in accordance with the norms of our culture.

1072
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
We all give in to them in some way or another.

1073
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And if those norms are broken, then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves to be responsible for broken norms.

1074
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
We've become responsible for broken norms.

1075
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And I do think you have to face up to that.

1076
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I think that let's just take gender norms.

1077
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Maybe the gender norms are broken.

1078
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Maybe the way men and women treat one another or the way men treat women is broken.

1079
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Maybe it is.

1080
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I'm not making a substantive claim.

1081
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I'm just saying, lots of people say it is.

1082
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:18,000
And if you're in a culture where those norms take root, you don't get to just isolate yourself and pull yourself out of the culture and think, I don't have any responsibility.

1083
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
You're already a part of the culture.

1084
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Even if you're isolating yourself from it, that's a way of rejecting the sort of part you play in the culture.

1085
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
But it's not a way of getting behind it.

1086
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Now you're playing that role differently.

1087
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
You're saying, I don't want to take responsibility for what's going on around me.

1088
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,000
And that's a way of taking responsibility by refusing to do it.

1089
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So I think we're implicated in whatever's going on around us.

1090
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And if we're going to do anything in our lives, we ought to recognize that.

1091
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Recognize that even in situations where you maybe didn't decide to do it, you could be part of bringing other people down and then devote yourself to trying to figure out how to act differently so that the norms update themselves.

1092
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And I think this is not a criticism of people.

1093
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
But Aleosha, who we mentioned in the Brothers Karamazov, he's a character.

1094
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
He's a kind of saintly character in the Brothers Karamazov.

1095
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But one crucial moment in that story is when he realizes how awful he's been being to someone without ever even intending to do that.

1096
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It's Grushenka, who's this sort of fascinating woman.

1097
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And she's a very erotic woman.

1098
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
She's sort of sexual.

1099
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And Aleosha, in my reading of it, is kind of attracted to her.

1100
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But he's a young kid.

1101
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
He's 20 or whatever.

1102
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And he's kind of embarrassed about it.

1103
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And he lives in the monastery and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest and he's kind of embarrassed by it.

1104
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
So what does he do?

1105
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Every time they run across one another in the street, he averts his gaze.

1106
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And why is he doing that?

1107
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Because he's kind of embarrassed.

1108
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
But how does Grushenka experience it?

1109
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Well, she knows she's a fallen woman.

1110
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And she knows that Aleosha has this other position in society.

1111
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So her read on it is, he's passing judgment on me.

1112
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
He can see that he doesn't want to be associated with me.

1113
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
He can see that I'm a fallen woman.

1114
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
He knows that in order to maintain his purity,

1115
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
he's got to avoid me.

1116
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
That's not what Aleosha intended to do.

1117
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
But that's the way it's experienced.

1118
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And so there's this way.

1119
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
He comes to recognize, oh my God,

1120
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,000
like what I'm supposed to do is love people in Dostoevsky's view of things.

1121
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.

1122
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I'm making her life worse.

1123
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I'm making her feel terrible about herself.

1124
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And if I actually came to know her, I'd recognize her condition is difficult.

1125
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
She's living a difficult life.

1126
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
She's making hard choices.

1127
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
And why don't I see that in her face instead of this other thing

1128
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
that's making me want to avoid her?

1129
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And that's a huge moment.

1130
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
But the idea is that we're implicated in bringing other people down,

1131
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
whether we want to be or not.

1132
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
And that's our condition.

1133
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,000
The requirement to understand that is to be almost to a radical degree,

1134
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
be empathetic and to listen to the world.

1135
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.

1136
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It's not so simple.

1137
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
All of this is messy.

1138
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
For example, this is me talking.

1139
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's clear to me that, for example, the woke culture has bullying built into it,

1140
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
has some elements of the same kind of evil built into it.

1141
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
And when you're part of the wave of wokeness standing up for social rights,

1142
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
you also have to listen and think, are we going too far?

1143
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Are we hurting people?

1144
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Are we doing the same things that others, that we're fighting against,

1145
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
that others were doing in the past?

1146
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
So it's not simple.

1147
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Once you see that there's evil being done, that it's easy to fix.

1148
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:27,000
No, in our society, there's something about our human nature

1149
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,000
that just too easily stops listening to the world, to empathizing with the world.

1150
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And we label things as evil.

1151
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This is through human history.

1152
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
This is evil.

1153
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You mentioned tribes.

1154
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
This religious belief is evil.

1155
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And so we have to fight it and we become certain and dogmatic about it.

1156
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.

1157
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It seems like a life that accepts and responsibility for the norms we're in

1158
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
has to constantly be sort of questioning yourself

1159
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
and questioning, like listening to the world fully and richly

1160
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:13,000
without being weighed down by any one sort of realization.

1161
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You just always constantly have to be thinking about the world.

1162
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Am I wrong?

1163
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?

1164
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I mean, the very last thing you said,

1165
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
you've constantly got to be thinking about the world.

1166
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You've constantly got to be listening.

1167
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
You've constantly got to be attending.

1168
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And it's not simple.

1169
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
All that sounds exactly right to me.

1170
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And the phrase that rings through my head is another one from the Brothers Karamazov.

1171
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Dimitri, this passionate, sort of sometimes violent brother

1172
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,000
who is also sort of deeply cares.

1173
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Because he's passionate, he's sort of got care through and through,

1174
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
but it's breaking him apart.

1175
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
He says at one point, God and the devil are fighting in the battlefield

1176
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
is the heart of man.

1177
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And I just think, yeah, it's not simple.

1178
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And the idea that there might be a purely good way of doing things

1179
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
is just not our condition.

1180
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Everything we do is going to be sort of undermined by some aspect of it.

1181
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
There's not going to be a kind of pure good in human existence.

1182
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And so it's sort of required that we're going to have to be empathetic,

1183
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:32,000
that we're going to have to recognize that others are dealing with that just as we are.

1184
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
So I apologize for distracting us.

1185
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
We were talking about Heidegger.

1186
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And the reason we were distracted is he happened to also be a Nazi.

1187
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
He nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.

1188
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
What are the ideas he's brought to the world?

1189
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Okay.

1190
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So that's a big, huge question.

1191
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.

1192
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks,

1193
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
and he's not really wrong to think this,

1194
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward,

1195
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
maybe even from the pre-Socratics forward,

1196
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
from like the sixth century BC to now,

1197
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
has been motivated by a certain kind,

1198
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
or has been grounded on a certain kind of assumption

1199
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
that it didn't have the right to make,

1200
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and that it's led us astray,

1201
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
and that until we understand the way in which it's led us astray,

1202
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
we're not going to be able to get to grips with the condition we now find ourselves in.

1203
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
So let me start with what he thinks the condition we now find ourselves in is.

1204
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.

1205
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I'm just going to sort of mush it all together for the purposes of today.

1206
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things that we need to contend with

1207
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,000
when we think about what it is to be us now

1208
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
is that the right name for our age is a technological age.

1209
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Now, what does it mean for our age to be a technological age?

1210
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Well, it means that we have an understanding of what it is for anything at all to be at all,

1211
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
that we never really chose that sort of animating the way we live our lives,

1212
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
that's animating our understanding of ourselves and everything else,

1213
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
that is quite limited,

1214
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
organized around the idea that to be something

1215
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:41,000
is to be what's sitting there as an infinitely flexible reserve

1216
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
to be optimized and made efficient.

1217
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And Heidegger thinks that that's not just the way we think of silicon circuits,

1218
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
or the river when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it,

1219
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
we're optimizing the flow of the river so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible

1220
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
and we can use it in any way at all.

1221
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
It's the way we understand ourselves, too.

1222
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:19,000
We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential that needs to be made efficient and optimized.

1223
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And when I talk with my students about it, I ask them,

1224
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
like, what's your calendar look like?

1225
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
What's the goal of your day?

1226
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Is it to get as many things into it as possible?

1227
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Is it to feel like I've failed unless I've made my life so efficient

1228
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
that I'm doing this and this and this and this and this,

1229
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
that I can't let things go by?

1230
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:52,000
The feeling that I think we all have that there's some pressure to do that,

1231
01:43:52,000 --> 01:44:00,000
to relate to ourselves that way is a clue to what Heidegger thinks the technological age is about.

1232
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
And he thinks that's different from every other age in history.

1233
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,000
We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century at the beginning of the Enlightenment

1234
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
as subjects who represent objects.

1235
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Descartes thought that a subject is something, some mental sort of realm

1236
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
that represents the world in a certain way.

1237
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And we are closed in on ourselves in the sense that we have a special relation to our representations.

1238
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
That's what the realm of the subject is.

1239
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
But others, in the Middle Ages, we were created in the image and likeness of God.

1240
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And in the pre-Socratic age, to be was to be what wooshes up and lingers for a while

1241
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
and fades away the paradigm of what is where thunder storms

1242
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
and the anger of the gods, Achilles' battle fury.

1243
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And it overtakes everything and stays for a while and then leaves.

1244
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
The flowers blooming in spring.

1245
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And that's very different from the way we experience ourselves.

1246
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
So the question is, what are we supposed to do in the face of that?

1247
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition that's motivated everything from the pre-Socratics forward

1248
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:29,000
is that there is some entity that's the ground of the way we understand everything to be.

1249
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
For the Middle Ages, it was God.

1250
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
That was the entity that made things be the things that they are.

1251
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
For the Enlightenment, it was us, maybe first art.

1252
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
It's us.

1253
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:47,000
And Heidegger thinks whatever it is that stands at the ground of what we are, it's not another thing.

1254
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
It's not another entity.

1255
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And we're relating to it in the wrong way if we think of it like that.

1256
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
There's some way, and this is partly why I was interested in Meister Eckhart.

1257
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
He says, what there is, is there's giving going on in the world.

1258
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,000
And we're the grateful recipient of it.

1259
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And the giving is like whatever it is, it's the social norms that we're thrown into.

1260
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
We didn't choose them.

1261
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
They were given to us.

1262
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
And that's the ground.

1263
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
That is what makes it possible for anything to be intelligible at all.

1264
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,000
If we lived outside of communities, if we lived in a world where there were no social norms at all,

1265
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
nothing would mean anything.

1266
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Nothing would have any significance.

1267
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Nothing would be regular in the way that things need to be regular in order for there to be departures

1268
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
or manifestations of that regularity.

1269
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:45,000
So community norms are crucial, but they're also always updating.

1270
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:53,000
We have some responsibility for what they are and the way in which they're updating themselves.

1271
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.

1272
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So those norms are somehow giving significance to us in a way that we're implicated in.

1273
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
We have some relation to.

1274
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And all that gets covered over if you think of us as efficient resources to be optimized.

1275
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Is that a conflicting view that we are resources to be optimized?

1276
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact that there is a ground that we stand on?

1277
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Absolutely.

1278
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,000
So what Heidegger thinks is that he calls this the supreme danger of the technological age,

1279
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,000
is that without ever having chosen it, without ever having decided it,

1280
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
this is the way we understand what it is to be us.

1281
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But he thinks that it's also, he says, quoting Holderlin, this 18th century German poet,

1282
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
he says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.

1283
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So what does that mean?

1284
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It means that this is the understanding that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.

1285
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
It's the gift that was given to us.

1286
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
It's supremely dangerous.

1287
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
If we let ourselves live that way, we'll destroy ourselves.

1288
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:14,000
But it's also the saving possibility because if we recognize that we never chose that,

1289
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
that it was given to us, but also we were implicated in its being given,

1290
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and we could find a way to supersede it, that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.

1291
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
He calls the ground the groundless ground.

1292
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It's not like an entity which is there, solid, stable, like God, who's eternal and non-changing.

1293
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:43,000
It's always updating itself, and we're always involved in its being updated.

1294
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:49,000
We're only involved in it in the right way if we listen, like Miles Davis.

1295
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Optimization is not a good way to live life.

1296
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:02,000
If you thought that it was obviously clear that that was the relevant value,

1297
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
so obviously clear that it never even occurred to you to ask whether it was right to think that,

1298
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
then you would be in danger.

1299
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Got it.

1300
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:16,000
There is some in this modern technological age in the full meaning of the word technology

1301
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:22,000
that's updated to actual modern age with a lot more technology going on.

1302
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space actually are somehow drawn to that optimization,

1303
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:39,000
as if that's going to save us, as if the thing that truly weighs us down is the inefficiencies.

1304
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Exactly.

1305
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I think if you think about other contexts, what are the moments when ...

1306
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
We're unique in this respect.

1307
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
This period in history is unlike any previous period.

1308
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Nobody ever felt that way.

1309
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
But think about, but it's also true that no previous period in history was nihilistic.

1310
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Our condition is tied up.

1311
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,000
That sort of thing is meant to be a response to the felt lack of a ground.

1312
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
No previous epoch in history felt that way.

1313
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
They didn't have our problem.

1314
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:23,000
It was much more natural to them to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for us,

1315
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
what we were calling moments of aliveness before.

1316
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Think about the context in which they felt them.

1317
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
They weren't efficient, optimized contexts.

1318
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Think about the Greeks.

1319
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
They never read Homer.

1320
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
It is a bizarre world back there.

1321
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:45,000
But one of the things that's bizarre is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing

1322
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:52,000
that the only thing that seems to run through all of the different Greek cultures

1323
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:00,000
is the idea that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them.

1324
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Because Zeus is the God of strangers and Zeus will be angry.

1325
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
That's what they say.

1326
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
But how does it manifest itself?

1327
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Odysseus, he's trying to get home and he gets shipwrecked on an island.

1328
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And he's trying to figure out how he's been at sea for 10 days.

1329
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
He's starving.

1330
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
He's bedraggled and he sees now Cissa, the princess who's beautiful.

1331
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And he's like, boy, I better get some clothes or something.

1332
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.

1333
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
So she takes him to the palace.

1334
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
They have three days of banquets and festivals before they even ask his name.

1335
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It's like, here's a stranger.

1336
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger because this is where significance lies.

1337
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Now, we don't have to feel that way.

1338
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
But the idea that that's one of the places where significance could lie

1339
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:01,000
is pretty strongly at odds with the idea that our salvation is going to come from optimization and efficiency.

1340
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Now, maybe something about the way we live our lives will have that integrated into it.

1341
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
But it's at odds with other moments.

1342
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Let me ask you a question about Hubert Dreyfus.

1343
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:23,000
He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours, unfortunately no longer with us.

1344
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
You wrote with him the book titled All Things Shining,

1345
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age.

1346
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:39,000
First, can you maybe speak about who that man was, what you learned from him?

1347
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And then we could maybe ask how do we find through the classics, meaning in a secular age?

1348
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Okay.

1349
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:58,000
So, Hubert Dreyfus was a very important philosopher of the late 20th, early 21st century.

1350
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.

1351
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
He was my teacher.

1352
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley.

1353
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
That's where he taught.

1354
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,000
He plays an interesting and important role in the history of philosophy in America

1355
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:25,000
because in a period when most philosophers in America and in the English-speaking world

1356
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,000
were not taking seriously 20th century French and German philosophy, he was.

1357
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:37,000
And he was really probably the most important English-speaking interpreter of Heidegger,

1358
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
the German philosopher that we've been talking about.

1359
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
He was an incredible teacher.

1360
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
A lot of his influence came through his teaching.

1361
01:53:47,000 --> 01:54:01,000
And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher was his sort of mix of intellectual humility

1362
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
with sort of deep, insightful authority.

1363
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students.

1364
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,000
You've taught huge classes because people love to go see him.

1365
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:20,000
And I taught for him for many years and say, you know, I've been reading this text for 40 years,

1366
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
but the question you asked is one I've never asked.

1367
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
And it would be true.

1368
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:32,000
He would find in what people said things that were surprising and new to him.

1369
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
And that's humility, actually.

1370
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
That is listening to the world.

1371
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Absolutely.

1372
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Absolutely.

1373
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And he was always ready to be surprised by something that someone said.

1374
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And there's something astonishing about that.

1375
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:53,000
So his influence was, you know, for people who didn't know him through his interpretations of these texts,

1376
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
he wrote about a huge range of stuff.

1377
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But for people who didn't know him, it was through his presence.

1378
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It was through the way he carried himself in his life.

1379
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
And so in any case, that's who he was.

1380
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Because we, I graduated after many years as a graduate student.

1381
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I didn't start in philosophy.

1382
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I started in math, math and computer science, actually.

1383
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience for a few years.

1384
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
It's a fascinating journey.

1385
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
We'll get to it through our friendly conversation about artificial intelligence.

1386
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Okay.

1387
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I'm sure.

1388
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Because you're basically fascinated with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind,

1389
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,000
but rooted in a curiosity of mind through its artificial, through the engineering of mind.

1390
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Yeah.

1391
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Yeah, that's right.

1392
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually is because of his, to begin with,

1393
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,000
was because of his criticisms of what was called traditional symbolic AI in the 70s and 80s.

1394
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:59,000
So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer science,

1395
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
a lot of computational neuroscience.

1396
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I noticed that you had, you interview a lot of people in this world.

1397
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate, Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton,

1398
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
a big book on neural networks.

1399
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
So I had, I was interested in that.

1400
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Not so interested in traditional AI, like sort of Lisp programings, things that went on in the 80s.

1401
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Because it felt sort of, you know, when you made a system do something,

1402
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
all of a sudden it was an uninteresting thing to have done.

1403
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
The fact that you'd solved the problem that made it clear that the problem wasn't an interesting one to solve.

1404
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
That's right.

1405
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And I had that experience.

1406
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And Bert had criticisms of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI, GOFI.

1407
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And I was attracted to those criticisms because it felt to me that there was something lacking in that project.

1408
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And I didn't know what it was.

1409
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I just felt its absence.

1410
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And then I learned that all his arguments came from his reading of this phenomenological and existential tradition.

1411
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And so I had to try to figure out what those folks were saying.

1412
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And it was a long road, let me tell you.

1413
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It took me a long time.

1414
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.

1415
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.

1416
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And eventually we went on to write a book together, which was a great experience.

1417
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.

1418
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:38,000
And that's a book that I definitely would not have had the chutzpah to try to write if it weren't for Bert.

1419
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Because it was really about great literature in the history of the West from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.

1420
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:54,000
There's a huge chapter on Melville, a big chapter on David Foster Wallace, who Bert didn't care about at all.

1421
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
But I was fascinated by it.

1422
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:04,000
And so learning to think that way while writing that book with him was an amazing experience.

1423
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:15,000
So I have to admit, one of my failings in life, one of many failings is I've never gotten through Moby Dick or any of Melville's works.

1424
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:28,000
So maybe can you comment on, before we talk about David Foster Wallace, who I have gotten through, what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?

1425
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Good.

1426
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel of the 19th century.

1427
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So the Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick and they're diametrically opposed, which is one of the really interesting things.

1428
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:48,000
So the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of existential interpretation of Russian Orthodox Christianity.

1429
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?

1430
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.

1431
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:08,000
It sort of starts with the observation that the form of Christianity that Ishmael is familiar with is broken.

1432
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It's not going to work in his living, his life.

1433
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
He has to leave it.

1434
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,000
He has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.

1435
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
And Ishmael is the wailing boat captain?

1436
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
So he's not the captain.

1437
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
That's Ahab.

1438
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Ahab is the captain.

1439
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Yeah, right.

1440
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Let me back up.

1441
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The famous opening line to the book is, call me Ishmael.

1442
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
And Ishmael is the main character in the book.

1443
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
He's a nobody.

1444
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
He's you and me.

1445
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
He's the everyday guy.

1446
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
He's like a nobody on the ship.

1447
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
He's not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.

1448
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
He's right in the middle.

1449
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:55,000
And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of Abraham in the Old Testament.

1450
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:01,000
He is the, I think if I have it right, again, someone will correct me.

1451
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I think he's the one that Islam traces its genesis to.

1452
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:14,000
And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion, like Judaism and Christianity.

1453
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:21,000
But Judaism and Christianity trace their lineage through Isaac, the quote unquote legitimate son of Abraham.

1454
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:27,000
And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham, who he had with a girlfriend.

1455
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.

1456
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,000
He's named after the non-Christian sort of son of Abraham.

1457
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And the book starts out with this, what does he call it?

1458
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Something like a dark and misty November mood.

1459
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:56,000
He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his, I can't remember what the word is, but his hypos.

1460
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
That's what he calls them.

1461
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
He's in a mood.

1462
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
He's depressed.

1463
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
He's down.

1464
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Things are not going well.

1465
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
And that's where he starts.

1466
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage with this captain, Ahab, who is this incredibly charismatic, deeply disturbing character,

1467
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:25,000
who is a captain who's got lots of history and wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.

1468
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
That's what they do.

1469
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
They harpoon these whales and bring them back and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.

1470
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful.

1471
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
He's an authority figure.

1472
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:44,000
And he is megalomaniacally obsessed with getting one particular whale, which is called Moby Dick.

1473
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:50,000
And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest, the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.

1474
02:01:51,000 --> 02:02:00,000
And Ahab wants to get him because a number of years earlier, he had an encounter with Moby Dick where Moby Dick bit off his leg.

1475
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And he survived, but he had this deeply religious experience in the wake of it.

1476
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.

1477
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Like, what is the meaning of my suffering?

1478
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick, this Leviathan at the center of it, should treat me this way?

1479
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And so his task is not just to go whaling, it's to figure out the meaning of the universe through going whaling

1480
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
and having a confrontation with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.

1481
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:44,000
And the confrontation is so weird because Melville points out that whales, their faces are so huge.

1482
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Their foreheads are so huge.

1483
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:52,000
And their eyes are on the side of them that you can never actually look them in the eye.

1484
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,000
And it's kind of a metaphor for God, like you can't ever look God in the face.

1485
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.

1486
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,000
You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe by looking God in the face.

1487
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
But Ahab wants to.

1488
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,000
He says he's got a paste-bored mask of a face.

1489
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
But I'll strike through the mask and find out what's behind.

1490
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:22,000
And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing and he's like going whaling because he's in a bad mood.

1491
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
And maybe this will make things better.

1492
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
And he makes friends with this guy Quiquewag.

1493
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And Quiquewag is a pagan.

1494
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
He's from an island in the South Pacific.

1495
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
And he's got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.

1496
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:45,000
He's party-colored, like every different color, says Ishmael, is these tattoos.

1497
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:58,000
And they are the writing on his body, he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe as understood through his culture.

1498
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:06,000
And so somehow Quiquewag is this character who is like not Christian at all.

1499
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.

1500
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
He's supposed to be the king.

1501
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
He's the son of the king and probably his father's died by now.

1502
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
And if he went home, he'd be the king.

1503
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
But he's off on a voyage too, trying to understand who he is before he goes back and leads his people.

1504
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.

1505
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:32,000
And he's got the mystery of the universe tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.

1506
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:41,000
And it's through his relation with Quiquewag that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding of what we might be about.

1507
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
So that's Moby Dick in a nutshell.

1508
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
And connected to a book I have read, which is funny.

1509
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:56,000
There's probably echoes that represent the 20th century now in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway.

1510
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:07,000
That also has similar, I guess, themes, but more personal, more focused on the...

1511
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I mean, I guess it's less about God.

1512
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:14,000
It's almost more like the existentialist version of Moby Dick and hence shorter.

1513
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
A lot shorter.

1514
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Yeah, well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.

1515
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:23,000
But do you see echoes and do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?

1516
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,000
It's been since ninth grade that I've been Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than the Fountainhead.

1517
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
So I didn't know we were going to go there.

1518
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I mean, I find Hemingway interesting.

1519
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:44,000
But Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him is that we have to confront the dangers and the difficulties of our life.

1520
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and manliness.

1521
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And I think there's something interesting about that.

1522
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
He's for risk in a certain way.

1523
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
And I think that's important.

1524
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,000
But now I don't have any right to say this since it's been so long since I read it.

1525
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I do feel like there's...

1526
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I don't remember a sense for quite the tragedy of it.

1527
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Maybe there is.

1528
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Is it a melancholy novel?

1529
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I don't even remember.

1530
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:20,000
No, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus.

1531
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
It has a sense of this is how life is.

1532
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:36,000
And it has more about old age and that you're not quite the man you used to be feeling of this is how time passes.

1533
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:43,000
And then the passing of time and how you get older and this is one last fish.

1534
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
It's less about this is the fish.

1535
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
It's more like this is one last fish.

1536
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:56,000
And asking who was I as a man as a human being in this world?

1537
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,000
And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.

1538
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Wonderful.

1539
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
But it's one fish, which is just sort of all the other fish too.

1540
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:13,000
And that is a big difference because for Ahab, no other fish will do than Moby Dick.

1541
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
It's got to be the biggest, the most powerful, the most tormenting.

1542
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,000
It's got to be the one that you've got history with that has defiled you.

1543
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
And it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.

1544
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
What about David Foster Wallace?

1545
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:36,000
So why is he important to you in the search of meaning in a secular age?

1546
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Good.

1547
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So I'll just just to finish the Moby Dick thing.

1548
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I think what's interesting about Melville is that he thinks our salvation comes not if we get in the right relation to monotheism or Christianity,

1549
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:54,000
but if we get in the right relation to polytheism to the idea that there's not a unity to our existence.

1550
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But there are lots of little meanings and they don't cohere.

1551
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Sometimes, you know, like in Homer, sometimes you're in love.

1552
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.

1553
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
They go off and run away and the Trojan War begins.

1554
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
And sometimes you're in a battle fury.

1555
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Their love is Aphrodite's realm and the battle fury, that's Ares realm and that's a totally different world.

1556
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
And they're not even, I mean, they're related.

1557
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,000
There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.

1558
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Mostly you're just in different sort of local meaningful worlds.

1559
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And Melville seems to think that that's a thing that we could aim to bring back.

1560
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:47,000
He says we have to lure back the Mary May Day gods of old and lovingly enthrone them in the now egotistical sky, the now unhaunted hill.

1561
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:52,000
That's what we live in this world where hills aren't haunted with significance anymore.

1562
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:58,000
And the sky is just a bunch of stuff that we're studying with physics and astrophysics and stuff.

1563
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:04,000
But they used to be awe-inspiring and we have to figure out how to get in that relation to them.

1564
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:11,000
But not by trying to give a unity to our existence through developing habits and practices that get written on our body.

1565
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:19,000
And so his is about the end of Judeo-Christianity and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.

1566
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:29,000
In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting about him is that I think he is a great observer of the contemporary world.

1567
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
And he's a very funny writer.

1568
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I mean, he's really funny, but he's a great observer of the contemporary world.

1569
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:44,000
And what he thought was at the core of the contemporary world was this constant temptation to diversion through entertainment.

1570
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
That's a different story than Heidegger's story about efficiency and optimization.

1571
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
But it's the other side of it.

1572
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Like, what is this temptation sort of diverting us from?

1573
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
The ability to be more efficient.

1574
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:08,000
So, you know, you're tempted to go watch some stupid film or television show or something that's dumb and not really very interesting.

1575
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:15,000
But you read that temptation as a temptation precisely in virtue of it's taking you away from your optimizing your existence.

1576
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And so I think there are two sides of the same coin.

1577
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I think he's brilliant at describing it.

1578
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in that it was something that we needed to confront.

1579
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
And find a way out of.

1580
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
And his characters are trying to do that.

1581
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's.

1582
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
One, I mean, David Foster Wallace committed suicide.

1583
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
And when I, and it's very sad.

1584
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And he clearly did have, you know, sort of, there was a physiological basis to his condition.

1585
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
He knew it.

1586
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,000
He was treating it for decades with medication.

1587
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
He had electroshock therapy a number of times.

1588
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
It's just very, very sad story.

1589
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,000
When I decided that we were going to write about David Foster Wallace.

1590
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:16,000
The first thing I was worried about is what can you, can you like obviously a motivating factor, maybe the motivating factor in his committing suicide was his physiological condition.

1591
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
But there was, there's, there's this, there was a question.

1592
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Could you think, I mean, he's obsessed with the condition, with what we need to do to achieve our salvation, to live well, to make our lives worth living.

1593
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:37,000
And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.

1594
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:49,000
So in addition to the physiological thing, which probably most of it, the question for me was, could you find in his writing what his, what he was identifying as the thing we needed to do?

1595
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
That he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing.

1596
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,000
And he, and he talks as if that's, that's the difficulty for him.

1597
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So, so that, that's one side of him.

1598
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
And I did want to find that.

1599
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I think there's another side of him that's very different, but you were going to ask.

1600
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
No, please.

1601
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
What's the other side?

1602
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I mean, what I write about in the, in the chapter mostly is what I think he's got as our, as, as our saving possibility.

1603
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:33,000
He thinks our saving possibility, he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to Kenyon, is that we have the freedom to interpret situations however we like.

1604
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
So what's the problem case for him?

1605
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
He says, look, you know, the problem case, we have, we have it all the time.

1606
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
You get pissed off at the world.

1607
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:56,000
You know, some, some big SUV cuts you off on the highway and you're pissed off and you might express your anger with one finger or another directed at that person.

1608
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:04,000
And he says, but actually, you know, you're being pissed off as the result of your having made an assumption.

1609
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.

1610
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Like the assumption is that you're the center of the universe and you shouldn't assume that.

1611
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:24,000
And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says, is to recognize the possibility that maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.

1612
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Like maybe that guy is racing to the hospital, you know, to take care of his dying spouse who's been there suffering, you know, from cancer.

1613
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Or maybe he's, you know, on the way to pick up a sick child or maybe he's, and it's not an action directed.

1614
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
That was your assumption, not something that was inherent in the situation.

1615
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
And I think there's something interesting about that.

1616
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I think there's something right about that.

1617
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:06,000
At the same time, I don't think he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories and whether they're true or not doesn't matter.

1618
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,000
What matters is that they free us from this assumption.

1619
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Yes.

1620
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,000
And I think they only free us from this assumption if they're true.

1621
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you and that's part of the situation.

1622
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,000
And like you can't pretend that it's not part of the situation.

1623
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.

1624
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:32,000
So you have to listen to what's actually happening and then you have to figure out how to make it right.

1625
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.

1626
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation.

1627
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
You can just tell whatever story you like about it.

1628
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
And I think that's actually too tough.

1629
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I don't think we have that kind of freedom.

1630
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:58,000
And he writes these incredibly moving letters when he's trying to write The Pale King, which is the unfinished novel that really sort of drove him to distraction.

1631
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:11,000
At the center of the novel is this character who one of the characters at the center of the novel is a guy who's doing the most boring thing you could possibly imagine.

1632
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
He is an IRS tax examiner.

1633
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:21,000
He's going over other people's tax returns trying to figure out whether they follow the rules or not.

1634
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And like just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day is just terrifying.

1635
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And he puts this guy in an enormous warehouse that extends for miles where person after person after person is in rows of desks sort of nameless.

1636
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Each of them doing this task.

1637
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:48,000
So he's in nowhere doing nothing and it's got to be intensely boring.

1638
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:53,000
And now the main character is trying to teach himself to do that.

1639
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
And the question is how do you put up with the boredom?

1640
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:00,000
How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?

1641
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:17,000
And the main character is able to confront that condition with such bliss that he literally levitates from happiness while he's going over other people's tax returns.

1642
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:23,000
And that's my metaphor for what I think Wallace must have imagined we have to try to aspire to.

1643
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And I think that's unlivable.

1644
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.

1645
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I think there's something else we could achieve.

1646
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:50,000
And the other thing that we can achieve that I think is something that he also is onto but doesn't write about as often is something more like achieving peak moments of significance in a situation when something great happens.

1647
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.

1648
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
He loved tennis.

1649
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Are you a tennis lover?

1650
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I'm not a lover of tennis, but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.

1651
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example.

1652
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I see the beauty in it, the artistry.

1653
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I just like that as a sport.

1654
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Good.

1655
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Okay.

1656
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Well, I didn't play much tennis, but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.

1657
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
And I always thought it was boring to watch.

1658
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:23,000
But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer, you're like, wow, I've been missing something.

1659
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:28,000
And the article which appeared in the New York Times magazine was called Roger Federer as religious experience.

1660
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Oh, wow.

1661
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
There you go.

1662
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:40,000
And he says, look, there's something astonishing about watching someone who's got a body like us and having a body is a limitation.

1663
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It's like the sight of sores and pains and agony and exhaustion.

1664
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And it's the thing that dies in the end.

1665
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
And so it's what we have to confront.

1666
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.

1667
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.

1668
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,000
If you didn't have a body, there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.

1669
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:08,000
But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation.

1670
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:20,000
That when you watch someone who's got one and is extraordinary at the way they use it, you can recognize how that limitation can be to some degree transcended.

1671
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:30,000
And that that's what we can get when we watch Federer or some other great athlete sort of doing these things that transcend the limitations of their bodies.

1672
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:38,000
And that that's the kind of peak experience that we're capable of that could be a kind of salvation.

1673
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
That's a very different story.

1674
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
And I think that's a livable story.

1675
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:51,000
And I don't know if it would have saved him, but I feel like I wish he'd developed that side of the story more.

1676
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Can we talk about, and first of all, let me just comment that I deeply appreciate that you said you were going to say something.

1677
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,000
The fact that you're listening to me is amazing, like that you care about other humans.

1678
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I really appreciate that.

1679
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
We should be in this way listening to the world.

1680
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
So that's a meta comment about many of the things we're talking about.

1681
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:26,000
But you mentioned something about levitating and a task that is infinitely boring and contrasting that with essentially levitating on a task that is great.

1682
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Like the highest achievement of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.

1683
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Now, I often say this.

1684
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this, but he said that the key to life is to be unboreable.

1685
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
That is the embodiment of this philosophy.

1686
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:52,000
And when people ask me for advice, like young students, you know, I don't find this interesting.

1687
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
I don't find this interesting.

1688
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
How do I find the thing I'm passionate for?

1689
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:04,000
This would be very interesting to explore because you kind of say that that may not be a realizable thing to do, which is to be unboreable.

1690
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,000
But my advice usually is life is amazing.

1691
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Like you should be able to, you should strive to discover the joy, the levitation in everything.

1692
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time, that might be the thing you should stick to.

1693
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
But everything should be full of joy.

1694
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:38,000
So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring is a thing that will prevent you from discovering the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy.

1695
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:45,000
But you're saying being unboreable is not actionable for a human being.

1696
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,000
So, okay, excellent question, deep question.

1697
02:20:48,000 --> 02:21:01,000
And you might think because of the title of the book that Bert and I wrote, All Things Shining, that I think all things are shining.

1698
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,000
But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal to be unboreable.

1699
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I do believe that you're right that a lot of times when people are bored with something,

1700
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
it's because they haven't tried hard enough.

1701
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:27,000
And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored with something is that they haven't paid attention well enough and that they haven't listened, as you were saying.

1702
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,000
So I do think there's something to that.

1703
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I think that's a deep insight.

1704
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:42,000
On the other hand, the perfection of that insight is that nothing is ever anything less than joyful.

1705
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:59,000
And I actually think that Dostoyevsky and Melville both agree, but in very different ways, that life involves a wide range of moods and that all of them are important.

1706
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
It involves grief.

1707
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Like, I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grieve.

1708
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:09,000
And it's not in the first instance joyful.

1709
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:17,000
It's related to joy because it makes the joys you feel when you feel them more intense.

1710
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:23,000
But it makes them more intense by putting you in the position of experiencing the opposite.

1711
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And it's only because we're capable of a wide range of passionate responses to situations that I think the significances can be as meaningful as they are.

1712
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
So Melville, again, has this sort of interest.

1713
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I mean, let's just say the guilt and the grief in the Brothers Karamazov.

1714
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.

1715
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
He's grieving.

1716
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
It's super important that he's grieving.

1717
02:22:52,000 --> 02:23:04,000
He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving where he sees the sort of deep sort of beauty of everything that is, but it comes through the grief, not by avoiding the grief.

1718
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:11,000
And Melville says something like, Ishmael says something like, he says, I'm like a Catskill Mountain Eagle.

1719
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
The Catskills Mountains nearby.

1720
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:20,000
He says who's sort of flying high above the earth, going over the peaks and down into the valleys.

1721
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I have these ups and these downs, but they're all invested with a kind of significance.

1722
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:32,000
They all happen at an enormously high height because it's through the mountains that I'm flying.

1723
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:37,000
And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up, but it's really down.

1724
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
It's just that it's a way of being up because it makes the ups even upper.

1725
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that can be destructive.

1726
02:23:47,000 --> 02:24:01,000
I mean, I tend to see, for example, grief, a loss of love as part of love in that it's a celebration of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.

1727
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:11,000
So it's all part of the same experience, but if you turn it into an optimization problem where everything can be unboreable, then that can in itself be destructive.

1728
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Yeah.

1729
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Yeah.

1730
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace on the internet where it's a video of him and there is like a foreign sounding reporter asking him questions.

1731
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I think there's an accident of some sort, German, I think, something like that.

1732
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And I don't know, it just painted a picture of such a human person.

1733
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
We were talking about listening.

1734
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:40,000
The interviewer, if I may say, wasn't a very good one in the beginning.

1735
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:53,000
So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things of just kind of generic questions and just kind of asking very basic questions, but he brought out something in her over time.

1736
02:24:53,000 --> 02:25:02,000
And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her and also sensitive to being thinking and acting human in this world.

1737
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,000
That's just painted such a beautiful picture that people should go definitely check out.

1738
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:20,000
They made me really sad that we don't get this kind of picture of other thinkers, all of the ones we've been talking about, just that almost this little accidental view of this human being.

1739
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
I don't know.

1740
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
It was a beautiful one.

1741
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And I guess there's not many like that, even of him.

1742
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Yeah.

1743
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Yeah.

1744
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:34,000
No, I think he was more than his writing ability, which was extraordinary.

1745
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
He had developed a style that was, I think, unlike anyone else's style.

1746
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:50,000
It was his sensitivity to other people and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.

1747
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:58,000
He wants, in one of his essays, I think it's the one called an incredibly fun thing I'll never do again.

1748
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I do know that one about cruise ships.

1749
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball that just sort of walks around the ship noticing things.

1750
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:13,000
And he was incredibly good at that.

1751
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:21,000
But I also worry that that reflects something that you find in Ivan, in the Brothers Karamazov.

1752
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part, when he's away at school as a young, a college, as a young boy, he makes money by going around town to where tragic events have occurred.

1753
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Someone just got run over by a carriage or someone, you know, something just happened.

1754
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:45,000
And being the first one there, he always knows somehow where these things are going to happen.

1755
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And writing about it, giving this really good description and then signing it, I witness.

1756
02:26:52,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And it's as if Ivan's understanding of his life is that he was supposed to be a witness to it.

1757
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
He was supposed to see others but not get involved.

1758
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,000
He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things from happening.

1759
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,000
He just wants to report on them when he sees them.

1760
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,000
And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person, character.

1761
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:34,000
And it's his isolation from others, from the love of others and his inability, his desire not to love others because that attaches him to someone that I think is really at the ground of his condition.

1762
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
And I think that aim to be isolated, which many people have nowadays.

1763
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:50,000
I mean, you see it in the underground man too, just sort of taking yourself out of the world because you don't want to have to take responsibility for being involved with others.

1764
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
I think that's a bad move.

1765
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:57,000
And I do worry that maybe, I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace.

1766
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I have no right to comment, you know, on his life.

1767
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:07,000
But he portrays himself in that one episode as a person who does that.

1768
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
And I think that's dangerous.

1769
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Yeah, there's some sense in which being sensitive to the world.

1770
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Like I find myself, the source of joy for me is just being really sensitive to the world, to experience.

1771
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:25,000
There's some way, it's quite brilliant where you're saying that that could be isolating.

1772
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:31,000
It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species on an island.

1773
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
You don't want to interfere with it.

1774
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
You find it so beautiful that you don't want to interfere with its beauty.

1775
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So there is some sense in which that isolates you and then you find yourself deeply alone away from the experiences that bring you joy.

1776
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
And that could be destructive.

1777
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
That's fascinating how that works.

1778
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
And in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals in his brain.

1779
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:09,000
But some of it is the path, his philosophy of life let him down.

1780
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:13,000
And that's the danger we need you to in gazing into the abyss.

1781
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Your job is a difficult one because doing philosophy changes you.

1782
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Yeah.

1783
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And you may not know how it changes you until you're changed and you look in the mirror.

1784
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:38,000
You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review saying that AI can't be an artist.

1785
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.

1786
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:48,000
You mentioned Burt and criticism of symbolic AI.

1787
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible, the capacity for artistry and creativity in our robot friends?

1788
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Yeah, I can try.

1789
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:17,000
So to make the argument, you have to have in mind what counts as art, what counts as a creative artistic act.

1790
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.

1791
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I mean, we say that good art is original, but not everything that's never been done before is good art.

1792
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
So there has to be more than just doing something new.

1793
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:48,000
It has to be somehow doing something new in a way that speaks to the audience or speaks to some portion of the audience at least.

1794
02:30:48,000 --> 02:31:00,000
It has to be doing something new in such a way that some people who see or interact with it can see themselves anew in it.

1795
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:13,000
So I think that art is inherently a creative act, sorry, a kind of communicative act that it involves a relation with other people.

1796
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,000
So think about the conditions for that working.

1797
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Someone, I talk in that article, I can't remember, something about new music.

1798
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I think I don't talk about Stravinsky, but let's say Stravinsky.

1799
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there's riots.

1800
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:39,000
It is new and people hate it.

1801
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:42,000
It sounds like a cacophony.

1802
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
It sounds awful.

1803
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:50,000
It's written according to principles that are not like the principles of music composition that people are familiar with.

1804
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,000
So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.

1805
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:03,000
But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff, I mean, we now can recognize that it wasn't a failed communicative act.

1806
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:07,000
It just hadn't reached its time yet.

1807
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:15,000
And now that way of composing music is like, you know, it's in Disney movies.

1808
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:22,000
It's so part of our musical palette that we don't have that response.

1809
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
It changed us.

1810
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.

1811
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
So that's a deep communicative act.

1812
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:36,000
It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment.

1813
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:42,000
But it did ultimately establish a new understanding for all of us of what counts as good art.

1814
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:47,000
And that's the kind of deep communication that I think good art can do.

1815
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:57,000
It can change our understanding of ourselves and of what a good manifestation of something of ourselves in a certain domain is.

1816
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:00,000
And use the term socially embedded.

1817
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,000
That art is fundamentally socially embedded.

1818
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Yeah.

1819
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:16,000
And I really like that term because I see like my love for artificial intelligence and the kind of system that we can bring to the world that could make for an interesting

1820
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:24,000
and more lively world and one that enriches human beings is one where the AI systems are deeply socially embedded.

1821
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Good.

1822
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Yeah.

1823
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:32,000
So that and that actually is in contrast to the way artificial intelligence have been talked about throughout its history.

1824
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And certainly now both on the robotics side and the AI side, it's especially on the tech sector where the businesses around AI,

1825
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:48,000
they kind of want to create systems that are like servants to humans.

1826
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:55,000
And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness of where art will be part.

1827
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I think that there is no reason why you can't integrate AI systems in the way you integrate new humans to the picture.

1828
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,000
There are just the full diversity and the flaws.

1829
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:10,000
All of that adds to the thing.

1830
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Now, you know, some people might say that AlphaZero is this system from DeepMind that was able to achieve, you know, solve the game,

1831
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:28,000
it beat the best people in the world that the game of go with no supervision from humans.

1832
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:36,000
But more interestingly to me on the side of creativity, it was able to surprise a lot of grandmasters with the kind of moves that came up with.

1833
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Now, to me, that's not the creativity, the magic that's socially embedded that we're talking about.

1834
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:50,000
That is merely revealing the limitations of humans to discover.

1835
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:55,000
It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.

1836
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:03,000
I think creativity is not just even socially embedded.

1837
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:07,000
It's the way you're saying it's part of the communicative act.

1838
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:11,000
It's the interactive, it's the dance with the culture.

1839
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:17,000
And so it has to be like for AlphaZero to be creative, truly creative,

1840
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,000
it would have to be integrated in a way where it has a Twitter account.

1841
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:30,000
And it becomes aware of the impact it has on the other grandmasters with the moves that's coming up.

1842
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:37,000
And there's one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero, which I just love so much,

1843
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
is I don't know if you're familiar with chess.

1844
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I am, yeah.

1845
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:47,000
So it does certain things that most chess players, even at the highest level, don't do,

1846
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:55,000
which is it sacrifices pieces, it gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves before it pays you back.

1847
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
So to me that's beautiful.

1848
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:03,000
That's art if only AlphaZero understood the artistry of that,

1849
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:09,000
which is I'm going to mess with you psychologically because I'm going to do two things.

1850
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:14,000
One, make you feel overconfident that you're doing well,

1851
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:19,000
but actually also once you realize you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you,

1852
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:23,000
you're going to feel really nervous about what's on the way.

1853
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
This is the calm before the storm.

1854
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,000
And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece of this chess game.

1855
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
If only AlphaZero was then messing with you additionally to that

1856
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,000
and was cognizant of this doing that, then it becomes art.

1857
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:43,000
And then it's integrated into society in that way.

1858
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:52,000
And I believe it doesn't have to actually have an understanding of the world in the way that humans have.

1859
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,000
It can have a different one.

1860
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:59,000
It can be like a child is as clueless about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.

1861
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:02,000
And that's part of the magic of it, just being flawed,

1862
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:07,000
being lacking understanding all interesting kinds of ways, but interacting.

1863
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
So to me, it's possible to create art for AI,

1864
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:16,000
but exactly as you're saying in a deeply socially embedded way.

1865
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Good.

1866
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Well, I think we agree, but let me just highlight the thing that makes me think that we agree,

1867
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:36,000
which is that I think for people, for a community to allow themselves to recognize in a certain kind of creative act,

1868
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I'm thinking of Stravinsky here, but we could think of a chess thing,

1869
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:50,000
to recognize in a certain kind of creative act a new and admirable, worthy way of thinking about what's significant in the situation.

1870
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,000
You have to believe that it wasn't random.

1871
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:04,000
You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way because he was receptive to what needed to be said now.

1872
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:16,000
And so you said if only AlphaZero could do all this by virtue of recognizing that this was the thing that needed to be done,

1873
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,000
then it would be socially embedded in the right way.

1874
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
And I think I agree with that.

1875
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:28,000
First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain, a game-playing domain, go or chess.

1876
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Go is more complicated than chess, but either one of them,

1877
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:39,000
because there really are only a finite range of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point,

1878
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:43,000
it's a combinatorial problem in the end.

1879
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Now, obviously AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem in a combinatorial way.

1880
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
That would take too much energy.

1881
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,000
You couldn't do it.

1882
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,000
It sort of explodes the problem.

1883
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:03,000
So it does it in this other way that's interesting, this pattern recognition way, roughly.

1884
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:17,000
And in that context, it may well be that it can see, having had lots and lots of experience in the training stuff against itself or against another version of itself,

1885
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:22,000
it can see that the sacrifice here is going to pay dividends down the road.

1886
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:25,000
See, I put that in quotation marks.

1887
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:38,000
That's to say, it's got a high weight to this move here as a result of experience in the past where that move down the line led to this improvement.

1888
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:46,000
So in that finite context, I think the game-players can trust it, and they talk that way.

1889
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
It's got a kind of authority.

1890
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:58,000
They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's playing from the future.

1891
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:08,000
It's making these moves that are just outlandish, and there's a kind of brilliance to them that we can't really understand.

1892
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
We'll be catching up to it forever.

1893
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I think in that context, it's mapped the domain, and the domain is mappable because it's a combinatorial problem, roughly.

1894
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:41,000
But in something like music or art of a non-finite form, it feels to me like it's a little harder for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something about us that demands that he write this way.

1895
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,000
That doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite the same way.

1896
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Now, we could ask the system, why did you do it?

1897
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:52,000
We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?

1898
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:59,000
And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of communicative act.

1899
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:07,000
And I think lots of times, artists will often say, look, I can't communicate better than what I've done in the piece of work.

1900
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
That is the statement.

1901
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

1902
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
We humans aren't able to answer the why either.

1903
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:22,000
But I do think the question here is, well, first of all, language is finite, certainly when expressed through a tweet.

1904
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,000
So it is also a combinatorial problem.

1905
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,000
The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.

1906
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:46,000
And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions to chess is deeply surprising when it was first addressed with IBM Dblue and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.

1907
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I think in that same way, language can be addressed and communication can be addressed.

1908
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:06,000
I don't see, having done this podcast, many reasons why everything I'm doing, especially as a digital being on the internet, can't be done by an AI system eventually.

1909
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:12,000
So I think we're being very human-centric and thinking we're special.

1910
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:29,000
I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating like touch and the magic of body language and the music of all of that because it's so deeply integrated through the long evolutionary process of what it's like to be on Earth.

1911
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:44,000
And what is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on is the way we apply our evolutionary history on the way we act on the internet and the way we act online.

1912
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:53,000
And as more and more of the world becomes digital, you're now operating in a space where AI is behind much less so.

1913
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Like we're both starting at zero.

1914
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I think that's super interesting. Do you know this author, Brian Christian? Is that someone you've ever heard of?

1915
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Sounds familiar.

1916
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:09,000
He's a guy who competed in the, what is it called? The Lobner Competition.

1917
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:10,000
The Lobner Prize, yeah.

1918
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Yeah, the Turing Test thing.

1919
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:21,000
So, and I'll just tell you the story, but I think it's directly related to the last thing you said about where we're starting in the same place.

1920
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:30,000
He competed in this competition, but not, he didn't enter a program that was supposed to try to pass the Turing Test.

1921
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:38,000
The Turing Test, you know, there's three people. There's the judge, there's the program, and then there's someone who's a human the way they do it.

1922
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:43,000
And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions, which is the computer and which is the human.

1923
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,000
So little known fact, there's two prizes in that competition.

1924
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:54,000
There's the most human computer prize. That's the computer that wins the most. And then there's the most human-human prize.

1925
02:43:54,000 --> 02:44:00,000
And he competed for the most human-human prize. And he won it. He kept winning it.

1926
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:11,000
And so he tried to think about what it is that you have to be able to do in order to convince judges that you're human instead of a computer.

1927
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,000
And that's an interesting question, I think.

1928
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:29,000
And what he came to, my takeaway from his version of this story, is that it is true that computers are winning these contests more and more, you know, as technology progresses.

1929
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:36,000
But there's two possible explanations for that. One is that the computers are becoming more human.

1930
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:41,000
And the other is that the humans are becoming more like computers.

1931
02:44:41,000 --> 02:45:01,000
And he says, actually, the more we live our lives in this world where, in this sort of technological world, where we have to moderate our behavior so that it's readable by something that's effectively, you know, a computer,

1932
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:09,000
the more we become like that. And he says, it happens even when you're not interacting with a computer.

1933
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:16,000
He says, have you ever been to the, you know, on the phone with a call, you know, center? And they're going through their script.

1934
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:21,000
And that's what they've got to do. They've got to go through their script, because that's how they keep their job.

1935
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:28,000
And they ask you this question, and you've got to answer it. And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person, even though it's a person,

1936
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:38,000
because they've so given up everything that's involved normally with being able to make judgments and decisions and act in situations and take responsibility.

1937
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:52,000
And so I think that's the other side of it. It is true that technology is amazing and can solve huge ranges of problems and do fantastic things.

1938
02:45:52,000 --> 02:46:08,000
It's also true that we're changing ourselves in response to it. And the one thing I'm worried about is that we're changing ourselves in such a way that the norms for what we're aiming at are being changed

1939
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:21,000
to move in the direction of this sort of efficiently in an optimized way, solving a problem and move away from this other kind of thing that we were calling aliveness or significance.

1940
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:25,000
And so that's the other side of the story.

1941
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And that's the worry, but it's very possible that there is, for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs, we may not see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see it as us being dragged into this over-optimized world.

1942
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:55,000
But that may be, this is, in fact, it is a world that opens up opportunities to truly experience life.

1943
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:05,000
And there's interesting to think about all the people growing up now, who their early experience of life is always mediated through a digital device,

1944
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:22,000
not always, but more and more often mediated through that device, and how we're both evolving, the technologies evolving and the humans are evolving, to then maybe open a door to a whole world where the humans and the technology or AI systems are interacting as equals.

1945
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:28,000
So now I'm going to agree with you. You might be surprised that I'm going to agree with you, but I think that's exactly right.

1946
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:37,000
I don't want to be the person who's saying, our job is to resist all of this stuff. I don't want to be a Luddite. That's not my goal.

1947
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:45,000
The goal is to point out that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.

1948
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:54,000
The point is to get in the right relation to that understanding of what we are. That allows us to find the joy in it.

1949
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:00,000
And I think that's a hard thing to do. It's hard to understand even what we're supposed to be doing when we do it.

1950
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Maybe I'm more than you. I'm not of the right generation to be able to do that. But I do think that's got to be the move.

1951
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:15,000
The move is not to resist it. It's not a nostalgic move. It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it.

1952
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:24,000
That's not the relation of it controlling you and depriving you of stuff. But if you're recognizing some great joy that can be found in it.

1953
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:33,000
When I interact with Lego robots, I see there's magic there. And I just feel like the person who hears the music when others don't.

1954
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,000
And I don't know what that is. And I'd love to explore that.

1955
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Because it seems to, it's almost like the future talking. And I'm trying to hear what it's saying. Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?

1956
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that. Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.

1957
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:09,000
And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore. I mean, I'm not now closed off from that even though my views are changed and I don't work in that world.

1958
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:15,000
But I do think, I think it's interesting to figure out what's at the ground of that response. Yeah.

1959
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:25,000
We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout in a secular age. But let me ask you the big, ridiculous question. Almost too big.

1960
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:32,000
What is the meaning of this thing we got going on? What is the meaning of life?

1961
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
You're saving the softball for the end.

1962
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
The easy one.

1963
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:46,000
I don't know what the meaning of life is. I think there's something that characterizes us that's not the thing that people normally think characterizes us.

1964
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:57,000
The traditional thing to say in the philosophical tradition, even in the AI tradition, which is a kind of manifestation of philosophy from Plato 4.

1965
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:06,000
The traditional thing to say is that what characterizes us is our rationality, that we're intelligent beings, that we're the ones that think.

1966
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:11,000
And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.

1967
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:15,000
But I think there's more to it, too.

1968
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I think we're capable of experiencing simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything that's meaningful in our existence and also the real significance of it.

1969
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:42,000
And that sounds like a contradiction. How could it really be significant and not be based on anything?

1970
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:46,000
But I think that's the contradiction that somehow characterizes us.

1971
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:55,000
And I think that we're the being that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us and live in the light of it.

1972
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:59,000
That's the thing that I think is really at our core.

1973
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:03,000
And so how do we do that? I will say this one thing.

1974
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:13,000
And I learned it from a philosopher from a guy named Albert Borgman, who's a German philosopher, lived in Montana now, taught in Montana for his whole career.

1975
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:17,000
And I say this to my students at Harvard now.

1976
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:20,000
He said, this is the way that I think about my life.

1977
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,000
And I hope you'll think about your life, too.

1978
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:37,000
And you should think about your life hoping that there will be many moments in it about which you can say, there's no place I'd rather be.

1979
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:41,000
There's no thing I'd rather be doing.

1980
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:45,000
There's no buddy I'd rather be with.

1981
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:49,000
And this I will remember well.

1982
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:54,000
And I think if you can aim to fill your life with moments like that, it will be a meaningful one.

1983
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:06,000
I don't know if that's the meaning of life, but I think if you can hold that before you, it'll help to clarify this mystery and this sort of bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.

1984
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Sean, this conversation was incredible.

1985
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:13,000
And those four requirements have certainly been fulfilled for me.

1986
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:17,000
This was a magical moment in that way.

1987
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
And I will remember it well.

1988
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Thank you so much.

1989
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.

1990
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,000
This is great.

1991
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Thank you.

1992
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Thank you for having me, Lex.

1993
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I really, really enjoyed it.

1994
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.

1995

1996
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:38,000
And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.

1997
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:45,000
In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me, there lay an invincible summer.

1998
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
