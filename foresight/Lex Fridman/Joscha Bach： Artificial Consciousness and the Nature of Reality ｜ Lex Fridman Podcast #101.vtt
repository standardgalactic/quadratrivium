The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, VP of Research at the AI Foundation

00:05.520 --> 00:12.240
with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard. Yosha is one of the most unique

00:12.240 --> 00:17.280
and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community, exploring the workings of the human

00:17.280 --> 00:24.640
mind, intelligence, consciousness, life on earth, and the possibly simulated fabric of our universe.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.720
I can see myself talking to Yosha many times in the future.

01:04.240 --> 01:10.480
to try to figure out how to spell my last name without using the letter E. And it'll probably

01:10.480 --> 01:16.080
be the correct way. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never hear any ads in the middle

01:16.080 --> 01:22.400

01:36.640 --> 01:41.920
the best VPN out there. They told me to say it, but I think it actually happens to be true.

01:42.880 --> 01:49.040
It doesn't log your data. It's crazy fast and it's easy to use literally just one big power on

01:49.040 --> 01:55.440
button. Again, for obvious reasons, it's really important that they don't log your data. It works

01:55.440 --> 02:02.080
on Linux and everywhere else too. Shout out to my favorite flavor of Linux, Ubuntu Mate 2004.

02:02.880 --> 02:09.920

02:23.600 --> 02:30.240
friends by Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional

02:30.240 --> 02:35.280
share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes

02:35.280 --> 02:41.120
to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to

02:41.120 --> 02:46.240
the Cash App engineers for taking a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

02:46.240 --> 02:53.040
making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So again, if you

will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping advance robotics and STEM education

03:06.480 --> 03:13.120
for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Yosha Bach.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.360
As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany, just as what we're talking about off mic,

03:20.160 --> 03:25.520
to parents who were artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the most

03:25.520 --> 03:30.560
unique thinkers in the AI world. So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit?

03:31.520 --> 03:38.560
What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies, or just realizations that

03:39.280 --> 03:45.040
impact on you when you're growing up that kind of led to the trajectory? Or were the key sort of

03:45.040 --> 03:52.160
crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development? My father came from a long tradition

03:52.160 --> 04:00.560
of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family. And so basically, he was technically a nerd,

04:00.560 --> 04:07.840
and nerds need to interface in society with non-standard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd

04:07.840 --> 04:12.160
as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer

04:12.160 --> 04:19.360
review. And normal people understand that the primary purpose of communication is to negotiate

04:19.360 --> 04:24.480
alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict, which means that nerds have to learn how to

04:24.480 --> 04:32.080
interact with society at large. Who is the reviewer in the nerd's view of communication?

04:32.080 --> 04:37.760
Everybody who you consider to be a peer. So whatever hapless individual is around,

04:37.760 --> 04:41.360
well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information.

04:42.080 --> 04:48.720
Okay. So you're not, by the way, my research will malinform me. So you're

04:50.160 --> 04:57.280
architect or artist? So he did study architecture. But basically, my grandfather made the wrong

04:57.280 --> 05:05.600
decision. He married an aristocrat and was drawn into the war. And he came back after 15 years.

05:05.600 --> 05:12.800
So basically, my father was not parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him

05:12.800 --> 05:19.840
what to do and expected him to do what he was told. And he was unable to. He's unable to do

05:19.840 --> 05:24.320
things if he's not intrinsically motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son.

05:24.880 --> 05:30.720
And her son responded when he became an architect to become an artist. So he built

05:30.720 --> 05:35.440
100-wasser architecture. He built houses without right angles. He'd built lots of things that

05:35.440 --> 05:41.200
didn't work in the more brutalist traditions of Eastern Germany. And so he bought an old

05:41.200 --> 05:45.600
watermill, moved out to the countryside, and did only what he wanted to do, which was art.

05:46.160 --> 05:52.080
Eastern Germany was perfect for Bohem, because you had complete material safety. Put was heavily

05:52.080 --> 05:56.560
subsidized. Haskell was free. You didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.280
Socialized Communist side of the memory. Yes. And the other thing is it was almost impossible

06:01.280 --> 06:05.360
not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very productive for artists.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.240
So everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful, because it will always touch on the

06:10.240 --> 06:15.120
deeper currents of society, of culture, and being conflict with it, and tension with it. And you

06:15.120 --> 06:19.920
will always have to define yourself with respect to this. So what impact did your father, this

06:20.560 --> 06:26.720
outside-of-the-box thinker against the government, against the world artists have?

06:26.720 --> 06:31.440
He was actually not a thinker. He was somebody who only got self-aware to the degree that he

06:31.440 --> 06:39.200
needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, he was also in the late 1960s, and he was

06:39.200 --> 06:44.800
in some sense a hippie. So he became a one-person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. He built

06:44.800 --> 06:53.520
big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on, and convinced a woman to live

06:53.520 --> 06:58.560
with him. She was also an architect, and she adored him and decided to share her life with him.

06:58.560 --> 07:05.680
And I basically grew up in a big cave full of books. I'm almost feral. And I was bored out there. It

07:05.680 --> 07:11.760
was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely. So I started to read, and by the time I

07:11.760 --> 07:16.960
came to school, I've read everything until fourth grade and then some. And there was not a real way

07:16.960 --> 07:22.240
for me to relate to the outside world. And I couldn't quite put my finger on why. And today,

07:22.240 --> 07:27.600
I know it was because I was a nerd, obviously. And it was the only nerd around. So there were no

07:27.600 --> 07:34.000
other kids like me. And there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on.

07:34.640 --> 07:39.920
And this village school that I went to, it was basically a nice school. Kids were nice to me.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.400
I was not beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or build deep relationships. They only

07:44.400 --> 07:48.560
happened then starting from ninth grade when I went into a school for mathematics and physics.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.200
Do you remember any key books from this moment?

07:51.200 --> 07:56.880
Yes, I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the

07:56.880 --> 08:01.680
children's and young adult sections. And then I read a lot of science fiction. For instance,

08:01.680 --> 08:07.040
Danislav Lem, basically the great author of cybernetics, has influenced me. Back then,

08:07.120 --> 08:10.720
I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural

08:10.720 --> 08:16.640
to me. And it's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote. Another thing that

08:16.640 --> 08:22.080
was very influential on me were the classical philosophers and also the literature of romanticism.

08:22.080 --> 08:29.680
So German poetry and art, Dr. Hilzhoff and Heine, and up to Hesse and so on.

08:30.320 --> 08:35.920
Hesse, I love Hesse. So at which point do the classical philosophers end at this point

08:35.920 --> 08:40.640
or in the 21st century? What's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through

08:41.680 --> 08:45.840
even as far as Nietzsche or is this, are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?

08:45.840 --> 08:49.120
I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster.

08:51.600 --> 08:58.000
So he's very smart and easy to read. But he's not so much trolling others. He's trolling himself

08:58.000 --> 09:02.480
because he was at odds with the world. Largely, his romantic relationships didn't work out.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.720
He got angry and he basically became a nihilist.

09:07.360 --> 09:11.840
Isn't that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual is to constantly be trolling yourself,

09:11.840 --> 09:17.280
to be in that conflict, in that tension? I think it's a lack of self-awareness. At some point,

09:17.280 --> 09:21.680
you have to understand the comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously

09:22.400 --> 09:25.840
and you are not functional, it ends in tragedy as it did for Nietzsche.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.840
I think you think he took himself too seriously in that tension.

09:29.840 --> 09:34.160
And if you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, the Steppenwolf syndrome is classic

09:34.160 --> 09:38.800
adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all

09:38.800 --> 09:44.080
the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self-awareness because you think that you

09:44.080 --> 09:48.960
are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them

09:48.960 --> 09:53.600
based on your innate instincts and it doesn't work out. And you become a transcendentalist

09:53.600 --> 09:58.480
to deal with that. So it's very, very understandable and have great sympathies for this

09:58.560 --> 10:03.760
to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history, but you have to grow out of it.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.680
So as an intellectual, a life well-lived, a journey well-traveled is one where you don't

10:09.680 --> 10:16.960
take yourself seriously? No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you

10:16.960 --> 10:23.280
need to become unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.560
Yeah. You don't do this for the audience, you don't do it for yourself. You have to submit to

10:28.560 --> 10:33.920
the things that are possibly true and you have to follow wherever your inquiry leads, but it's

10:33.920 --> 10:40.240
not about you. It has nothing to do with you. So do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed

10:40.240 --> 10:44.800
sort of an idea of there's objective truth? So what's your sense in the philosophical,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.920
if you remove yourself that's objective from the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover

10:50.640 --> 10:56.480
ideas that are true or are we just in a mesh of relative concepts that are either true or false?

10:56.480 --> 11:01.440
It's just a giant mess. You cannot define objective truth without understanding the

11:01.440 --> 11:06.480
nature of truth in the first place. So what does the brain mean by saying that it covers

11:06.480 --> 11:12.560
something as truth? So for instance, a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there

11:12.560 --> 11:17.280
can be a sense in which a mathematical statement can be true because it's defined as true under

11:17.280 --> 11:24.640
certain conditions. So it's basically a particular state that a variable can have in a symbol game.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.440
And then you can have a correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is again

11:29.440 --> 11:33.920
a type of model correspondence. And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground truth.

11:33.920 --> 11:39.360
So for instance, you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all, right?

11:39.360 --> 11:44.640
That's stunning when you realize something exists rather than nothing. And this seems

11:44.640 --> 11:49.360
to be true, right? There's absolute truth in the fact that something seems to be happening.

11:49.920 --> 11:55.040
Yeah, that to me is a showstopper. I could just think about that idea and be amazed by that idea

11:55.760 --> 11:59.520
for the rest of my life and not going any farther because I don't even know the answer to that.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.920
Why does anything exist at all? Well, the easiest answer is existence is the default, right? So

12:03.920 --> 12:08.000
this is the lowest number of bits that you would need to encode this. Whose answer? Who provides

12:08.000 --> 12:12.800
the simplest answer to this is that existence is the default. What about non-existence? I mean,

12:12.800 --> 12:18.720
that seems non-existence might not be a meaningful notion in the sense. So in some sense, if everything

12:18.720 --> 12:24.240
that can exist exists for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable. The only

12:24.240 --> 12:28.960
thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the superposition

12:28.960 --> 12:33.360
of all finite automata. And we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties that it

12:33.360 --> 12:41.520
can contain us. What does it mean to be a superposition of finite? So any superposition like

12:41.520 --> 12:46.880
all possible rules. Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator that acts on some

12:46.880 --> 12:53.680
substrate. And as a result, you get emergent patterns. What's the substrate? I have no idea to

12:53.680 --> 12:59.200
know. But some substrate? It's something that can store information. Something that can store

12:59.200 --> 13:03.280
information, there's automaton. Something that can hold state. Still, doesn't make sense to me the

13:03.280 --> 13:10.640
why that exists at all. I could just sit there with a beer or a vodka and just enjoy the fact,

13:10.640 --> 13:16.080
wandering the why. May not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there

13:16.080 --> 13:22.560
could be no relation in the y direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't

13:22.560 --> 13:28.320
mean that everything has to have a purpose or a cause, right? So we mentioned some philosophers

13:28.320 --> 13:33.760
in that early just taking a brief step back into that. So we asked ourselves when did classical

13:33.760 --> 13:39.040
philosophy end? I think for Germany, it largely ended with the first revolution. That's basically

13:39.120 --> 13:47.120
when we ended the monarchy and started a democracy. And at this point, we basically came

13:47.120 --> 13:52.720
up with a new form of government that didn't have a good sense of this new organism that society

13:52.720 --> 13:57.760
wanted to be. And in a way, it decapitated the universities. So the universities went on

13:57.760 --> 14:02.080
through modernism like a headless chicken. At the same time, democracy failed in Germany,

14:02.080 --> 14:07.520
and we got fascism as a result. And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned

14:07.520 --> 14:12.480
down intellectual traditions in Russia. And Germany, both Germanies have not recovered from

14:12.480 --> 14:17.760
this. Eastern Germany had this vulgar dialectic materialism, and Western Germany didn't get

14:17.760 --> 14:23.200
much more edgy than Habermas. So in some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions

14:23.200 --> 14:30.080
and killing off and driving out the Jews didn't help. Yeah, so that was the end. That was the end

14:30.080 --> 14:36.320
of really rigorous what you would say is classical philosophy. There's also this thing that in some

14:36.320 --> 14:44.560
sense, the low hanging foods in philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we

14:44.560 --> 14:49.680
discovered was the constructivist turn in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of

14:49.680 --> 14:55.600
mathematics that work are computation. There was a very significant discovery in the first half of

14:55.600 --> 15:02.160
the 20th century. And it hasn't fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists

15:02.160 --> 15:06.800
checked out the code libraries for mathematics before constructivism became universal.

15:07.360 --> 15:11.280
What's constructivism? What are you referring to girls and completeness there and that kind of

15:11.280 --> 15:15.280
those kinds of ideas? So basically, Gödel himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert

15:16.080 --> 15:20.320
could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance, countries set theoretical experiments and

15:20.320 --> 15:26.000
mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that with the current semantics,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.520
we cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.120
And Gödel could prove this. And so what Gödel could show is using classical mathematical

15:35.120 --> 15:40.240
semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Gödel strongly believed in these semantics,

15:40.240 --> 15:45.920
and more than in what he could observe and so on, he was shocked. It basically shook his

15:45.920 --> 15:49.200
world to the core, because in some sense, he felt that the world has to be implemented in

15:49.200 --> 15:55.520
classical mathematics. And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that Turing could see that

15:55.520 --> 16:01.040
the solution is to understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means you,

16:01.040 --> 16:07.520
for instance, pi in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function, but it's the same

16:07.520 --> 16:12.800
thing. And in computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it. And if you cannot

16:12.800 --> 16:16.960
compute the last digit of pi, you only have a function. You can plug this function into your

16:16.960 --> 16:21.360
local sun, let it run until the sun burns out. This is it. This is the last digit of pi you

16:21.360 --> 16:26.720
will know. But it also means there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically

16:26.720 --> 16:32.640
realized computer that depends on having known the last digit of pi. Which means there are parts of

16:32.640 --> 16:37.520
physics that are defined in such a way that cannot strictly be true, because assuming that this could

16:37.520 --> 16:43.760
be true leads into contradictions. So I think putting computation at the center of the world view

16:43.760 --> 16:48.880
is actually the right way to think about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein

16:48.880 --> 16:53.920
basically preempted the logitist program of AI that Minsky started later, like 30 years later.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.120
Turing was actually a pupil of Wittgenstein. Really? So I didn't know there's any connection

16:59.120 --> 17:02.880
between Turing and Wittgenstein. And Wittgenstein even canceled some classes when Turing was not

17:02.880 --> 17:05.760
present because he thought it was not worth spending the time on with the others.

17:06.560 --> 17:11.120
Interesting. If you read the Tractados, it's a very beautiful book. Like they say you once thought

17:11.120 --> 17:17.600
on 75 pages. It's very non-typical for philosophy because it doesn't have arguments in it and it

17:17.600 --> 17:22.720
doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending to convince anybody.

17:23.760 --> 17:29.120
It's mostly for people that have the same insight as me. Just spell it out. And this insight is

17:29.680 --> 17:34.320
there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy ought to meet. Mathematics tries to

17:34.320 --> 17:39.680
understand the domain of all languages by starting with those that are so formalizable that you can

17:39.680 --> 17:44.480
prove all the properties of the statements that you make. But the price that you pay is that

17:44.480 --> 17:48.560
your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say something meaningful in mathematics.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.680
And it looks complicated to people, but it's far less complicated than what our brain is casually

17:53.680 --> 17:59.600
doing all the time and it makes sense of reality. And philosophy is coming from the top. So it's

17:59.600 --> 18:04.400
mostly starting from natural languages with vaguely defined concepts. And the hope is that

18:04.400 --> 18:09.520
mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point. And Wittgenstein was trying to make them meet.

18:09.520 --> 18:13.280
And he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything with the non-calculus

18:13.280 --> 18:18.320
that you could reduce the entire logic to non-gates as we do in our modern computers.

18:18.320 --> 18:22.480
So in some sense, he already understood Turing universality before Turing spelled it out. I

18:22.480 --> 18:26.720
think when he wrote the track titles, he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important

18:26.720 --> 18:32.480
and significant. And as a specter, when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was

18:32.480 --> 18:39.120
not that famous. When he lived, it was mostly his work in decrypting the German codes that made

18:39.200 --> 18:44.240
him famous or gave him some notoriety. But the same status that he has to computer science right

18:44.240 --> 18:49.200
now and something that I think he'll acquire later. That's kind of interesting. Do you think of

18:49.200 --> 18:53.760
computation and computer science? And you kind of represent that to me is maybe that's the modern

18:54.240 --> 19:02.080
day. You, in a sense, are the new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist who dares to

19:02.080 --> 19:07.760
ask the bigger questions that philosophy originally started. Is the new philosopher?

19:07.840 --> 19:13.360
Certainly not me. I think I'm mostly still this child that grows up in a very beautiful valley

19:13.360 --> 19:17.440
and looks at the world from the outside and tries to understand what's going on. And my teachers

19:17.440 --> 19:22.400
tell me things and they largely don't make sense. So I have to make my own models. I have to discover

19:22.400 --> 19:26.640
the foundations of what the others are saying. I have to try to fix them, to be charitable. I

19:26.640 --> 19:31.280
try to understand what they must have thought originally or what their teachers or their teachers

19:31.280 --> 19:35.360
teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation and how to make sense of the

19:35.360 --> 19:40.320
reality that we are in. And whenever I have an original idea, I'm usually late to the party

19:40.320 --> 19:44.720
by say 400 years. And the only thing that's good is that the parties get smaller and smaller,

19:44.720 --> 19:50.080
the older I get and the more I explore. The parties get smaller and more exclusive.

19:50.080 --> 19:56.240
And more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing was that you

19:56.240 --> 20:02.320
were not tethered, whether it's because of your parents or in general, maybe you're something

20:02.320 --> 20:07.920
within your, within your mind, some genetic material, you were not tethered to the ideas

20:07.920 --> 20:14.080
of the general populace, which is actually a unique property where kind of, you know,

20:14.080 --> 20:18.560
the education system and whatever from that education system, just existing in this world

20:18.560 --> 20:24.560
forces certain sets of ideas onto you. Can you disentangle that? Why were you,

20:25.520 --> 20:32.240
why are you not so tethered? Even in your work today, you seem to not care about perhaps

20:33.920 --> 20:41.440
a best paper in Europe, right? Being tethered to particular things that current today in this year,

20:42.240 --> 20:47.040
people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and resume. You're a little bit more

20:47.040 --> 20:51.120
outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people are especially focusing

20:51.200 --> 20:56.800
the benchmarks of today, the things. What's, can you disentangle that? Because I think that's

20:56.800 --> 21:01.280
inspiring. And if there were more people like that, we might be able to solve some of the bigger

21:01.280 --> 21:08.240
problems that sort of AI dreams to solve. And there's a big danger in this, because in a way,

21:08.240 --> 21:13.840
you are expected to marry into an intellectual tradition and visit this tradition into a

21:13.840 --> 21:18.640
particular school. If everybody comes up with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not

21:18.640 --> 21:23.040
cumulative as an enterprise, right? So in some sense, you need a healthy balance,

21:23.040 --> 21:27.280
you need paradigmatic thinkers, and you need people that work within given paradigms.

21:27.280 --> 21:32.640
Basically, scientists today define themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a disease

21:32.640 --> 21:38.560
that we think as a scientist, somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor that they

21:38.560 --> 21:42.880
should join a particular discipline, and then they find a good mentor to learn the right methods,

21:42.880 --> 21:47.840
and then they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team, and then their

21:47.840 --> 21:53.040
name will show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns with

21:53.040 --> 21:59.040
this approach. And when our field, computer science and AI started, most of the people

21:59.040 --> 22:05.120
that joined this field had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers in AI either don't have

22:05.120 --> 22:09.040
interesting opinions at all, or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually

22:09.040 --> 22:13.520
doing, because what they're doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon.

22:14.320 --> 22:21.200
And this is often a good idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for

22:21.200 --> 22:27.360
me, it's first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it? If the current

22:27.360 --> 22:32.960
methods of machine learning lead to strong AI, why should I be doing it? I will just wait until

22:32.960 --> 22:38.240
they're done and wait until they do this on the beach, or read interesting books or write some,

22:38.320 --> 22:43.360
and have fun. But if you don't think that we are currently doing the right thing,

22:43.360 --> 22:50.480
if we are missing some perspectives, then it's required to think outside of the box. It's

22:50.480 --> 22:57.040
also required to understand the boxes. But it's necessary to understand what worked,

22:57.040 --> 23:02.080
and what didn't work, and for what reasons. So you have to be willing to ask new questions and

23:02.080 --> 23:07.200
design new methods whenever you want to answer them. And you have to be willing to dismiss

23:07.280 --> 23:11.040
the existing methods if you think that they're not going to yield the right answers.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.960
It's very bad career advice to do that.

23:14.240 --> 23:23.120
So maybe to briefly stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the

23:23.120 --> 23:29.840
dream before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started? When was the dream to

23:29.840 --> 23:34.000
understand or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you?

23:34.320 --> 23:44.080
I think that you can see AI largely today as advanced information processing. If you would

23:44.080 --> 23:48.720
change the acronym of AI into that, most people in the field would be happy. It would not change

23:48.720 --> 23:54.640
anything what they're doing. We're automating statistics, and many of the statistical models

23:54.640 --> 23:59.200
are more advanced than what statisticians had in the past. And it's pretty good work. It's

23:59.200 --> 24:04.560
very productive. And the other aspect of AI is philosophical project. And this philosophical

24:04.560 --> 24:09.840
project is very risky, and very few people work on it, and it's not clear if it succeeds.

24:10.400 --> 24:16.480
So first of all, you keep throwing a lot of really interesting ideas, and I have to pick which

24:16.480 --> 24:24.800
ones we go with. But first of all, you use the term information processing, just information

24:24.800 --> 24:32.640
processing, as if it's the mere, it's the muck of existence, as if it's the epitome

24:34.320 --> 24:37.920
that the entirety of the universe might be information processing, that consciousness

24:37.920 --> 24:43.440
and intelligence might be information processing. So that maybe you can comment on if the advanced

24:43.440 --> 24:50.160
information processing is a limiting kind of round of ideas. And then the other one is what

24:50.160 --> 24:56.800
do you mean by the philosophical project? So I suspect that general intelligence is the result

24:56.800 --> 25:02.560
of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model. It's not

25:02.560 --> 25:08.080
necessarily goal directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this. But

25:08.720 --> 25:14.000
it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns,

25:14.000 --> 25:20.800
and be able to predict the next set of patterns to make sense of things. And some problems are

25:20.800 --> 25:25.600
very general. Usually intelligence serves control. So you make these models for a particular purpose

25:25.600 --> 25:31.200
of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results. But the intelligence itself

25:31.200 --> 25:35.520
is in the sense instrumental to something. But by itself, it's just the ability to make models.

25:35.520 --> 25:40.080
And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes them needs to understand

25:40.080 --> 25:44.800
what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child, for instance,

25:44.800 --> 25:50.400
you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting different things.

25:50.400 --> 25:55.600
So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you have

25:55.600 --> 25:59.760
complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself to reverse engineer yourself

25:59.760 --> 26:04.640
to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself

26:04.640 --> 26:09.760
in relationship to your environment. And this process, if this project, if you reverse engineer

26:09.760 --> 26:14.240
yourself in your relationship to reality in the nature of a universe that can contain you,

26:14.240 --> 26:19.280
if you go all the way, this is basically the project of AI, or you could say the project of AI

26:19.280 --> 26:24.640
is a very important component in it. The true Turing test in a way is, you ask a system,

26:24.640 --> 26:30.720
what is intelligence? If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works,

26:31.680 --> 26:36.640
then you should assign it the property of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test

26:36.640 --> 26:41.200
that Turing was administering in a way, I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't

26:41.200 --> 26:47.760
express it yet in the original 1950 paper, is that he was trying to find out whether he was

26:47.760 --> 26:51.680
generally intelligent. Because in order to take this test, the rub is, of course, you need to

26:51.680 --> 26:55.920
be able to understand what the system is saying. And we don't yet know if we can build an AI.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.880
We don't yet know if we are generally intelligent. Basically, you win the Turing test by building

27:00.880 --> 27:07.120
an AI. Yes. So in a sense, hidden within the Turing test is a kind of recursive test.

27:07.120 --> 27:12.080
Yes, it's a test on us. The Turing test is basically a test of the conjecture whether

27:12.080 --> 27:17.520
people are intelligent enough to understand themselves. Okay. But you also mentioned a

27:17.520 --> 27:22.320
little bit of a self-awareness. And then the project of AI, do you think this kind of emergent

27:22.400 --> 27:29.280
self-awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence? So as opposed to

27:29.280 --> 27:37.600
goal-oriented, as you said, kind of puzzle-solving is coming to grips with the idea that you're an

27:37.600 --> 27:42.240
agent in the world. And I find that many highly intelligent people are not very self-aware,

27:42.960 --> 27:47.840
right? So self-awareness and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be

27:47.840 --> 27:53.120
self-aware if you have good priors especially, without being especially intelligent. So you

27:53.120 --> 27:57.680
don't need to be very good at solving puzzles if the system that you are already implements the

27:57.680 --> 28:05.440
solution. But I do find intelligence. So you kind of mentioned children, right? Is that the

28:05.440 --> 28:13.120
fundamental project of AI is to create the learning system that's able to exist in the world?

28:13.120 --> 28:20.800
So you kind of drew a difference in self-awareness and intelligence. And yet you said that the

28:20.800 --> 28:26.960
self-awareness seems to be important for children. So I call this ability to make sense of the world

28:26.960 --> 28:31.360
and your own place and so to make you able to understand what you're doing in this world

28:31.360 --> 28:36.000
sentience. And I would distinguish sentience from intelligence because sentience is

28:37.120 --> 28:41.760
possessing certain classes of models. And intelligence is a way to get to these models

28:41.760 --> 28:53.040
if you don't already have them. I see. So can you maybe pause a bit and try to answer the question

28:53.040 --> 28:58.880
that we just said we may not be able to answer and might be a recursive meta question of what is

28:58.880 --> 29:06.240
intelligence? I think that intelligence is the ability to make models. So models. I think it's

29:06.240 --> 29:16.400
useful as examples. Very popular now. Neural networks form representations of large-scale

29:16.400 --> 29:22.960
data set. They form models of those data sets. When you say models and look at today's neural

29:22.960 --> 29:28.320
networks, what are the difference of how you're thinking about what is intelligent in saying

29:28.320 --> 29:34.560
that intelligence is the process of making models? Two aspects to this question. One is

29:34.640 --> 29:38.880
the representation as the representation adequate for the domain that we want to represent.

29:39.760 --> 29:45.040
And the other one is the type of the model that you arrive at adequate. So basically,

29:45.040 --> 29:52.560
are you modeling the correct domain? And I think in both of these cases, modern AI is lacking still.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.120
And I think that I'm not saying anything new here. I'm not criticizing the field. Most of the

29:57.120 --> 30:03.760
people that design our paradigms are aware of that. And so one aspect that we are missing is

30:03.760 --> 30:08.720
unified learning. When we learn, we at some point discover that everything that we sense

30:09.280 --> 30:14.000
is part of the same object, which means we learn it all into one model. And we call this model

30:14.000 --> 30:18.880
the universe. So the experience of the world that we are embedded on is not a secret direct

30:18.880 --> 30:23.440
wire to physical reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we can never experience

30:23.440 --> 30:28.560
or get access to. But it has these properties that it can create certain patterns that our

30:28.560 --> 30:32.720
systemic interface to the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship

30:32.800 --> 30:36.480
between the patterns that we discover is what we call the physical universe.

30:36.480 --> 30:43.840
So at some point in our development as a nervous system, we discover that everything that we relate

30:43.840 --> 30:50.160
to in the world can be mapped to a region in the same three dimensional space by and large.

30:50.160 --> 30:54.720
We now know in physics that this is not quite true. The world is not actually three dimensional,

30:54.720 --> 30:58.320
but the world that we are entangled with at the level which we are entangled with

30:58.320 --> 31:03.920
is largely a flat three dimensional space. And so this is the model that our brain is

31:03.920 --> 31:09.360
intuitively making. And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition of res extensor

31:09.360 --> 31:13.200
of this material world, this material domain. It's one of the mental domains, but it's just

31:13.200 --> 31:17.920
the class of all models that relate to this environment, this three dimensional physics

31:17.920 --> 31:21.760
engine in which we are embedded. Physics engine ocean we're embedded. I love that.

31:22.640 --> 31:32.560
Just slowly pause. So the quantum graph, I think you called, which is the real world,

31:32.560 --> 31:36.560
which you can never get access to, there's a bunch of questions I want to sort of

31:36.560 --> 31:42.320
disentangle that, but maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at,

31:42.320 --> 31:47.680
can you just describe the basics? Can you talk about what is dualism? What is idealism?

31:47.760 --> 31:52.320
What is materialism? What is functionalism? And what connects with you most in terms of,

31:52.320 --> 31:56.800
because he just mentioned, there's a reality we don't have access to. Okay. What does that even

31:56.800 --> 32:03.440
mean? And why don't we get access to it? Are we part of that reality? Why can't we access it?

32:03.440 --> 32:09.360
So the particular trajectory that mostly exists in the West is the result of our indoctrination

32:09.360 --> 32:15.600
by a cult for 2000 years. A cult, which one? The Catholic cult mostly. And for better or worse,

32:15.600 --> 32:21.040
it has created or defined many of the modes of interaction that we have that has created this

32:21.040 --> 32:30.000
society, but it has also in some sense scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists,

32:30.000 --> 32:35.600
if you would translate the mythology of the Catholic Church into the modern world is that

32:35.600 --> 32:40.480
the world in which you and me interact is something like a multiplayer role-playing

32:40.480 --> 32:44.960
adventure. And the money and the objects that we have in this world, this is all not real.

32:46.240 --> 32:52.960
Or Eastern philosophers would say it's my eye. It's just stuff that appears to be meaningful. And

32:52.960 --> 32:59.280
this embedding in this meaning, if you believe in it, is samsara. It's basically the identification

32:59.280 --> 33:06.080
with the needs of the mundane secular everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced

33:06.080 --> 33:11.760
the notion of higher meaning, the sacred. And this existed before, but eventually the natural

33:11.760 --> 33:16.240
shape of God is the platonic form of the civilization that you are part of. It's basically

33:16.240 --> 33:21.840
the super-organism that is formed by the individuals as an intentional agent. And basically,

33:21.840 --> 33:27.920
the Catholics used a relatively crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and

33:27.920 --> 33:34.240
get the software synchronized to make them walk on lockstep, to basically get this God online

33:34.240 --> 33:40.640
and to make it efficient and effective. And I think God technically is just a self that spends

33:40.720 --> 33:46.320
multiple brains as opposed to your and myself, which mostly exists just on one brain. And so,

33:46.320 --> 33:51.040
in some sense, you can construct a self functionally as a function that is implemented by brains

33:51.040 --> 33:55.040
that exists across brains. And this is a God with a small g.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.720
That's one of the, if you've all Harari kind of talking about,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.560
this is one of the nice features of our brains, it seems to that we can all download the same

34:04.560 --> 34:07.760
piece of software, like God in this case, and kind of share it.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.440
Yeah. So basically, you give everybody a spec and the mathematical constraints

34:12.320 --> 34:18.640
that are intrinsic to information processing, make sure that given the same spec, you come

34:18.640 --> 34:23.440
up with a compatible structure. Okay. So that's, there's the space of ideas that we all share.

34:23.440 --> 34:31.600
And we think that's kind of the mind. But that's separate from the idea is from Christianity for

34:32.240 --> 34:35.200
from religion is that there's a separate thing between the mind.

34:35.280 --> 34:40.640
There is a real world. And this real world is the world in which God exists. God is the quarter

34:40.640 --> 34:45.280
of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game.

34:45.920 --> 34:51.280
And that's dualism, you would say. But the dualist aspect is because the mental realm

34:51.280 --> 34:57.280
is exists in a different implementation than a physical realm. And the mental realm is real.

34:57.280 --> 35:01.520
And a lot of people have this intuition that there is this real room in which you and me

35:01.520 --> 35:07.840
talk and speak right now, then comes a layer of physics and abstract rules and so on. And then

35:07.840 --> 35:12.800
comes another real room where our souls are. And our two form isn't a thing that gives us

35:12.800 --> 35:17.200
phenomenal experience. And this is of course, a very confused notion that you would get.

35:17.760 --> 35:24.880
And it's basically is the result of connecting materialism and idealism in the wrong way.

35:24.880 --> 35:29.040
So okay, I apologize, but I think it's really helpful if we just try to define

35:29.840 --> 35:35.040
terms. What is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism for people who don't know?

35:35.040 --> 35:39.520
So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances,

35:39.520 --> 35:45.600
a mental substance and a physical substance. And they interact by different rules. And the

35:45.600 --> 35:51.600
physical world is basically causally closed and is built on a low-level causal structure. So

35:51.600 --> 35:55.600
they're basically a bottom level that is causally closed that's entirely mechanical.

35:56.240 --> 36:00.240
And mechanical in the widest sense. So it's computational. There's basically a physical

36:00.240 --> 36:05.280
world in which information flows around. And physics describes the laws of how information

36:05.280 --> 36:09.680
flows around in this world. Would you compare it to like a computer where you have a hardware

36:09.680 --> 36:15.040
and software? The computer is a generalization of information flowing around basically. But

36:15.040 --> 36:19.360
during this cover that there is the universal principle, you can define this universal machine

36:20.240 --> 36:25.200
that is able to perform all the computations. So all these machines have the same power.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.960
This means that you can always define a translation between them as long as they

36:28.960 --> 36:34.320
have unlimited memory to be able to perform each other's computations.

36:34.320 --> 36:38.880
So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware

36:38.880 --> 36:41.360
and idealism is this whole world is just the software?

36:42.160 --> 36:46.000
Not quite. I think that most idealists don't have a notion of software yet,

36:46.000 --> 36:51.760
because software also comes down to information processing. So what you notice is the only thing

36:51.760 --> 36:56.080
that is real to you and me is this experiential world in which things matter, in which things

36:56.080 --> 37:00.240
have taste, in which things have color, phenomenal content, and so on. And you realize that.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.240
You are bringing up consciousness, okay. And this is distinct from the physical world,

37:04.240 --> 37:11.760
in which things have values only in an abstract sense. And you only look at cold patterns

37:12.320 --> 37:17.120
moving around. So how does anything feel like something? And this connection between the two

37:17.120 --> 37:21.280
things is very puzzling to a lot of people, of course, too many philosophers. So idealism

37:21.280 --> 37:25.760
starts out with the notion that mind is primary, materialism thinks that matter is primary.

37:26.320 --> 37:33.040
And so for the idealist, the material patterns that we see playing out are part of the dream

37:33.040 --> 37:39.520
that the mind is dreaming. And we exist in a mind on a higher plane of existence, if you want.

37:39.520 --> 37:46.160
And for the materialist, there is only this material thing, and that generates some models,

37:46.160 --> 37:51.680
and we are the result of these models. And in some sense, I don't think that we should

37:51.680 --> 37:56.880
understand, if you understand it properly, materialism and idealism is a dichotomy,

37:56.880 --> 38:00.720
but there's two different aspects of the same thing. So the weird thing is,

38:00.720 --> 38:05.200
we don't exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story that the brain tells itself.

38:05.600 --> 38:16.560
Okay. Let me, my information processing, take that in. We don't exist in the physical world,

38:16.560 --> 38:21.280
we exist in the narrative. Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A New Yorker cannot feel

38:21.280 --> 38:25.120
anything. They're physical things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.360
But it would be very useful for the brain or for the organism to know what it would be like

38:29.360 --> 38:34.880
to be a person and to feel something. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person,

38:34.960 --> 38:39.360
that it uses to model the interactions of the person. It's the best model of what that

38:39.360 --> 38:42.880
brain, this organism, thinks it is in relationship to its environment.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.800
So it creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain is continuously

38:46.800 --> 38:52.000
writing and updating. But you also kind of said that, you said that we kind of exist in that,

38:52.960 --> 38:59.920
that story. Yes. That story. What is real in any of this? So like,

39:00.880 --> 39:07.040
there's a, again, these terms are, you kind of said there's a quantum graph. I mean, what is,

39:07.040 --> 39:13.120
what is this whole thing running on then? Is the story, and is it completely fundamentally

39:13.120 --> 39:20.880
impossible to get access to it? Because isn't the story supposed to, isn't the brain in something,

39:21.520 --> 39:28.240
in existing in some kind of context? So what we can identify as computer scientists, we can

39:28.320 --> 39:34.960
engineer systems and test our theories this way that may have the necessary insufficient properties

39:34.960 --> 39:40.240
to produce the phenomena that we are observing, which is there is a self in a virtual world

39:40.240 --> 39:46.480
that is generated in somebody's neocortex that is contained in the skull of this primate here.

39:46.480 --> 39:51.600
And when I point at this, this indexicality is, of course, wrong. But I do create something

39:51.600 --> 39:57.520
that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina that allow you to interpret what I'm saying,

39:58.080 --> 40:02.960
but we both know that the world that you and me are seeing is not the real physical world.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.680
What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your brain to explain the patterns on your

40:07.680 --> 40:15.600
retina. How close is it to the real world? That's kind of the question. When you have people like

40:15.600 --> 40:21.200
Donald Hoffman that say that you're really far away, the thing we're seeing, you and I now,

40:21.200 --> 40:27.040
that interface we have is very far away from anything. We don't even have anything close to

40:27.040 --> 40:32.080
the sense of what the real world is. Or is it a very surface piece of architecture?

40:32.080 --> 40:37.120
Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot tractor, right? This famous thing that Bernard Mandelbrot

40:37.120 --> 40:42.480
discovered. If you see an overall shape in there, right? But you know that if you truly

40:42.480 --> 40:49.360
understand it, you know it's two lines of code. It's basically in a series that is being tested

40:49.360 --> 40:54.080
for complex numbers in the complex number plane for every point. And for those where

40:54.080 --> 41:03.280
the series is diverging, you paint this black and where it's converging, you don't. And you get the

41:03.280 --> 41:12.160
intermediate colors by taking how far as it diverges. This gives you this shape of this fractal.

41:12.160 --> 41:16.240
But imagine you live inside of this fractal and you don't have access to where you are in the

41:16.240 --> 41:22.640
fractal or you have not discovered the generator function even. So what you see is all I can see

41:22.640 --> 41:26.240
right now is a spiral. And this spiral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate

41:26.240 --> 41:31.920
model of reality? Yes, it is. It is an adequate description. You know that there is actually

41:31.920 --> 41:37.440
no spiral in the Mandelbrot fractal. It only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting

41:37.440 --> 41:42.800
things as a two-dimensional space and then defines certain regularities in there at a certain scale

41:42.800 --> 41:46.560
that it currently observes. Because if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear and turn out to be

41:46.560 --> 41:50.800
something different at a different resolution. So at this level, you have the spiral and then

41:50.800 --> 41:54.320
you discover the spiral moves to the right and at some point, it disappears. So you have a

41:54.320 --> 41:59.040
singularity. At this point, your model is no longer valid. You cannot predict what happens

41:59.040 --> 42:03.840
beyond the singularity. But you can observe again and you will see it hit another spiral

42:03.840 --> 42:07.920
and at this point, it disappeared. So we now have a second order law. And if you make

42:07.920 --> 42:12.560
30 layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world that is similar to the one that we

42:12.560 --> 42:17.200
come up with when we describe the reality around us. It's reasonably predictive. It does not cut

42:17.280 --> 42:22.160
to the core of it. It does not explain how it's being generated, how it actually works. But it's

42:22.160 --> 42:26.320
relatively good to explain the universe that we are entangled with. But you don't think the tools

42:26.320 --> 42:32.560
of computer science, the tools of physics could step outside, see the whole drawing and get it

42:32.560 --> 42:38.400
the basic mechanism of how the pattern, the spirals are generated. Imagine you would find

42:38.400 --> 42:42.560
yourself embedded into a Mandelbrot fractal and you try to figure out what works and you have

42:42.640 --> 42:49.360
somehow a Turing machine with enough memory to think. And as a result, you come to this idea,

42:49.360 --> 42:53.840
it must be some kind of automaton. And maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata until

42:53.840 --> 42:58.880
you get to the one that produces your reality. So you can identify necessary and sufficient

42:58.880 --> 43:03.520
condition. For instance, we discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.680
And then we see that most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered

43:08.240 --> 43:12.560
are in some sense describing the same fractals. This is what category theory is obsessed about,

43:12.560 --> 43:16.400
that you can map these different domains to each other. So there are not that many fractals.

43:17.440 --> 43:23.920
Some of these have interesting structure and symmetry breaks. So you can discover what region

43:23.920 --> 43:28.880
of this global fractal you might be embedded in from first principles. But the only way you

43:28.880 --> 43:33.520
can get there is from first principles. So basically, your understanding of the universe has to start

43:33.520 --> 43:38.240
with automata and the number theory and then spaces and so on. Yeah, I think like Stephen

43:38.240 --> 43:44.320
Wolfram still dreams that he's that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules of the cellular

43:44.320 --> 43:52.080
automata or the generalization of which is behind our universe. You've said on this topic,

43:52.080 --> 43:57.840
you said in a recent conversation that quote, some people think that a simulation can't be

43:57.840 --> 44:02.880
conscious and only a physical system can. But they got it completely backward. A physical system

44:03.520 --> 44:08.800
cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property,

44:08.800 --> 44:16.240
the simulated self. Just like you said, the mind is kind of the we call it story narrative.

44:16.240 --> 44:19.200
There's a simulation. So our mind is essentially a simulation?

44:20.000 --> 44:26.160
Usually, I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically a principles that produce

44:26.160 --> 44:30.720
the simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain. And the mind is

44:30.720 --> 44:37.200
creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that is on the other

44:37.200 --> 44:43.120
side of attention and is embedded in this world. Why is that important, that idea of a self?

44:43.120 --> 44:49.440
Why is that important feature in the simulation? It's basically a result of the purpose that

44:49.440 --> 44:54.320
the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We are side effects

44:54.320 --> 45:01.440
of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is the relationship

45:01.440 --> 45:07.120
of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of other organisms.

45:08.080 --> 45:13.120
And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to. These regulation

45:13.120 --> 45:17.200
targets start with priors. They're basically like unconditional reflexes that we are more or

45:17.200 --> 45:21.920
less born with. And then we can reverse engineer them to make them more consistent. And then we

45:21.920 --> 45:24.960
get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with it.

45:25.840 --> 45:31.040
And so these priors that you commit to are largely target values that our needs should

45:31.040 --> 45:37.280
approach, set points. And this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension.

45:37.280 --> 45:42.000
And we find ourselves living inside of feedback loops, right? The consciousness emerges over

45:42.000 --> 45:47.360
dimensions of disagreements with the universe. Things where you care, things are not the way

45:47.360 --> 45:52.240
there should be, but you need to regulate. And so in some sense, the sense itself is the result

45:52.240 --> 45:56.640
of all the identifications that you're having. And identification is a regulation target that

45:56.640 --> 46:00.480
you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about. Do you think it's important?

46:01.040 --> 46:06.720
And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments of these identifications,

46:06.720 --> 46:11.440
you get free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them,

46:11.440 --> 46:14.080
you're completely free and you can enter Nirvana because you're done.

46:15.040 --> 46:20.880
And actually, this is a good time to pause and say thank you to a friend of mine, Gustav

46:20.880 --> 46:26.320
Sodastrom, who introduced me to your work. I want to give him a shout out. He's a brilliant guy.

46:26.320 --> 46:30.560
And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing. And Gustav is a good representative

46:30.560 --> 46:34.800
of that. You are as well. So I'm glad. First of all, I'm glad the internet exists,

46:34.800 --> 46:41.200
the YouTube exists, where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study your writing

46:41.200 --> 46:47.680
and think about, you know, that's amazing. Okay, but you've kind of described instead of this

46:47.680 --> 46:52.720
emergent phenomenon of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard

46:52.720 --> 47:02.960
problem of consciousness? Can you just linger on it? Like, why does it still feel like I understand

47:02.960 --> 47:09.040
you're kind of the self as an important part of the simulation? But why does the simulation feel

47:09.120 --> 47:14.880
like something? So if you look at a book by, say, George R. R. Martin, where the characters

47:14.880 --> 47:20.000
have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below the

47:20.000 --> 47:23.600
hill and they're done in it and they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive

47:24.160 --> 47:27.920
and feel empowered and all these things, why do they have these emotions? It's because it's

47:27.920 --> 47:31.920
written into the story, right? And it's written into the story because it's an adequate model

47:31.920 --> 47:37.120
of the person that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing has happened too

47:37.120 --> 47:40.960
for us. So it's basically a story that our brain is writing, it's not written in words,

47:40.960 --> 47:47.600
it's written in perceptual content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what

47:47.600 --> 47:53.920
the person would feel if it existed. So it's a virtual person. And you and me happen to be

47:53.920 --> 47:58.800
this virtual person. So this virtual person gets access to the language center and talks about

47:58.800 --> 48:05.520
the sky being blue. And this is us. But hold on a second, do I exist in your simulation?

48:06.480 --> 48:13.760
You do exist in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less accessible

48:14.640 --> 48:21.200
for me that you have and so on. And my model might not be completely adequate. There are also

48:21.200 --> 48:25.760
things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense, both you and

48:25.760 --> 48:32.160
me are some puppets, two puppets that enact this play in my mind. And I identify with one of them

48:32.160 --> 48:38.240
because I can control one of the puppet directly. And with the other one, I can create things in

48:38.240 --> 48:42.880
between. So for instance, we can go on an interaction that even leads to a coupling to a feedback

48:42.880 --> 48:48.560
loop so we can sync things together in a certain way or feel things together. But this coupling is

48:48.560 --> 48:52.880
itself not a physical phenomenon. It's entirely a software phenomenon. It's the result of two

48:52.880 --> 48:57.920
different implementations interacting with each other. So that's interesting. So I used to just

48:58.880 --> 49:04.880
like the way you think about it is the entirety of existence, the simulation and where kind of

49:04.880 --> 49:14.160
each mind is a little sub simulation that like, why don't you, why doesn't your mind have access

49:15.520 --> 49:22.640
to my mind's full state? Like for the same reason that my mind hasn't had access to its own full

49:22.640 --> 49:30.000
state. So what I mean, there is no trick involved. So basically, when I say know something about

49:30.000 --> 49:34.480
myself, it's because I made a model. Yes, part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other

49:34.480 --> 49:40.960
parts of your brain are doing. Yes. But there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world

49:40.960 --> 49:45.360
in the physical sense, that there's repeatable experiments and so on. Yeah. How does that

49:46.000 --> 49:51.520
fit into our silly, the center of the ape's simulation of the world? So why is it so repeat

49:51.520 --> 49:56.640
why is everything so repeatable? And not everything. There's a lot of fundamental physics

49:56.640 --> 50:04.080
experiments that are repeatable for a long time all over the place and so on. The laws of physics.

50:04.080 --> 50:09.440
How does that fit in? It seems that the parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long

50:09.440 --> 50:17.120
lived. So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something,

50:17.120 --> 50:22.960
you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics.

50:23.520 --> 50:28.080
So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result of usually of some

50:28.080 --> 50:32.800
control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors. And the things that are

50:32.800 --> 50:37.280
not stable that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on, they tend to get

50:37.280 --> 50:44.080
weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that says stains complexity,

50:44.080 --> 50:49.680
which is required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe

50:49.680 --> 50:54.720
that is very tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of interesting

50:54.720 --> 50:59.280
symmetries and also symmetry breaks that allow to the creation of structure.

51:00.560 --> 51:05.040
But they exist where? So there's such an interesting idea that our mind is simulation

51:05.040 --> 51:12.960
that's constructing the narrative. My question is just to try to understand how that fits

51:13.920 --> 51:17.920
with the entirety of the universe. You're saying that there's a region of this universe

51:17.920 --> 51:22.160
that allows enough complexity to create creatures like us. But what's the connection between

51:23.360 --> 51:30.400
the brain, the mind, and the broader universe? Which comes first? Which is more fundamental?

51:30.400 --> 51:35.520
Is the mind the starting point, the universe is emergent? Is the universe the starting point,

51:35.520 --> 51:41.600
the minds are emergent? I think quite clearly the latter. That's at least a much easier explanation

51:41.680 --> 51:46.720
because it allows us to make causal models. And I don't see any way to construct an inverse

51:46.720 --> 51:50.320
causality. So what happens when you die to your mind's simulation?

51:51.760 --> 51:57.600
My implementation ceases. So basically the thing that implements myself will no longer be present,

51:57.600 --> 52:01.680
which means if I am not implemented on the minds of other people, the thing that I identify with,

52:02.960 --> 52:08.480
the weird thing is I don't actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct.

52:08.480 --> 52:14.560
If I was the Dalai Lama, he identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama

52:14.560 --> 52:21.200
gets reborn not because he's confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being.

52:21.760 --> 52:27.120
He runs on a human being. He's basically a governmental software that is instantiated

52:27.120 --> 52:31.280
in every new generation in you. So his advice is to pick someone who does this in the next

52:31.280 --> 52:37.040
generation. So if you identify this, you are no longer a human and you don't die in the sense

52:37.440 --> 52:42.240
that what dies is only the body of the human that you run on. To kill the Dalai Lama, you would

52:42.240 --> 52:47.840
have to kill his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small

52:47.840 --> 52:51.760
part like this, most of us. So for instance, if you have children, you realize something lives on

52:52.480 --> 52:57.040
in them, or if you spark an idea in the world, something lives on, or if you identify with

52:57.040 --> 53:01.680
a society around you, because you are part that. You're not just this human being.

53:01.680 --> 53:07.920
Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama. In a sense that you, Joshua Bach,

53:07.920 --> 53:13.440
is just a collection of ideas. So you have this operating system on which a bunch of ideas live

53:13.440 --> 53:19.120
and interact. And then once you die, some of them jump off the ship.

53:19.120 --> 53:23.440
You put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction.

53:23.440 --> 53:29.440
It's not physically real. Identity is not a physical concept. It's basically a representation

53:29.440 --> 53:37.280
of different objects on the same world line. But identity lives and dies. Are you attached?

53:38.560 --> 53:43.920
What's the fundamental thing? Is it the ideas that come together to form identity? Or is

53:43.920 --> 53:48.080
each individual identity actually a fundamental thing? It's a representation that you can get

53:48.080 --> 53:53.200
agency over if you care. So basically, you can choose what you identify with if you want to.

53:53.200 --> 54:04.480
No, but it just seems, if the mind is not real, that the birth and death is not a crucial part

54:04.480 --> 54:16.080
of it. Well, maybe I'm silly. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism, but it seems

54:16.080 --> 54:23.120
that the physical being a physical object in this world is an important aspect of birth and

54:23.120 --> 54:29.120
death. It feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die.

54:30.080 --> 54:34.400
The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the

54:34.400 --> 54:39.760
real world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to

54:39.760 --> 54:44.480
model reality with oscillators. So colors and sound in some sense have octaves.

54:44.480 --> 54:49.200
And it's because they are represented probably with oscillators. So that's why colors form a

54:49.200 --> 54:54.800
circle of use. And colors have harmonics, sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing

54:54.800 --> 55:01.200
oscillators in the brain. So the world that we subjectively interact with is fundamentally

55:01.200 --> 55:05.520
the result of the representation mechanisms in our brain. They are mathematically, to some

55:05.520 --> 55:09.680
degree universal. There are certain regularities that you can discover in the patterns and not

55:09.680 --> 55:14.240
others. But the patterns that we get, this is not the real world. The world that we interact with

55:14.720 --> 55:19.520
is always made of too many parts to count. So when you look at this table and so on,

55:19.520 --> 55:24.800
it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count them. So you only look at

55:24.800 --> 55:31.360
the aggregate dynamics at limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely many particles,

55:31.360 --> 55:35.520
what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get. So geometry that we are

55:35.520 --> 55:40.800
interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that work in the limit that you

55:40.800 --> 55:46.400
get by building an infinite series that converges. For those parts where it converges, it's geometry.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.400
For those parts where it doesn't converge, it's chaos.

55:49.040 --> 55:56.080
Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the consciousness that's emergent in our narrative.

55:56.080 --> 56:00.080
So the consciousness gives it color, gives it feeling, gives it flavor.

56:00.720 --> 56:06.800
So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has to all the

56:06.800 --> 56:12.800
other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color

56:12.800 --> 56:18.720
is given by those aspects of the representation or this experiential color where you care about,

56:18.720 --> 56:22.960
where you have identifications, where something means something, where you are the inside of a

56:22.960 --> 56:28.400
feedback loop and the dimensions of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system

56:28.400 --> 56:34.880
that we emerge over. The meaning of the relations, the graph. Can you elaborate that a little bit?

56:35.600 --> 56:41.840
Maybe you can even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness to be more

56:41.840 --> 56:49.440
systematic? How do you think about consciousness? I think that consciousness is largely a model

56:49.440 --> 56:55.200
of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism that has evolved for a certain type of learning.

56:55.760 --> 57:01.520
At the moment, our machine learning systems largely work by building chains of weighted

57:01.520 --> 57:08.960
sums of real numbers with some nonlinearity. And you will learn by piping an error signal

57:08.960 --> 57:15.840
through these different chain layers and adjusting the weights in these weighted sums.

57:15.840 --> 57:21.120
And you can approximate most polynomials with this if you have enough training data.

57:21.120 --> 57:26.720
But the price is you need to change a lot of these weights. Basically, the error is piped

57:26.800 --> 57:32.160
backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures in the network. And everything

57:32.160 --> 57:36.160
else evens out statistically. And only at these junctures, this is where you had the actual error

57:36.160 --> 57:40.960
in the network, you make the change there. This is a very slow process. And our brains don't have

57:40.960 --> 57:45.200
enough time for that because we don't get old enough to play go the way that our machines

57:45.200 --> 57:50.400
learn to play go. So instead, what we do is an attention-based learning. We pinpoint the probable

57:50.400 --> 57:56.720
region in the network where we can make an improvement. And then we store this binding

57:56.720 --> 58:01.520
state together with the expected outcome in a protocol. And this ability to make indexed

58:01.520 --> 58:08.400
memories for the purpose of learning to revisit these commitments later, this requires a memory

58:08.400 --> 58:13.600
of the contents of our attention. Another aspect is when I construct my reality and make mistakes.

58:13.600 --> 58:18.880
So I see things that turn out to be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able

58:18.880 --> 58:24.640
to point out which features of my perception gave rise to the present construction of reality.

58:25.200 --> 58:30.480
So the system needs to pay attention to the features that are currently in its focus.

58:31.200 --> 58:35.280
And it also needs to pay attention to whether it pays attention itself, in part because the

58:35.280 --> 58:39.760
attentional system gets trained for the same mechanism, so it's reflexive, but also in part

58:39.760 --> 58:44.640
because your attention lapses if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. So it's the

58:44.640 --> 58:50.160
thing that I'm currently seeing just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream

58:50.160 --> 58:55.280
or am I still paying attention to my percept? So you have to periodically go back and see whether

58:55.280 --> 58:59.520
you're still paying attention. And if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the

58:59.520 --> 59:04.160
system becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention

59:04.160 --> 59:08.160
itself and makes attention, the object of its attention, I think this is the loop over which

59:08.160 --> 59:14.800
we wake up. So there's this, so there's this attentional mechanism that's somehow self-referential

59:14.800 --> 59:21.120
that's fundamental to what consciousness is. So just ask you a question, I don't know how much

59:21.120 --> 59:25.840
you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. They use attentional

59:25.840 --> 59:34.480
mechanism, they use something called transformers to learn patterns and sentences by allowing

59:34.480 --> 59:40.160
them at work to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence that each individual. So

59:40.160 --> 59:47.120
like parametrize and make it learnable the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window

59:47.120 --> 59:54.960
into the sentence. Do you think that's like a little step towards that eventually would

59:54.960 --> 59:59.600
take us to the intentional mechanisms from which consciousness can emerge?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.920
Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.440
language translation, there was an example that I found particularly funny, where somebody tried

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:18.080
to translate a text from English into German and it was a bet broke the window. And the

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:25.280
translation in German was in a Fliedermaus zerbracht das Fenster mit einem baseball Schläger.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.960
So to translate back into English a bet, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.880
bet. And it seemed to be the most similar to this program because it somehow maximized

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:43.280
the possibility of translating the concept bet into German in the same sentence. And this is

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.320
some mistake that the transformer model is not doing because it's tracking identity. And the

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.480
attentional mechanism in the transformer model is basically putting its finger on individual

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.360
concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up later in the text and tracks basically the

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.720
individuals through the text. And this is why the system can learn things that other systems

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.960
couldn't before it, which makes it, for instance, possible to write a text where it talks about

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.240
the scientist, then the scientist has a name and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.040
about that thing. What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this. So this meaning falls apart

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.160
at some point, it loses track of this context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.840
has to refer to the same universe. And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.480
in the transformer model does not go beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:40.000
important part of attention, but it's a different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it's not

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.240
the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness that we have. Okay, just to link on, what do you

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.920
mean by identity in the context of language? So when you talk about language, you have different

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.960
words that can refer to the same concept. Got it. And in the sense that... So space of concepts.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:01.360
So yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or in an inexical sense that you say

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.200
this word does not only refer to this class of objects, but it refers to a definite object,

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.360
to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story and is only referred by

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:19.440
different ways in the language. So the language is basically a projection from a conceptual

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:25.520
representation from a scene that is evolving into a discrete string of symbols. And what

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:31.280
the transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection mechanism that other models

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:37.040
couldn't learn. So have you ever seen an artificial intelligence or any kind of construction idea

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.320
that allows for unlike neural networks or perhaps within neural networks that's able to form

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.840
something where the space of concepts continues to be integrated? So what you're describing,

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:56.000
building a knowledge base, building this consistent, larger and larger sets of ideas

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.680
that would then allow for deeper understanding? Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:07.440
from language, from basically a logical grammatical construct. And I think to some degree,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.480
this was also what Minsky believed. So that's why he focused so much on common sense reasoning

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:18.880
and so on. And a project that was inspired by him was Psyche. That was basically-

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.680
That's still going on.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.680
Yes. Of course, ideas don't die, only people die.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.200
And that's true, but-

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.040
And Psyche is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.520
converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve,

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.160
and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations,

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.040
was the notion of images. So images play an important role in tractatus, the tractatus

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.440
in attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language, to design a logical

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.800
language in which you can do actual philosophy that Wittgenhaft for doing this. And the difficulty

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.280
was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually, I think he decided that he was not able to solve

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:07.200
it. And I think this preempted the failure of the logitist program in AI. And the solution,

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.760
as we see it today, is we need more general function approximation. There are functions,

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.040
geometric functions, that we learn to approximate that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.840
in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory and so

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:28.640
on and to learn in algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry. But to equate

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.720
language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it. So functional, you kind of just

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.920
said that neural networks are sort of the approach that neural networks takes is actually more general

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:48.560
than what can be expressed through language. Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.320
through language at the data rates at which we process grammatical language?

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.960
Okay, so you don't think languages, so you disagree with Wittgenstein,

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:03.040
that language is not fundamental to? I agree with Wittgenstein. I just agree with the late Wittgenstein.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.600
And I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the tractatus itself

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.120
is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was written in the 20th century.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.560
But language is not fundamental to cognition and intelligence and consciousness.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.520
So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we're using is a

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.960
particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages in

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.040
which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:40.480
different. They're more general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:46.880
model is you have a bunch of parameters. These have a range. These are the variances of the world.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.200
And you have relationships between them, which are constraints, which say if certain parameters

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:58.080
have these values, then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.800
early insight in computer science. And I think some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.280
machine. And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that while it has a measure of whether it's

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.120
good, it's basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.640
constraints where the constraints don't quite match. It's very difficult to, despite having this

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.720
global measure, to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially few elements,

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.880
parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.880
And so the solution that Hinton and Zanovsky found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.760
which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine and only has

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.960
basically input and output layer. But this limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machine. So now

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.360
he builds a network of small of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense, you can

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.840
see a almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we're using today,

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.640
even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the Boltzmann machine

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.120
is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception. And this forces the entire

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.960
machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently perceive.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:13.200
And this state is your model of the world. I think it's a very general way of thinking about

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:19.920
models. But we have to use a different approach to make it work. And this is, we have to find

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.440
different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that trains the

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.680
Boltzmann machine and the mechanism that makes the Boltzmann machine settle into its state

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.760
are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine itself.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.400
The kind of mechanism that we want to develop, you're saying?

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.320
Yes. So there's the direction in which I think our research is going to go,

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.560
is going to, for instance, what you notice in perception is our perceptual models of the world

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.520
are not probabilistic, but possibilistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.920
are improbable, but possible, right? Perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.200
possible, if it's coherent. So if you see a tiger coming after, you should be able to see this,

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:09.760
even if it's unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the model. So

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.600
given the state of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features,

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.040
how should you change the states of the model to get it to convert with your perception?

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:30.560
But the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing is perhaps not

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.960
as large. I mean, that's perhaps pretty small. The degree of coherence that you

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.600
need to achieve depends, of course, how deep your models go. That is, for instance, politics is

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.400
very simple when you know very little about game theory and human nature. So the younger you are,

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.320
the more obvious it is how politics should work, right? Because you get a coherent aesthetic from

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.920
relatively few inputs. And the more layers you model, the more layers you model reality,

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:05.600
the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints. So the current neural networks are fundamentally

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.640
supervised learning system with a feed forward neural network is back propagation to learn.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.360
What's your intuition about what kind of mechanisms might we move towards to improve

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.920
the learning procedure? I think one big aspect is going to be meta learning and architecture

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.160
search starts in this direction. In some sense, the first wave of AI classical AI work by identifying

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.240
a problem and the possible solution and implementing the solution right program that plays chess.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.920
And right now we are in the second wave of AI. So instead of writing the algorithm that

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:43.040
implements the solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches for an algorithm

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.760
that implements the solution. So the learning system in some sense is an algorithm that

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.320
itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem, like go. Go is too hard to implement

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.320
it by the solution by hand, but we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.960
Let's move to the third stage, right? The third stage would be meta learning.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.120
Find an algorithm that discovers the learning algorithm for the given domain.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.080
Our brain is probably not a learning system, but a meta learning system.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.840
This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way. If you look at the way our

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.240
brain is, for instance, implemented, there is no central control that tells all the neurons how

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.000
to wire up. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.240
a single celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fed.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:36.160
It gets fed if it fires on average at the right time. The right time depends on the

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:42.160
context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:48.320
So it basically has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire to get fed.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.240
Or if you see it as a reinforcement learning agent, every neuron is in some sense

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.040
making a hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to pipe a signal through the universe

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.000
and tries to get positive feedback for it. The entire thing is set up in such a way that it's

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.280
robustly self-organizing into a brain, which means you start out with different neuron types

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.960
that have different priors on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward. You put them

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.240
into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment, and then you entrain it

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.680
in a particular order. As a result, you get a well-organized brain.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:29.520
Okay, so the brain is a meta-learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning agents.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:40.640
I think you said, but just to clarify, there's no centralized government that tells you

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:48.400
here's a loss function, here's a loss function, here's a loss function. Who says what's the

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.760
objective of what's going on? There are also governments which impose loss functions on

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.520
different parts of the brain. So we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.400
get especially rewarded when you look at faces. If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.240
which basically means the inability to tell people apart by their faces.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.400
And the reason that happens is because it had an evolutionary advantage. So evolution comes

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.280
into play here. But it's basically an extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don't think

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.400
that people with a prosopagnosia have a perceived defective brain. The brain just has an average

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.120
attention for faces. So people with prosopagnosia don't look at faces more than they look at cups.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.720
So the level at which they resolve the geometry of faces is not higher than the one for cups.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.560
And people that don't have prosopagnosia look obsessively at faces. For you and me,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.200
it's impossible to move through a crowd without scanning the faces. And as a result,

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.200
we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow us to discern mental states of people.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:52.000
So obviously, we don't know 99% of the details of this meta-learning system that's our mind.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000
But still, we took a leap from something much dumber to that from through the evolutionary

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.360
process. Can you, first of all, maybe say how big of a leap is that from our brain,

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:16.720
from our ape ancestors to multi-cell organisms? And is there something we can think about

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.800
as we start to think about how to engineer intelligence? Is there something we can learn

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:30.880
from evolution? In some sense, life exists because of the market opportunity of controlled chemical

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.720
reactions. We compete with dump chemical reactions and we win in some areas against this dump

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.040
combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients where you need to add a little bit

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.600
of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy. So we all competed combustion?

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.160
Yes, in many regions we do. We try very hard because when we are in direct competition,

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:56.560
we lose. Because the combustion is going to close the entropy gradients much faster than we can

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:04.160
run. So basically, we do this because every cell has a Turing machine built into it.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:11.440
It's like literally a read-write head on a tape. So everything that's more complicated than a

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:18.080
molecule that just is a vortex around the tractors that needs a Turing machine for its

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.840
regulation. And then you bind cells together and you get next-level organizational organism where

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:30.640
the cells together implement some kind of software. And for me, a very interesting discovery in the

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.760
last year was the word spirit because I realized that what spirit actually means is an operating

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.720
system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented, people needed this word.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.720
But they didn't have robots that they built themselves. Yet the only autonomous robots

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.280
that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities, and so on. And they all

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.240
had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant is an operating system. If you pinch the

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.960
plant in one area, then this is going to have repercussions throughout the plant. Everything

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.600
in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics like in other organisms.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.560
An organism is not a collection of cells. It's a function that tells cells how to behave.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.600
And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing,

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.360
like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:28.000
cell with each other's cell. So what you're saying is the organism is a function that tells what

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:37.200
to do. And the function emerges from the interaction of the cells.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.520
So it's basically a description of what the plant is doing in terms of macro states.

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.800
And the micro states, the physical implementation are too many of them to describe them. So the

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.320
software that we use to describe what the plant is doing, the spirit of the plant is the software,

01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.160
the operating system of the plant, right? This is a way in which we, the observers, make sense of

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.960
the plant. And the same is true for people. So people have spirits, which is their operating

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.680
system in a way, right? And there are aspects of that operating system that relate to how your

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.680
body functions and others, how you socially interact, how you interact with yourself and so

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:20.160
on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it's a loaded term because it's from a

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:26.160
pre-scientific age. But it took the scientific age a long time to rediscover a term that is

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.040
pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the differences that we still see between the old

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.400
word and the new word are translation errors that have been over the centuries.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.760
Can you actually linger on that? Like, why do you say that spirit, just to clarify,

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:45.120
because I'm a little bit confused. So the word spirit is a powerful thing. But why did you say

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.160
in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.760
spirit? Or do you mean? I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality

01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.240
in the US, it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.320
And a culture is in some sense, you could say the spirit of a society that is long game.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.720
This thing that becomes self-aware at a level above the individuals where you say,

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.040
if you don't do the following things, then the grand-grand-grand-grandchildren of our children

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.400
will not have nothing to eat. So if you take this long scope where you try to maximize the

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.320
length of the game that you are playing as a species, you realize that you're part of a

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.600
larger thing that you cannot fully control. You probably need to submit to the

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:36.880
ecosphere instead of trying to completely control it. There needs to be a certain level at which

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:42.880
we can exist as a species if you want to endure. And our culture is not sustaining this anymore.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.640
We basically made this bet with the Industrial Revolution that we can control everything.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:52.400
And the modernist societies with basically unfettered growth led to a situation in which

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:58.880
we depend on the ability to control the entire planet. And since we are not able to do that,

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.240
as it seems, this culture will die. And we realize that it doesn't have a future,

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.280
right? We called our children generations that it's such a very optimistic thing to do.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:16.320
Yeah, so you have this kind of intuition that our civilization, you said culture,

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:22.800
but you really mean the spirit of the civilization, the entirety of the civilization

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.160
may not exist for long. Can you untangle that? What's your intuition behind that?

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:36.320
So you kind of offline mentioned to me that the Industrial Revolution was kind of the moment

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:44.240
we agreed to accept the offer, sign on the paper, on the dotted line with the Industrial Revolution,

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.200
we doomed ourselves. Can you elaborate on that? This is suspicion. I of course don't know how it

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:57.840
plays out, but it seems to me that in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.800
an entropic abyss without land on the other side, it's relatively clear that your cantilever is at

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:08.320
some point going to break down into this entropic abyss. And you have to pay the bill.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:16.800
Okay, Russia is my first language, and I'm also an idiot. Me too. This is just two apes,

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.440
instead of playing with the banana trying to have fun by talking. Okay,

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:30.320
anthropic what? And what's anthropic? Entropic. Entropic. So entropic in the sense of entropy.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.400
Oh, entropic, guys. Yes. And entropic, what was the other word you used? Abyss.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:41.600
What's that? It's a big quart. Oh, abyss. Abyss, yes. Entropic abyss. So many of the things you

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:49.120
say are poetic, it's parting my brain. It's amazing, right? It's mispronounced, which makes

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:58.960
you do more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So entropic abyss. Okay, let's rewind then. The

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.680
industrial revolution, so how does that get us into the entropic abyss?

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:10.000
So in some sense, we burned 100 million years worth of trees to get everybody plumbing.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.600
Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number of people. So basically,

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:24.000
since zero BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. And this only changed with

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.080
the Enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution. And in some sense, the Enlightenment

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.440
freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the preexisting order gradually.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.080
It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops, so it was not that just one

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:46.080
caused the other. It was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically increasing

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:53.520
productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the definition of

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.880
poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die,

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.480
which is in some sense the state that all animals on earth are in.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.320
The definition of poverty is having enough...

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.920
So you can have only so many children as you can feed and if you have more, they die.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.960
And in our societies, you can basically have as many children as you want and they don't die.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.200
Right. So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:26.240
pay a price in terms of we have to insert ourselves in the lower source of dread if we have too many.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.320
So basically everybody in the under, middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:38.000
children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to their individual families

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.120
because children, especially in the US, super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.440
this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you are super poor, it doesn't

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.920
matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change and these children are

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:58.400
largely not going to die of hunger. So how does this lead to self-destruction? So there's a lot of

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.040
unpleasant properties about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to let

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:12.080
our children survive even if they have diseases. Like I would have died before my mid-20s without

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.560
modern medicine and most of my friends would have as well. And so many of us wouldn't live

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:24.160
without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialized society. We get our protein

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:30.240
largely by sub-doing the entirety of nature. Imagine there would be some very clever microbe

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:36.880
that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.720
a thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that, for instance,

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.520
brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.480
and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.560
that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:02.240
changes. Yeah, but some part of that organism, the one that's actually doing all the using of the

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:08.880
that there'll still be somebody thriving. So it relates back to this original question.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:14.160
I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.520
complex system has to have some complex regulation if it depends on feedback loops. And so for

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.880
instance, it's likely that we should describe a certain degree of intelligence to plants.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.160
The problem is that plants don't have a nervous system. So they don't have a way to telegraph

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:37.840
messages over large distances almost instantly in the plant. And instead, they will rely on

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.440
chemicals between adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:49.920
processing with the rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.920
intelligent, it's not going to be intelligent at similar timescales. The time scale is different.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:02.560
So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent, but we're the most intelligent

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:08.160
and the spatial scale and our time scale. So basically, if you would zoom out very far,

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:13.520
we might discover that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet that existed for

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:18.480
thousands of years in a almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these ecosystems

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.200
actively related their environment. So basically, change the course of the evolution vision,

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.840
this ecosystem to make it more efficient and less brittle.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.640
So it's possible something like plants is actually a set of living organisms,

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.200
an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating a different time scale and are far

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.760
superior in intelligence to human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:45.520
still be there and they'll be there. Yeah, there's an evolutionary adaptation playing a

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.080
role at all of these levels. For instance, if mice don't get enough food and get stressed,

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.200
the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.480
because in a natural environment, the mice have probably hidden a drought or something else.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.840
And if they're overgrays, then all the things that sustain them might go extinct. And there will be

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.560
no mice a few generations from now. So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.000
from now, basically the mice scale back. And a similar thing happens with the predators of mice.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.240
They should make sure that the mice don't completely go extinct. So in some sense,

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:25.520
if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.320
And maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains than antelopes is not so much

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.320
because it's so hard to catch an antelope as opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.560
need to make complex models of their environment, more complex than the antelopes.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:45.520
So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.440
not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on earth,

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:54.080
makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.440
Yes, maybe we adjust Gaia's ploy to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.080
Yeah, this is just a nice, we tried it out.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.120
The big stain on evolution is not as it was trees. First evolved trees before they could

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.640
be digested again, right? There were no insects that could break all of them apart.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:15.040
Cellulose is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.480
fell into swamps and all this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.520
And we are the species that is destined to take care of that.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.400
So this is kind of...

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.840
To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the earth is already greening.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:35.280
So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.200
that they're not compatible with right now, this is going to be awesome again.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.000
And there won't be even a memory of us little apes.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.240
I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first general intelligent species in

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.720
this sense. We are the first species with an industrial society because we will leave more

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.920
phones than bones in the stratosphere. Well, see, phones than bones, I like it.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.560
But then let me push back. You've kind of suggested that we have a very narrow definition of

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.520
I mean, why aren't trees more general, a higher level of general intelligence?

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.120
If trees were intelligent, then they would be at different time scales,

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.040
which means within a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.240
complex as the ones that we make in 10 years. But maybe the trees are the ones that made the

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:30.480
phones, right? You could say the entirety of life did it. The first cell never died.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.720
The first cell only split, right? And every divided. And every cell in our body is still

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.360
an instance of the first cell that split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.480
on this planet as far as we know. And so the cell is not just a building block of life.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.000
It's a hypoorganism, right? And we are part of this hypoorganism.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:56.160
So nevertheless, this hyperorganism, no, this little particular branch of it,

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.200
which is us humans, because of the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:07.040
technology might somehow destroy ourselves. So what do you think is the most likely

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.320
way we might destroy ourselves? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people,

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.920
as we've talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:25.120
artificial intelligence destroying us. Some people worry about nuclear weapons and weapons of war

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:29.680
in general. What do you think? If you had to, if you were a betting man, what would you bet on in

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.880
terms of self-destruction? And they would be higher than 50, would it be higher than 50 percent?

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:41.280
So it's very likely that nothing that we bet on matters after we win our bets. So I don't think

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.480
that bets are literally the right way to go about this. I mean, once you're dead, you won't be there

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:52.640
to collect the weighings. So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.200
our present civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.480
fewer people on the planet than there are today. And even if not, then still most of people that

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.280
are alive today will not have offspring in 100 years from now because of the geographic changes

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.960
and so on and the changes in the food supply. It's quite likely that many areas of the planet

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.920
will only be livable with a close cooling chain in 100 years from now. So many of the areas around

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:25.440
the equator and in sub-tropical climates that are now quite pleasant to live in will stop to be

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:31.200
inhabitable without air conditioning. So you honestly, wow, cooling chain, close-knit cooling

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:38.080
chain communities. So you think you have a strong worry about the effects of global warming?

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:42.560
By itself, it's not the big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.440
months in the summer in which you cannot be outside. And so you have a close cooling chain,

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.200
you have air conditioning in your car and in your home and you're fine. And if the air conditioning

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:57.600
would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive. Can we just pause

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:04.080
for a second? You say so many brilliant, poetic things. What is a close, do people use that term

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:10.080
close cooling chain? I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get meat into a

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.720
supermarket. If you break the cooling chain and this thing starts to thaw, you're in trouble and

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:22.080
you have to sew it away. That's such a beautiful way to put it. It's like calling a city a closed

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.400
social chain or something like that. That's right. The locality of it is really important.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:30.240
It basically means you wake up in a climatized room, you go to work in a climatized car,

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.720
you work in a climatized office, you shop in a climatized supermarket. And in between,

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.800
you have very short distance in which you run from your car to the supermarket. But you have

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:43.680
to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of the environment.

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.080
The crucial thing is the wet bulb temperature. The wet bulb temperature. It's what you get

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:54.960
when you take a wet clothes and you put it around your thermometer and then you will move it very

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:02.560
quickly through the air so you get the evaporation heat. And as soon as you can no longer cool your

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:09.040
body temperature via evaporation to a temperature below something like I think 35 degrees, you die.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.480
Which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down by sweating,

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.720
but if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature,

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.320
then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you're a healthy, fit individual within

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:31.520
a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on, you'll die. Unless you have some

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:37.440
climatizing equipment. And this itself, if as long as you maintain civilization and you have

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.920
energy supply and you have food trucks coming to your home that are climatized, everything is fine.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.640
But what if you lose a large-scale open agriculture at the same time? So basically,

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:51.440
you run into food insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:58.240
irregular and you have a lot of extreme weather events. So you need to roll most of your food maybe

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.760
indoor or you need to import your food from certain regions. And maybe you're not able to maintain

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.640
the civilization throughout the planet to get the infrastructure to get the food to your home.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.920
But there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.040
There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you not have

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.880
not a faith, but what do you make of the capacity of technological innovation

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:36.640
to help us prevent some of the worst damages that this condition can create? So as an example,

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.240
as a almost out there example is the work that SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:50.560
also consider our propagation throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets.

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.680
That's one technological step. But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to

01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.720
save us from global warming because Mars looks much worse than Earth will look like after the

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:06.960
worst outcomes of global warming imaginable, right? Mars is essentially not habitable.

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.360
It's exceptionally harsh environment, yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.760
throughout history since the Industrial Revolution are doing, are just doing a lot of different

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.320
technological innovation with some kind of target. And when ends up happening is totally

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:27.440
unexpected new things come up. So trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars,

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:35.040
extremely harsh environment, might give us totally new ideas of how to expand or increase the power

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:44.160
of this closed cooling circuit that empowers the community. So it seems like there's a little bit

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:53.760
of a race between our open-ended technological innovation of this communal operating system

01:33:53.760 --> 01:34:02.560
that we have and our general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.360
You don't think technology can win that race?

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:11.600
I think the probability is relatively low given that our technology is, for instance,

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:17.040
the U.S. is stagnating since the 1970s roughly. In terms of technology, most of the things that

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.240
we do are the result of incremental processes. What about Intel? What about Moore's law?

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.360
It's basically, it's very incremental. The things that we are doing is, so the invention of the

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:36.480
microprocessor was a major thing. The miniaturization of transistors was really major. But the things

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:44.480
that we did afterwards largely were not that innovative. We had gradual changes of scaling

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:51.840
things from CPUs into GPUs and things like that. But I don't think that there are,

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.040
basically there are not many things if you take a person that died in the 70s and was at the top

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.280
of their game, they would not need to read that many books to be current again.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:06.800
But it's all about books. Who cares about books? There might be things that are beyond books might

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.960
be a very... Or say papers or... No, papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are,

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:16.080
so papers and books and knowledge, that's a concept of a time when you were sitting there

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.800
by candlelight and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.240
in the middle of? We're not, might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube. The reason

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:33.280
you and I are sitting here today is because of Twitter and YouTube. So the ripple effect,

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.760
and there's two minds, sort of two dumb apes are coming up with a new, perhaps a new clean

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.280
insights. And there's 200 other apes listening right now, 200,000 other apes listening right now.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:51.200
And that effect, it's very difficult to understand what that effect will have. That might be bigger

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.160
than any of the advancement of the microprocessor or the industrial revolution, the ability of

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:08.400
spread knowledge. And that knowledge, it allows good ideas to reach millions much faster. And the

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.720
effect of that, that might be the new, that might be the 21st century, is the multiplying of ideas.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:22.480
Because if you say one good thing today, that will multiply across huge amounts of people. And

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.000
then they will say something, and then they will have another podcast, and they'll say something,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.680
and then they'll write a paper. That could be a huge, you don't think that...

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.760
Yeah, we should have billions of von Neumanns right now in two rings, and we don't for some reason.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.720
I suspect the reason is that we destroy our attention span. Also the incentives, of course,

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:48.240
different. So the reason why we are sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because you

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.240
and me don't have the attention span to write a book together right now, and you guys probably

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.840
don't have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you... But I guarantee you they're still

01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:02.400
listening. You can't burst care of your attention. It's very short. But we're an hour and 40 minutes

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:07.280
in, and I guarantee you that 80% of the people are still listening. So there is an attention span,

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:13.200
it's just the form. Who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information?

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.760
That's still an open question. I mean, that's what we're...

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.360
There's something that social media could be doing, that other forms could not be doing.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:23.680
I think the end game of social media is a global brain. And Twitter is, in some sense,

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.440
a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn't have any kind of inhibition,

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.120
and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure. It's also, in some sense, a multi-player role

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:38.800
playing game. And people use it to play an avatar that is not like them as they were in the

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.160
sane world, and they look through the world through the lens of their phones and think it's

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.240
the real world. But it's the Twitter world that is distorted by the popularity incentives of Twitter.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:53.200
Yeah, the incentives and just our natural biological, the dopamine rush of a like,

01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:02.640
no matter how... I try to be very kind of zen-like and minimalist and not be influenced by likes and

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:09.280
so on, but it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some degree. Speaking of a small tangent

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:18.160
of Twitter, how can Twitter be done better? I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.240
impact on society by doing exactly what you're doing. Sorry, doing exactly what you described,

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:31.440
which is having this... We're like, this is some kind of game, and we're kind of

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.280
individual RL agents in this game, and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.880
centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey nor the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:49.440
this game. Or can they? That's sort of a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.040
this game? I wouldn't give advice because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts

01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:00.720
on this. Our brain has solved this problem to some degree. Our brain has lots of individual

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:05.200
agents that manage to play together in a way, and they have also many contexts in which other

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:11.920
organisms have found ways to solve the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:19.600
Maybe the solution is to go for an evolutionary approach. Imagine that you have something like

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:25.040
Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter, and you think about what they have

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.200
in common. What they have in common? They are companies that in some sense own a protocol.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.880
This protocol is imposed on a community, and the protocol has different components for monetization,

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.760
for user management, for user display, for rating, for anonymity, for import of other content,

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:47.040
and so on. Now imagine that you take these components of the protocol apart, and you

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:53.600
do it in some sense like communities, visit this social network, and these communities are allowed

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:59.520
to mix and match their protocols and design new ones. For instance, the UI and the UX can be

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:04.640
defined by the community. The rules for sharing content across communities can be defined. The

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:10.000
monetization can be redefined. The way you reward individual users for what can be redefined,

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.160
the way users can represent themselves and to each other can redefine.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.000
Who could be the redefiner? Can individual human beings build enough intuition to redefine those

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.160
things? This itself can become part of the protocol. For instance, it could be in some

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.720
communities, it will be a single person that comes up with these things, and others, it's a group of

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.920
friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting weighted voting. Who knows?

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.720
Who knows what will be the best self-organizing principle for this?

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.840
But the process can't be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain...

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.360
Who can be automated so people can write software for this? And eventually, the idea is,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.320
let's not make an assumption about this thing if you don't know what the right solution is. In

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:55.600
those areas, we have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc

01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:01.360
or machines doing this, whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia,

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.560
or with software solutions, or with AI that goes through the posts of people, or with a

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:12.240
legal principle, and so on. This is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:18.640
be if you let the communities evolve, and you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:25.760
the most sentient communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors that allow

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.960
you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals. You have a network that gives you

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:35.680
information that is relevant to you. It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.400
ways. It allows you to build teams. It allows you to basically bring the best of you into

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.720
this thing and goes into a coupling, into a relationship with others in which you produce

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:51.600
things that you would be unable to produce alone. Yes, beautifully put. But the key process of that

01:41:51.600 --> 01:42:00.560
with incentives and evolution is things that don't adopt themselves to effectively get the

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:06.880
incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy,

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.920
or whatever you want to define as the incentives, really don't like dying. One of the things that

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:17.840
people really get agressive, protest aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.760
I don't know much about the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:34.320
censorship is really painful in America. And so what do you think about that,

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:42.000
having grown up in East Germany? Do you think censorship is an important tool in our brain,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.440
in the intelligence, and in the social networks? So basically, if you're not a good member

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.280
of the entirety of the system, then you should be blocked away, well, locked away, blocked.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.400
An important thing is who decides that you're a good member. Who? Is it distributed?

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.520
And what is the outcome of the process that decides it,

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.040
both for the individual and for society at large? For instance, if you have a high trust

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.080
society, you don't need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even, in some sense,

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:20.880
undermining trust, because it's basically punishing people that look suspicious when

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.560
surveyed, but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite, if you have a low trust society,

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:30.720
then surveillance can be a better trade-off. And the US is currently making a transition

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.440
from a relatively high trust or mixed trust society to a low trust society, so surveillance

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.000
will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are not just inert representations. There are

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.720
implementations that run code on your brain and change your reality and change the way you

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:51.280
interact with each other at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:57.680
use to display our alignment. So for instance, people might say all cultures are the same and

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.560
equally good, but still they prefer to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so.

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:06.880
And it turns out that the cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction,

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.760
and these rules of interaction lead to different results when you implement them. So if you adhere

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:18.080
to certain rules, you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.600
tricky situations when people do not have a commitment to shared purpose. And our societies

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.560
probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how to make this

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:35.360
compatible with a non-totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a conundrum between

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:43.600
totalitarianism and diversity, and it doesn't need to how to resolve this. And the solutions

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.920
that the US has found so far are very crude, because it's a very young society that is also

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:51.520
under a lot of tension. It seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself.

01:44:52.240 --> 01:45:01.120
What do you think, just philosophizing, what kind of mechanisms of government do you think

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:05.440
we as a species should be evolving with? US or broadly? What do you think will work well

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.080
as a system? Of course, we don't know. It all seems to work pretty crappily. Some things worse

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:18.560
than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet Union.

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.480
Some people argue that anarchy is the best, and then completely discarding the positive effects

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.800
of government. There's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing pretty damn well.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.880
In the span of history, there's respect for human rights, which seems to be a nice feature,

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:41.520
not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:48.880
People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things. What lessons do you draw from

01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:55.680
that? What kind of government system do you think is good? Ideally, government should

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.600
not be perceivable. It should be frictionless. The more you notice the influence of the

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.800
government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient the government

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:15.440
probably is. A government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes an offset on your payout

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:22.080
metrics to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the common good. You have these situations

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.600
where people act on the local incentives. And these local incentives, everybody does the thing

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:31.680
that's locally the best for them, but the global outcome is not good. And this is even the case

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.920
when people care about the global outcome, because a regulation mechanism exists that

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.000
creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what I do.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.560
So for instance, if I think that we should fly less, and I stay at home, there's not a single

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.120
plane that is going to not start because of me. It's not going to have an influence, but I don't

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.400
get from A to B. So the way to implement this would basically to have a government that is

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:59.600
sharing this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance,

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.480
makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.200
that are less putting that strain on the environment, for instance.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.960
So there's so much optimism in so many things you describe, and yet there's the pessimism of

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.840
you think our civilization is going to come to an end. So that's not 100% probability,

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:29.600
nothing in this world is. So what's the trajectory out of self-destruction, do you think?

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.680
I suspect that in some sense, we are both too smart and not smart enough,

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.680
which means we are very good at solving near-term problems. And at the same time,

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:44.640
we are unwilling to submit to the imperatives that we would have to follow and if you want to

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:51.040
stick around. So that makes it difficult. If you were unable to solve everything technologically,

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.760
you can probably understand how high the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.520
and how high the mutation rate needs to be to adapt to slowly changing your systemic environment.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:06.480
So you could, in principle, compute all these things game theoretically and adapt to it.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.400
But if you cannot do this because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die,

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.960
you will use any kind of medical information to keep child mortality low. Even if it means that

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.600
our visit in the future generations, we have enormous genetic drift and most of us have allergies

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.520
as a result of not being adapted to the changes that we made to our food supply.

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:31.840
That's for now, I say technologically speaking, we're just a very young,

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.960
300 years industrial revolution. We're very new to this idea. So you're attached to your kids being

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.760
alive and not being murdered for the good of good of society, but that might be a very temporary

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:50.480
moment of time that we might evolve. So like you said, we're both smart and not smart enough.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:56.080
We are probably not this first human civilization that has discovered technology that allows to

01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:02.000
efficiently overgrace our resources. And this overgracing, at some point, we think we can

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.400
compensate this because if we have eaten all the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.640
Right? But it could also be that the ecosystems tip. And so what really concerns me is not so much

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.760
the end of the civilization because we will invent a new one. But what concerns me is

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.320
the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip. So for instance, maybe the plankton dies

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:29.360
because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over. And as a result, we can no longer

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.080
breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning. So basically a major reboot of most

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:40.400
complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a possibility. I don't know what the percentage

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.560
for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be outlandish to me if you look at the scale

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.200
of the changes that we've already triggered on this planet. And so Danny Hillers suggests that

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.120
for instance, we may be able to put chalk into the stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe

01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:00.080
it works. Maybe this is sufficient to counter the effects of what we've done. Maybe it won't be.

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:05.520
Maybe we won't be able to implement it by the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:10.880
is going to play out in this regard. It's just, I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:18.000
like this. All our cousin species, the other home, and it's a gun. So the right step would be to

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:26.080
what? To rewind towards the industrial revolution and slow the, to try to contain

01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.120
the technological process that leads to the overconsumption of resources.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:37.440
Imagine you get to choose. You have one lifetime. You get born into a sustainable agricultural

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:44.960
civilization, 300, maybe 400 million people on the planet tops. Or before this, some kind of

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:51.200
nomadic species with like a million or 2 million. And so you don't meet new people unless you give

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.920
birth to them. You cannot travel to other places in the world. There is no internet. There is no

01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.160
interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep. So you would not discover

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:05.840
tumor incompleteness probably and so on. We wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:11.040
born into an insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned 100 million

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.160
years worth of trees in a single century. Which one do you like? I think I like this one. It's

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.960
a very weird thing that when you find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.960
like we are not going to miss it. And a lot of people are in denial and most of the counter

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.320
arguments sound like denial to me. There don't seem to be rational arguments.

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:33.120
And the other thing is we are born on this Titanic. Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:36.800
been born. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be talking. We wouldn't be on the internet. We

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.840
wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy. And we are not responsible for this happening. It's

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.760
basically if we had the choice, we would probably try to prevent it. But when we were born,

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.080
we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society we want to be born,

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.120
what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively little agency in the entire

01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:01.520
thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's basically a giant machine

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:05.680
that's tumbling down a hill and everybody is fantastically trying to push some buttons. Nobody

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.480
knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them are not

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:15.600
stopping this tumbling down the hill. As possible, the artificial intelligence will give us

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:24.000
an escape latch somehow. So there's a lot of worry about existential threats of

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.280
artificial intelligence. But what AI also allows in general forms of automation

01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:38.800
allows the potential of extreme productivity growth that will also, perhaps in a positive way,

01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:46.080
transform society that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:55.120
more, to the same kind of ideals of closer to nature that's represented in hunter-gatherer

01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:01.680
societies that's not destroying the planet, that's not doing overconsumption and so on.

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:05.600
I mean, generally speaking, do you have hope that AI can help somehow?

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:12.080
I think it is not fun to be very close to nature until you completely subdue nature.

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.520
So our idea of being close to nature means being close to agriculture,

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.840
basically forests that don't have anything in them that eats us.

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:29.120
See, I mean, I want to disagree with that. I think the niceness of being close to nature

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:38.160
is to being fully present. When survival becomes your primary, not just your goal,

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:48.560
but your whole existence, I'm not just romanticizing, I can just speak for myself.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:54.080
I am self-aware enough that that is a fulfilling existence.

01:53:54.960 --> 01:54:00.960
I prefer to be in nature and not fight for my survival. I think fighting for your survival

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:06.560
while being in the cold and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having open wounds

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:12.720
is very unpleasant. There's a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you, just as you said,

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:18.720
would not choose it, but if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling existence.

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.960
If you are adapted to it, basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you get

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.960
rewards optimally in such an environment, and there is some evidence for this that

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.480
for a certain degree of complexity, basically, people are more happy in such an environment,

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.600
because it's what we largely have evolved for. In between, we had a few thousand years in which

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:44.720
I think we have evolved for a slightly more comfortable environment. So there is probably

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.920
something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than there would be

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:56.480
if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and often die versus

01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:02.640
something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big mordor, in which we run

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:10.320
through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines and largely don't feel well cared for

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:17.200
as the monkeys that we are. So returning briefly to, not briefly, but returning to AI,

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.560
what, let me ask a romanticized question, what is the most beautiful to you,

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:29.040
silly ape, the most beautiful or surprising idea in the development of artificial intelligence,

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.120
whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence that you've come across?

01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:40.640
If you built an AI, it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree of detail of the world,

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.760
and then it would try to understand its own nature. It's tempting to think that at some point,

01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.240
when we have general intelligence, we have competitions where we will let the AIs wake

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.200
up in different kinds of physical universes, and we measure how many movements of the Rubik's Cube

01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.160
it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe and what it is in its own nature

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:05.360
and its own physics and so on. So what if we exist in the memory of an AI that is trying to

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:10.400
understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and remembers Lex and Yosha sitting in

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:16.080
a hotel, sparking some of the ideas of that led to the development of general intelligence?

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.240
So we're a kind of simulation that's running in an AI system that's trying to understand itself.

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.920
It's not that I believe that, but I think it's a beautiful idea.

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:35.040
I mean, you kind of return to this idea with a Turing test of intelligence being

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.400
the process of asking and answering, what is intelligence?

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:53.600
I mean, why do you think there is an answer? Why is there such a search for an answer?

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:58.880
So does there have to be like an answer? You just had an AI system that's trying to

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.880
understand the Y of what, you know, understand itself.

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:11.120
Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater and greater intelligence?

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.920
Is the continuous trying of understanding itself?

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:19.120
No, I think you will find that most people don't care about that because they're well adjusted

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.480
enough to not care. And the reason why people like you and me care about it probably has to do

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.800
with the need to understand ourselves. It's because we are in fundamental disagreement

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.200
with the universe that we wake up in. It looked down on me and I see, oh my god,

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.800
I'm caught in a monkey. What's that? Some people are unhappy with the government and I'm unhappy

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:44.960
with the entire universe that I find myself in. So you don't think that's a fundamental

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:47.600
aspect of human nature that some people are just suppressing,

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.160
that they wake up shocked they're in the body of a monkey?

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.880
No, there is a clear adaptive value to not be confused by that and by...

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:04.160
Well, no, that's not what I asked. So yeah, if there's clear adaptive value, then

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:09.760
there's clear adaptive value to while fundamental your brain is confused by that,

01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:18.240
by creating an illusion, another layer of the narrative that tries to suppress that and instead

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:22.240
say that what's going on with the government right now is the most important thing. What's

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.720
going on with my football team is the most important thing. But it seems to me the...

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:34.320
For me, it was a really interesting moment reading Ernest Becker's Denial of Death.

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:46.000
That this kind of idea that we're all... The fundamental thing from which most of our human

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:52.640
mind springs is this fear of mortality and being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:59.440
mortality and then you construct illusions on top of that. I guess I'm... You being...

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:07.600
Just to push on it, you really don't think it's possible that this worry of the big existential

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.800
questions is actually fundamental as the existentialist thought to our existence.

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:18.000
I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don't see the big picture.

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:24.480
The thing is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn't have identity. Software in

01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:31.920
some sense is a physical law. But it feels like there's an identity. I thought that was for

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:36.480
this particular piece of software and the narrative it tells. That's a fundamental

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.840
property of it. The maintenance of the identity is not terminal. It's instrumental to something

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:46.960
else. You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning. So you can do the things that you're

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:52.160
supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people, the fear of death is the fear of

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:55.680
dying before they are done with the things that they feel they have to do even though they cannot

01:59:55.680 --> 02:00:02.720
quite put their finger on it, what it is, what that is. Right. But in the software world,

02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:07.360
to return to the question, then what happens after we die?

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:15.040
Why would you care? You will not be longer there. The point of dying is that you are gone.

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:21.040
Well, maybe I'm not. This is what, you know, it seems like there's so much...

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:28.800
In the idea that this is just, the mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:37.360
some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function world that we can't quite get direct

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:44.800
access to, then like the idea of mortality seems to be fuzzy as well. Maybe there's not

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:50.160
a clear end. No, the fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don't have continuous

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:55.920
existence. How do you know that? Like that... Because it's not computable. Because you're

02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:59.520
saying it's... There is no continuous process. The only thing that binds you together with the

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:03.920
Lex Friedman from yesterday is the illusion that you have memories about him. So if you want

02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:07.920
to upload, it's very easy. You make a machine that thinks it's you. Because this is the same

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.160
thing that you are. You are a machine that thinks it's you. But that's immortality.

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.960
Yeah, but it's just a belief. You can create this belief very easily. Once you realize that

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:22.400
the question whether you are immortal or not depends entirely on your beliefs and your own

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:28.240
continuity. But then you can be immortal by the continuity of the belief.

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.600
It cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid of your mortality because you realize

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.400
you were never continuously existing in the first place.

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:42.080
Well, I don't know if I'd be more terrified or less terrified with that. It seems like the fact

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:47.520
that I existed. Also, you don't know this state in which you don't have a self. You can turn off

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:54.320
yourself, you know? I can't turn off myself. You can turn it off. I can. Yes. You can basically

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.480
meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious. There are still things are happening

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:02.800
where you know everything that you knew before, but you're no longer identified with changing

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:09.120
anything. And this means that yourself and the way it dissolves, there is no longer this person.

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.920
You know that this person construct exists in other states and it runs on the brain of

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:20.080
Lex Friedman. But it's not a real thing. It's a construct. It's an idea. And you can change

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:25.040
that idea. And if you let go of this idea, if you don't think that you are special,

02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.760
you realize it's just one of many people and it's not your favorite person even, right? It's

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:34.320
just one of many. And it's the one that you are doomed to control for the most part and

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:40.080
that is basically informing the actions of this organism as a control model. And this is all there

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:46.640
is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model gets interrupted or loses the identity

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:53.280
of continuity. Yeah, so I'm attached. I mean, yeah, it's a very popular, it's a somehow compelling

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:59.760
notion that being attached, like there's no need to be attached to this idea of an identity.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:08.080
But that in itself could be an illusion that you construct. So the process of meditation,

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.440
while popular, is thought of as getting under the concept of identity. It could be just putting

02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:23.040
a cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment. I think that meditation is eventually

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.760
just a bunch of techniques that let you control attention. And when you can control attention,

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.400
you can get access to your own source code, hopefully not before you understand what you're

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.320
doing. And then you can change the way it works temporarily or permanently.

02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:43.200
So yeah, meditation is to get a glimpse at the source code, get under, so basically control or

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.400
turn off the attention. The entire thing is that you learn to control attention. So everything

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:51.360
else is downstream from controlling attention. And control the attention that's looking at the

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:55.520
attention. Normally, we only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat,

02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:00.560
where you have a mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.840
are not self aware because their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.800
want, and the only things that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.680
mostly have models about these domains. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.720
relationships to the world around you don't work because the ideology of your country is insane

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:25.120
and the other kids are not nerds and don't understand why you understand physics and you

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:29.840
don't why you want to understand physics and you don't understand why somebody would not want to

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:37.600
understand physics. So we kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:45.040
And there's been some successes as you brought up with with go with Alpha go Alpha zero,

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:49.360
with ideas of self play, which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:58.000
each other and an automated way to improve by playing other systems of in a particular

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.080
construct of a game that are a little bit better than itself and thereby improving continuously.

02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:09.600
All the competitors in the game are improving gradually. So being just challenging enough

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:15.040
and from learning from the process of the competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:19.840
learning process to achieve greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:27.120
ideas in AI that we need to be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:31.040
AGI system? So what do you think? The forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:36.240
algorithms that can achieve that. And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms that work,

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:41.920
there will be a class of them or many of them and they might have small differences of like

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:47.200
magnitude and efficiency. But eventually what matters is the type of model that you form.

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.720
And the types of models that we form right now are not sparse enough.

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:57.600
Sparse, what does it mean to be sparse? So it means that ideally every

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:04.720
potential model state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically,

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:08.960
if you vary states in your model, you always end up with valid world states.

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:13.440
And our mind is not quite there. So an indication is basically what we see in dreams.

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:18.400
The older we get, the more boring our dreams become. Because we incorporate more and more

02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:23.040
constraints that we learned about how the world works. So many of the things that we imagine

02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.240
to be possible as children turn out to be constrained by physical and social dynamics.

02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:33.760
And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain possible. And it's not because our imagination

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.920
scales back, but the constraints under which it operates become tighter and tighter.

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:44.000
And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate are almost limitless, which

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.920
means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine things that look real.

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:55.280
So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to build dreaming systems.

02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:01.520
I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is to, similar to a generative adversarial network,

02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:07.520
learn certain constraints, and then it produces alternative perspectives on the same set of

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.600
constraints. So you can recognize it under different circumstances. Maybe we have flying

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.000
dreams as children, because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps that we know

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.600
from different perspectives, which also means from a bird's eye perspective.

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.520
So I mean, aren't we doing that anyway? I mean, not without with our eyes,

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:29.120
with our eyes closed and when we're sleeping, aren't we just constantly running dreams and

02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:32.960
simulations in our mind as we try to interpret the environment? I mean,

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:37.920
sort of considering all the different possibilities of the way we interact with the environment seems

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:46.560
like essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of simulations that are

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:52.240
consistent with our expectations, with our previous experiences, with the things we just

02:07:52.240 --> 02:08:02.400
saw recently. And through that hallucination process, we are able to then somehow stitch

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:07.760
together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well and thereby

02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:12.720
interpret it. I suspect that you and my brain are slightly unusual in this regard,

02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:19.520
which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession of constantly pondering possibilities

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:27.520
and solutions to problems. Oh, stop it. I think I'm not talking about intellectual stuff. I'm

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:33.600
talking about just doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall.

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:35.920
Yes, this is largely automatic.

02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.160
Yes, but the process is, I mean... It's not complicated. It's relatively easy to build

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:49.280
a neural network that in some sense learns the dynamics. The fact that we haven't done it right,

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.440
so far, it doesn't mean it's hard because you can see that a biological organism does it.

02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:58.160
There's relatively few neurons. So basically, you build a bunch of neural oscillators that

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:02.800
entrain themselves with the dynamics of your body in such a way that the regulator becomes

02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:07.440
isomorphic and it's modeled to the dynamics that it regulates. And then it's automatic,

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.360
and it's only interesting the sense that it captures attention when the system is off.

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:18.000
See, but thinking of the kind of mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller,

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:27.040
as a neural network, I think it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly,

02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:33.120
or at least makes implicit the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:40.480
to walk. It's an open question whether you do or not, but my intuition is to act in this world,

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:46.400
there's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it somehow. There's so much information

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:54.400
of the kind we have never been able to construct in neural networks or in artificial intelligence

02:09:54.400 --> 02:10:00.400
systems period, which is like it's humbling, at least in my imagination, the amount of

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:07.520
information required to act in this world humbles me. And I think saying that neural

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:16.160
networks can accomplish it is missing the fact that we don't have yet a mechanism for

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:20.160
constructing something like common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:31.200
about to linger on the idea of what kind of mechanism would be effective at walking?

02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:36.160
You said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have, but something a little bit better

02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:40.720
would be able to walk easily. Don't you think it also needs to know

02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:48.240
a huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.520
How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:56.000
really hardworking through all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.520
so you end up with something like a million concepts because you don't get that old.

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.120
So a million concepts, that's not a lot.

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.240
So it's not just a million concepts. I personally think it might be much more than

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.480
a million. But if you think just about the numbers, you don't live that long.

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.520
If you think about how many cycles do your neurons have in your life, it's quite limited.

02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:24.640
You don't get that old. Yeah, but the powerful thing is the number of concepts,

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.920
and they're probably deeply hierarchical in nature, the relations as you described between

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:38.080
them is the key thing. So it's like even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:46.400
formed and some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's what common sense reasoning is,

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:52.080
the relationship between things. Yeah, so in some sense, I think of the concepts as the

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.560
address space for our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize

02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:02.240
objects and interact with them, also mental objects. And a large part of that is the physical

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.640
world that we interact with, which is this res extender thing, which is basically navigation

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:13.440
of information and space. And basically, it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:20.240
that you can use to describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel,

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:24.320
when you touch them in particular way, that are proprioception, that are auditory perception,

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:28.000
and so on, how they work out. So basically the geometry of all these things. And this is

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.720
probably 80% of what our brain is doing is dealing with that with this real time simulation.

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.760
And by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:46.880
doing, right? And our game engines are already in some sense, approximating the fidelity of

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:53.120
what we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:57.200
relatively crude with respect to what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.480
already, right? It's just a couple order of magnitudes away from saturating our perception

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.840
in terms of the complexity that it can produce. So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:14.080
our computer that you can buy and put into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:20.160
has a detail that is already in the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:25.120
else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that they are relatively sparse. And also the

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:30.560
intuitive models that we form about social interaction. Social interaction is not so hard.

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:35.040
It's just hard for us nerds because we all have our wires crossed, so we need to deduce them.

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.080
But the pyres are present in most social animals. So it's an interesting thing to notice that many

02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:46.640
domestic social animals like cats and dogs have better social cognition than children.

02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:54.240
Right. I hope so. I hope it's not that many concepts fundamentally to do to exist in this

02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.240
world. Social interaction. For me, it's more like I'm afraid so because this thing that

02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.360
we only appear to be so complex to each other because we are so stupid is a little bit depressing.

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:11.120
Yeah. To me, that's inspiring if we're indeed as stupid as it seems.

02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:15.920
I think our brains don't scale and the information processing that we build tend to scale very well.

02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:23.920
Yeah. But one of the things that worries me is that the fact that the brain doesn't scale

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.080
means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain. All the flaws of the brain,

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:35.360
everything we see as limitations perhaps as a fundamental, the constraints on the system could

02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:43.920
be a requirement of its power, which is different than our current understanding of

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:48.720
intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with reinforcement

02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:56.720
learning, the hope behind open AI and deep mind, all the major results really have to do with huge

02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:02.560
compute. It could also be that our brains are so small, not just because they take up so much

02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:08.000
glucose in our body, like 20% of the glucose so they don't arbitrarily scale. There are some

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.720
animals like elephants which have larger brains than us and the dogs seem to be smarter.

02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.400
Right. Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they're

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:20.480
really good with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture. So you can make them

02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:27.200
recreate drawings stroke by stroke. They can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life. So

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:31.520
they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. They will always be only able to

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:34.880
reproduce the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments.

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:40.800
Yeah. Why is that? Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:44.240
because their brains are too large. So basically the elephants that were not autistic,

02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:48.960
they didn't reproduce. Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:54.320
interlinked with the body in our human and biological system. Do you think that AGI systems,

02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.440
that we try to create a greater intelligence systems, would need to have a body?

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.920
I think that should be able to make use of a body if you give it to them,

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.680
but I don't think that I fundamentally need a body. So I suspect if you can interact with the

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:13.360
world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make controlled experiments. And this allows you

02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:21.280
to have many magnitudes, fewer observations in order to reduce the uncertainty in your models.

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.040
So you can pinpoint the areas in your models where you're not quite sure and you just move

02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:30.080
your head and see what's going on over there and you get additional information. If you just have

02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:34.640
to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this, you probably need just

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:40.160
much more data. But we have much more data. So if you can build a system that has enough

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:44.800
time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there is to be

02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:51.360
found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do. But it seems that the interactivity

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.920
is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do. But let me ask on that topic,

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:01.760
that's what a body is, is allowing the brain to touch things and move things and interact with

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:07.520
whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with some interface

02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:15.600
to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think we can do the same kind of

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:24.080
reasoning, consciousness, intelligence if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world? Do you

02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:28.320
think there's any fundamental difference between the interface to the physical world that it's

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:32.560
here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world?

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:38.880
The question is, does this non-physical world or this other environment entice you to solve

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:43.920
problems that require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:47.840
general intelligence. And arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't

02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.320
have to solve problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:57.440
if we are smart enough to build AI and understand our own nature to this degree. So it could be a

02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:01.680
matter of capacity. And for most people, it's in the first place a matter of interest. They don't

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.720
see the point because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:11.120
not going to succeed in it and the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:16.080
entire life. Right? But it seems like the possibility is what you can do in the virtual world. So

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:22.160
imagine it is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation and be interesting

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:29.840
option for me. If somebody came to me and offered what I'll do is, so from now on, you can only

02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:36.240
exist in the virtual world. And so you put on this headset. And when you eat, we'll make sure to

02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:42.480
connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world, your body will be nourished

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:48.000
in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives between the our common sort of real

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:54.080
world in the virtual world, but then the possibility to become much bigger. Like I could be other kinds

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:59.440
of creatures I could do. I can break the laws of physics because we know them. I could do a lot.

02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:05.360
I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? As far as we think, it's an interesting thought

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:10.960
whether like what existence would be like, what kind of intelligence would emerge there,

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.000
what kind of consciousness, what kind of maybe greater intelligence, even in me,

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:21.040
Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in our world

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.560
to see how that intelligence emerges. And if I was, if that happened at the very beginning,

02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:31.680
before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:38.000
how that child would develop. And the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:44.000
it's not completely out of the realm of possibility that we're all, that some part of our lives will,

02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:51.440
if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have

02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:56.880
living on Twitter and social media and so on. Do you have, I mean, does something draw you

02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:04.000
intellectually or naturally in terms of thinking about AI to this virtual world where more possibilities

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:09.920
I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:14.800
mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it. The body gives you a second order

02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:19.680
agency. What constitutes the body is the things that you can indirectly control.

02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:25.680
Third order are tools. And the second order is the things that are basically always present,

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:32.000
but you operate on them with first order things, which are mental operators. And the zero order

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:39.760
is in some sense the direct sense of what you're deciding. So you observe yourself initiating an

02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:44.960
action that features that you interpret as the initiation of an action, then you perform the

02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:49.920
operations that you perform to make that happen. And then you see the movement of your limbs and

02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:55.200
you learn to associate those and thereby model your own agency over this feedback. But the first

02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:58.960
feedback that you get is from this first order thing already. Basically, you decide to think

02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:03.440
a thought and the thought is being thought. You decide to change the thought and you observe

02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.160
how the thought is being changed. And in some sense, this is, you could say, an embodiment

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:12.320
already. And I suspect it's sufficient as an embodiment or intelligence.

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:17.360
It's not that important, at least at this time, to consider variations in the second order.

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:24.080
Yes. But the thing that you also mentioned just now is physics that you could change in

02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:29.120
any way you want. So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If there's

02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:33.920
nothing to control, you cannot make models. There needs to be a particular way that resists you.

02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:38.880
And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists your motivation,

02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:43.040
is what gets you up in the morning, even though it would be much less work to stay in bed.

02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:51.840
It's basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it,

02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:56.720
to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance

02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:59.680
against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything.

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:03.200
Yeah. But so some of that resistance, just like you described with motivation, is like

02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:08.320
in the first order. It's in the mind. Some resistance is in the second order,

02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:12.240
like actual physical objects pushing against you and so on. It seems that the second order

02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:17.280
stuff in virtual reality could be recreated. Of course. But it might be sufficient that you

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.840
just do mathematics and mathematics is already putting up enough resistance against you.

02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:27.760
So basically just with an aesthetic motive, this could maybe sufficient to form a type of

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:32.320
intelligence. It would probably not be a very human intelligence, but it might be one that is

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:39.840
already general. So to mess with this zero order, maybe first order, what do you think about

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:44.880
ideas of brain-computer interfaces? So again, returning to our friend Elon Musk and Neural

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:50.480
Link, a company that's trying to, of course, there's a lot of trying to cure diseases and so on

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.840
with a near term, but the long-term vision is to add an extra layer to basically expand the

02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:03.920
capacity of the brain connected to the computational world. Do you think one that's

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:07.840
possible too, how does that change the fundamentals of the zero-th order and the first order?

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:11.600
It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would ever allow me to drill

02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:16.880
holes in my skull to interface my neocortex on Musk envisions. So at the moment, I can do

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:22.960
horrible things to mice, but I'm not able to do useful things to people, except maybe at some

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:28.240
point down the line in medical applications. So this thing that we are envisioning, which means

02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:34.720
recreational and recreational brain-computer interfaces, are probably not going to happen

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:40.000
in the present legal system. I love it how I'm asking you, out there philosophical

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:48.080
and sort of engineering questions, and for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA.

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:51.760
There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to

02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:57.920
try a new type of brain-computer interface. But also, if it works, FDA will approve it. I mean,

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:03.840
it's like I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes, you can say that it's going to be very

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:08.080
difficult regulatory process of approving with autonomous, but it doesn't mean autonomous vehicles

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:13.200
are never going to happen. No, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least

02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:20.960
two lawyers and one regulator per car. Yes, lawyers, that's actually like lawyers,

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:27.600
this is the fundamental substrate of reality. In the US, it's a very weird system. It's not

02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.240
universal in the world. The law is a very interesting software once you realize it, right?

02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:37.440
These circuits are, in some sense, streams of software, and it largely works by exception

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:41.520
handling. So you make decisions on the ground, and they get synchronized with the next level

02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:48.160
structure as soon as an exception is being thrown. So it escalates the exception handling. The process

02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:55.040
is very expensive, especially since it incentivizes the lawyers for producing work for lawyers.

02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:03.680
Yes, so the exceptions are actually incentivized for firing often. But to return, outside of lawyers,

02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:10.640
is there anything fundamentally, is there anything interesting, insightful about the

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.360
possibility of this extra layer of intelligence added to the brain?

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.120
I do think so, but I don't think that you need technically invasive procedures to do so. We

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:25.200
can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:31.680
in some kind of empathetic resonance. I know it's not very good at this, but I noticed that people

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:37.920
are able to do this to some degree. It basically means that we model an interface layer of the

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:43.440
other person in real time. And it works despite our neurons being slow, because most of the things

02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:48.240
that we do are built on periodic processes. So you just need to entrain yourself with the

02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:53.120
oscillation that happens. And if the oscillation itself changes slowly enough, you can basically

02:25:53.120 --> 02:26:03.440
follow along. But the bandwidth of the interaction, it seems like you can do a lot more computation

02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.960
of course. But the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is running on is

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:14.240
actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively think in any given day

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:20.000
is quite limited. But if they had the discipline to write it down and the speed to write it down,

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.040
maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think about the computers that we can build,

02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:29.520
the magnitudes at which they operate, this would be nothing. It's something that it can

02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:35.280
put out in a second. Well, I don't know. So it's possible, sort of the number of thoughts you

02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:41.120
have in your brain, it could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able

02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:46.880
to express through your fingers or through your voice. Most of them are going to be repetitive,

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:53.680
because they have to control the same problems every day. When I walk, they are going to be

02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:58.240
processes in my brain that model my walking pattern and regulate them and so on. But it's

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.800
going to be pretty much the same every day or every step. But I'm talking about intellectual

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:06.960
reasoning, thinking. So the question, what is the best system of government? So you sit down and

02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:14.000
start thinking about that. One of the constraints is that you don't have access to a lot of facts,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:22.240
a lot of studies. You always have to interface with something else to learn more, to aid in your

02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:26.960
reasoning process. If you can directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the

02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:32.720
best form of government, then every thought won't be stuck in a loop. Every thought that requires

02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:37.760
some extra piece of information will be able to grab it really quickly. That's the possibility of

02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:47.680
if the bottleneck is literally the information that the bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just

02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:51.920
being able to quickly access huge amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting

02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:59.040
your brain to the computer could lead to totally new breakthroughs. You can think of

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:08.320
mathematicians being able to just up the orders and magnitude of power in their reasoning about

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:13.200
mathematical rules. What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of government through

02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:19.440
a revolutionary process? There is an evolution going on. So what we discover is that maybe

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.760
the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species, because we are

02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:29.520
not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them. But there could be

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:34.240
solutions that work under given circumstances or that they're the best for certain environment and

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:39.840
depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means of production. So if the

02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:47.360
main means of production is land, then the forms of government will be regulated by the land owners

02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:53.680
and you get a monarchy. If you also want to have a form of government in which you depend on some

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.720
form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have to work very long hours for very little gain,

02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:04.720
so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe you need to promise them that you get paid in the

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:12.400
afterlife over time. So you need a theocracy. And so for much of human history in the West,

02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:17.840
we had a combination of monarchy and theocracy that was our form of governance, right? At the same

02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:25.200
time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently reread Thomas O'Kynos,

02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:29.760
it's very interesting to see this because he was not a dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:37.360
particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically

02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:41.920
people are animals and very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically

02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:46.800
organisms with cybernetic control. And then he says that there are initial rational principles

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:51.600
that humans can discover and everybody can discover them. So they are universal. If you are sane,

02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:55.840
you should understand, you should submit to them because you can rationally deduce them.

02:29:55.840 --> 02:30:02.480
And these principles are roughly, you should be willing to self-regulate correctly.

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:11.040
You should be willing to do correct social regulation, it's intraorganism. You should be

02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:13.440
willing to act on your models. So you have skin in the game.

02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:21.920
And you should have goal rationality. You should be choosing the right goals to work on.

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:27.440
So basically these three rational principles, goal rationality, he calls prudence or wisdom.

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:33.440
Social regulation is justice. The correct social one and the internal regulation is

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:40.320
temperance. And this, I think, willingness to act on your models is courage. And then he says

02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:45.040
that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these

02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:49.360
three divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced, but they reveal themselves by the harmony,

02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:53.840
which means if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen, you will see that they

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:59.520
make sense. And it's often been misunderstood as God has to tell you that these are the things.

02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:05.440
So basically there's something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe

02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:11.840
some guy with a long beard, that they discovered this. So these principles are relatively simple.

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:16.480
Again, it's for high level organization, for the resulting civilization that you form,

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:22.960
commitment to unity. So basically you serve this higher larger thing, this structural

02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:29.040
principle on the next level, and he calls that faith. Then there needs to be commitment to

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:32.560
shared purpose. This is basically this global reward that you try to figure out what that

02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:36.880
should be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love. The commitment to shared purpose

02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:40.960
is the core of love. You see this sacred thing that is more important than your own

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:45.280
organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together. And this is how you see

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:50.960
the sacred in the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that

02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:55.600
principle without getting rewards in the here and now, because it doesn't exist yet.

02:31:55.600 --> 02:32:00.000
Then you start out building the civilization. So you need to be able to do this in the absence

02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:04.880
of its actual existence yet. So it can come into being.

02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:08.960
So yeah, so the way it comes into being is by you accepting those notions and then you see

02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:13.680
in there these three divine concepts and you see them realized.

02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:18.000
Another problem is divine is a loaded concept in our world, right? Because we are outside of

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.640
this cult and we are still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically we need to

02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:27.840
have a civilization that acts as an intentional agent, like an insect state. And we are not

02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:33.760
actually a tribal species. We are a state building species. And what enabled state building is

02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:38.960
basically the formation of religious states and other forms of rule based administration,

02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:42.640
in which the individual doesn't matter as much as the rule or the higher goal.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:47.200
We got there by the question, what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think that

02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:51.760
Catholicism is the optimal form of governance because it's obviously on the way out, right?

02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:58.320
So it is for the present type of society that we are in. Religious institutions don't seem to be

02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:04.320
optimal to organize that. So what we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy.

02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:08.480
And democracy is the role of oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:14.240
that is administered not by the oligarchs themselves because there's too much disruption,

02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:19.200
right? We have so much innovation that we have in every generation new means of production that

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:24.240
we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so. And something other

02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:29.680
takes the leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions. And these

02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:35.680
institutions themselves are not elected, but they provide continuity. And they are led by

02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:40.640
electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to

02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:44.960
kill people, right? So you can, for instance, if a change in governments, if people think that the

02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:50.160
current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a

02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:55.920
journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution has no plan B

02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:01.760
like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is what when you run society by the deep state.

02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:08.640
So ideally you have an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens, right?

02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:13.600
So you will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in the West.

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.000
And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. So it's mostly just

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.880
second, third order consequences that people are modeling in the design of these institutions.

02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:27.520
It's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of many of

02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:33.680
the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help us this in a way if you can fix

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:39.520
the incentives. The society of the US is the society of teeters. It's basically cheating

02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.120
is so indistinguishable from innovation and we want to encourage innovation.

02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:45.040
Can you elaborate on what you mean by cheating?

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:49.200
It's basically people do things that they know are wrong. It's acceptable to do things that

02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:52.720
you know are wrong in the society to a certain degree. You can, for instance,

02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:56.400
suggest some non-sustainable business models and implement them.

02:34:57.440 --> 02:34:59.600
Right, but you're always pushing the boundaries. I mean, you're-

02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:02.720
And yes, this is seen as a good thing largely.

02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:04.240
Yes.

02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:09.200
And this is different from other societies. So for instance, social mobility is an aspect of

02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:13.280
this. Social mobility is the result of individual innovation that would not be

02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:17.280
sustainable at scale for everybody else. Normally, you should not go up. You should

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:21.440
go deep. We need bakers and indeed we are very good bakers, but in a society that

02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:24.400
innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really good machine.

02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:29.600
That's not a bad thing and it's a thing that made the US so successful,

02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.680
but it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability but for innovation.

02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:39.360
And so it's not obvious as the evolutionary process is unrolling. It's not obvious that

02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:41.200
that long-term would be better.

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:47.600
It has side effects. So basically, if you treat, you will have a certain layer of toxic sludge

02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:50.400
that covers everything that is a result of cheating.

02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:55.600
And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging

02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:01.840
that the system is horrible or if the benefits actually outweigh the negative effects.

02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:05.840
How do we get to the which system of government is best?

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.800
I'm trying to trace back the last five minutes.

02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:16.560
I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has

02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:24.800
to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons and our mind is a society of

02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:30.800
behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements

02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:36.560
regulation. And government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of

02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:41.040
power or local interest, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human

02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:47.040
survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory

02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:52.640
that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.480
the next state without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a

02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:01.280
bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire

02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:06.960
infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions,

02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:10.720
and there are not that many natural transitions available at any given point.

02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:12.160
What do you mean by natural transitions?

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.560
So we try not to have revolutions if we can help.

02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:21.200
So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems in the mind,

02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:29.120
you've also said that in some sense becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions.

02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:35.200
Maybe you never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind,

02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:42.320
what's the role of emotion? And what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role?

02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:46.960
It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling,

02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:52.880
and in common day parlance we don't. I think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive

02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:57.840
system. That's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have

02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:02.560
an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence,

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.080
your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, inter-reception or extra-reception,

02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:13.120
and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way to relate to the

02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:17.280
environment and to yourself. And this is in some sense an emotional configuration.

02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:23.200
In the more narrow sense, an emotion is an affective state that has an object. And the relevance

02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.400
of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated

02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:32.560
with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs,

02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.720
you act on models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifests, it's too late,

02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:41.120
you've done everything. But so you act on expectations, what will give you pleasure and

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.320
pain? And these are your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy, they just coexist and compete.

02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:50.480
And your organism has to, or your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them.

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:55.840
But the purposes need to be consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and

02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:01.440
make plans. And so we organize them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution

02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:06.240
for this. Some people eat to make art and other people make art to eat. And they might end up

02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:10.560
doing the same things, but they cooperate in very different ways. Because they are ultimate goals.

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:15.440
Are different. And we cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything else that is not

02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:22.080
cooperation on shared purpose is transactional. I don't think I understood the last piece of

02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:29.360
achieving the homeostasis. Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:36.720
expression of emotion? Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense,

02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:42.000
what you feel is an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:49.200
makes this based on your motivation and on your estimates, not your, but of the subconscious

02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:54.240
geometric parts of your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a

02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:59.520
neural network. And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind,

02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:06.400
to your conscious attention via mapping them as features into a space. So what you will feel

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:11.360
about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your

02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:17.360
solar plexus. And you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry, right? Your body map is

02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:22.880
the space that is always instantiated and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat if your

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:29.440
non symbolic parts of your brain try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map

02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:33.600
the feelings into the body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant and unpleasant,

02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:38.000
depending on whether the appraisal has a negative or positive valence. And then you have

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.800
different features of them that give you more knowledge about the nature of what you're feeling.

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:46.400
So for instance, when you feel connected to other people, you typically feel this in your

02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:51.120
chest region around your heart. And you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're

02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:56.720
reaching out, right? And it's very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's encoded

02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:00.400
like this for most people. It's encoded. It's a code. It's a code in which the non symbolic

02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:04.960
parts of your mind talk to the symbolic ones. And then the expression of emotion is then the

02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:10.320
final step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. That's part of the communication.

02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:15.360
This probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:20.400
observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they are in,

02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:25.200
others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state.

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.360
So we now look at the inflections, at the difference between the standard phase that

02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:33.120
they're going to make in this situation, right? When you are at a funeral, everybody expects

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.200
you to make a solemn face. But the solemn face doesn't express whether you're sad or not. It

02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:42.080
just expresses that you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:47.280
you are triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the

02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:55.520
delta between a truly sad expression and the things that are animated, mating this face behind

02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:01.120
the curtain. So the interesting thing is, so having done these, having done this podcast

02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:08.320
and the video component, one of the things I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I just don't

02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:15.040
know how to express emotion on my face when I see that as weakness. But whatever the people look to

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:22.240
me after you say something, they look to my face to help them see how they should feel about what

02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:27.840
we said, which is fascinating because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did

02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.880
you particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting, it makes

02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:39.200
me cognizant of I'm part, like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I'm part

02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:46.400
of the play that you're the key actor and by making my facial expressions and therefore

02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:52.640
telling the narrative of what the big point is, which is fascinating, makes me cognizant that

02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.440
I'm supposed to be making facial expressions. Even this conversation is hard because my preference

02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:03.840
will be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen. Yes, I understand this because

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:09.360
it's intrusive to interact with others this way and basically Eastern European society have a

02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:15.360
taboo against that and especially Russia, the further you go to the east and in the US it's

02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.040
the opposite, you're expected to be hyperanimated in your face and you're also expected to show

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:28.160
positive effect. And if you show positive effect without a good reason in Russia, people will

02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:36.800
think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person. Exactly and here positive effect without reason

02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:42.880
goes either appreciate or go unnoticed. No, it's the default, it's being expected,

02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:50.240
everything is amazing. Have you seen this Lego movie? No, there was a diagram where somebody

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:57.120
gave the appraisals that exist in US and Russia, so you have your bell curve and the lower 10%

02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:08.640
in US are, it's a good start. Everything above the lowest 10% is amazing. And for Russians,

02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:16.240
everything below the top 10% is terrible. And then everything except the top percent is,

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:19.840
I don't like it and the top percent is even so.

02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:30.400
Yeah, it's funny, but it's kind of true. There's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how we construct

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:36.960
meaning in the US. Usually you focus on the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative

02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:45.040
aspects. And in our Eastern European traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something

02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:49.040
above the water line, you also need to put something below the water line because existence

02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:55.360
by itself is as best neutral. Right, that's the basic intuition, at best neutral, or it could

02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:59.520
be just suffering, the default. There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty

02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:05.280
are inextricably linked to the reality of suffering. And to not acknowledge the reality

02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:09.200
of suffering means that you are really stupid and unaware of the fact that basically every

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:17.120
conscious being spends most of the time suffering. Yeah, you just summarized the ethos of the Eastern

02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:22.400
Europe. Yeah, most of life is suffering with occasional moments of beauty. And if your

02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:28.720
facial expressions don't acknowledge the abundance of suffering in the world and in existence itself,

02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:34.960
then you must be an idiot. It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the US and you

02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:40.240
in some sense preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:46.320
are embedded in your own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid and

02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:52.720
asks you, why is Ariel not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. She's a

02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:57.520
siren. Sirens eat people. You don't play with your foot. It does not end well. And then you tell her

02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:01.760
the original story, which is not the one by Anderson, which is the romantic one. And there's

02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:10.640
a much darker one, the Ondine story. What happened? So Ondine is a mermaid or a water woman. She lives

02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:15.440
on the ground of a river and she meets this prince and they fall enough. And the prince really,

02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:20.800
really wants to be with her. And she says, okay, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman.

02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:24.240
If you marry somebody else, even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:29.760
underwater and have other things to do than managing your kingdom with you up here, you will die.

02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:35.040
And eventually, after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her and

02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.520
she shows up and quietly goes into his chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do

02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:46.480
so because she is fierce. And she comes quietly and sat out of his chamber and they ask her,

02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:50.320
what has happened? What did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:58.640
Well done. And you know the Anderson story, right? In the Anderson story, the mermaid is playing

02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:03.680
with this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and she cannot live out there. So

02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:10.560
she is giving up her voice and her tale for a human-like appearance so she can walk among the

02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.760
humans. But this guy does not recognize that she is the one that she would marry. Instead,

02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.720
he marries somebody who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his

02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:33.280
own kingdom and so on as he should. She dies. Yeah. Instead, Disney, the little mermaid story

02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.040
has a little bit of a happy ending. That's the western, that's the American way.

02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:42.000
My own problem is this, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other things. So I'm

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.960
indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You

02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:51.840
sacrifice your life for romantic love. That's what you do because if you are confronted with either

02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:57.840
serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing under the economic and social and other

02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:06.080
human incentives, that's wrong. You should follow your heart. So do you think suffering is fundamental

02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:12.240
to happiness along these lines? No. Suffering is the result of caring about things that you cannot

02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:17.120
change. And if you are able to change what you care about to those things that you can change,

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:23.840
you will not suffer. Would you then be able to experience happiness? Yes. But happiness itself

02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:28.800
is not important. Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child, you think cookies are very

02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:32.320
important and you want to have all the cookies in the world. You look forward to being an adult

02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:36.720
because then you have as many cookies as you want, right? Yes. But as an adult, you realize a

02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:41.280
cookie is a tool. It's a tool to make you eat vegetables. And once you eat your vegetables

02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:45.120
anyway, you stop eating cookies for the most part because otherwise you will get diabetes

02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:49.360
and will not be around for your kids. Yes. But then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie.

02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:55.680
If scarcity is enforced, nevertheless, the pleasure comes from the scarcity. Yes. But

02:48:55.680 --> 02:49:00.400
the happiness is a cookie that your brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the environment.

02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.400
The environment cannot make you happy. It's your appraisal of the environment that makes you happy.

02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:08.480
And if you can change the appraisal of the environment that you can learn to, then you

02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:12.720
can create arbitrary states of happiness. And some meditators fall into this trap. So they

02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:16.560
discover the room, this basement room in their brain where the cookies are made,

02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.040
and they indulge in stuff themselves. And after a few months, it gets really old and the big crisis

02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.640
of meaning comes. Because they thought before that their unhappiness was the result of not

02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:30.560
being happy enough. So they fixed this, right? They can release the newer transmitters at will

02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:37.040
if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is,

02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:40.960
why do I live? How can I make a sustainable civilization that is meaningful to me?

02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:44.560
How can I insert myself into this? And this was the problem that you couldn't solve in the first

02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:53.840
place. But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same question. What is the answer to that?

02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:59.920
What could the possible answer be of the meaning of life? What could an answer be? What is it to you?

02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:04.480
I think that if you look at the meaning of life, you look at what the cell is.

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:10.320
The life is the cell. Yes, or this principle, the cell. It's this

02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:15.280
self-organizing thing that can participate in evolution. In order to make it work,

02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:20.400
it's a molecular machine. It needs a self-replicator and like entropy extractor and a Turing machine.

02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.720
If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell and it is not living, right? And life is

02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:29.520
basically the emergent complexity over that principle. Once you have this intelligent super

02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:34.080
molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot make it do. It's probably the optimal

02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:39.600
computronium, especially in terms of resilience. It's very hard to sterilize a planet once it's

02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:47.680
infected with life. So it's active function of these three components of the supercell of cell

02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:53.280
is present in the cell, is present in us, and it's just... We are just an expression of the cell.

02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:58.320
It's a certain layer of complexity in the organization of cells. So in a way, it's

02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:03.200
tempting to think of the cell as a von Neumann probe. If you want to build intelligence on

02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:08.640
other planets, the best way to do this is to infect them with cells and wait for long enough.

02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:12.800
And with a reasonable chance, the stuff is going to evolve into an information processing

02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:19.520
principle that is general enough to become sentient. Well, that idea is very akin to the same

02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:23.040
dream and beautiful ideas that are expressed to cellular automata in their most simple

02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:29.760
mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some basic mechanisms of replication and

02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:35.440
basic rules, amazing things would emerge. And the cell is able to do something that James

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:41.120
Trady calls existential design. He points out that in technical design, we go from the outside in.

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:45.200
We work in a highly controlled environment in which everything is deterministic, like our

02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:51.520
computers, our labs, or our engineering workshops. And then we use this determinism to implement a

02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:56.240
particular kind of function that we dream up and that seamlessly interfaces with all the other

02:51:56.240 --> 02:52:00.880
deterministic functions that we already have in our world. So it's basically from the outside in.

02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:08.160
And biological systems designed from the inside out as seed will become a seedling by taking some

02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:14.320
of the relatively unorganized matter around it and turn it into its own structure and thereby

02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:19.200
subdue the environment. And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells having a similar

02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:25.520
organization that is already compatible. But unless that's there, the cell needs to divide to

02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:30.400
create that structure by itself. So it's a self-organizing principle that works on a

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:36.640
somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in the sense is to produce complexity.

02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:40.480
And the complexity allows you to harvest like entropy gradients that you couldn't harvest

02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:45.520
without the complexity. And in this sense, intelligence and life are very strongly connected

02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:50.480
because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control and the conditions of complexity. So

02:52:50.480 --> 02:52:56.720
basically you shift the boundary between the ordered systems into the realm of chaos. You

02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:02.080
build bridgeheads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we are doing. This is not

02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:05.840
necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors for that we are

02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:09.920
involved for outside of the priors, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists if a mind projects

02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:17.280
it. That is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is to try to

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:23.200
build and maintain a sustainable civilization. And taking a slight step out outside of that,

02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:34.720
we talked about a man with a beard and God. But something, some mechanism perhaps must have

02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:42.480
planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God?

02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:45.760
And what would that look like? So if there was no spontaneous

02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:52.720
abiogenesis, in the sense that the first cell formed by some happy random accidents where

02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:55.840
the molecules just happen to be in the right constellation to each other. But there could

02:53:55.840 --> 02:54:02.000
also be the mechanism of, that allows for the random, I mean, there's like turtles all the way

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:06.640
down. There seems to be, there has to be a head turtle at the bottom. Let's consider something

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:11.600
really wild. Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant could become intelligent?

02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:17.360
What would that involve? So imagine that you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on the gas

02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:22.560
giants like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these storm

02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:27.040
systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something.

02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:32.400
And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds and thereby

02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:36.640
produce some self-sabilizing patterns that eventually to regulation feedback loops,

02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:42.320
nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such a thing that basically has emergent,

02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.720
self-sustaining, self-organizing complexity. And at some point, this fakes up and realizes

02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:51.360
and basically lambs Solaris. I am a sinking planet, but I will not replicate because I

02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:57.120
can recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence

02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:03.040
that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds a von Neumann probe. And the

02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:07.040
best von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell. So maybe it, because it's very,

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:12.000
very clever and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out. And one of them has infected our

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.840
planet. And I'm not suggesting that this is the case, but it would be compatible with the

02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:21.440
Prince Birmingham hypothesis. And with my intuition that our biogenesis is very unlikely.

02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:25.600
It's possible, but you probably need to roll the cosmic dice very often,

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:28.240
maybe more often than there are planetary surfaces. I don't know.

02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:37.360
So God is just a large enough, a system that's large enough that allows randomness.

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:41.440
Now, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation. I think it's a mistranslation

02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.800
of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is actually the childhood

02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:52.960
memories of a God. So the, when, sorry, the Genesis is the childhood memories of a God.

02:55:52.960 --> 02:56:00.240
It's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being. And we typically interpret

02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:06.800
Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being. And I think when you'll

02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:13.280
read it, there is light and darkness that is being created. And then you discover sky and

02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:20.080
ground, create them. You construct the plants and the animals, and you give everything their

02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:24.960
names and so on. That's basically cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that

02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.880
every mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have children, you

02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:34.400
can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness, and then they make out directions in it,

02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:37.760
and they discover sky and ground, and they discover the plants and the animals, and they

02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.080
give everything their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind, because it's

02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:46.480
not given, right? Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns on your

02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:53.040
retina. Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it, this would

02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:57.840
not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not have the magical

02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:04.160
power to give meaning to our existence, right? So this equation of a creator God with the God of

02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:10.320
meaning is laid off hand. You shouldn't do it. The other one that is done in Catholicism is the

02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:15.520
equation of the first mover, the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton that

02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:21.200
runs the universe. Aristotle says, if things are moving and things seem to be moving here,

02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:25.440
something must move them, right? If something moves them, something must move the thing that

02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:30.320
is moving it. So there must be a prime mover. This idea to say that this prime mover is a

02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:36.800
supernatural being is complete nonsense, right? It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we

02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:42.640
have to explain the enormity that this automaton exists at all. But again, we don't have any

02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:48.480
possibility to infer anything about its properties except that it's able to produce change in

02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:53.680
information, right? So there needs to be some kind of computational principle. This is all there is.

02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:58.160
But to say this automaton is identical again with the creator of first cause or with the

02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:05.520
thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion. Now, I think that what we perceive is the higher

02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:10.800
being that we are part of. And the higher being that we are part of is the civilization. It's the

02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:16.800
thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell has to our body. And we have this prior

02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:22.800
because we have evolved to organize in these structures. So basically, the Christian God

02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:27.520
in its natural form without the mythology, if you undress it, is basically the platonic form of

02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:35.280
the civilization. Is the ideal? Yes, it's this ideal that you try to approximate when you interact

02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:42.640
with others, not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right. Wow, we covered a lot

02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:48.640
of ground. And we left with one of my favorite lines. And there's many, which is happiness

02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:58.240
is a cookie that the brain bakes itself. It's been a huge honor and a pleasure to talk to you.

02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:03.920
I'm sure our paths will cross many times again. Josh, thank you so much for talking today.

02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:08.240
Thank you, Lex. It was so much fun. I enjoyed it. Awesome.

02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:38.560
Supporting on Patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.

02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:42.640
And yes, try to figure out how to spell it without the E.

02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:47.120
And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Yoshabach.

02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:53.760
If you take this as a computer game metaphor, this is the best level for humanity to play.

02:59:54.560 --> 03:00:00.960
And this best level happens to be the last level as it happens against the backdrop

03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:04.640
of a dying world. But it's still the best level.

03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:16.880
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
