0	5680	The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, his fourth time on the podcast,
5680	12160	both sadness and hope run through his heart and his mind, and the result is a complicated,
12160	15760	brilliant human being who I am fortunate to call a friend.

35600	42080	topics in this or other conversations that you listen with an open mind and forgive me or the
42080	48240	guest for a misstep in an imperfectly thought out statement. To have any chance at truth,
48240	54160	I think we have to take risks and make mistakes in conversation and then learn from those mistakes.
54720	59200	Please try not to close your mind and heart to others because of a single sentence or an
59200	64160	expression of an idea. Try to assume that the people in this conversation are just people in
64160	70800	general are good, but not perfect and far from it, but always striving to add a bit more love
70800	76960	into the world in whatever way we know how. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

82880	90640	at Lex Freedman. And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein. You often talk about
90640	99600	getting off this planet and I think you don't often talk about extra terrestrial life, intelligent
99600	104960	life out there. Do you wonder about this kind of thing, about intelligent civilizations out there?
104960	111840	I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way. In a certain sense, I do find
111840	117040	that speculating about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and Space Aliens is kind of a recreation
117040	122800	for when things aren't going very well. At least it gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives.
123520	129520	So I worry about, for example, the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion. You
129520	134640	can't quite believe enough to go to church or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend. So then
134640	138880	you just take up an interest in the simulation theory because that's something like what you
138880	144880	do for your job coding. I do think that in some sense, the issue of aliens is a really
145440	151280	interesting one, but has been spoiled by too much sort of recreational escapism.
152320	160080	The key question that I find is, let's assume that it is possible to look out at the night sky
160080	165040	and see all of these distant worlds and then go visit them. If that is possible, it's almost
165040	174320	certainly possible through some as yet unknown or not accepted theory of physics beyond Einstein.
176640	183200	It doesn't have to be that way, but probably is. If that theory exists, there would be a
183200	188240	percentage of the worlds that have life in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way that would have
188320	197360	encountered the ability to escape soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom at a
197360	205840	minimum and whatever they have that is probably analogous to the cell on that world. So assuming
205840	212960	that life is a fairly generic thing that arises, probably not carbon-based, probably doesn't have
212960	222160	DNA, but that something that fits the pattern of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation,
223760	229200	differential success. And thereby constantly improving and so on that through time, there'll
229200	234400	be a trajectory where there'll be something increasingly complex and fascinating and beautiful
234400	240080	like us humans, but much more. That can also off-gas whatever entropy it creates to give an
240080	245280	illusion that you're defeating thermodynamics. So whatever these things are, probably has an
245280	251280	analog of the bilipid layer so that cells can get rid of the chaos on one side of the barrier and
251280	256480	keep order on the other. Whatever these things are that create life, assuming that there is a
256480	264080	theory to be found that allows that civilization to diversify, we would have to imagine that
264880	270960	such a civilization might have taken an interest in its concept of the universe and have come here.
272400	277600	They would come here. They would have a deep understanding of the physics of the universe
277600	283120	sufficient to have arrived here. Well, there's two questions, whether they could arrive physically
283120	290400	and whether their information could be sent here and whether they could gain information from us.
290400	297360	It's possible that they would have a way of looking into our world without actually reaching it. I
297360	306560	don't know. But yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world, can be realized if that's
306560	313760	feasible, then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true and that somebody else should be
313760	320800	here. First of all, I want to say this. My purpose when I come on to your show and I reframe the
320800	327280	questions is not to challenge you. I can sit inside all of those. It's to give you better audio and
327280	332880	video because I think we've been on an incredible role. I really love what you do. I am trying to
332880	337520	honor you by being as disagreeable about frame breaking as possible. I think some of your listeners
337520	342720	don't understand that it's actually a sign of respect as opposed to some sort of a complex
342720	347680	dynamic, which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames and that these are sort of
347680	351840	offerings to get the conversation started. So let me try to break that frame and give you something
351840	360880	different. Beautiful. I think what's going on here is that I can prove effectively that we're
360880	365760	not thinking about this in very deep terms. As soon as I say we've got to get off this planet,
365760	369680	the number of people who assume that I'm talking about faster than light travel
371200	378400	is very high. Faster than light travel assumes some sort of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken
380400	386880	by some small adjustment. I think that that's fascinating. It shows me that our failure to
386880	394400	imagine what could be being said is profound. We don't have an idea of all of the different
395040	401840	different ways in which we might be able to visit distant worlds. All we think about is,
401840	407200	okay, it must be, it must be Einsteinian space times and then some means of exceeding the
407200	414960	speed limit. And it's just, it's fascinating to me that we don't really have, we've lost
414960	421520	the ability to just realize we don't know the framework. And what does it even mean? So one
421600	425440	of the things I think about a lot is worlds with more than one temporal dimension.
426720	429920	It's very hard to think about more than one temporal dimension.
430800	437200	So that's a really strong mental exercise of breaking the framework in which we think,
437200	440880	because most of the frameworks would have a single temporal dimension, right?
440880	444880	Well, first of all, most of the frameworks in which we think would have no temporal dimension,
444880	450240	would have pure, like in mathematics, the differential geometry that Riemann came up with
450240	457120	in the 1800s. We don't usually talk about what we would call split signature metrics,
458000	463440	or Lorentzian signature. In fact, if it weren't for relativity, this would be the most obscure
463440	468880	topic out there. Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature, and then there's this
468880	474880	one freakish case of relativity theory in physics that uses this one time and the rest spatial
474880	480640	dimensions. Fascinating. So it's usually momentary and just looking at space?
481360	487200	Yes. We have these three kinds of equations that are very important to us. We have
487200	496560	elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic. And so the idea is if I'm chewing gum after eating garlic bread,
499120	503200	when I open my mouth and I've got chewing gum between my lips,
503920	510400	maybe it's going to form an elliptic object called a minimal surface. Then when I pop that and
510400	514400	blow through it, you're going to hear a noise that's going to travel to you by a wave equation,
514400	518880	which is going to be hyperbolic. But then the garlic breath is going to diffuse towards you,
518880	522480	and you're eventually going to be very upset with me, according to a heat equation,
522480	528160	which will be parabolic. So those are the three basic paradigms for most of the work that we do.
528160	533600	And a lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic, whereas the physicists are in the
533600	537440	hyperbolic case. And I don't even know what to do about more than one temporal dimension,
537440	541600	because I think almost no one studies that. I can't believe you just captured
542240	545600	much of modern physics in the example of chewing gum.
545600	549360	Well, I have an off-color one, which I chose not to share, but hopefully the kids at home...
550160	550800	Can imagine.
551680	559040	Okay, so that is the place where we come from. Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility of
559040	566560	breaking the frameworks with two versus zero temporal dimensions, how do we even begin to
566560	570400	think about that? Well, let's think about it as you and I getting together in New York City.
571840	577440	So if you tell me, Eric, I want to meet you in New York City, go to the corner
578160	585200	of, I don't know, 34th Street and 3rd Avenue, and you'll find a building on the northwest corner
585200	591440	and go up to the 17th floor, right? So when we have 3rd Avenue, that's one coordinate,
591440	596240	34th Street, that's the second coordinate, and go up to the 17th. And what time is that? Oh,
596240	603120	12 noon. All right. Well, now imagine that we traded the ability to get up to a particular
603200	607440	height in a building that's all flatland, but I'm going to give you two temporal coordinates. So
607440	615040	meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon at the corner of 34th and 3rd. That gets to be too mind-blowing.
615040	620880	I've got two separate watches. And presumably that's just specifying a single point in those
620880	626080	two different dimensions, but then being able to travel along those dimensions. Let me see your
626080	634000	right hand. You have no watch on that. I'm very concerned, Lex, that you're going through life
634000	640800	without a wristwatch. That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch. I want you to wear it.
640800	647680	This guy's funnier than basically any human on earth. That has been in my family for months.
649360	655760	It's a Fitbit. Now, what I want you to understand is Lex Fridman is now in a position to live
656160	662160	in two spatial and two temporal dimensions unlike the rest of us. I clearly am only fit for four
663280	667840	spatial dimensions. So I'm frozen, whereas you can double move.
667840	675120	I can double move, which is funny because this is set in Austin time. So it's 4 p.m. and this is set
675120	681200	in Los Angeles time. Well, but that's just with an affine shift in mod 12. But my point is,
681200	684480	wouldn't that be interesting if there were two separate time scales and you had to coordinate
684480	688240	both of those, but you didn't have to worry about what floor of the building because everything
688240	695200	was on the ground floor. That is the confusion that we're having. And if you do one more show,
696400	700080	then they're going to put a watch on your ankle and you're only going to have one spatial dimension
700080	706480	that you can move around. But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors of my theory,
706480	712960	in case we're interested in that, which is geometric unity. There is a 2-2 sector and a 3-1
712960	718960	and a 1-3 and a 0-4 and a 4-0. And all of these sectors have some physical reality. We happen
718960	725680	to live in a 1-3 sector. But that's the kind of thinking that we don't do. When I say we have
725680	729840	to get off this planet, people imagine, oh, okay, it's just Einstein plus some ability to break the
729840	736960	law. By the way, even though you did this for humor's sake, I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin.
737280	745280	Am I going to get whacked? No, not quite. But he was given a Super Bowl ring
746560	751760	to look at. And he, instead of just looking at it, put it on his finger and walked away with it.
752400	758080	Robert Kraft? Robert Kraft, that's right. In the same way, I will, if you don't mind,
758080	762320	walk away with this Fitbit and taking the entirety of your life story with it because
762400	765120	there's all these steps on it. Boy, have you lost a lot of weight.
767920	769680	And where have I been? Exactly.
770640	773680	Right. That's what we're talking about. We're talking about, you want to get into aliens.
773680	778800	Let's have an interesting alien conversation. Let's stop having the typical free will conversation,
778800	784080	the typical alien conversation, the typical AGI morality conversation. It's like, we have to
784080	788400	recognize that we're amusing ourselves because we're not making progress. Time to have better
788400	793280	versions of all these conversations. Is there some version of the alien conversation that could
793280	797840	incorporate the breaking of frameworks? Well, I think so. I mean, the key question would be,
798560	804960	we've had the Pentagon release multiple videos of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us.
804960	810080	I just think it's also really fascinating to talk about the fact that those of us who were
810080	815280	trained to call BS on all of this stuff just had the rug pulled out from under us by the
815280	819840	Pentagon choosing to do this. And you know what the effect of that is? You've opened the door
819840	828880	for every stupid theory known to man. My aunt saw a ghost. Okay. Now we're going to have to listen to,
828880	832560	well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it. Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude.
834000	840880	Whoever is in charge of lying to the public, they need a cost function that incorporates
841280	846080	the damage and trust because I held this line that this was all garbage and all BS.
847200	851360	Now I don't know what to think. There's a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion,
851360	855760	the breaking of frameworks that involves the release of videos from the Pentagon,
855760	861040	which is almost like another dimension that trust in itself or the nature of truth and
861040	866880	information is a kind of dimension along which we're traveling constantly that is
867520	875440	messing with my head to think about because it almost feels like you need to incorporate
875440	883040	that into your study of the nature of reality is like the constant shifting of the notation,
883040	888000	the tools we use to communicate that reality. And so what am I supposed to think about these
888000	894480	videos? Is it a complete distraction? Is it a kind of cosmic joke? I don't know, but you know what,
894480	899360	I'm tired of these people just completely tired of these people on the Pentagon side or the people
899360	905760	who are interpreting this stuff on the Pentagon side. I'm tired of the authorities playing games
905760	910560	with what we can know. The fact that you and I don't, do you have a security clearance?
911680	915040	Some level of it for because I was funded for DARPA for a while.
915040	921280	I don't have a security clearance. You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have
921680	924960	my guess is that there is zero interest from our own government.
926480	930560	And so the Chinese will find out about it at the same time our government does
930560	936560	because Lord knows what they do in these buildings. I watch crazy people walk in and out of the
936560	943040	intelligence community, walk in and out of DARPA. And I think, wow, you're talking to that person?
943040	948960	That's really fascinating to me. We don't seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball.
948960	953040	Complete lack of transparency. Do you think it's possible there is the government is in
953760	959120	possession of something deeply fundamental to understanding of the world that they're not
959680	965840	releasing? So this is one, one thing is, this is one of the famous distractions that people
965840	973280	play with the narrative of alien life forms and spacecraft and possession that the government
973280	976480	is in possession of alien spacecraft. That's the narrative. Yeah.
977440	983280	I don't think the government really exists at the moment. I believe, and this is not an idea
983280	987680	that was original to me. There was a guy named Michael Tidalbaum who used to be at the Sloan
987680	992960	Foundation. And at some point I pointed out that the US government had completely contradictory
992960	997600	objectives when it came to the military and science. And one branch said this,
997600	1001040	one branch said that. I said, you know, I don't understand which is true. What is the
1001040	1005280	government want? He said, do you think there's a government? And I said, what do you mean?
1005280	1010080	He said, what makes you think that the people in those two offices have ever coordinated?
1011840	1017600	What is it that allows each office to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office?
1017600	1021600	And that's when I first started to understand that there are periods where the government coheres
1022320	1025840	and then there are periods where the coherence just decays. And I think that that's been going
1025840	1031120	on since 1945, that there have been a few places where there's been increased coherence, but in
1031120	1036160	general, everything is just getting less and less coherent. And that what war did was focus us on
1036160	1043120	the need to have a government of people, a mission, capacity, technology, commitment, ideology.
1043760	1049520	And then as soon as that was gone, you know, different people, those who'd been through
1049520	1055680	World War II had one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s, you know, or late 40s by the time
1055680	1063040	they got to Woodstock, they didn't buy any of that. So coherence is the complete opposite of like
1065600	1072400	bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy. So coherence is efficient functional government,
1072400	1078720	because when you say there's no government, meaning there's no emergent function from a
1078720	1083840	collection of individuals, it's just a bunch of individuals stuck in their offices without
1083840	1089440	any kind of efficient communication with each other on a single mission. And so a government
1089440	1095440	that is truly at the epitome of what a government is supposed to be is when a bunch of people working
1095440	1100800	together. What are we about? Are we about freedom? Are we about growth? Are we about decency and
1100800	1106880	fairness? Are we about the absence of a national culture so that we can all just do our own thing?
1106880	1112160	I've called this thing the USAN, the United States of Absolutely Nothing. These are all
1112160	1119520	different visions for our country. So it's possible that there's an alien spacecraft somewhere, and
1119520	1125680	there's like 20 people that know about it, and then they're kind of, as you communicate further and
1125680	1130720	further into the offices, that information dissipates, it gets distorted in some kind of way, and then
1130720	1134400	it's completely lost. The power, the possibility of that information is lost.
1135680	1139600	We bought a house, and I had this idea that I wanted to find out what all the switches did.
1140160	1147280	And I quickly found out that your house doesn't keep updating its plans. As people do modifications,
1147280	1151360	they just do the modifications, and they don't actually record why they were doing what they
1151360	1155680	were doing or what things lead to. So they're all sorts of bizarre, like there's a switch in my
1155680	1162160	house that says privacy. I don't know what privacy is. Does it turn on an electromagnetic field?
1162160	1169600	Does some lead shielding go over the house? That's what we have. We have a system in which
1169600	1174000	the people who've inherited these structures have no idea why their grandparents built them.
1174000	1178560	I'd be funny if there's a freedom of speech switch that you could also control,
1178560	1180960	and there would be perfect metaphor for our current state of things.
1180960	1186560	Because what they figured out is that if they can just make sure that we don't have any public
1186560	1192960	options for communication, then, hey, every thing that we say to each other goes through a
1192960	1197520	private company. Private companies can do whatever they want. And this is one of the greatest moves
1197520	1203120	that we didn't really notice. Electronic and digital speech makes every other kind of speech
1203120	1210800	irrelevant. And because there is no public option, guess what? There's always somebody named Sundar
1210800	1217040	or Jack or Mark who controls whether or not you could speak and what it appears to be that is
1217040	1222480	being said and who stuff is weighted more highly than others. It's an absolute nightmare. And by
1222480	1229040	the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite, Lord knows what is going on. People are so busy
1229040	1235600	making money that they are not actually upholding any of the values. So Silicon Valley is sort of
1235680	1243680	maximally against it. It has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen to it when it goes to
1243680	1248000	Burning Man. And then it quickly just imposes rules on all of the rest of us as to what we
1248000	1253200	could say to each other if we're not part of the inner elite. So what do you think the ideal
1253200	1258480	of the freedom of speech means? Well, this is very interesting. I keep getting lectured on
1258480	1263760	social media by people who have no idea how much power the Supreme Court has to abstract things.
1264560	1269920	Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. And the spirit
1269920	1276080	of the law would have to say that our speech that matters is free, at least at the level of ideas.
1276080	1281040	I don't claim that I have the right to endanger your life with speech or to reveal your private
1281040	1287280	information. So I really am not opining about directed speech intended to smear you. And
1288320	1291440	that's a different kettle of fish. And maybe I have some rights to do that,
1291440	1298080	but I don't think that they're infinite. What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas
1300960	1307040	is essential that the court abstract it and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook,
1307040	1315040	Twitter, Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are, because it really matters which
1315040	1321040	abstraction use. The case that I really like is search and seizure. If I have private data
1321040	1325840	that I entered in my house that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house,
1327280	1332800	but is the abstraction that it's only the perimeter of my house that I have the right to
1332800	1340400	protect? Or does my password extend the perimeter of my house to the data on the server that is
1340400	1347360	located outside of my house? These are choices for the court. And the court is supposed to pretend
1347360	1353040	that they can divine the true intent of the framers. But all of the sort of, and I've taken
1353040	1358560	the calling this the problem of internet hyenas, people with ready-made answers and LOLs and you're
1358560	1363920	such a moron. These folks love to remind you, it's a private company, dude, it can do whatever it wants.
1364560	1369840	No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are. And just the way, for example,
1370560	1375600	the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra because there was too little in the
1375600	1379760	constitution. Therefore, there were all sorts of things implied that couldn't be in the document.
1380800	1384720	Somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now that says,
1386880	1392480	Jack, cannot do it over your wants. It's really, so you say the courts, but it's also us,
1393600	1398640	people who think about the world, it's you. No, no, no. It's the courts. But the courts don't do this.
1399520	1405440	We're toast. But we can still think about it. I mean, I don't feel like going down the drain.
1405680	1410240	Here's what I'm thinking about it because it's tricky how far it should extend. I mean, that's
1410240	1414720	an ongoing conversation. Don't you think the interpretation of the law? I think I'm trying
1414720	1418640	to say something very simple and it's just not going to be popular for a while.
1421200	1429600	Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication. Print or shouting in a public park. And so,
1429600	1433680	you know, I can go to a public park and I can shout if I get a permit. Even there,
1433680	1438480	I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta. We came up with free speech zones where you
1438480	1443600	can't protest at a convention. You bet you can go to a park 23 miles out and they'll fence off
1443600	1450400	a little area where you can have your free speech. No, speech is dangerous. Ideas are dangerous.
1450400	1457280	We are a country about danger and risk. And yes, I agree that targeted speech at individuals trying
1457280	1463440	to reveal their private stuff and all that kind of, that is very different. So forget a lot of
1463440	1470320	that stuff. But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous and people will die as a result of
1470320	1476720	free speech. The idea that one life is too much is preposterous. Like why did we send,
1476720	1480400	if one life is preposterous, why did we send anyone to the beaches of Normandy? I just don't
1480400	1487840	get this. So one thing that I was clearly bothered by, and maybe you can be my therapist as well,
1488800	1494480	I thought you were mine. This is, this is a little bit of a miscommunication on both of our
1494480	1505440	parts then. Because who's paying who for this? I was really bothered by Amazon banning parlor
1505520	1512480	from AWS because my assumption was that the infrastructure, I drew a distinction between
1512480	1522080	AWS, the infrastructure on which competing platforms could be created is different than the
1522080	1531360	actual platforms. So the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech, I in my mind, in a shallow way
1531360	1539520	perhaps applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter. It felt that we've created a more
1539520	1546880	dangerous world, that freedoms were violated by banning parlor from AWS, which I saw as the
1546880	1551760	computing infrastructure which enables the competition of tools, the competition of
1552480	1557840	frameworks of communication. What do you think about this? First of all, let me give you the
1558400	1565200	internet hyena answer. I don't understand dude, just build your own Amazon. Yeah, right? Yes.
1565200	1570800	Well, so that's a very shallow statement, but it's also one that has some legitimacy. We can't
1570800	1578080	completely dismiss it because there's levels to this game. Yes and no, but if you really wanted
1578080	1583280	to chase that down, one of the great things about a person-to-person conversation is opposed to like,
1583280	1587520	let's have 30 of our closest friends. Whenever we have a conversation with 30 of our closest
1587520	1593040	friends, you know what happens? It's like passing light through a prism. Every person says something
1593040	1600160	interesting and as a result, it's always muddled. Nothing ever resolves. Well, one of my
1600160	1606880	conversational techniques you mentioned, you pushed back, is first this childlike naivety and
1606880	1613120	curiosity, but also- Real or simulated? Real, I'm afraid. I would say 8% real.
1613680	1619840	So in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming? I mean, I did a show with
1620800	1625840	Ashley Matthews, who's the woman behind Riley Reed, and specifically about this. It was about
1625840	1633120	the idea that if I move away from politics and go towards sex, I know that there's always a move
1633120	1641120	to use the infrastructure to shut down sex workers. And in this case, we had Operation
1641120	1648800	Choke Point under the Obama administration. We have a positive passion for people who want
1648800	1652880	to solve problems that they don't like. This company, they don't like. That company,
1652880	1658560	Payday Loans would be another one. And so you have legal companies that are harassed by our
1658560	1666400	financial system that you can't, you know, as Riley Reed, Ashley couldn't get a mailchimp
1666800	1672080	account according to her, if I understand her correctly. And this idea that you charge these
1672080	1677840	people higher rates because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards, even if they're chargebacks are
1677840	1684240	low. Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment. There's something about everybody
1684240	1690480	who shows up at Davos. They get drunk in the Swiss Alps, and then they come back home,
1691040	1696080	and they coordinate. And they coordinate things like build back better. We don't really understand
1696080	1700800	what build back better is, but my guess is is that build back better has to do with extremism
1700800	1707120	in America. How do we shut down the Republican Party as the source of extremism? Now, I do think
1707120	1712400	the Republican Party has got very extreme under Trump. And I do believe that that was responsive
1712400	1722080	to how extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first, and then Obama, and then Hillary.
1722080	1728080	And in all of these circumstances, it's amazing how much we want to wield these things as weapons.
1728720	1733600	Well, our extremism is fine because we pretend that Tifa doesn't exist and we don't report
1733600	1740800	what goes on in Portland, but your extremism, my God, that's disgusting. This is the completely
1740800	1748800	ridiculous place that we're in. And by the way, our friends in part are coked up on tech money,
1748800	1754720	and they don't appear to hold the courage of their convictions at a political level because
1755440	1760800	it's not in keeping with shareholder value. At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate
1760800	1769840	shield with which everyone can cloak themselves. Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned from
1769840	1777680	Twitter, and I'm not sure it was a good financial decision for Twitter. Perhaps you can correct
1777760	1784240	me if I'm wrong. Well, are you thinking locally, or are you thinking if Twitter refused to ban
1784240	1788960	Donald Trump, what is the odds that the full force of the antitrust division might find them?
1788960	1794320	I don't know. Oh, I see. I see. So there's a complicated thing. Well, look, these guys are
1794320	1800640	all having a discussion in very practical terms. You can imagine the sorts of conversation.
1801280	1805120	Jack, Mark, Senator, we're really glad you're all here. We're all trying to
1805120	1810000	sing from the same hymnal and row in the same direction. We understand free speech. We're
1810000	1814960	completely committed to it, but we have to draw on with extremism, guys. We just need,
1814960	1819280	we need to make sure we're all on the same page. Well, they use the term violence too,
1819280	1823040	and they, I think, overapply it. So basically anybody...
1827600	1834240	I'm telling you, I say dumb things to incentivize thoughtful conversation.
1834240	1839840	Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace... Like, how old are you, Lex? You're in
1839840	1842480	your mid-thirties? Yeah, to late-forties.
1843280	1846400	Mid... Late-twenties to late-forties, somewhere in there.
1846400	1847600	That's the demographic.
1847600	1851600	I do think that partially what's happened is that your group has never seen functional
1851600	1855200	institutions. These institutions have been so compromised for so long,
1856480	1861520	you've probably never seen an adult. Sometimes I think Elon looks like an adult.
1861520	1867760	Well, I know that he has a wild lifestyle, but I also see him looking like an adult.
1867760	1869280	What does an adult look like, exactly?
1869280	1874080	Oh, you know, somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully, thinks about the future
1874080	1880560	beyond their own lifespan. Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done,
1881120	1886960	isn't wildly caught up in punitive actions, is more focused on breaking new ground than
1886960	1893120	playing rent-seeking games. I mean, I really had a positive... I was so completely chastised
1893120	1898080	when Elon must end up as the world's richest person. He was like, well, that's interesting,
1898080	1902400	back to work. That's what an adult would do.
1902400	1907440	That's what a grown-up would do. And weirdly, I said something about, isn't it amazing that the
1907440	1912800	world's richest person knows what a Lagrangian is, and he made a terrible Lagrange joke about
1912800	1918720	potentials? But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately, Elon may be one of the closest
1918720	1923600	things we have to an adult. And I can tell you that the internet hyenas will immediately descend
1923600	1927600	as to what a fraudster he is for pumping his stock price, talking his book and all this stuff.
1928320	1929360	Shut up.
1929360	1934480	So, looking at the world seriously and rigorously, you're saying that the people who are running
1934480	1943040	tech companies or running the mediums on which we can exercise the ideal of free speech are not
1943040	1943440	adults?
1944400	1950480	I think not. I think, first of all, a lot of them are Silicon Valley utopian businessmen,
1950480	1955520	where you talk a utopian line and you use it... You've heard my take, which is that
1956880	1960400	the idealism of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts.
1961120	1965360	And I believe that in many ways, the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world,
1965360	1969360	a world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, is really about the
1970720	1974960	software eating the world, as Mark Andreessen likes to say, through all these legacy properties,
1974960	1983120	and by simply being a bad tech version of something that previously existed like a newspaper,
1983120	1988080	you could immediately start to dwarf that by aggregating newspapers and their digital versions,
1988080	1994240	because digital is so much more powerful. As a result, yes, we have lots of man-children
1995040	2000400	wandering around what once was the Bay Area and is now Austin and Miami and other places,
2002080	2009680	maybe Singapore, that all of these people... These are friends of ours and they're brilliant
2009680	2014240	with respect to a certain amount of stuff, but none of them can get off the drip.
2014240	2019120	It's amazing that none of them have FU money. We've got billionaires who don't have FU money.
2019680	2025680	Okay. I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey was that there was an incitement of violence,
2025680	2031520	and not just Jack Dorsey, but everybody that was banning people. And then this word violence was
2031520	2039760	used as a kind of just like extremism and so on without much reason behind it. You think it's
2039760	2046000	impossible for Jack Dorsey or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult, a grown-up and...
2046000	2048560	Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grown-up. It seems like he is.
2050160	2056560	As you've discussed, it seems that he's been on the verge of almost being
2057200	2061840	quite serious and transparent and real. I don't know where the Jack Dorsey that I met
2061840	2068000	went, and I worry that that must be something behind the scenes that I can't see.
2068960	2075440	From my perspective, what I think is the stress, the burden of that when people are
2075440	2085040	screaming at you. Jack is a Zen monk. He really is. Jack is an incredibly impressive person,
2086240	2093360	intellectually, morally, spiritually, at least for a couple of meetings. I don't know him very
2093360	2099120	well, but I'm very impressed by the person I met, and I don't know where that person is,
2099120	2104480	and that terrifies me. But do you think somebody could step up in that way?
2104480	2114080	No. Does a human being have the capacity to be transparent about the reasoning behind the banning,
2114080	2121280	or do you think all banning eventually, all banning of people from mediums of communication
2122240	2127840	is eventually destructive, or it's impossible for human beings to reason with ourselves about it?
2127840	2134080	Well, let's see what the problem is. My phone has been on airplane mode. I'm going to unlock it.
2135040	2142320	I'm going to take a picture of Lex Fridden. Now, if I can, I'm going to tweet that picture out.
2143280	2150960	Great. But here's the weird part about it. That picture sitting with
2151680	2158000	Lex today. This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made.
2158640	2169280	Okay. In so doing, I have just sent a picture of you and a tiny piece of text all over the
2169280	2176800	planet that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth, just under half a million different
2176800	2183840	accounts. And then more from sharing and so on. Well, in some of those accounts are dead,
2183840	2190240	we don't really know how many places it went. But the key issue with that tweet is that
2191600	2201120	that is a non-local phenomenon. Yes. So I just broadcasted to an entire planet. Somebody in
2201200	2210640	Uganda is reading that at the same time as somebody in Uruguay. There is no known solution to have
2210640	2216720	so many people with the ability to communicate non-locally because locality was part of the
2216720	2222560	implicit nature of speech inside of the constitution. Friction, locality, there were all sorts of other
2222560	2229280	aspects to speech. So if you think about speech as a bundle, I like this.
2229440	2237680	Then it got unbundled. And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on to retard
2238560	2243840	the impact of speech aren't present. And we don't have the courage to say,
2243840	2248720	I wonder if the First Amendment really applies in the modern era in the same way,
2248720	2252960	or we have to work through an abstraction. Either we probably have to amend the constitution,
2252960	2261440	or we have to abstract it properly. And that issue is not something we're facing up to. I watch us
2262240	2269920	constantly look backwards. We don't seem to try to come up with new ideas and new theories. Nobody
2269920	2275360	really imagines that we're going to be able to wisely amend the constitution anymore inside of
2275360	2279520	the United States. Many people abroad will say, why are these guys talking about the US? It's a
2279520	2283520	US-centric program. Well, that's because nobody knows where this program lives.
2284880	2289680	The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be in a physical place together is also
2289680	2292880	bizarre. It could be anywhere. It doesn't really matter that it happens to be here.
2293600	2297040	So the difference between logical and between physical, local, non-local,
2297040	2304400	frictional, non-fictional, it's the same thing with firearms. Nobody imagined that the
2304400	2308080	gatling gun was going to be present when you had to reload a musket.
2309440	2318160	And that's fascinating to think about. You're exactly right that the nature of this particular
2318160	2325040	freedom that seems so foundational to this nation, to what made this nation great, and perhaps
2325040	2330720	much of the world that is great, made it great, is changing completely. Can we try to reason through
2330720	2338880	how the ideal freedom of speech is to be changed? I guess I'm struggling. It feels really wrong,
2339440	2343760	perhaps because I wasn't paying attention to it. It feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump
2345200	2352320	from Twitter, to ban not just the president. That's really wrong to me. But this particular
2352320	2358720	human for being divisive. But then when there's an incitement of violence,
2360640	2371680	that is an overused claim. But perhaps there was actual brewing of local violence happening. So
2371680	2379280	one of the things I know what's happening on Parler is people were scheduling meetings together
2379280	2387520	in physical space. So you're now going back from this dynamic, social, large-scale people
2387520	2392800	from Uganda, people from all over the world being able to communicate. You're now mapping that into
2392800	2398640	now back meeting in the physical space that is similar to what the founding of this nation was.
2398640	2406080	But if the violence were digital, if ransomware suddenly was unleashed, the key issue is the
2406080	2414480	abstractions. So what was freedom of speech as a bundle? And then how do we abstract the bundle
2414480	2419200	into the digital era? Do you think we just need to raise the question and talk about it? Do you
2419200	2424880	have ideas? Well, sure I have ideas. But the key point is that I'm not even welcome in mainstream
2424880	2431120	media. I've never seen you on mainstream media. Do you do mainstream media? So we exist in part
2431120	2437360	of an alternate universe because the mainstream media is trying to have a coherent story, which I
2437360	2441840	have called the gated institutional narrative. And the institutions pretend that they plug their
2441840	2449120	fingers in their ears and pretend that nothing exists outside of MSNBC talking to CNN about what
2449120	2454400	was in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post. And so that's effectively like a
2454400	2459760	professional wrestling promotion where they, you know, the undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan
2459760	2467600	and Rowdy Roddy Piper. Okay, well, that's very different than MMA. You've recently been on
2467600	2473520	Glenn Beck's program. Yeah. And there was this kind of one of the things you've talked about
2474480	2480080	is being able to have this conversation. I don't know if you would put it as a type of
2480080	2484320	conversation that was happening outside the mainstream media, but a conversation that
2484320	2491440	reaches across different worldviews and having a nuanced or just like a respectful
2492640	2498080	conversation that's grounded and mutual. But we can't have the reality because the main model is
2500480	2504880	the center, both left and right is in the process of stealing all the wealth that we built up.
2506160	2510880	And they've organized the extremes into two LARPing teams that I've called
2510880	2516960	MAgastand and Wokastand. And then you have everybody who isn't part of that complex,
2516960	2522160	all seven of us, the number of us who are able to earn a living looking at all of these mad
2522160	2529520	people playing this game. You know, there's a phrase inside finance when the investment banks
2529520	2534000	are trying to look at price action. And somebody says, this doesn't make any sense.
2534800	2539040	And somebody will say, it's just the locals stealing from each other. And that's really
2539040	2546160	what we have. We've got the leaders of MAgastand and Wokastand championing these two teams sponsored
2546160	2550160	by the center because it's a distraction while they steal all the silver and cut the paintings
2550160	2555120	out of the frames. That's what you and I are looking at. So when you ask me, do you have any
2555120	2561760	ideas about the abstraction for free speech? I've never met Mark Zuckerberg. I've never met
2561760	2568080	Sundar Pichai. I never met Larry Page. I was once in a room with Sergey Brin. I've never
2568080	2574320	spoken to Elon Musk. I hang out with Peter Thiel, but we have a very deep relationship,
2574320	2579520	but I don't really speak to that many other people at sort of at this level.
2580640	2587120	We're not having any kind of smart conversation at a national level. In fact, it's almost as if
2588080	2594400	we've destroyed every sandbox in which we could play together. There's no place
2594400	2599120	that we actually talk except long form podcasting. And by the way, they've found,
2600160	2604880	you see what's going on with like Alex Stamos and the Hoover Institution.
2606560	2613040	There's a loophole left. Long form podcasting allows people to speak at levels above daytime
2613040	2617440	CNN. It's like, well, why do you think they're not watching daytime CNN?
2619120	2624800	But that's just silly journalism. They currently have no power to
2624800	2629360	displace podcasting. That's why it's so powerful. RSS feed. I mean, that's why the big challenge
2629360	2635680	with Joe Rogan and Spotify is like, there's this dance that's fascinating to see is Joe Rogan is
2635680	2643200	not part of the system. And then he's also uncancelable. And there's this tension that's
2643200	2650960	happening. Well, Howard Stern, Howard Stern became much less relevant. So if they can't control Joe
2650960	2658960	by bringing him in house, the key question is, is he going to continue? Like, you know, this
2658960	2665040	Joe says this thing about FU money. Yeah. Joe's one of the only people with FU money who's actually
2665040	2675600	said FU. Yeah. I don't understand this. I don't have FU money. What exactly is, can we break apart
2675600	2684400	FU money? Because I always thought I've been fortunate enough to have always have FU money
2684400	2688960	in the sense that my standards were so low that a basic salary in the United States.
2688960	2694160	This is the stoic point, which is it can live on rice and beans. You're uncancelable because
2694160	2698480	you're always rich relative to your needs. So isn't that FU fundamental FU money? Why do you say
2698480	2704000	that tech billionaires don't have FU money? When you need to hire private security to protect
2704000	2710560	your family, how do you protect your two children? I don't have those yet. Bingo. Yeah. My point is,
2710560	2717760	is that FU money insulates everything that you care about. It's not just about you. So you're
2717760	2723760	saying as the level of responsibility grows, the amount of money required for FU
2724480	2730560	we have a war going on. The war is on academic freedom. Academic freedom used to be present
2730560	2736720	in the system as a, in terms of the idea, we trust our elite. Now we have an idea like,
2737520	2741280	you want to be the elite, you know, you want a Lord above us. That's like, first of all,
2741280	2747600	there's like a populist anti-elitist thing. Then there's the idea that we're going to defer tenure
2747600	2751680	for forever. Then we're going to tell people stay in your lane. Your tenure is only good for your
2751680	2756800	own particular tiny micro subject. Then we're going to also control your grants and we'll
2756800	2761120	be able to load up your teaching load if we don't like who you are and we'll make your life
2761120	2769520	absolutely impossible. We lost academic freedom and we ushered in peer review, which was a disaster.
2770560	2776400	And then we lost funding so that people were confident that they would have the ability to
2776400	2782720	do research no matter what they said. And as a result, what you find is, is a world in which
2782720	2788560	there's no ability to get people to say, no, I'm not going to sign your diversity and inclusion
2788560	2795520	forced loyalty oath. I won't sign any loyalty oath. Get the hell out of my office. FU.
2796320	2801040	FU. And you're connecting money to that, but. Well, my point is, is that academic freedom
2801600	2807760	is the whole idea behind it was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire
2808320	2816800	on a much smaller salary. Right. Okay. We've lost that. Yeah. The only reason in part that I wanted
2816800	2825440	to go into academic, academics as a profession, as opposed to wanting to do physical or mathematical
2825520	2833280	research, the great prize was freedom. Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation previously of IBM
2833280	2839600	research pointed it out. He says, if you lose freedom, you lose the only thing we had to offer
2839600	2845280	top minds, top minds value their intellectual freedom and their physical and economic security
2846000	2850800	at a different level than other human beings. And so people say, you know,
2851680	2856480	I don't understand, dude, you have the ability to do X, Y and Z. What's the problem? It's like, well,
2856480	2862800	I value my ability to raise the middle finger as an American practically above everything else.
2864080	2869360	I want to talk to you about freedom here in the context of something you've mentioned, which
2870880	2877600	one way to take away freedom is to put a human being into a cage to create constraints. The other
2877600	2883680	one that worries me is something that I think you spoke into Twitter a little bit on Twitter is
2885120	2898800	we bleed freedom by kind of slowly scaring you into not doing, not expressing the full spectrum
2898800	2906320	of opportunities you can as freedom. So like when you ban Donald Trump, when you ban Parler,
2907280	2912960	you give a little doubt in the minds of millions like me, a person who's a tech person,
2912960	2918560	who's an entrepreneur, there's a little, that's what I'm afraid of when I look in the mirror.
2918560	2923680	Is there not a little doubt in there that limits the amount of options I will try?
2923680	2930960	How certain are you that the COVID virus didn't come from the Wuhan lab and his biosafety level
2931040	2938720	for? We both know that we're both supposed to robotically say the idea that the COVID virus
2938720	2942880	came from a lab is a discredited conspiracy theory. There is no evidence that suggests
2942880	2948000	that this is true. The World Health Organization and the CDC have both upon this to say otherwise
2948000	2954000	would be incredibly irresponsible. And the threat of that is the thing that ultimately limits
2955040	2958960	the freedoms we feel. I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time.
2959440	2962000	And you're afraid. In a sense.
2962000	2966000	It's also boring. I mean, I said it in the public many times.
2966000	2970720	Why is it we don't ask where the records are from Velard House? Where are the financial records?
2970720	2976480	Where are the SEC filings? Where are the questions on the record to the intelligence
2977760	2984800	agencies? Was he known to be part of the intelligence community? So we're not interested
2984800	2990080	in asking questions. Am I going to die as a result of asking the question?
2991040	2994160	Was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community of any nation?
2994880	2998320	Is there a reason we're not asking about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund
2998320	3001920	that he didn't run? Just like the Wuhan lab.
3002800	3008160	Okay. How do we get to the core of the Jeffrey Epstein, the truth behind Jeffrey Epstein, in
3008160	3012640	a sense? I mean, there's some things that are just useless conspiracy theories around it,
3012640	3014560	even if they're true. There's some things they get.
3014560	3016320	I hate to say it. You're not going to like it.
3016960	3022960	Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break-in of the Citizens' Committee to investigate the FBI.
3024160	3030080	Those kids, and by the way, they weren't all kids, did what had to be done.
3031440	3035760	They broke in. They broke the law. It was an incredible act of civil disobedience.
3036960	3041760	And God bless Judy Feingold for taking to her, she was going to take to her grave.
3042400	3045280	That she'd been part of this, like the coolest thing of all time.
3045280	3050160	They didn't say anything for forever. So civil disobedience. I mean, you have to...
3050160	3054560	We are founded on civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is incredibly...
3056880	3061280	You screw it up and you're just a vandal. You screw it up, you're a hooligan.
3062960	3067040	Those cats were so disciplined. It's an art form.
3067120	3072320	It was an art form and they risked everything they were willing to pay with their freedom.
3074080	3078720	Those are the sorts of people who earned the right by putting themselves at risk.
3078720	3084880	I would not do this. I am not volunteering to break into anything.
3084880	3090960	I think it was William Davodon who was a student of Murray Gelman and a physics professor at Haverford
3091920	3095920	who corralled these people and led this effort.
3095920	3102960	And right now, what we need is somebody to blow the lid off of what is controlling everything.
3104400	3108560	I'm happy to hear that it's a system of incentive structures,
3108560	3112080	that it's a system of selective pressures. I'm happy to find out that it's emergent.
3112080	3116400	I'm happy to find that it's partially directed by our own intelligence community.
3116400	3123200	I'm happy to hear that, in fact, we've been penetrated by North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia.
3124000	3129600	But I need to know why people aren't... The firebombing of the courthouse in Portland,
3129600	3136080	Oregon has no explanation. And somehow this is normal. This is not normal to any human being.
3137200	3143200	We have video that people don't believe. I come back to the shaggy defense of it wasn't me.
3144160	3145600	It's like...
3148960	3152080	You remember that song? Shaggy, yeah. It wasn't me. He caught you
3153280	3156480	banging him in the shower on the counter. Yeah, exactly. It wasn't me.
3159040	3161760	His friend says, well, your strategy makes no sense at all.
3162480	3168320	But this is what MSNBC is doing. You dropped him from the graphic. It wasn't me.
3168320	3171200	It wasn't me. You came up with another yank. It wasn't me.
3172160	3178400	I will never see MSNBC the same again. So you've spoken about him before. I think it would be nice
3178400	3186000	to maybe honor him to break it apart a little bit. Aaron Schwartz. Why was he a special human
3186000	3192560	being in this ilk of what we're talking about now, civil disobedience? How do we honor him
3193120	3198320	now moving forward as human beings who are willing to take risks in this world?
3198960	3203120	Well, I don't know. Are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz?
3203680	3209520	I am. How do you feel about JSTOR? Let's talk about JSTOR first. Let's say what JSTOR is all about.
3210880	3222000	We the taxpayer pay for research and then the people who do the research do all the work for a
3222000	3228560	bunch of companies who then charge us $30 an article to read what it is that we already paid
3228560	3233600	for. And if we don't cite these articles, we're told that we're in violation. Okay.
3235200	3239760	I almost never call for civil disobedience because I don't really want to, but
3241680	3247120	fuck JSTOR, fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer. Who the fuck are these people?
3247120	3258000	Yeah. The smart people need to take the greedy people behind the woodshed and explain to them
3258000	3264880	what science is. I have a very old fashioned idea that's so out of favor that I will immediately
3264880	3270400	be seen as a knuckle-dragger. I believe in the great woman theory of history and the great man
3270480	3280240	theory of history. Emmy Nerder is fantastic as an example. And I believe in editors over peer
3280240	3285840	reviewers. And I believe that wrong things should be allowed into the literature. And I believe that
3285840	3292560	the gatekeeping should go towards zero because the costs associated with distribution are very,
3292560	3300320	very slight. I believe that we should be looking at the perverse incentives of sending your paper
3300560	3304720	blindly into your competitors' clutches, particularly if you're a young person being
3304720	3312480	reviewed by an older person. Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor? Are you familiar with
3312480	3320240	the legend of the Magnaia? No. The Magnaia is the Miller's daughter. And the largest food fight
3320240	3326560	in the entire universe, I believe, is held, I think in Italy. It's called the Battle of the
3326560	3335680	Oranges. And it celebrates the Miller's daughter who had fallen in love with her beloved. And when
3335680	3345040	it came time for them to marry, the Virginal Magnaia was in fact told that the Lord of the land
3345040	3351280	had the right to have the first night with the bride. Well, the Magnaia had a different idea.
3351280	3358320	So she seemed to consent to this perhaps mythical right, also called the Prima note the first night.
3359200	3367520	And by legend, she concealed a dagger underneath her robes. And when it came time for the hated
3367520	3374960	Lord of the Manor to extract this right, she pulled the knife out and killed him. And I think it
3374960	3382160	also echoes a little bit of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones. But that inspired
3382160	3390880	both men and women. And the Magnaia is the legendary hero. Right now, what we need to do is we need
3390880	3397920	to resist the Prima note, the right of first look, right? F you, you don't have the right of first
3397920	3402160	look. I don't want to send something blindly to my competitors. I don't want to subject myself to
3402240	3409920	you naming what work I've done. Why are you in my story? That's my question. Get out of my story.
3409920	3415440	If I do work, and then you have an idea, oh, well, it's the Matthew principle. To him,
3415440	3420240	who has much more will be given. I've gone to the National Academy of Sciences and talked about
3420240	3425440	these things. And it's funny, I've been laughed at by the older people who think, well, Eric,
3425440	3430960	you know, science proceeds funeral by funeral, that's plonk. You know, the Matthew principle,
3430960	3433840	you know, the Matilda principle that things done by women are attributed to men,
3434400	3437680	that these are not new. And you guys just live like this?
3437680	3443760	Yeah. So the revolutionary act now is to resist all of these things that are not new.
3443760	3447600	So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz. Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia. One of the things
3447600	3455440	you've done very beautifully is to communicate love. And I think about some of our conversations.
3455520	3461200	You got me to talk a little bit about my own experiences in 02138 and 39.
3465280	3471040	We are the product of our trauma. And what people don't understand is that very often,
3471040	3477040	when you see people taking countermeasures against what appear to be imaginary forces,
3477760	3480960	they're really actually replaying things that really happen to them.
3481840	3488160	And having been through this system and watching all of the ways in which it completely rewrites
3488160	3492640	the lives of the people who I am counting on to cure our diseases, build our new industries,
3492640	3499520	keep us safe from our foes, the amount of pressure the system is putting on the most
3499520	3508320	hopeful minds is unimaginable. And so my goal is to empower somebody like an Aaron Schwartz in memory
3508320	3514400	and to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation. Do you know that the first person outside
3515920	3519760	of me to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein?
3522080	3525280	How did he know I was working on this? I don't know.
3525920	3531840	So your ideas that formed geometric unity was something that his eyes have seen?
3531840	3538400	I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein as one of the only people who could help me.
3539040	3541680	No, no, no, listen to this. Yeah, how does this connect?
3541680	3549360	Okay. Well, first of all, my old synagogue, my old school, was the conservative minion at Harvard
3549360	3558240	Hillel. And I believe it's called Rossofsky Hall after Henry Rossofsky in the economics department
3558240	3564240	who was a Japan scholar, if I'm correct. And he became provost or dean of Harvard.
3566000	3573120	I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein's money. And I wondered in part whether the Jewish
3573120	3578960	students at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck of Harvard Hillel. So that was something
3578960	3584000	I found very curious, but I don't know much about it. I also found that Jeffrey Epstein hanging
3584000	3588960	around scientists. I don't think that either you or Joe exactly, I mean, got me correct
3589680	3594400	in your last interchange. For the record, for people who didn't have a listen to Joe Rogan
3594400	3601920	program, Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein was the only person who has gotten laid. And you said
3601920	3608320	you also got paid as a young man, right? I believe the word was laid, but allegedly.
3608320	3611920	My hearing isn't so good at age 55. All right, leaving that aside.
3614400	3619600	What was Jeffrey Epstein doing hanging around all of these scientists? I don't think that was the
3619600	3626400	same program that was about compromising political leaders and business people and entertainment
3626400	3631040	figures. I think these are two different programs that were being run through one individual.
3631760	3638400	And Joe seemed to think that I didn't think he was smooth. I thought he was glib. I think what Joe
3638400	3645680	was really trying to get at was that I found his mysticism meretricious. He had an ability to deflect
3645680	3651520	every conversation that might go towards revealing that he didn't know what he was talking about.
3651520	3656400	Every time you started to get close to something where the rubber hit the road, the rubber wouldn't
3656400	3667120	hit the road. And yet, can you help me untangle the fact that you thought deeply about the physics
3667200	3673440	of the nature of our universe? And Jeffrey Epstein was interested.
3673440	3676960	How did he know? I wasn't really talking about this stuff until
3678480	3682160	even my close friends didn't really know what I was up to.
3682160	3687360	And yet, you're saying he did not have sufficient brilliance to understand
3687360	3692800	when the rubber hit the road. So why did he have sufficient interest and curiosity?
3692800	3698000	Tell me what I thought. I've been waiting to find out, does my government even know I exist?
3699280	3705200	Do you have an answer to that question? A couple times, the government has reached out to me.
3706560	3713440	In general, there is zero interest in me, less than zero interest. I find that fascinating.
3714560	3719360	As far as you know, right? Well, that's what I'm trying to say. The question about not being able
3719360	3724480	to see through a half-silvered mirror, you don't know what's going on behind the half-silvered
3724480	3731840	mirror. To you, all you see is your reflection. But your intuition still holds. This is where I've
3731840	3738400	mentioned that I... This is where I'll say naive dumb things, but I still hold on to this intuition
3738400	3746400	that Jeff... I'm not confident in this, but I lean towards that direction that Jeffrey Epstein is the
3746400	3752640	source of evil, not something that's underlying him. You have a bias. It's different than mine.
3752640	3760000	Our Bayesian priors are tutored by different life experiences. If I was mostly concerned,
3760000	3764000	like Sam Harris is concerned, that people fill their heads with nonsense,
3765440	3770400	I would have a very strong sense that people need order in the world, that they take
3770400	3775200	mysterious situations, they build entire castles in the air, and then they go move in if they
3775200	3781040	really get crazy. The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air and
3781040	3786560	psychotics move in. Coming from a progressive family, we had a different experience. It's
3786560	3790240	really weird when the government is actually out to get you, when they actually send a spy,
3790880	3795920	when they actually engage in disinformation campaigns, when they smear you. And if you've
3795920	3801440	ever had that brought to bear on your family, you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding
3801440	3807520	of the country, which is different than having a, wow, do people believe crazy stuff because
3807520	3812880	they watch too much TV? And both of these things have some merit to them, but it's a question
3812880	3816960	of regulated expression. When do you want to express more Sam Harris and when do you want to
3816960	3822720	express more Howard Zinn? You can express both, correct? The one human being can express both?
3822720	3827120	Sure, but there's a trade-off between them. In other words, most people, like the Michael
3827120	3831920	Shermers of the world are going to tilt very strongly to extraordinary claims, require extraordinary
3831920	3835520	evidence. You're going to have that kind of energy. And then somebody else is going to say,
3835520	3841200	how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb before I realize that there's a problem?
3841920	3848160	So my feeling about this is, yes, people see patterns in clouds. They see faces and scripture
3848160	3852720	and all sorts of things, and it's just random cloud patterns. And it's also the case that there's
3852800	3857680	tremendous pressure not to see conspiracies when conspiracies are relatively more common
3857680	3862720	than the people who shout conspiracy theory will claim. So both of these things are true. And you
3862720	3867760	have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn and when your inner Harris? And those are different.
3867760	3873440	One fundamental difference you and I biases aside is you've actually met Jeffrey Epstein.
3873440	3882800	And I'm listening to reverberations years later of stories and narratives throughout the story.
3882800	3889600	Luckily, I only met him once. And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations with him
3889600	3895040	other than the one meeting. You can learn a lot in just a few words from a human being.
3895040	3900000	Well, that's true. But I think that the bigger issue was I saw something that I don't hear
3900080	3907200	much remarked upon, which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is. In other words, there's the
3907200	3913040	National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes, there's all this stuff
3914480	3918000	that kind of has the same feel to it, a little bit of variation and difference,
3918000	3924240	Department of Energy. If you fall outside of that, there's just Jeffrey Epstein. That's what you're
3924240	3930160	told. That's not quite true. There's Cavley. Maybe Jim Simons is now in the game. Peter
3930160	3936160	Thiel has done some stuff. You had Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try. So there is other money
3936160	3942880	running around, Templeton. But very strongly, there was a belief that if you're doing something
3942880	3949040	really innovative and the system can't fund it because we become pussies, Jeffrey Epstein's your
3949040	3952960	guy. And that's because it's funnel that you're supposed to go through.
3952960	3959600	That's right. And the idea is that you get called to the great man's house and the sort of
3961600	3968480	lubricious version of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions and maybe he has
3968480	3977680	an island, maybe he has a plane. And when you're starved, somebody showing you a feast or when
3977680	3987760	you're dehydrated in a death's door and somebody says, oh, I have a well. That's what it is.
3987760	3994160	And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing money into the science system so that we
3994160	4001120	don't have super creeps trying to learn all of our secrets ahead of time? WTF, what is your problem
4001120	4007200	with transparency and taxpayer dollars? All of you, you wouldn't have a country. You'd be speaking
4007280	4013600	German. So essentially, you believe that human beings would not be able to, when the money is
4013600	4018800	lacking in the system, like in research. We produce public goods. You and I are meant to produce
4018800	4024800	public goods. Now, I sell athletic greens and I sell Theragun and I sell Unagi scooters
4025920	4033680	and Chili Pat. Can I be honest? I love these products. But I didn't get into this game for the
4033680	4041440	purpose of selling. I'm trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle? But you know something
4041440	4047600	like, I don't know why you built this channel. It's kind of a mystery. I'll tell you why I built
4047600	4054720	my channel. It's going to be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley. I got rolled multiple
4054720	4061120	times and my point is I didn't want to become a celebrity. I didn't want to become well known,
4061760	4068960	but it's a lot harder to roll somebody who's getting, you know, I think I'm, I don't know if
4068960	4073120	this is mistaken, but I think I'm the math PhD with the largest number of followers on Twitter.
4074320	4080960	And there was nothing you could do before. I mean, again, to put a little responsibility on you.
4080960	4086320	So you've created something really special for the distribution of your own ideas. I mean,
4087280	4093760	but because it's not necessarily currently scalable, you also, perhaps you and I have
4093760	4100080	the responsibility of giving other people also a chance to spread their ideas. I mean, Joe Rogan
4100080	4104800	did this very effectively for a bunch of people that. That's why they're angry at him because
4104800	4111520	he's a gatekeeper and he let all sorts of people through that gate from Roger, from Roger Penrose
4111600	4119680	to Alex Jones. To Jordan Peterson to, I mean, even, first of all, to you and to Abby Martin.
4119680	4127920	To Abby Martin. To Barry Weiss. Yeah. That's the problem. Well, but you have not successfully
4127920	4134320	built up a thing that allows that to carry that forward. No, no, no, no. We are all vulnerable
4134320	4140800	to reputational attack because what happens, you see, the problem Lexis is that you are now in
4140800	4146240	an institution at some level. You walk around with all this equipment in a duffel bag,
4148240	4156560	the last suit, the last suit you'll ever need. And you have the reach of something like CNN
4156560	4163760	to people who matter. Okay. So now the question is, how do we control something that doesn't
4163760	4169360	have a board, doesn't have shareholders, doesn't have to make SEC filings, FCC. So the best
4170080	4177520	answer they have is, well, we just have to destroy reputations. All it takes is for us
4177520	4182960	to take something that gets said or done or alleged. And I think it's incredibly important.
4182960	4189040	One of the things people don't understand is that I'm going to fight general reputational attacks,
4189680	4194400	not because some people don't deserve to have their reputations drag through the mud,
4195040	4202880	but because it's too powerful of a tool to hand it to CNN, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard,
4202880	4206240	the State Department. Yes. But as some of it is also...
4207360	4213120	Jake Morgan. Muhammad Ali style being good enough at
4215600	4221600	doing everything you need to do without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks,
4221600	4228000	not being afraid, but not giving enough meat. I don't see why the people who have good ideas
4228000	4232720	have to lead lives that are that clean. If you can do it. You can be messy. Yeah. You should
4232720	4237760	be able to be messy that otherwise we're suppressing too many people. Look. Too many, too
4237760	4244000	billion minds. Yeah. Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt? I still people tell me this.
4244960	4247520	Okay. I have discussions about Elon and people,
4249600	4258080	the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist who's talking about Amua Amua that it might be alien technology.
4258640	4267760	He told me this outside the box thinker. Yeah. When speaking to me about Elon,
4268720	4276480	said, called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed. The blunt in a dismissive way.
4276480	4283520	Like this guy is crazy because he smoked some weed. I was looking at him. I was like, why? Wow.
4284080	4291680	Wow. I think you should be able to have consensual drug filled orgies. Fuck perfect lives.
4292320	4296480	Yeah. You should be allowed to be messy. Yeah. Right. I take back my statement. I'm just saying.
4297040	4304160	Respectability is the unique prison where all of the gates are open and the inmates
4304160	4310720	beg to stay inside. It's time to end their prison of respectability because it's too
4310720	4317680	effective of a means of sidelining and silencing people, including it is better that we have bad
4317680	4325280	people in our system than this idea of no platforming people who are beyond the pale
4325280	4331040	because it's such a simple technique. So what's the heroic action here on the...
4331680	4337040	Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program. By the way, she was absolutely
4338640	4345040	delightful as a guest. She is polite in the extreme, far more polite than I am.
4346000	4350960	And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest because I wanted to highlight this
4350960	4356000	program can go anywhere. We can talk to anyone. What about social media? You've started highlighting
4356000	4361840	people being banned on social media. How do we fight this? Like if you get banned from social
4361840	4365920	media, so you're saying nobody will stand up to me? Well, just figure out what your incentive
4365920	4370800	structure is before. Assume that I get banned on social media because somebody wants to make
4370800	4375280	sure that my message doesn't interfere with the dominant narrative. Yeah. Okay.
4375280	4382560	What will happen? By the way, I'm very glad to be able to explain this on your show because
4383440	4389120	that video will presumably be archived and they can't easily make you take it down. Okay.
4389760	4394800	So what's going to happen is that there'll be a whole bunch of very low quality bot-like
4395680	4398880	accounts that dog you every time you talk about me.
4399520	4404800	Right. Dude, it's getting old. It's getting boring. We already heard you. Dude, that was like,
4404800	4408240	let it go. Not a good look. Not a good look is one of my favorites.
4409040	4412960	But what about the high-profile ones? Well, then you'll get a few high-profile ones and some of
4412960	4421200	the high-profile ones command armies. Like at some point, I had 10,000 people using exactly the
4421200	4426240	same templated tweeting at me. It was just actually, it got to the point where it was funny because
4427200	4430640	everybody said, did you hear that in a hipster coffee shop? I was like,
4430640	4433840	why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee? It's hilarious.
4436400	4441040	Those things will cause you to think better of it. You'll start to see your follower can't go down
4441040	4445840	because it's easy to give you a bunch of bot-like follows and then just pull them.
4445840	4452240	So I think it's pretty well known how, and then maybe your account will be suspended and it can't
4452240	4456560	be revoked and etc. And then three days later, you'll be told it was an error.
4457200	4462560	So let me push back. I just don't see not defending you. So what are the things you would do
4463680	4471040	that, given that I can actually talk to you offline, that would make me not defend you?
4473120	4480320	Well, first of all, I can imagine some. But all of us have things. If somebody says,
4480400	4486320	do you hear what your boy Lex said about you? What did Lex say about me? Oh, he said you were
4486320	4496240	flawed, dude. Oh, shit. They're so distressed because none of us want to stand behind flawed
4496240	4500160	people. That's why you have everybody rushing to say, I neither condemn nor condone. I know,
4500160	4503360	I don't condemn nor condone. What is that? We're all trying to say-
4503360	4508640	By the way, for the record, I said that Eric is smarter than me in a brilliant human being,
4508640	4514000	but flawed like all humans are. My point is, I've now come up with a new policy,
4514000	4520880	which is I don't care what my friends have done. I am not disavowing my friends. Not because
4520880	4523840	they didn't do the wrong thing. Maybe they did do the wrong thing. I don't know.
4524880	4529760	What's the value of friendship if that's not that? Like, for example, we've had the situation
4529760	4534640	with Brian Callan. Brian Callan was featured recently in the Los Angeles Times. I know nothing
4534640	4540560	about the allegations. I can't. I didn't even know Brian at the time, right? I've known him for
4540560	4544800	roughly the time I've been in Los Angeles, maybe a year and a half during that period of time.
4544800	4550240	I've never seen anything wrong. Now I'm in a situation. What do you think he did? Do you think
4550240	4556240	he didn't? It's like, you know what? I don't know. But I do know this. Everyone's entitled to have
4556240	4562000	friends because we can't afford isolated people. And if your friends do the wrong thing,
4562000	4567520	they're still your friends. And if they do terrible, terrible things, you bring that up with
4567520	4573360	them privately. And it's not my responsibility to disavow in public. We've had this situation
4574720	4580560	that I don't like where particular people that I've been close to, I'm put under tremendous
4580560	4585120	pressure to disavow them. What do you think now about your buddy? I like Dave Rubin and all that
4585120	4590640	kind of stuff. Here's the thing. My friends are my friends. I don't disavow my friends.
4590720	4598240	We all need to make a statement that we will not be brought under pressure to disavow our friends,
4598880	4608080	our family members, because mass murderers are dangerous the more isolated they become.
4608080	4614160	It is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people. And it's dangerous.
4614400	4620560	It sends a signal to everybody else to fit in, to be more cynical about the
4620560	4624000	human connection we have to each other. If I find out you've been selling heroin
4624000	4629360	to elementary school students, you're still my friend and I will not be disavowing you.
4629360	4632960	And if I have a problem with you selling heroin to elementary school students
4633760	4641440	during school hours, I will bring it up with you privately because we don't need to hear my voice
4641440	4646160	added to that condemnation. Are there things that you could do that would cause me to say,
4646160	4652560	actually, F this guy? Yeah, above and beyond that. But simply doing the wrong thing, I think we've
4652560	4657920	gone down a terrible path. I think isolated people are about the most dangerous thing we could have
4657920	4664480	in a heavily armed society. So I deeply agree with you. I'm Brian Callan and all these people
4664480	4670640	that quote unquote got canceled. And I'm not saying that I don't know the truth value because we
4670640	4677920	can't. And even if I did know the truth value, I'm not setting up an incentive structure for the
4677920	4684160	personal destruction as a means of letting institutions combat the fact that individuals
4684160	4689440	are the last thing that can say none of you guys make any sense. I don't treat these things like,
4689440	4694160	you know, I had a conversation where Kevin Spacey was at the dinner table when I came down from a
4694160	4700400	hotel room. And I had a very long conversation with Kevin Spacey. I will not detail because
4700400	4706400	I don't do that as to what we discussed. But we talked very specifically about him being canceled.
4706960	4713680	And I don't think that the world has heard that story in part because there's a very strong sense
4713680	4721920	that he has to be out grouped. And as a result, you know, I mean, do we want do we want to disavow
4721920	4726080	the space program because it touched Werner von Braun? Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics
4726080	4730880	because Pascal Jordan and Werner Heisenberg passed through it? Is Aaron Fest theorem false
4730880	4737760	because he murdered his child? I mean, at what point do we recognize that we are the problem?
4737760	4743680	Humans are humans. And there is no perfect, there is no perfect group of people, even all of the
4743680	4748320	most oppressed people, the supposed victims of the world who we now have fetishized into thinking
4748320	4752880	that they're all oracles because their lived experience informs us and their pain is more
4752880	4760400	salient than everyone else's pain. Those people are necessarily great people. You know, it's like
4760400	4766800	none of us, we can't, we can't do this in this fashion. So when we sit down to have a conversation
4767600	4773440	across the table from somebody, you should be willing to, like you should not have NPR in your
4773440	4779920	mind, you should be willing to take the full risk and to see the good in the person without,
4780000	4783680	with limited information and to do your best to understand that person.
4784480	4790080	Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget. I don't believe this is of institutions.
4791440	4794960	Everybody is entitled to a certain amount of screwing up in life.
4796160	4800880	You're entitled to a mendacity budget. You're entitled to an aggression budget.
4801760	4807280	The idea of getting rid of everybody is, you know, people haven't even blown through their
4807280	4812880	budgets and we're already. Yeah. I think about, for example, one person, I'd be curious to get
4812880	4817520	your thoughts about Alex Jones. Let's not talk about Alex Jones for a second. Let's talk about
4817520	4825840	the National Enquirer. Is everything the National Enquirer says false? No. Okay. Do you remember
4825840	4833120	the John Edwards story? Did she run his wife? Sorry. He had a child from an extramarital affair.
4833120	4837200	Yes. I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story.
4839760	4843920	And then what does the New York Times do? The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report that
4843920	4848080	the National Enquirer is making a claim. That way they don't have to substantiate the story.
4849040	4855760	So why is the New York Times talking to Mike Cernovich or using the National Enquirer as a
4855760	4861360	source? Are they using Alex Jones as a source? Who, here's the big problem that we're having.
4862320	4867360	Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody and other people are entitled to talk
4867360	4871600	to no one? I don't really understand this. This is an indulgence system. This is how the Catholic
4871600	4876240	Church used to do things. It's hard to fight the system because the reason you don't talk to Alex
4876240	4881760	Jones is because the platforms on which we do the communication will de-platform, will remove you.
4881760	4888160	But I'm not platformed. I used to do NPR and I used to do the news hour and I used to
4888960	4894560	provide stories to Washington Post New York Times. That has gone away. They've circled the
4894560	4900400	wagons closer and closer and more of us are unacceptable. And right now I have no question
4900400	4905920	that they're going through anybody who has a platform trying to say, okay, what do we have
4905920	4910960	against that person in case we need to shut that down? We have to make a different decision, Lex.
4910960	4917360	And the different decision is that it doesn't matter how many times Joe said the N-word.
4918640	4926480	It doesn't matter that somebody else, with mathematical theorems, if the worst person
4926480	4931120	in the world proves a mathematical theorem like the Unabomber, we can't undo the theorem.
4932720	4939120	And I point out Charles Manson's song, Look At Your Game Girl is an amazing song. It's a really
4939120	4943680	good song. I don't think it's one of the greatest songs ever, but it happens that he wasn't a no
4943680	4950080	talent. And I don't know how Hitler was as an artist. Fiction, not bad.
4950720	4956480	Okay, we've got to get past this. We've got to get past this idea that we're going to purge
4956480	4961920	ourselves of our badness. And we're just going to, this is like, I liken it to teenage girls in
4961920	4968320	cutting. We're just, all we're doing is destroying ourselves in search of perfection. And the answer
4968320	4973440	is no, we're not perfect. We're flawed. We're screwed up. And we've always been this way.
4973440	4978000	And we're not going to silence everyone who you can point a laser beam at and say, well,
4978000	4983680	that person, look at how bad that person is. If we do that, kiss the whole thing goodbye.
4983680	4989520	We might as well just, let's learn Chinese. But there is an art to having those messy
4989520	4995280	conversations, whether with Alex or anybody else. Okay, let's talk about Alex. There's
4995360	4999920	particular stuff that Alex does that's absolutely nauseating. And there's other stuff that he's
4999920	5004560	doing that's funny. The methodology of the way he carries. And sometimes he's talking about the
5004560	5009520	truth. And sometimes he's talking about a conspiracy theory. His variance is incredibly high.
5010320	5014880	The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O'Keefe or the National Enquirer or anything you
5014880	5023840	don't like is to say, great, go long short. What's that mean? Well, if you invest in a mutual fund,
5023840	5028240	all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long. But if you invest in a hedge fund,
5028800	5033440	you do something called relative value trade. It's like, well, you long tech or short tech?
5034240	5041360	Well, actually, I'm long Microsoft and I'm short Google. Why is that? Oh, because I believe Google
5041360	5046960	got way too much attention and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned. And so this is really a
5046960	5054400	play on legacy tech over more modern tech. Okay. Which part of Alex Jones are you long?
5054400	5058160	And which part are you short? One of the things that should be a requirement for being a reporter
5058160	5064000	is like, what did Donald Trump do that was good? Nothing. Okay, then you're not a reporter.
5064960	5066240	What did Hitler do that was good?
5066800	5071120	The Rosenstrasza protest.
5074560	5078560	Non-Jewish women campaign for their Jewish men to be returned home to them
5079280	5085760	from certain death almost in death camps. It should have been that not there were no death camps.
5085760	5092000	It should have been that everybody was returned home. But you know what? The fact that the women
5092000	5096640	of the Rosenstrasza protest, I mean, sorry, I get very emotional about, you know, some of the
5096640	5107680	baddest ass chicks in the world got their husbands returned to them, colica vote. And not, not
5107680	5114160	celebrating Hitler, Hitler's the worst of the worst. But God damn it, you know, this idea
5114160	5119280	that we can just say everything that person does is a lie. Everything that person does is evil.
5119600	5127760	Evil. This reflects a simplicity of mind that humanity cannot afford. Is Google evil,
5127760	5132960	evil because it will sell you mine comp? Is Amazon evil because it will sell you mine comp?
5132960	5137040	If you find out that mine comp rests on somebody's bookshelves, do you have any idea what it means?
5138320	5143920	If you find out that a scholar used the N word, should that person lose their job? Come on,
5144800	5152240	grow the hell up. I guess our responsibility to lead by example in that, because you have to
5152240	5157040	acknowledge that the fact, like the current public discourse. Have somebody on your podcast
5157040	5164160	who you're worried about. But do it in a principled fashion. I mean, in other words,
5164160	5172240	I'm not here to whitewash everything. On the other hand, if somebody makes, you know, some
5172240	5178240	allegations, I don't know that I'm obligated to treat every set of allegations as if,
5179120	5183840	now, how do you defend yourself against the, no, allegations are so cheap to make at this moment.
5184480	5188160	Well, my, sort of my standard, I don't know, maybe you could speak to it is,
5188960	5192240	I don't care. Like in the case of Alex Jones, for example, I don't,
5193760	5199040	I'm willing to have a conversation with Alex Jones and people like him. If I know he's not
5199040	5202320	going to try to manipulate me. Assume that he is going to try to manipulate you.
5202320	5205200	I can't. Then, then we're not going to be two humans.
5205200	5210800	Okay. But Lex, I want you to think well of me. I put on a jacket. I don't usually wear a jacket.
5210800	5213120	Okay? Thank you, Eric.
5213120	5219120	All right. I'm trying to manipulate you. There's an entire field. No, there's an entire field
5219120	5223920	that says that speech may be best thought of as an attempt to manipulate each other.
5224960	5228480	This is too simplistic. Everything that we keep talking through.
5228480	5231440	Yes. You know better than this.
5231440	5234480	I disagree. I think, I think there is ways.
5235680	5241680	There's, of course, it's a gray area, but there is a threshold where your intent with
5241680	5249520	which you come to a meeting to an interaction is one that is not one that's grounded in like
5250240	5254480	a respect for a common humanity, like a love for each other as deeply messy.
5254480	5259680	If somebody is doing really bad stuff, I expect you to try to keep them from doing really bad
5259680	5267040	stuff. But, you know, just keep in mind that when I was a younger man, I saw an amazing
5267040	5273440	anti pornography documentary and it was called Rate It X and I don't know where it went.
5275040	5280560	But the conceit of it was we're going to get some pornographers in front of a camera because
5280560	5286080	they want to talk and we're going to ask them about what they do for a living and why it's okay.
5287840	5288880	No commentary.
5293040	5298560	Okay. You could potentially, if you really think Alex Jones is the worst, and again,
5298560	5308640	I'm not intimately familiar with him, you could decide to just let him talk.
5309520	5315280	Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people. You know, I've spoken to Stefan Molenu.
5315280	5321200	Stefan Molenu makes many good points, makes many bad points, and he makes many good points in bad
5321200	5327360	ways and I worry about it and I don't feel that it's not my obligation to make sure that
5327360	5334880	Stefan Molenu has a voice on the portal. But I did stand up and say I didn't want him banned
5334880	5340480	from social media and I do think that a lot of the people who are being banned from social media
5340480	5345920	were worried that they're right rather than that they're wrong. I certainly don't really think that
5345920	5351680	I'm worried in some sense that some of the really wrong people are wrong. But if you look at, for
5351680	5356400	example, Curtis Jarvin, there's a tremendous amount of interest. Is Eric going to speak to Curtis
5356400	5361840	Jarvin? Curtis Jarvin says many interesting things and he says many horrible, stupid things,
5361840	5370080	very provocative. And I haven't invited him onto the portal, but I haven't said I will never invite
5370080	5377600	him onto the portal. We are all in a difficult position. That's what I'm saying. I think it's
5377600	5383760	a much more difficult task and burden who carry it as people who have conversations because
5383760	5389920	Curtis Jarvin is a good example. How much work do I have to put in reading Curtis's work
5389920	5393840	to really understand? We should talk about the problem of Curtis Jarvin because I think it's
5393840	5398480	a problem to be illustrative. There's this big question as why does somebody who says such
5398480	5403760	stupid ass things listen to by so many people? Very smart people, people who are part of our
5403760	5410800	daily lives discuss Curtis Jarvin in hush tones. Now, it's a good question. My belief is that Curtis
5410800	5417440	Jarvin has made a number of very interesting provocative points and they associate Curtis
5417440	5423600	Jarvin as the person who has made these points and they treat the completely asinine stuff that
5423600	5431360	he says that's super dangerous as, well, that's Curtis. Right? Right. They give him the credit
5431360	5436960	for, he's kind of like, sorry to use the term, first principles, deep thinker about the way
5436960	5444160	the world, some space about the world. But as a result, we don't actually know why Curtis
5444160	5450320	Jarvin is knocking around so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives.
5451440	5455840	See, you said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff and that's the sense I got from
5455840	5460560	a few things I've read, not just about it. This is not just like Wikipedia stuff. Is he,
5460560	5465040	he's a little like I've said before, he seems to be careless.
5465600	5471840	I don't think he's careless. No, no, it's like Jim Watson. Jim Watson wants to say very provocative
5471840	5476800	things in order to prove that he's free. It's not a question of careless. He enjoys
5477760	5483440	the freedom to say these things. And the key point is, is that there's, I expect something
5483440	5489600	more of Curtis. I expect that if somebody is insightful about all sorts of things up to that
5489600	5495280	point, that they're going to have enough care. Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly
5495280	5501760	that vaccines are not 100% safe. Most people who have an idea that anybody is an anti-vaxxer
5501760	5507760	should be silenced, are in a position where they, they probably don't say vaccines are 100%
5507760	5512240	safe, but you keep finding that statement over and over again. Like believe all women, vaccines
5512240	5517760	are 100% safe. Climate science is settled science. Whatever this Montenegro is where you make
5517760	5525040	extraordinarily vapid blanket claims and then you retreat into something, well, defund the pull,
5525040	5530080	you know, we don't want no more police actually just means we want the police to
5530960	5537600	not take on mental health duties. We've come up with an incredibly disingenuous society.
5537600	5544880	And what I'm claiming is, is that I might talk to Curtis Yardvin, but I have really very little
5544880	5550160	interest to talk to a guy who seems to be kind of giddy about who makes good slaves and who makes
5550160	5556880	bad slaves. It's like, why do I want to do that on the portal? One, first of all, because just as
5556880	5563600	you said, that's not Curtis's main thing. He has a lot of ideas and the, what I've read of him,
5563600	5570480	which is not a huge amount, is there's, he's very thoughtful about the way this world works.
5570480	5577120	And on top of that, he's an important historical figure in the birth and the development of the
5577120	5582480	alt-right or what would be called the alt-right. The new reaction. Yeah. And there's, so he's in
5582560	5588080	just an important intellectual. And so it makes sense to talk to him. The question is,
5588880	5593920	how much work do you put in? Well, this is the issue of Fugu. I'm not a chef
5593920	5600880	that necessarily can serve that Fugu. So you have, you have a puffer fish. You can eat the puffer
5600880	5605600	fish. You can, you can get a kind of a tingly sensation on your tongue if you get a little bit
5605600	5611200	of the poison organ. But my point is, I don't know how to serve Curtis Yardvin. Yeah. So that,
5611280	5617200	in fact, I'm not worried about what happens. But I believe that if somebody else was a student
5617200	5622880	of the new reactionary movement, that person might be in a better position to host Curtis Yardvin.
5622880	5626640	So somebody, that's a really good example. Somebody I think you've spoken with,
5627520	5632640	that's an intermediary. That's a powerful one is Michael Malis. And he's spoken with Curtis Yardvin.
5632640	5638000	And Michael wrote a book about. By the way, Michael somewhat changed my mind about Michael Malis.
5638640	5645280	I'm glad he did. I think I would call him a friend. And I think he's a underneath it all
5646960	5652560	really kind human being. And I think your skepticism about him was initially from a surface level of
5652560	5657120	what did you call him hyenas, the trolls and so on. I'm not happy about his.
5657280	5668720	It's been so long since I've seen good trolls. Yes. So he needs higher quality of trolling,
5668720	5677200	but he aspires to that. I mean, it, you know, disagree or not. I really enjoy how much care
5677200	5682160	he puts into the work he does, like on North Korea and the study of the world,
5682160	5689600	and how much privately, but also in public love he has for people, especially those who are powerless.
5690160	5696560	Just a genuine admiration for them. But I think Curtis actually,
5697200	5701440	does too. I don't know. I mean, you have to appreciate the first time I met Curtis,
5701440	5704720	he introduced me, he says, I'm the most right-wing person you've ever met.
5705360	5708000	I was just like, well, this is a conversation that's already over.
5708000	5713920	It's theatrical in a way that's not conductive to actually having a real connection.
5713920	5718000	Well, it just, it turned me so, it turned me off because it was like,
5718000	5721440	you need to be the most right-wing person. And so it's like, I'm a troll, I'm a troll.
5722160	5723840	Yeah. Okay. Why are we doing this?
5723840	5728720	Yeah. But what I'm trying to get at is different. I'm trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend
5728720	5732560	of yours. If you found out something terrible, you should still be a friend.
5732560	5736480	You should still continue to be his friend. And in Michael Malice's case,
5736480	5740080	it's very likely that we'll find out something. Curtis is an acquaintance of mine,
5740080	5745600	because he hangs around with some people that I know. I did not get it. I've started to understand
5745600	5752800	why the people in my life, some of them are Curtis Yarvin fans. Many of them disregard the stupid
5752800	5760160	stuff. But my feeling is, is that too much poison organ, not enough fish. I don't know how to serve
5760160	5765280	that too intermingled. I'm not your chef. Speaking for defending your friends, staying with your
5765280	5774080	friends and bringing the old band together again, you coined the term IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.
5775280	5782880	I like it. It represents a certain group of people that are struggling with, that are almost like
5784560	5790640	challenged the norms of social and political discourse from all different angles.
5790640	5796480	Right. What do you think is the state of the IDW? What do you think is its future? Is it still
5797200	5803920	a useful? Well, it never exists. Is it a protocol? Is it a collection of people featured in an article?
5803920	5809520	What I learned very clearly is that there's a tremendous desire in the internet age to pin
5809520	5814640	people down. Well, what do you say? Who's in it? What are the criteria? It's like, I understand.
5815440	5819760	You want to play the demarcation game and you want to make everything that is demarcated
5819840	5827280	instantly null and void. No, thank you. I resisted saying who was in it. I resisted saying what it
5827280	5835760	was. I resisted saying that Barry Weiss's article was the definitive thing. They chose a ridiculous
5835760	5840400	concept for the photographs that we couldn't get out of. I did not want those photographs taken.
5840400	5844640	They decided that the Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer needed to take them all at twilight.
5845040	5851680	I didn't even necessarily want to do the article. Barry convinced me that it was the right thing
5851680	5859520	to do. Undoubtedly, Barry was right. I was wrong. But the key point is nothing can grow in this
5859520	5867360	environment. There's a reason we're not building. It does not appear that we found a way to grow
5867360	5872880	anything organic and good and decent that we need right now. That's the key issue.
5872880	5877840	Who's the weed? Do you mean us as a society? Those of us who wish to have a future for our
5877840	5883760	great grandchildren. Let's take the subset of people who are worried about things long after
5883760	5892160	their demise. Do you think it's useful to have a term like the IDW to capture some set of people,
5893040	5903120	some set of ideas or maybe principles that capture what I think the IDW... Okay, you can say it's
5903120	5907760	not supposed to me. It doesn't exist. It doesn't mean anything. But to the public, to me. Okay,
5907760	5917360	I'll just speak to me. It represented something. I think I said this to you. In my first attempt
5917360	5923440	to interview the great Eric Weinstein, I said that I spoke about you, but IDW in general is
5923440	5927280	trying to point out the elephant in the room or that the emperor has no clothes. The set of people
5927280	5933040	that do that in their own way. If there are multiple elephants in the room. Yes. The point is that
5933040	5938480	the IDW was more interested in seeing the totality of elephants and trying to figure out how do we
5938480	5942400	move forward as opposed to saying I can spot the other guy's elephant in the room, but I can't see
5942400	5951280	my own. In large measure, we didn't represent an institutional base. Therefore, it wasn't
5951280	5956480	maximally important that we look at our own hypocrisy because we weren't on the institutional
5957120	5962880	spectrum. This is where friendship comes into play with the different figures that are loosely
5962880	5973760	associated with IDW is you are somehow responsible for the exact thing that you said. Did you hear
5973760	5982240	what Sam Harris said about IDW? Yeah. That kind of thing. I chuckled.
5983680	5990880	Lovingly or chuckled? I was angry at some people who had said things that caused Sam to say what Sam
5990880	5998320	said about turning his imaginary club membership into the IDW. People said very silly things and
5999280	6006640	I think that there is just this confusion that integrity means calling out your friends in
6006640	6014320	front of the world. I've been pretty clear about this. I try to choose my friends carefully and
6014320	6019120	if you would like to recuse me because I'm not a source of reliable information, people that I
6019120	6025600	know and love the most, maybe that's reasonable for you. Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing
6025600	6031440	to throw a friend under the bus at the first sign of trouble. By all means, exit my feed.
6031440	6038240	You don't have to subscribe to me. If that's your concept of integrity, you're barking up the wrong
6038240	6042720	tree. What I will say is that I knew these people well enough to know that they're all flawed.
6043680	6053520	Thank you for the callback. But the issue is that I love people who are flawed and I love
6053520	6061360	people who have to earn a living even if you call them a grifter. I love people who like the fact
6061360	6066960	that Donald Trump didn't get us into new wars even if you call them alt-right. I love the fact that
6067200	6074480	some people believe in structural oppression and want to fight it even if they're not woke
6074480	6077200	because they don't believe that structural oppression is hiding everywhere.
6078880	6084000	I care and love different people in different ways and I think that the overarching thing
6084000	6090000	like so we're not getting at is that we were sold a bill of goods that you can go through life
6090960	6098560	like an Eliza program with pre-programmed responses. Well, it's what aboutism? It's both
6098560	6105280	sidesism. It's alt-right. It's the loony left. It's campus madness. It's like, okay,
6105280	6113600	why don't you just empty the entire goddamn magazine? All of those pre-recorded
6114480	6123600	snips. Now that you've done all of that, now we can have a conversation. Your son put it
6124320	6132880	really well, which is we should in all things resist labels. But we can't deal without labels.
6132880	6139440	We have to generalize, but we also have to keep in mind that just in the way in science,
6139440	6145280	you deal with an effective theory that isn't a fundamental one. In science, most of our theories
6145280	6152320	we consider to be effective theories. If I generalize about Europe, about women, about
6154320	6161600	Christians, those things have to be understood to mean something and not to have their
6161680	6170480	definitions extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all, nor that they're so rigid that
6170480	6176880	their claims that clearly won't bear scrutiny. Lex, what do you really want to talk about? That's
6176880	6183120	always my question to you. That always gets me. Maybe you are the therapist. But you and I could
6183120	6189280	talk about people love up until now at least. People have loved listening to the two of us in
6189280	6197520	conversation. My feeling is that we're not talking about neural nets. We're not talking
6197520	6203920	about geometric unity. We're not talking about where distributed computing might go. I don't
6203920	6210400	think that we're really focused on some of the most exciting things we could do to transform
6210400	6216240	education. We're still caught in this world of other people that we don't belong in. I don't
6216240	6223200	belong in the world as it's been created. I'm trying to build a new world and I'm astounded
6223200	6227680	that the people with the independent means to help build that world are so demotivated
6228640	6234320	that they don't want to build new structures. The people who do want to build new structures
6234320	6238960	seem to be wild-eyed. Wild-eyed? What do you mean by wild-eyed? They're not.
6238960	6244560	I guarantee you that I will get some message in my DMs. It says, hey, Eric, I'm a third-year
6245280	6252400	chemistry student at South Dakota State and I've got a great idea. I just need funding.
6252400	6256320	I want to build... They don't have the means. The people who have the means have become...
6256320	6262160	Or the sophistication. It's like you're looking for somebody who's proven themselves a few times
6262160	6269120	to say, I've got $4 billion behind me that soft-circled. I want to figure out what a new
6269120	6274240	university would be and what it would take to protect academic freedom and who we would hire
6274240	6277840	and what are the different characteristics because I can clearly see that everything
6277840	6283440	following the current model is falling apart. Nobody in my understanding is saying that.
6283440	6292240	Nobody is saying, let's take that which is functioning independently and make it less
6292240	6298880	vulnerable. Let's boost those signals. A critical component as money, you think?
6298880	6303920	It's not only that, but it's also a kind of... These people are mobbed up hands-off.
6303920	6310240	Let's imagine for the moment that Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg
6312880	6322800	founded a university-come-social-media entity. They said, the purpose of this is to make sure
6322800	6326960	that academic freedom will not perish from this earth because it's necessary to keep us from
6326960	6333600	all going crazy. We are going to lock ourselves out. We've come up with this governance system.
6334480	6340400	The idea is that these people will be assigned the difficult task of making sure that society
6340400	6344640	doesn't go crazy in any particular direction, that we have a fact-based, reality-based,
6345520	6351120	feasibility-based understanding. We can try to figure out where our real opportunities are.
6351520	6359680	It feels like everybody with the ability to do something like that and with the brains and
6359680	6367440	experience and the resources would rather sit in the current system and hope to figure out
6367440	6369600	where they can flee to if the whole thing comes apart.
6370800	6376960	Maybe to push back on a little bit. I agree with you, but it feels like some people are
6376960	6384160	trying that. For example, Google purchased DeepMind. DeepMind is a company that represents a lot of
6384160	6390080	radical ideas. They've become acceptable, actually. AGI, Artificial General Intelligence,
6390080	6398080	used to be really radical of a thing to talk about. DeepMind and OpenAI are two places
6398080	6404880	which has made it more acceptable. I know you can now start to criticize, well, they're really,
6404880	6408720	now that it's become acceptable, they're not taking the further stuff would be more and more
6408720	6416640	radical. But that was an attempt by Google to say that let's try some wild stuff.
6417440	6418880	Sort of like Boston Dynamics.
6419440	6427680	Sort of like Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics is a really good example of trying radical ideas
6427680	6432720	for perhaps no purpose whatsoever except to try to try out their ideas.
6433520	6439280	The idea is that innovation is like dessert. You can have dessert after you solve
6440240	6444000	the problem of the main course. The main course is a bunch of insoluble problems.
6445280	6449520	We can get into innovation once we perfect ourselves.
6449520	6453360	And you're saying that we need to make innovation the main meal.
6453360	6459040	Well, I'm saying that there really is structural pressure. If you train
6462960	6467280	a deep learning system on exclusively white faces, it's going to get confused.
6467840	6472400	So let's not disagree that there are real issues around this. In fact,
6473440	6478800	that's an issue of innovation and data. Your data should be responsive. On the other hand,
6478800	6483680	there are things we can't do anything about that are actually fundamental.
6486560	6492480	Those things may have to do with the fact that some of us taste cilantro as soap
6493360	6498160	and some of us don't. There are differences between people and some of them are in the
6498160	6502640	hardware, some of them are in the firmware, some of them are in the software that is the human mind.
6503520	6513040	And this completely simplistic idea that every failure of an organization to promote
6513760	6516960	each person who has particular intersexual characteristics,
6518160	6525440	we cannot hold progress hostage to that. And you've talked about, perhaps we'll
6525440	6529360	save this for another time because it's such a fascinating conversation. You talked about this
6529360	6535440	with Glenn Beck is the whole stagnation of growth and all that kind of stuff. Your idea is that
6536080	6543040	in as much as the current situation is a kind of Ponzi scheme, the current situation in the United
6543040	6550880	States is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise of constant unending innovation, we need
6551840	6563200	to fund the true innovators and encourage them and empower them and sort of culturally say
6563200	6567440	that this is what this country is about is the brilliant minds.
6567440	6573120	We're going to kill each other if we don't grow. Growth is like an immune system
6574560	6578640	and you always have pathogens present, but if you don't have growth present, you can't fight the
6578640	6582560	pathogens in your society. And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere.
6583600	6589600	So if we don't get growth into our system fairly quickly, we are in really seriously bad shape.
6590640	6596480	So it's very important that if I had a horrible person who was capable of building something
6596480	6601920	that would give us all a certain amount of what I've called financial beta to some new technology
6601920	6607600	where we all benefit, let's say quantum computing comes in and everybody, the dry cleaner has a
6607600	6615600	quantum computing angle. That's necessary to keep this system that we built going.
6615600	6620240	We can try to redesign the system, but our system expects growth and we've started
6620240	6624960	started for growth and the madness that we're seeing is the failure of our immune system to
6624960	6629600	be able to handle the pathogens that have always been present. So people can say, well,
6629600	6632960	this was always there. Yes, it was. What's changed was your immune system.
6633120	6641680	We have got to make sure that one, we understand why diversity is potentially really important.
6643120	6646880	We have mined certain communities to death. You and I are Ashkenazi Jews.
6647600	6650880	Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews are good at technical stuff.
6652240	6656560	We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff. The Indians have many people who are good
6656640	6663920	at technical stuff as the Japanese. I also believe that we have communities where if you
6663920	6668560	think about the Pareto idea of diminishing returns, if you've never mined a community,
6669600	6672160	many of the people you're going to get at the beginning are going to be amazing
6672720	6677440	because that community, it's like, did you drill for more oil in Texas? Texas is pretty
6677440	6683840	thoroughly picked over. Do you find some place that's completely insane? Maybe there's oil there.
6683840	6692080	Who knows? In particular, I would like to displace our reliance on our military competitors in Asia
6692080	6698880	in our scientific laboratories with women, with African-Americans, with Latinos, people who are
6698880	6703280	in different categories than we have traditionally sourced. And I would like to get them the money
6704080	6710880	that the market would normally give these fields were we not using visas in place of payment.
6711840	6721760	Now, I have a crazy idea which is that you and I both play music and I find the analytic work
6721760	6725520	that I do when I'm trying to figure out chord progressions and symmetries and tritones and
6725520	6729040	all these sorts of things to be very similar to the work that I do when I do physics or math.
6730720	6737440	I believe that one of the things that is true is that the analytic contributions of African-Americans
6737520	6745120	to music are probably fungible to science. I don't know that that's true. It's true. I haven't done
6745120	6750320	controlled research, but I believe that it is very important to let the People's Republic of China
6750320	6756720	know that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore and that we need to look to our own people.
6756720	6761360	And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit from making sure that women,
6761440	6770080	black Americans, Latinos, are in a position to take over some of these things because many of
6770080	6775600	these communities have been underutilized. Now, I don't know if that's an insane idea. I want to
6775600	6780640	hear somebody tell me why it's an insane idea, but I believe that part of what we need to do
6780640	6785600	is we need to recognize that there are security issues. There are geopolitical issues with the
6785600	6791600	funding of science and that what we've done is we've starved our world for innovation. And if we
6791600	6795920	don't get back to the business of innovation, we should be doing diversity and inclusion out of
6795920	6802560	greed rather than guilt. Now, part of the problem with this is that a lot of the energy behind
6802560	6809600	diversity and inclusion is based on guilt and accusation. And what I want is I want to kick
6809600	6815360	ass. And my hope is that diminishing returns favors mining the communities that have not
6815360	6822480	been traditionally mined in order to extract output from those communities, unless there's a
6822480	6827120	flaw in that plan. If there's a flaw, somebody needs to tell me. If there isn't a flaw, we need
6827120	6833440	to get greedy about innovation rather than guilty about innovation. That's really brilliantly put.
6833440	6839680	My biggest problem with what I see is, it exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity.
6839680	6845920	It's used when it's grounded in guilt. It's then used as a hammer to shame people that don't care
6845920	6853600	about diversity enough. F that shit. Okay. So my point is, I'm excited about the idea of Jimi
6853600	6860160	Hendrix doing quantum field theory. I'm excited about the idea of art Tatum trying to figure out
6861520	6869120	what the neural nets figured out about protein folding. I have some idea of the level of intellect
6869200	6874080	of people who have not found their way into STEM subjects in incredibly technically demanding
6874080	6879200	areas. And if there's a flaw in that theory, I want somebody to present the flaw.
6880000	6887280	But right now, my belief is that these things are merit based. And if you really believe in
6887280	6891840	structural oppression, you do not want an affirmative action program. You want to make
6891840	6897440	sure that people have huge amounts of resources to get themselves into position. I want to push
6897440	6903600	out. I just tried this on this clubhouse application. I want to push out Klein bottles as a secret sign
6904480	6910320	inside of rap videos in hip hop. I want people to have an idea that there's an amazing world.
6910320	6916480	And I want to get the people who hopefully I'm trying to lure into science and engineering.
6916480	6921440	I want to get them paid. I don't want them as the cheap substitutes for the fleeing
6922080	6928320	white males who've learned that they can't make any money in science and engineering.
6929200	6936080	So the problem is that we need to take over the ship, Lex. And it doesn't need to be you and me
6936080	6940080	because, quite honestly, I have no desire to administer. I don't want to be the chief executive
6940080	6946240	officer of anything. What I do want is I want the baby boomers who've made this mess and can't see it
6947200	6956320	to be gone. They had almost all of our universities. And I want fresh blood, fresh resources. I want
6956320	6963680	academic freedom. And I want greed for our country and for the future to determine diversity inclusion
6963680	6970400	as opposed to shame and guilt, which is destroying our fabric. That's as good of a diversity statement
6970400	6977920	as I've ever heard. This is a U-turn, but somebody commented on the tweet you sent
6978640	6984480	that as one of the top comments, they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency. So it's a
6984480	6991200	U-turn, but not really. Since you're an economist, since you're deep, not an economist, you...
6991200	6997440	I mean, I pretend to be an economist hoping that the economists will take issue that I'm not an
6997440	7002720	economist so that I can advance gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics, which the economics
7002720	7008720	profession has failed to acknowledge was a major innovation that happened approximately 25 years
7008720	7013600	ago. I don't think that economists understand what a price index is that measures inflation,
7013600	7022000	nor do I think economists understand what a growth index or a product quantity index is
7022800	7029280	that measures GDP. I think that they don't even understand the basics of price and quantity
7029280	7037440	index construction. And therefore, they can't possibly review field theoretic economics. They
7037440	7042320	can't review gauge theoretic economics. They're intellectually not in a position to manage their
7042320	7047600	own field. You talked about that there's a stagnation in growth currently. I looked at,
7047600	7053600	from my microeconomics, macroeconomics and college perspective, GDP doesn't seem to capture
7054640	7063760	the productivity, the full spectrum of what I think is a functioning, successful society.
7063760	7070480	What do you think is broken about GDP? What does it need to include at these indices?
7071360	7073600	Let me explain what they don't understand to begin with.
7073600	7084320	Sure. Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output are the same at the end of a year as
7084320	7089840	they are at the beginning. And you ask, what happened during that year? Was there inflation?
7091040	7095440	They meandered over the course of the year, but miraculously, they all came back to exactly their
7095440	7102160	values. The amount produced at the end of the year is the same as at the beginning in every
7102160	7107760	single quantity. Typically, the claim would be that the price index should be 1.0 and that the
7107760	7119920	quantity index should be 1.0. That's clearly wrong. Right. Well, it speaks to a fundamental
7119920	7124800	confusion that economists have. They don't understand that the economy is curved and not flat.
7125520	7131200	In a curved economy, everything should be path dependence, but they view path dependence as a
7131200	7136480	problem because they are effectively the flat earth society of market analysis. They don't
7136480	7140480	understand that what they've called, and they've actually called it the cycling problem,
7141280	7146080	is exactly what they need to understand to advance their field. So I'll give you a very
7146080	7153200	simple example. Let's imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund and Ted and Alice
7154000	7164800	in another. In both cases, the females that is Alice and Carol are the chief investment officers,
7166080	7171920	and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers in charge of trying to get money into the fund
7171920	7183040	and trying to get people not to, in fact, remove their money from the funds. If you, in fact, had
7185760	7192160	Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, and both hedge funds were invested in assets whose prices came
7192160	7200880	back to the same levels and whose exposures were in the same quantities, and you wanted to
7200880	7206560	compensate these two hedge funds, would you compensate them the same necessarily? What if,
7206560	7214960	for example, Carol was killing it in terms of investments? Every time she bought some sort
7214960	7224720	of security, the price of that security went up. But Bob was the worst marketing officer,
7225280	7229840	and as chief marketing officer, there were tons of redemptions because Bob was constantly drunk,
7230880	7237360	Bob was making off-color comments. Now, as a result, at the end of the year, the fund hasn't
7237360	7242000	grown in size because even though Carol was crushing it in terms of the investments,
7243120	7248720	Bob was screwing up everything and the redemptions were legendary, so people were making money and
7248720	7257360	still pulling it out of the fund. In the other fund, Alice can't seem to buy a base hit every
7257360	7264080	time she gets into a security, the thing plummets, but Ted's amazing marketing skills allowed
7264880	7269840	the fund to get all sorts of new subscriptions and halted the redemptions as people hoped that
7269840	7281680	the fund would get its act together. Okay. Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated,
7282640	7294160	and quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted are compensated. So even though both funds
7294160	7300400	had closed loops that come back to the original states, what happened during the period that
7300400	7304080	they were active tells you how people are supposed to be compensated.
7304480	7312880	Now, we know that whatever the increase in the price index is, is compensated by a decrease
7313600	7319440	in the quantity index or conversely because prices and quantities return to their original values.
7320000	7324160	You could have another fund where nothing much happened, there were no redemptions, no subscriptions,
7325040	7329280	prices, the fund remained in cash the whole time. So in that third fund,
7330240	7337120	you know, let's call that Tristan and Izalda, that fund should have no bonuses paid because
7337120	7343440	nobody did anything, but nobody should be fired either. Now, the fact that economists don't even
7343440	7348400	understand that this is what their price and quantity indices were intended to do, that they
7348400	7353280	don't understand that you can actually give what would be called ordinal agents, the freedom to
7353280	7360480	change their preferences and still have something defined as a conus cost of living adjustment.
7361280	7363840	They don't even understand the mathematics of their field.
7363840	7368000	So the indices need to be able to capture some kind of dynamics that-
7368000	7374080	We have had indices that capture these dynamics due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925.
7375280	7379840	But the economists have not even understood what de Vizier's index truly represents.
7379920	7384000	What do you miss with such crude indices then?
7384000	7388240	Well, you miss the fact that you're supposed to have a field theoretic subject.
7389120	7393760	The representative consumer should actually be a probability distribution on the space of all
7393760	7398480	possible consumers weighted by the probability of getting any particular pull from the distribution.
7399600	7405840	We should not have a single gauge of inflation. What is that in 1973 dollars? Any more than you
7405840	7410960	should be able to say it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday.
7412000	7418160	So when we get to the cryptocurrency, what I'm going to say is that because we didn't
7418160	7423920	found economic theory on the proper marginal revolution, because we missed the major opportunity,
7423920	7429600	which is that the differential calculus of markets is gauge theory. It's not ordinary
7430400	7437040	differential calculus. We found that out in finance that it was stochastic differential
7437040	7442240	calculus. We have the wrong version of the differential calculus underneath all of modern
7442240	7447440	economic theory. And part of what I've been pushing for in cryptocurrencies is the idea
7447440	7453760	that we should be understanding that gold is a gauge theory, just as modern economic theory is
7453760	7459360	supposed to be a gauge theory, and that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies, and more
7459360	7465840	importantly, distributed computing, from the problem of this unwanted global aspect, which is
7465840	7471440	the blockchain. The thing that is most celebrated in some sense about Bitcoin is in fact the reason
7471440	7476240	that I'm least enthusiastic about it. I'm hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did.
7477920	7483520	But it's an intermediate step towards trying to figure out what should digital gold actually be.
7483600	7491680	If physical gold is a collection of up quarks and down quarks in the form of protons and neutrons
7492400	7497920	held together, the quarks by gluons with electrons orbiting it held together by photons with the
7497920	7503920	occasional weak interaction beta decay, all of those are gauge theories. So gold is actually
7504480	7510080	coming from gauge theory, and markets are coming from gauge theory, and the opportunity to do
7510160	7514800	locally enforced conservation laws, which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is,
7515840	7521680	should theoretically be founded on a different principle that is not the blockchain. It should
7521680	7528960	be a gauge theoretic concept in which effectively the tokens are excitations on a network of computer
7528960	7538000	nodes. And the fact that, let's imagine that this is some token, by moving it from my custodianship
7538000	7544000	to your custodianship, effectively, I pushed that glass as a gauge theory towards your region of the
7544000	7550720	table. We should be recognizing the gauge theory is the correct differential calculus for the 21st
7550720	7554400	century. In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century. You're saying it captures these
7554400	7563520	individual dynamics. Why should my giving you a token have to be, why should we alert the global
7563520	7568800	community in this token that that occurred? You can talk about side change. You can talk about any
7568800	7573200	means of doing this. But effectively, we have a problem, which is if I think about this differently,
7573840	7580960	I have a glass that is extant. You have a glass that is absent. We're supposed to call
7580960	7586720	the constructor method on your glass at the same moment we call the destructor method on my glass
7586720	7591200	in order to have a conservation principle. It would be far more efficient to do this
7592000	7596960	with the one system that is known never to throw an exception, which is nature.
7596960	7600480	And nature has chosen gauge theory and geometry for her underlying language.
7601360	7607280	We now know due to work of Pia Malani at Harvard in economics in the mid 1990s,
7608080	7615280	which I was her co-author on. But I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea.
7616240	7622880	We know that modern economic theory is a naturally occurring gauge theory. And the failure of that
7622880	7628080	community to acknowledge that that work occurred and that it was put down for reasons that make no
7628080	7634880	analytic sense is important in particular due to the relatively new innovation of distributed
7634880	7640080	computing and Satoshi's brainchild. So you're thinking we need to have the mathematics that
7640080	7645360	captures, that enforces cryptocurrency as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized
7645360	7650080	one where the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized.
7650080	7658320	The abundance economy much discussed in Silicon Valley or what's left of it is actually a huge
7658320	7663520	threat to the planet because what it really is is that it is what Mark Andreessen is called
7663520	7668000	software eating the world. And what that means is that you're going to push things from being
7668080	7672480	private goods and services into public goods and services. And public goods and services cannot
7672480	7679520	have price and value tied together. Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value to the
7679520	7683920	world that they cannot command a price and they will not be able to capture the value that they
7683920	7689680	have created or a significant enough fraction of it. The abundance economy is a disaster.
7689680	7696560	It will lead to a reduction in human freedom. The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced
7696640	7704080	or semi locally enforced conservation laws where the idea is why is gold hard to
7704080	7708320	create or destroy? It's because it's created not only in stars but in violent events involving
7708320	7716880	stars like supernova collisions. When gold is created and we transact, we're using conservation
7716880	7723840	laws, the physics determines the custodianship, whatever it is that I don't have, you now have
7723920	7730800	and conversely. In such a situation, we should be looking for the abstraction that most closely
7730800	7734560	matches the physical world because the physical world is known not to throw an exception.
7735120	7741280	The blockchain is a vulnerability. The idea that the 51% problem isn't solved, that you could have
7741280	7748240	crazy race conditions, all of these things, we know that they're solved inside of gauge theory
7748240	7755040	somehow. So the important thing is to recognize that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever
7755040	7761120	in the history of economic theory took place already and was essentially instantly buried
7761840	7767440	and I will stand by those comments. Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you.
7768240	7774960	Are you Satoshi? No. No, no, I don't have that kind of ability. I really don't. I do other things.
7775200	7781280	Speaking of Satoshi and gauge theory, you've mentioned to Brian Keating
7783280	7789280	that you may be releasing a geometric community paper this year or some other form of additional
7789280	7795520	material on the topic. What is your thinking around this? What's the process you're going
7795520	7801920	through now? Well, it's very interesting. I used April 1st to try to start a tradition,
7801920	7809360	which I hope to use to liberate mankind. The tradition is that at least one day a year,
7810080	7815520	you should be able to say heretical things and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off
7815520	7819280	or Mark Zuckerberg. Your provost shouldn't call you up and say, what did you say?
7820560	7828640	We need at some level to have a jubilee from centralized control. And so my hope is that
7828640	7832480	you know what a tradition is in America, something a baby boomer did twice.
7835760	7845360	Impeachment? That's very funny. Anyway, so I'm not a baby boomer, but as an exer,
7846480	7852640	I thought about whether or not April 1st would be a good date on which to release a printed version
7852640	7857520	of what I already said in lecture form, because I think it's hysterically funny that the physics
7857520	7865840	community claims that it can't decode a lecture. Yeah. It must be paper. And you know what? There
7865840	7870880	will be a steady stream of new complaints up until the point that they fit it into a narrative that
7870880	7879600	they like. Yeah, I'm thinking about April 1st as a date in which to release a document and it won't
7879600	7886880	be perfectly complete, but it'll be very complete. And then they'll try to say, it's wrong or you
7886880	7893520	already did it or no, that was dumb, but what we just did on top of it is brilliant. Or it doesn't
7893520	7899440	match experiment or who knows what, they'll go through all of their usual nonsense. It's time to go.
7900160	7905680	Is there still puzzles in your own mind that need to be figured out for you to try to put it on
7905680	7911680	paper? I mean, those are different mediums, right? It was a great question. I did not count on something
7911680	7917920	that turns out to be important. When you work on your own outside of the system for a long time,
7918720	7925520	you probably don't think you're going to be doing this as a 55-year-old man. And I have been so long
7925520	7929280	outside of math and physics departments and I've been occupied with so many other things, as you
7929280	7938080	can see, that the old idea that I had was if I always did it in little pieces, then I was always
7938080	7945200	safe because it wouldn't be steelable. And so now those pieces never got assembled completely.
7946000	7954000	In essence, I have all the pieces and I can fit them together, but there's probably a small amount
7954000	7959520	of glue code. There are a few algebraic things I've forgotten how to do. I may or may not figure
7959520	7964720	them out between now and April 1st, but it's pretty complete. But that's the puzzle you're kind of
7965680	7970720	struggling to now figure out to get it all in the same, the glue together.
7970720	7975120	I can't tell you whether the theory is correct or incorrect. But for example,
7975120	7980320	there's what's the exact form of the supersymmetry algebra or what's the rule for passing a minus
7980320	7986320	sign through a particular operator. And all of that stuff got a lot more difficult because I didn't
7987920	7994640	do it. Look, it's a little bit like if you're a violinist and you don't touch
7994640	7999840	your violin regularly for 15 years, you come back to it and you pretty much know the pieces
7999840	8003280	sort of, but there's lots of stuff that's missing. Your tone is off and that kind of stuff.
8003920	8010160	I would say I'll get the ship to the harbor and it'll require a tugboat probably to get it in.
8010160	8014400	And if the tugboat doesn't show up, then I'll pilot the thing right into the dock myself.
8014400	8017760	But it's not a big deal. I think that it is essentially complete.
8018480	8024720	Psychologically, just as a human being, this is, I remember perhaps by accident,
8025440	8031280	but maybe there's no accidents in the universe, I was tuned in, I don't remember where,
8031280	8040400	on April 1st, to you, oh, I think in your discord, kind of thinking about thinking through this
8040400	8045360	release. I mean, it wasn't like, it wasn't obvious that you were going to do it. You were thinking
8045360	8050640	through it. And I remember there was intellectual, personal, psychological struggle with this.
8050640	8055520	Yeah. Well, because I thought it was dangerous. If this turns out to be right, I don't know what
8055520	8065680	it unlocks. If it's wrong, I think I understand where we are. If it's wrong, it'll be the first
8067280	8070720	fool's gold that really looks like a theory of everything.
8070880	8078320	It'll be the iron pyrides of physics. And we haven't even had fool's gold, in my opinion yet.
8079520	8087520	Got it. So what is your intuition, why this looks right to you? Why it feels like it would be,
8088320	8092320	if wrong, the first fool's gold? I can say it very simply. It's way smarter than I am.
8093200	8098080	Can you break that apart a little more? Every time you poke at it, it's giving you intuitions
8098080	8102320	that follow with the currently known fit. Well, let's put it in computer science terms.
8102320	8107280	Yes, please. Okay. There's a concept of technical debt that computer scientists struggle with.
8107840	8111360	As you commit crimes, you have to pay those crimes back at a later date.
8112480	8118320	In general, most of the problem with physical theories is that as you try to do something
8118320	8124400	that matches reality, you usually have to go into some structure that gets you farther away.
8125040	8128160	And your hope is that you're going to be able to pay back the technical debt.
8128160	8134560	And in general, these wind up as checkkiting schemes, or like you're funding a startup and
8134560	8143040	there are too many pivots. So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover things that have gone
8143040	8153680	wrong. My belief is that this thing represents something like a summit to me. And I'm very
8153680	8162160	proud of having found a route up this summit. But the route is what's due to me. The summit
8162160	8172480	can't possibly be due to me. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norge did not create Mount Everest.
8173040	8177680	They know that they didn't create that. They figured out a way up.
8178640	8184320	You got to tell me what Mount Everest is in this metaphor and also connected to the technical
8184320	8190800	debt. So technical debt is a negative thing that you'll eventually have to pay it. Are you
8190800	8197520	saying in the ascent that you're seeing now in the theory is you do not have much technical debt?
8197520	8200480	Well, that's right. I think that what happens is that early on,
8200960	8211200	what I would say is, I believe now that the physics community has said many things incorrectly
8211920	8216560	about the current state of the universe. They're not wildly off, which is why,
8217600	8222080	like for example, the claim is that there are three generations of matter. I do not believe
8222080	8225200	that there are three generations of matter. I believe that there are two generations of matter.
8225200	8233040	And there's a third collection that looks like a generation of matter as the first two,
8233040	8239440	only at low energy. Okay, well, that's not a frequent claim. People imagine that there are
8239440	8244240	three or more generations of matter. I would claim that that's false. People claim that the matter
8244240	8250240	is chiral, that is, it knows it's left from its right. I would claim that the chirality is not
8250240	8256560	fundamental, but it is emergent. We could keep going at all these sorts of things. People think
8256560	8262640	that space time is the fundamental geometrical construct. I do not agree. I think it's something
8262640	8271680	that I've termed the observers. All of these different things represent a series of over
8271680	8280560	interpretations of the world that preclude progress. So you gave, I think you gave some
8280560	8286080	credit to string theory as string theory, I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly,
8286800	8293280	as like getting close to the fool's gold. Well, I've said that Garrett Leasy,
8293280	8300480	Garrett Leasy, phenomenologically gets a lot of things right. He's got a reason for chirality,
8300480	8306560	a reason for uniqueness using E8. In fact, E8 uses something called vial fermions, which are chiral.
8307840	8316560	He has a way of getting geometry to get Riemann's geometry underneath general relativity to play with
8316560	8320240	Eris Mann's geometry, which is underneath the standard model using something called
8320240	8325840	Cartan connections that are out of favor. He's figured out something involving super connections
8325840	8330640	to make sure that the fermion, the matter in the system isn't quantized the same way as the
8330640	8335840	bosons were, which is a problem in his old theory. He's got something about three generations for
8335840	8341680	triality. He's got a lot of phenomenological hits. I don't think Garrett's theory works. It also has a
8341680	8346160	very simple Lagrangian. He's basically using the Yang-Mills norm squared, the same thing you would
8346160	8355680	use as a cost function if you were doing neural nets. The string theorists have a different
8355680	8360720	selling point, which is that they may have gotten a renormalizable theory of gravity if quantum
8360720	8366080	gravity was what we were meant to do. They've done some stuff with black holes that they can get
8366080	8373280	some solutions correct. Then they have lots of agreements where they show mathematical
8373280	8380240	truths that mathematicians didn't even know. I'm very underwhelmed by string theory based on how
8380240	8385120	many people have worked on it and how little is supporting the claims to it being a theory of
8385120	8394000	everything. Those are the two that I take quite seriously. I don't yet take Wolframs quite seriously
8394000	8400640	because if he really finds one of these cellular automatons that are really distinct and generative,
8400640	8405120	it'll be amazing. He's looking for such a thing. I don't think he's found anything.
8406000	8412880	Techmark, I view as a philosopher who is somehow taking credit for Platonism, which I don't see
8412880	8417440	any reason for fighting with Max because I like Max, but if it ever comes time, I'm putting a
8417440	8422880	post-it note that I'm not positive. The mathematical universe hypothesis is really anything new.
8425040	8430960	In general, loop quantum gravity really, I think, grew out of some hopes that the general
8430960	8435520	relativistic community had that they would be able to do particle theory. I don't think that
8435520	8442400	they've shown any particle theoretic realism. Essentially, here's what I really think, Lex.
8443600	8449440	I think we didn't understand how big the difference between an effective theory and a theory of
8449440	8455760	everything is conceptually. Maybe it's not mathematically that different, but conceptually,
8455760	8459840	trying to figure out what a theory of everything, how does the universe, and I've compared it to
8459840	8466080	Escher's drawing hands, how do two hands draw themselves into existence? That's the puzzle
8466960	8473840	that I think has just been wanting. I'll be honest, I'm really surprised that the theoretical physics
8473840	8485120	community didn't even get up on their high horse and say, this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable,
8485120	8491040	because clearly, I always say, I'm not a physicist. I'm an amateur with the heart
8491040	8497680	as big as all outdoors. In your journey of releasing this, and I'm sure there may be
8499360	8503680	it will be another American tradition on April 1st that will continue for years to come,
8506320	8518640	in my, there's crumbs along the way that I'm hoping to collect in my naive view of things
8518640	8530560	of the beauty that in your geometric view of the universe. So one question I'd like to ask is,
8533600	8538800	if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful, something important about
8538800	8545600	geometric community in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty from the outsider's perspective,
8545600	8551040	what would that thing be? Interesting question. Perhaps we can both
8551040	8555680	have a journey towards April 1st. Take a look at that.
8558480	8564480	Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose, not Melrose, on Montana in Santa Monica.
8565680	8571680	Now you'll notice that all of those discs rotate independently. Yes.
8571920	8581280	If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous, but not uniform everywhere, what
8581280	8588160	you're doing is a so-called gauge transformation on the torus seen as a U1 bundle over a U1
8588160	8595840	spacetime. So the concept of spacetime here in a very simplified case isn't four-dimensional,
8595920	8601280	but it's one-dimensional. It's just a circle. And there's a circle above every point in the
8601280	8609840	circle represented by those little discs. Imagine, if you will, that we took a rubber band
8611520	8617120	and placed it around here and decided that that was a function from the circle into
8618640	8625040	this circle that is representing a y-axis that's wrapped around itself. Well, you would have an
8625040	8630080	idea of what it means for a function to be constant if it just went all around the outside.
8630080	8635440	But what happens if I turn this a little bit? Then the function would be mostly constant.
8635440	8641200	It would have a little place where it dipped and it went back. It turns out that you can transform
8642080	8648400	that function and transform the derivative that says that function is equal to zero when I take
8648400	8656880	its derivative at the same time. That's what a gauge transformation is. Amazing to me that we
8656880	8666240	don't have a simple video visualizing things that I've already had built and that I can clearly
8666240	8673120	demonstrate. When you do that torus whose the code of the torus is itself generating spinning
8673760	8679760	Yeah. This is a U1 principle bundle. And the world needs to know what a gauge theory is,
8679760	8684000	not by analogy, not what Lawrence Krauss is saying. It's like a checkerboard. If you change
8684000	8690960	some of the colors this way, not saying that it's a local symmetry involving links,
8690960	8696400	none of those things. It's a theory of differential calculus where the functions and the derivatives
8697280	8702480	are both subject to a particular kind of change so that if a function was constant under one
8702480	8708640	derivative, then the new function is constant under the new derivative transformed in the same
8708640	8713920	fashion. And would you put that under the category of just gauge transformations? Yes,
8713920	8718240	that would be gauge transformations applied to sections and connections where connections
8718240	8726640	are the derivatives in the theory. This is easily explained. It is pathological that the community
8726640	8730880	of people who understand what I'm saying have never bothered to do this in a clear fashion
8730960	8737280	for the general public. You and I could visualize this overnight. This is not hard.
8738560	8744320	The public needs to know in some sense that, let's say quantum electrodynamics, the theory of
8744320	8750560	photons and electrons, more or less electrons are functions and photons are derivatives. Now,
8750560	8755920	there's some you can object in some ways, but basically a gauge theory is the way in which
8755920	8763680	you can translate a shift in the definition of the functions and the shift of the definition of
8763680	8769600	the derivatives so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed. So you have to do both
8769600	8774800	at the same time. Now, you and I can visualize that. So if what you wanted to do rather than going
8774800	8780000	directly to geometric unity is that I could sit down with you and I could say, here are the various
8780000	8785520	components of geometric unity. And if the public needs a visualization in order to play along,
8786000	8788960	we've got a little over two months and I'd be happy to work with you.
8789760	8793680	I love that as a challenge and I'll take it on and I hope we do make it happen.
8793680	8799600	And David Goggins, if Lex doesn't do some super macho thing because he's got to work
8799600	8805120	to get some of this stuff done, you'll understand he'll be available to you after April.
8805120	8809200	Thank you for the escape clause. I really needed that escape clause.
8809200	8812240	I'm glad that's on record. I'm worried, 48 miles and 48 hours.
8812880	8818240	By the way, I just want to say how much I admire your willingness to keep this kind
8818240	8824640	of hardcore attitude. I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews have it in spades,
8824640	8830320	but it's harder to do in a society that's sloppy and that's weak and that's lazy.
8830880	8836240	And the fact that you bring so much heart to saying, I'm going to bring this to jujitsu,
8836240	8839360	I'm going to bring this to guitar, I'm going to bring this to AI, I'm going to bring this to
8839360	8844960	podcasting. It comes through loud and clear. I just find it completely and utterly inspiring
8844960	8849840	that you keep this kind of hardcore aspect at the same time that you're the guy who's extolling
8849840	8853120	the virtue of love in a modern society and doing it at scale.
8853120	8857760	Thank you. That means a lot. I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm just following my heart on it
8857760	8862000	and just going with the gut. This seems to make sense somehow.
8863600	8868480	I personally think we better get tougher or we're going to get in a world of pain and I
8868480	8874000	do think that when it comes time to lead, it's great to have people who you know don't crack
8874000	8881200	under pressure. Do you mind if we talk about love and what it takes to be a father for a bit?
8881200	8884560	Sure. Do you mind if Zev joins us? I'd be an honor.
8885280	8894720	Eric, I've talked to your son Zev who's an incredible human being, but let me
8898320	8902400	ask you, this might be difficult because you're both sitting together,
8904160	8912800	what advice do you have for him as he makes his way in this world, especially given that,
8912800	8918320	as we mentioned before, on Joe Rogan, you're flawed and that just like all humans, you're mortal?
8919840	8926880	Well, at some level, I guess one of my issues is that I've got to stop giving quite so much advice.
8928640	8933600	Early on, I was very worried that I could see Zev's abilities and I could see his
8934240	8941440	challenges and I saw them in terms of myself. A certain amount of Zev rhymes with whatever I
8941440	8947040	went through as a kid and I don't want to doom him to the same outcomes that
8947920	8952720	suffice for me. I think that he's got a much better head on his shoulders at age 15. He's
8952720	8960800	much better adjusted and in part, it's important for me to recognize that because I think I did a
8960800	8969440	reasonably decent job early on, I don't need to get this part right. I'm looking at
8970400	8977120	at Zev's trajectory and saying, you're going to need to be incredibly and even pathologically
8977120	8981840	self-confident. The antidote for that is going to be something you're going to need to carry on
8981840	8987680	board, which is radical humility. You're going to have to have those in a dialectical tension,
8987680	8993520	which is never resolved, which is a huge burden. You are going to have to forgive people who do
8993520	8998960	not appreciate your gifts because your gifts are clearly evident and many people will have to pretend
8998960	9003520	not to see them because if they see your gifts, then they're going to have to question their
9003520	9011440	entire approach to education or employment or critical thinking. What my hope is is that you
9011440	9016080	can just forgive those who don't see them and who complicate and frustrate your life and realize
9016080	9020000	that you're going to have to take care of them too. Zev, let me ask you the more challenging
9020000	9024000	question because the guy sitting right here, what advice do you have for your dad?
9024880	9033120	Since after talking to you, I realize you're the more brilliant aside from the better-looking
9033840	9034800	member of the family.
9042960	9045280	You could say anything you want. This is the last time we're going to be seeing them.
9045600	9049520	This could be an awkward drive home.
9051760	9060640	I think a new perspective I've taken on parenting is that it is a task for which
9060640	9068400	no human is really supposed to be prepared. In Jewish tradition, for example, there are
9069360	9077120	myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud that compare the role of a parent to the role of a
9077120	9085840	God. No human is prepared to play God and create and guide a life, but somehow we're forced into
9085840	9095040	it as people. I think sometimes it's hard for children to understand that however their parents
9095040	9104880	are failing sort of has to be. It's something for which we must budget because our parents
9104880	9111040	play a role in our lives of which they're not worthy and they devote themselves to
9111920	9115280	regardless because that becomes who they are in a certain sense.
9116240	9132480	I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human because I think too often it's easy to
9132480	9140880	have godly expectations of people who are far from such a role. I think I'm really happy that you've
9140880	9150640	been as open as you have with me about the fact that you don't pretend to be a god in my life.
9152960	9161040	You are a guide who allows me to see myself and that's been very important considering the fact
9161040	9170080	that by your self-teaching paradigm I will have to guide myself and being able to see it
9170640	9175520	and see myself accurately has been one of the greatest gifts that you've given me.
9175520	9185040	So I'm very appreciative and I want you to know that I don't buy into the the role that you're
9185040	9196720	supposed to sort of fake your way through in my in my life but I
9199280	9207600	am unbelievably happy with a more realistic connection that we've been able to build in
9207600	9213920	lieu of it. I think it's been easier on you actually as you come to realize what I don't know,
9213920	9219040	what I can't do and that there's been a period of time I guess that's fascinating to me where
9220720	9226400	you're sort of surprised that I don't know the answer to a certain thing as well as you do and
9227280	9232640	that I remember going through this with a particular mathematician who I held and I still
9232640	9239280	hold an awe named David Kajdan and you know he famously said to him and weirdly our family
9239280	9246560	knew his family in the Soviet Union but he said you know Eric I always appreciate you coming to
9246560	9251200	my office because I always find what you have to say interesting but you have to realize that in
9251200	9255040	the areas that you're talking about you are no longer the student you are actually my teacher
9255920	9261280	and I wasn't prepared to hear that and there are many ways in which as I was just saying with the
9261280	9269280	Mozart I am learning at an incredible rate from you I used to learn from you because I didn't
9269280	9274240	understand what was possible you were very much I mean this is the weird thing there used to be
9274240	9278560	this thing called Harvey the invisible rabbit this guy could had a rabbit that was like six feet
9278560	9285200	tall that only he could see maybe was talking and that was like you at age four is you were saying
9285920	9290640	batch of crazy things that were all totally sensible and nobody else could put them together
9290640	9297520	and so what's wonderful is that the world hasn't caught on but enormous numbers of people
9297520	9305840	are starting to and I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit and that outside the box
9305840	9314640	intellectual commitment serves you well as the world starts to appreciate that I think you're a
9314640	9319760	very trustworthy voice you don't get everything right but the idea that we have somebody at your
9319760	9324240	age who's embedded in your generation who can tell us something about what's happening is really
9324240	9330320	valuable to me and I do hope that you'll consider boosting that voice more than just at the dinner
9330320	9341600	table. I apologize for saying this four-letter word but do you love Zav? I was really worried
9341600	9348240	it was going to be another four-letter word. There's so many. It doesn't even rise to the
9348240	9356000	level of a question. I mean I just there are a tiny number of people with whom you share so much
9356000	9364480	life that you can't even think of yourself in their absence and I don't know if Zav would find that
9364480	9373760	but it's you can have a kid and never make this level of connection. I think even right down to
9373760	9382560	the fact that you know when Zav chooses boogie woogie piano for his own set of reasons why I
9382560	9389600	would choose boogie woogie piano if I could play in any style it's a question about a decrease in
9389600	9396320	loneliness. You know like my grandfather played the mandolin and I had to learn some mandolin because
9396320	9402480	otherwise that instrument would go silent. You don't expect that you get this much of a chance
9402480	9411440	to leave this much of yourself in another person who is choosing it and recreating it rather than it
9411440	9420240	being directly instilled and my proudest achievement is in a certain sense having not
9421280	9428640	taught him and having shared this much so you know it's not even love it's like well beyond.
9429600	9440880	So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world I think I speak for I would argue probably
9440880	9447200	millions of people that you Eric because this is a conversation with you have made for many people
9447200	9456240	for me a less lonely world and I can't wait to see how you Zav develop as an intellect but also
9456800	9465200	I'm so heartworn by the optimism and the hopefulness that was in you that I hope develops further
9465840	9474640	and lastly I'm deeply thankful that you Eric are my friend and would give me would honor me
9475440	9482240	with this watch it means more than words can say. Thanks guys thanks for talking today. Thank you.
