0	2200	Let me ask you to this question.
2200	6160	Well, there's bell curve or any research on race differences.
9160	13080	Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world?
13520	16520	Can that be used to increase the amount of hate in the world?
16920	26200	My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism
26840	30600	that have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data
31480	37960	that speak against that, that no, I don't I don't want to give
37960	41840	racist groups of veto power over what scientists study.
44160	48800	The following is a conversation with Richard Hire on the science of human intelligence.
49280	52920	This is a highly controversial topic, but a critically important one
52920	54920	for understanding the human mind.
55000	59640	I hope you will join me in not shying away from difficult topics like this.
59960	65720	And instead, let us try to navigate it with empathy, rigor and grace.
66440	70120	If you're watching this on video now, I should mention that I'm recording
70120	74160	this introduction in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.
74560	77160	I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful.
78600	81080	This is Alex Friedman podcast to support it.
81080	83320	Please check out our sponsors in the description.
83560	86680	And now, dear friends, here's Richard Hire.
87880	90760	What are the measures of human intelligence and how do we measure it?
91560	95000	Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.
95800	101320	In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence is just being smart.
101320	104520	How well you reason, how well you figure things out,
105080	107640	what you do when you don't know what to do.
108600	113880	Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions
113880	116520	of how people use the word intelligence.
116520	118920	If you want to do research on intelligence,
119640	124680	measuring something that you can study scientifically is a little trickier.
125880	130920	And what almost all researchers who study intelligence use
131640	136360	is the concept called the G factor, general intelligence.
137080	139480	And that is what is common.
139480	146360	That is a mental ability that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.
146360	148680	What's the origin of the term G factor, by the way?
148680	152040	It's such a funny word for such a fundamental human thing.
152040	155320	The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman.
156440	160520	And he noticed, this is like more than 100 years ago,
161480	166680	he'd noticed that when you tested people with different tests,
167720	171640	all the tests were correlated positively.
173080	176680	And so he was looking at student exams and things.
177320	180760	And he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially.
181560	187960	And when he used it to look at student performance on various topics,
188040	191880	he found all the scores were correlated with each other,
191880	194360	and they were all positive correlations.
194360	199240	So he inferred from this that there must be some common factor
199240	203240	that was irrespective of the content of the test.
203240	208280	And positive correlation means if you do well on the first test,
208280	210840	you're likely to do well on the second test.
210840	215800	And presumably that holds for tests across even disciplines,
215800	219240	so not within subject, but across subjects.
219240	224840	So that's where the general comes in, something about general intelligence.
224840	226840	So when you were talking about measuring intelligence
226840	230840	and trying to figure out something difficult about this world
230840	234680	and how to solve the puzzles of this world, that means generally speaking,
234680	238120	not some specific test, but across all tests.
238120	239240	Absolutely right.
239240	243240	And people get hung up on this because they say,
243320	248840	well, what about the ability to do X isn't that independent?
248840	251880	And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this,
251880	254680	but not so good at this, this other thing.
255240	259880	And so there are a lot of examples like that, but it's a general tendency.
259880	262920	So exceptions really don't disprove.
264120	270600	Your everyday experience is not the same as what the data actually show.
270680	274440	And your everyday experience, when you say, oh, I know someone who's good at X,
274440	279160	but not so good at Y, that doesn't contradict the statement of about it.
279160	282680	He's not so good, but he's not the opposite.
283240	285720	He's not, it's not a negative correlation.
286440	294760	Okay, so we're not, our anecdotal data, I know a guy is really good at solving some kind of visual
294760	301320	thing that's not sufficient for us to understand actually the depths of that person's intelligence.
301320	310280	So how this idea of G factor, how much evidence is there, how strong,
311000	314680	you know, given across the decades that this idea has been around,
314680	322360	how much has it been held up that there is a universal sort of horsepower of intelligence
322440	327080	that's underneath all of it, all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing
328760	330280	in the depths of the human mind.
330280	334120	That's a universal stable measure of a person's intelligence.
334760	337480	You used a couple of words in there, stable.
338680	340520	We have to be precise with words.
340520	342680	I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.
342680	343480	We can.
343480	348760	There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research that is poetic.
349640	355720	Science has a kinetic aspect to it and good scientists are very intuitive.
355720	359160	They're not just, hey, hey, these are the numbers.
359160	362040	You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.
362040	369320	When it comes to intelligence research, you asked how well has this general concept held up?
369880	375480	And I think I can say, without fear of being empirically contradicted,
376120	380280	that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.
380920	384920	Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal, psychology, we all know there's a replication
384920	388360	crisis in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn't replicate.
388360	389560	That's all true.
389560	396600	There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying the existence of this general factor.
396600	398360	Let me tell you some things about it.
399560	404040	It looks like it's universal that you find it in all cultures.
404600	411000	The way you find it, step back one step, the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.
411800	413720	What battery you choose?
413720	420280	Take a battery of any mental test you want, give it to a large number of diverse people,
421480	428920	and you will be able to extract statistically the commonality among all those tests.
428920	431480	It's done by a technique called factor analysis.
432440	438280	People think that this may be a statistical artifact of some kind.
438280	440600	It is not a statistical artifact.
441240	442600	What is factor analysis?
442600	447960	Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data and look at the correlation among
447960	454680	the different test scores and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together.
455560	457240	And there are different factors.
457240	461000	So if you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor.
461000	463240	There may be a numerical factor.
463240	465800	There may be a visual spatial factor.
465800	471640	But those factors have variants in common with each other and that is the common.
473080	478040	That's what's common among all the tests and that's what gets labeled the G factor.
478040	484680	So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests and you extract a G factor from it,
484680	488200	that factor usually accounts for around half of the variants.
488200	492120	It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor.
492760	495000	But it is the most reliable.
495000	496360	It is the most stable.
497160	503720	And it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.
503720	512840	It's very hard to change the G factor with training or drugs or anything else.
512840	514920	You don't know how to increase the G factor.
514920	516920	Okay. You said a lot of really interesting things there.
516920	523240	So first, I mean, just to get people used to it in case they're not familiar with this idea.
523240	525800	G factor is what we mean.
525800	533960	So often there's this term used IQ, which is the way IQ is used.
533960	537240	They really mean G factor in regular conversation.
538360	542600	The way, because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence.
542600	547240	And what we mean by intelligence, we mean general intelligence and general intelligence
547240	552280	in the human mind from a psychology, from a serious rigorous scientific perspective
552280	553800	actually means G factor.
553800	558440	So G factor equals intelligence just in this conversation to define terms.
558440	562200	Okay. So there's this stable thing called G factor.
562200	572840	You said, now, factor, you said factor many times means a measure that's potentially could
572840	576280	be reduced to a single number across the different factors you mentioned.
577160	586600	And what you said it accounts for half, half-ish, accounts for half-ish of what?
587560	592760	Of variance across the different set of tests.
593640	600840	So if you do for some reason well on some set of tests, what does that mean?
600840	605800	So that means there's some unique capabilities outside of the G factor that might account for that.
605800	606680	And what are those?
607320	613400	What else is there besides the raw horsepower of the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?
613480	615240	There are test-taking skills.
616440	619720	There are specific abilities.
620840	630120	Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things, mathematical concepts,
630120	632040	even simple arithmetic people.
632040	634200	Some people are much better than others.
634200	641240	You might know people who can memorize and short-term memory is another component of this.
642200	649960	A short-term memory is one of the cognitive processes that's most highly correlated with the G factor.
653800	661000	So all those things like memory, test-taking skills account for variability across the test
661000	661720	performances.
663560	668440	You can run, but you can't hide from the thing that God gave you.
668520	675080	The genetics, so that G factor, science says that G factor is there.
675080	679240	Each one of us has a G factor.
679240	679880	Oh boy.
679880	681240	Some have more than others.
681240	682760	I'm getting uncomfortable already.
682760	692280	Well IQ is a score, and an IQ score is a very good estimate of the G factor.
692280	694280	You can't measure G directly.
694280	695960	There's no direct measure.
696040	699080	You estimate it from these statistical techniques.
699720	702200	But an IQ score is a good estimate.
702200	703000	Why?
703000	708600	Because a standard IQ test is a battery of different mental abilities.
708600	715640	You combine it into one score, and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,
715640	720040	even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.
720040	724200	Because again, it's what's common to all these mental abilities.
724200	731720	So a good IQ test, and I'll ask you about that, but a good IQ test tries to compress down
732600	733720	that battery of tests.
733720	740520	Like tries to get a nice selection of variable tests into one test.
741240	744120	And so in that way, it sneaks up to the G factor.
744120	747080	And that's another interesting thing about G factor.
748040	754040	Now you give, first of all, you have a great book on the neuroscience of intelligence.
754040	759000	You have a great course, which is when I first learned, you're a great teacher.
759000	759720	Let me just say.
759720	759880	Thank you.
762120	765720	Your course at the teaching company, I hope I'm saying that correctly.
765720	767000	The intelligent brain.
767000	772040	The intelligent brain is when I first heard about this G factor.
772040	776680	This mysterious thing that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine a light on.
776680	777960	We're trying to sneak up on.
778840	783480	So the fact that there's this measure, stable measure of intelligence, we can't measure directly.
785160	790520	But we can come up with a battery test or one test that includes a battery of
792440	801560	variable type of questions that can reliably or attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.
801560	803160	That's a fascinating idea.
803160	805720	So for me as an AI person, it's fascinating.
805720	809160	It's fascinating that there's something stable like that about the human mind,
809160	811240	especially if it's grounded in genetics.
811960	823160	It's both fascinating that as a researcher of the human mind and all the human psychological,
823160	828120	sociological, ethical questions that started rising, it makes me uncomfortable.
828120	829800	But truth can be uncomfortable.
830760	835480	You know, I get that a lot about being uncomfortable talking about this.
836440	839480	Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.
841960	847400	It doesn't matter which battery of tests you use.
848600	850600	So there are countless tests.
850600	858040	You can take any 12 of them at random, extract a G factor and another 12 at random and extract a G
858040	863080	factor and those G factors will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.
864120	866040	So it is a ubiquitous.
866040	869480	It doesn't depend on the content of the test is what I'm trying to say.
870200	874040	It is general among all those tests of mental ability.
874040	880280	And tests of mental abilities include things like G's plain poker.
881400	885560	Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.
886200	893480	Your skill at anything that requires reasoning and thinking, anything from spelling, arithmetic,
894280	895720	more complex things.
898120	900440	This concept is ubiquitous.
900440	904840	And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures, you get the same thing.
905720	910440	So this says something interesting about the human mind that as a computer is designed to be
911000	911560	general.
915240	919240	So it's not easily made specialized.
920360	927560	Meaning if you're going to be good at one thing, Miyamoto Masashi has this quote.
927560	932840	He's an ancient warrior famous for the book of five rings in the martial arts world.
933400	938120	And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.
938840	946200	Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize to everything.
946920	949240	And that's an interesting thing about the human mind.
950520	953560	So that's what the G factor reveals.
954360	955240	Okay.
955240	960840	So what's the difference if you can elaborate a little bit further between IQ and G factor?
960840	963480	Just because it's a source of confusion for people.
963480	965640	And IQ is a score.
965640	968200	People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.
968200	972760	But IQ has a more technical meaning for people who work in the field.
972760	978680	And it's an IQ score, a score on a test that estimates the G factor.
980040	984120	And the G factor is what's common among all these tests of mental ability.
984120	990520	So if you think about, it's not a Venn diagram, but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it.
990520	996920	But the G factor would be really at the core, what's common to everything.
997480	1003800	And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order of people on the score.
1004440	1006840	And this is what makes people uncomfortable.
1006840	1011480	This is where there's a lot of controversy about whether IQ tests are biased
1011480	1013720	toward any one group or another.
1014360	1019000	And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,
1019000	1024120	but they also have a technical aspect of it that's not so easy to explain.
1024120	1028040	Well, we'll talk about the fascinating and the difficult things about all of this.
1028040	1033720	But so by the way, when you say rank order, that means you get a number.
1033720	1036840	And that means one person you can now compare.
1037560	1042120	Like you could say that this other person is more intelligent than me.
1042920	1047960	Well, what you can say is IQ scores are interpreted really as percentiles.
1049240	1054920	So that if you have an IQ of 140 and somebody else has 70,
1055480	1061640	the metric is such that you cannot say the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart
1062840	1065080	as a person with an IQ of 70.
1065880	1069800	That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.
1069800	1073000	Now, you may think you know people with zero intelligence,
1073000	1077880	but in fact, there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale.
1077960	1079720	It's relative to other people.
1081080	1087320	So relative to other people, somebody with an IQ score of 140 is in the upper
1087320	1088600	less than 1 percent.
1089320	1095400	Whereas somebody with an IQ of 70 is two standard deviations below the mean.
1095400	1098520	That's a different percentile.
1098520	1105880	So it's similar to like in chess, you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.
1106840	1109080	So you can't say it's twice.
1109640	1115240	One person, if your ELO rating is twice another person, I don't think you're twice as good at chess.
1116040	1120840	It's not stable in that way, but because it's very difficult to do these kinds of comparisons.
1121400	1125560	But so what can we say about the number itself?
1126840	1129800	Is that stable across tests and so on and so on?
1130520	1133880	There are a number of statistical properties of any test.
1133880	1136360	They're called psychometric properties.
1136360	1140040	You have validity, you have reliability, reliability.
1140040	1142680	There are many different kinds of reliability.
1142680	1149720	They all essentially measure stability and IQ tests are stable within an individual.
1149720	1155800	There are some longitudinal studies where children were measured at age 11.
1155800	1162040	And again, when they were 70 years old and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.
1162040	1165080	This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.
1166280	1173320	In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test on every single child,
1173320	1176840	age 11 in the whole country, and they did.
1177640	1185560	And those records were discovered in an old store room at the University of Edinburgh.
1186360	1191720	By a friend of mine, Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,
1192360	1198760	and has done a lot of research on the people who are still alive today from that original study,
1198760	1201080	including brain imaging research, by the way.
1201080	1206120	Really, it's a fascinating group of people who are studied.
1208040	1211480	Not to get ahead of the story, but one of the most interesting things they found
1212440	1219560	is a very strong relationship between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality,
1221720	1230840	so that 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates,
1230840	1233160	and they could get death records from everybody.
1233160	1236440	And Scotland has universal health care for everybody.
1237000	1243080	And it turned out, if you divide the people by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles,
1243880	1248360	and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,
1251160	1253720	I know this is in the book, I have the graph in the book,
1254600	1259640	but there are essentially twice as many people alive in the highest IQ quartile
1259640	1263320	than in the lowest IQ quartile, true in men and women.
1263320	1265880	Interesting.
1266840	1268040	So it makes a big difference.
1268040	1275000	Now, why this is the case is not so clear since everyone had access to health care.
1275480	1281080	Well, there's a lot, and we'll talk about it, just the sentences you used now
1282040	1285720	could be explained by nature or nurture.
1285720	1286920	We don't know.
1286920	1291560	Now, there's a lot of science that starts to then dig in and investigate that question.
1291560	1293720	But let me linger on the IQ test.
1293720	1297320	How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?
1297320	1299960	Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.
1299960	1308040	What makes a good IQ test question that sneaks up on this g-factor measure?
1308040	1314280	Well, your question is interesting because you want me to give examples of items that make good
1314280	1318760	items, and what makes a good item is not so much its content,
1319320	1326920	but its empirical relationship to the total score that turns out to be valid by other means.
1327720	1334040	So for example, let me give you an odd example from personality testing.
1335560	1341560	So there's a personality test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,
1341560	1343960	MMPI, been around for decades.
1343960	1349080	I've heard about this test recently because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.
1349080	1355720	I don't know if you've been paying attention to that, but they had psychologist understand,
1355720	1358600	and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,
1359960	1365560	again, I'm learning so much from this trial, they did different battery of tests
1366920	1370360	to diagnose personality disorders.
1370360	1373240	Apparently, there's that systematic way of doing so.
1373240	1378920	And the Minnesota one is one of the ones that there's the most science on.
1378920	1383720	There's a lot of great papers which were all continuously cited on the stand,
1383720	1385000	which is fascinating to watch.
1385000	1386360	Sorry, a little bit of attention.
1386360	1388120	It's okay. I mean, this is interesting because you're right.
1388120	1389480	It's been around for decades.
1389480	1394840	There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test,
1394840	1401640	including what it predicts with respect to different categories of personality disorder.
1402200	1406200	But what I want to mention is the content of the items on that test.
1406840	1411800	All of the items are essentially true, false items.
1412440	1415560	True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath.
1416840	1422040	True or false, I think Lincoln was a better president than Washington.
1422600	1429320	What have all these, what does that have to do with, and the point is the content of these
1429320	1437160	items, nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything, but empirically they do.
1437800	1444520	It's a technique of choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism.
1445720	1451080	That the content doesn't matter, but for some reason, when you get a criterion group of people
1451080	1456760	with this disorder and you compare them to people without that disorder, these are the
1456760	1462600	items that distinguish. Irrespective of content, it's a hard concept to grasp.
1462600	1471880	Well, first of all, it's fascinating, but I consider myself part psychologist
1472840	1476520	because I love human-robot interaction, and that's a problem.
1476520	1480440	Half of that problem is a psychology problem because there's a human.
1481880	1486200	Designing these tests to get at the questions is the fascinating part.
1490040	1496600	What does dust bowl empiricism refer to? Does it refer to the final result?
1497320	1504840	Yeah, so the test is dust bowl empiricism, but how do you arrive at the battery of questions?
1504840	1510840	I presume one of the things, now again, I'm going to the excellent testimony in that trial,
1511880	1519000	because they also explain the tests, that a bunch of the questions that kind of
1520520	1527560	make you forget that you're taking a test, it makes it very difficult for you to somehow figure
1527560	1533960	out what you're supposed to answer. Yes, it's called social desirability,
1533960	1538040	but we're getting a little far afield because I only wanted to give that example of dust bowl
1538040	1548040	empiricism. When we talk about the items on an IQ test, many of those items in the dust bowl
1548040	1555880	empiricism method have no face validity. In other words, they don't look like they measure anything.
1557560	1562920	Whereas most intelligence tests, the items actually look like they're measuring some mental
1562920	1568280	ability. So here's one of the... So you were bringing that up as an example as what it is not?
1568280	1572760	Yes. Got it. Okay, so I don't want to go too far afield on it.
1572760	1579000	Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast. So I should mention that.
1579000	1587480	Far afield. Yeah, so anyway, sorry. So they feel the questions look like they pass the face validity
1587480	1591960	test and some more than others. So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.
1592600	1599240	If I... One of the subtests on a standard IQ test is general information.
1600680	1604200	Let me just think a little bit because I don't want to give you the actual item.
1604200	1611000	But if I said how far is it between Washington DC and Miami, Florida,
1611960	1619000	within 500 miles plus or minus? Well, it's not a fact most people memorize,
1619880	1626200	but you know something about geography. You say, well, I flew there once. I know planes fly 500
1626200	1633400	miles. You can kind of make an estimate. But it also seems like it would be very cultural.
1634120	1643560	So there's that kind of general information. Then there's vocabulary test. What does
1646200	1653320	regatta mean? And I choose that word because that word was removed from the IQ test because
1653320	1660040	people complained that disadvantaged people would not know that word just from their everyday
1660920	1668200	life. Okay. Here's another example from a different kind of subtest. What's regatta,
1668200	1676840	by the way? A regatta is a sailing competition, a competition with boats. Not necessarily sailing,
1676840	1682840	but the competition with boats. Yep. Yep. I'm probably disadvantaged in that way. Okay. Excellent.
1682840	1688760	So that was removed. Anyway, what you were saying. Okay. So here's another subtest. I'm going to repeat
1688760	1694760	a string of numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready? Okay. Seven,
1695640	1705000	four, two, eight, one, six. That's way too many. Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.
1705000	1709720	Okay. You get the idea. Now, the actual test starts with a smaller number,
1710440	1714920	you know, like two numbers. And then it is people get it right. You keep going,
1714920	1719960	adding to the string of numbers until they can't do it anymore. Okay. But now try this.
1720600	1725800	I'm going to say some numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them to me backwards.
1726520	1734120	I quit. Okay. Now, so I gave you some examples of the kind of items on an IQ test. Yes. General
1734120	1743640	information. I can't remember all. General information, vocabulary, digit span, forward
1743640	1750120	and digit span backward. Well, you said I can't even remember them. That's a good question for me.
1751560	1755080	What does memory have to do with your culture? Okay. Well, let's hold on.
1755080	1764600	Okay. All right. Let's just talk about these examples. Now, some of those items seem very
1764600	1774760	cultural and others seem less cultural. Which ones do you think scores on which
1774760	1782360	subtest are most highly correlated with the G factor? Well, the G2 advanced is less cultural.
1783560	1792920	Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated. And it turns out that digit span
1792920	1802120	backwards is highly correlated. How do you figure? Now you have decades of research
1802120	1808520	to answer the question, how do you figure? Right. So now there's like good research that
1808520	1817000	gives you intuition about what kind of questions get at it. Just like there's something I've done,
1817960	1823320	I've actually used for research, just send me a autonomous vehicle, like whether humans are
1823320	1829400	paying attention, there's a body of literature that does like end back tests. For example, we have to
1833400	1839160	put workload on the brain to do recall, memory recall. And that helps you kind of
1840200	1845080	put some work onto the brain while the person is doing some other task. And this does some
1845080	1850360	interesting research with that. But that's loading the memory. So there's like research around
1851000	1856760	stably what that means about the human mind. And here you're saying recall backwards
1858360	1863720	is a good predictor. It's a transformation. Yeah. So you have to do some,
1865640	1871160	like you have to load that into your brain and not just remember it, but do something with it.
1871160	1876520	Right. Now here's another example of a different kind of test called the Hick paradigm. And it's
1876520	1885080	not verbal at all. It's a little box. And there are a series of lights arranged in a semi circle
1885080	1892840	at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights
1892840	1899800	goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights, you take your finger off the home button
1899880	1905880	and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction
1905880	1910440	time. Like goes on as quick as you can. You press the button and you get a reaction time
1910440	1917080	from the moment you lift your finger off the button that when you press the button with where the
1917080	1925080	light is, that reaction time doesn't really correlate with IQ very much. But if you change
1925880	1933640	the instructions and you say three lights are going to come on simultaneously, I want you to
1933640	1940760	press the button next to the light that's furthest from the other two. So maybe lights one and two
1940760	1946520	go on and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger off and you would press the
1946520	1955560	button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task. It's not really hard.
1956280	1962600	Almost everybody gets it all right. But your reaction time to that is highly correlated with
1962600	1969320	the g-factor. This is fascinating. So reaction time. So it's a temporal aspect to this. So what
1969320	1974360	rolled this time? Speed of processing. It's the speed of processing. Is this also true for ones
1974360	1981880	that take longer like five, 10, 30 seconds? Is time part of the measure with some of these ideas?
1981880	1989880	And that is why some of the best IQ tests have a time limit. Because if you have no time limit,
1990520	1998200	people can do better. But it doesn't distinguish among people that well. So that
1999000	2006040	adding the time element is important. So speed of information processing and reaction time is
2006040	2011800	a measure of speed of information processing turns out to be related to the g-factor.
2011800	2017960	But the g-factor only accounts for maybe half or some amount on the test performance. For example,
2017960	2030520	I get pretty bad test anxiety. I just don't enjoy tests. I enjoy going back into my cave
2030520	2036920	and working it. I've always enjoyed homework way more than tests. No matter how hard the
2036920	2041080	homework is. Because I can go back to the cave and hide away and think deeply. There's something
2041080	2047000	about being watched and having a time limit that really makes me anxious. And I could just see the
2047000	2053080	mind not operating optimally at all. But you're saying underneath there, there's still a g-factor.
2057080	2061560	And if you get anxious taking a test, many people say, oh, I didn't do well because I'm anxious.
2063480	2067560	I hear that a lot. They say, well, fine. If you're really anxious during the test,
2068360	2073800	the score will be a bad estimate of your g-factor. It doesn't mean the g-factor isn't there.
2073960	2078680	That's right. And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT,
2080440	2086920	they're essentially intelligence tests. They are highly G-loaded. Now, the people who make the
2086920	2094200	SAT don't want to mention that. They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing. But to
2094200	2100600	call it an intelligence test is really beyond the pale. But in fact, it's so highly correlated
2100680	2106040	because it's a reasoning test. The SAT is a reasoning test, a verbal reasoning,
2106040	2114760	mathematical reasoning. And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to G. But if people
2115640	2120120	go in and take a standardized test, whether it's an IQ test or the SAT,
2120120	2127720	and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever, the score is not going to be a good
2127720	2134840	estimate of their g. If they retake the test when they're not anxious or less anxious or don't have
2134840	2142360	a fever, the score will go up and that will be a better estimate. But you can't say their g-factor
2142360	2148840	increased between the two tests. Well, it's interesting. So the question is, how wide of a
2148840	2154680	battery of tests is required to estimate the g-factor? Well, because I'll give you as my personal
2154760	2161800	example, I took the SAT and I think it was called the ACT, where I was to also, I took SAT many
2161800	2169160	times. Every single time, I got a perfect math. And verbal, the time limit on the verbal made me
2169160	2175320	very anxious. I did not, I mean, part of it, I didn't speak English very well. But honestly,
2175320	2179800	it was like, you're supposed to remember stuff. And like, I was so anxious. And like, as I'm reading,
2179800	2187080	I'm sweating. I can't, you know, that like, that feeling you have when you're reading a book and
2187080	2192520	you, you just read a page and you know nothing about what you've read because you zoned out,
2192520	2199560	that's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to, you're like, no, read and understand. And
2199560	2207000	that anxiety is like, and you start seeing like the typography versus the content of the words.
2207080	2215720	Like that was, I don't, it's interesting because I know that what they're measuring,
2215720	2222600	I could see being correlated with something. But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance,
2224760	2230520	sure plays a, plays a factor. And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way. I mean,
2230520	2235880	this is a broader discussion, but that's like standardized testing, how you sneak up,
2236520	2242360	how you get at the fact that I'm super anxious and still nevertheless measure some aspect of my
2242360	2247000	intelligence. I wonder, I don't, I don't know, I don't know if you can say it to that, that time
2247000	2254040	limit sure is a pain. Well, let me say this, there are two ways to approach the very real problem
2254040	2260920	that you say that some people just get anxious or not good test takers. By the way, part of,
2262280	2268040	part of testing is you know the answer, you can figure out the answer, or you can't.
2269880	2274840	If you don't know the answer, there are many reasons you don't know the answer at that particular
2274840	2280440	moment. You may have learned it once and forgotten it. You may, it may be on the tip of your tongue,
2280440	2285080	and you just can't get it because you're anxious about the time limit. You may never have learned
2285080	2290520	it. You may never, you may have been exposed to it, but it was too complicated and you couldn't
2290520	2297480	learn it. I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here. But for an individual to interpret your
2297480	2306120	scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score has to take into account various things
2306120	2312040	that would affect your individual score. And that's why decisions about college admission
2312600	2322200	or anything else where tests are used are hardly ever the only criterion to make a decision.
2322200	2326680	And I think people are, college admission is letting go of that very much.
2326680	2334280	Oh, yes, there, yeah. But what does that even mean? Because is it possible to design standardized
2334280	2338280	tests that do get, that are useful to college admissions?
2338280	2345160	Well, they already exist. The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects of success at college.
2345160	2351640	Here's the problem. So maybe you could speak to this, the correlation across a population versus
2351640	2360920	individuals. So, you know, our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,
2363320	2370760	well, it's still, there's tragic cases where innocent people go to jail, but you try to avoid
2370760	2377960	that. In the same way with testing, it just, it would suck for an SAT to miss genius.
2378680	2385400	Yes, and it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely. So it really comes down to
2386920	2398840	do which piece of information maximizes your decision making ability. So,
2400680	2407800	if you just use high school grades, it's okay. But you will miss some people who just
2407800	2413000	don't do well in high school, but who are actually pretty smart, smart enough to be bored silly in
2413000	2418520	high school, and they don't care, and they, their high school GPA isn't that good. So you will miss
2418520	2426440	them in the same sense that somebody who could be very able and ready for college just doesn't
2426440	2435960	do well on their SAT. This is why you make decisions with taking in a variety of information.
2435960	2443240	The other thing I wanted to say, I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,
2443800	2451400	statistically for groups, there are many people who have a disparity between their math score
2451400	2457800	and their verbal score. That disparity, or the other way around, that disparity is called tilt.
2458520	2465560	The score is tilted one way or the other, and that tilt has been studied empirically to see what
2465560	2474760	that predicts. And in fact, you can't make predictions about college success based on tilt.
2474760	2480200	And mathematics is a good example. There are many people, especially non-native speakers of
2480200	2485800	English who come to this country, take the SATs, do very well on the math and not so well on the
2485800	2493160	verbal. Well, if they're applying to a math program, the professors there who are making the
2493160	2500440	decision or the admissions officers don't wait so much the score on verbal, especially if it's
2500440	2506200	a non-native speaker. Well, so yeah, you have to try to, in the admission process, bring in the
2506200	2512600	context. But non-native isn't really the problem. I mean, that was part of the problem for me.
2513560	2518600	But it's the anxiety was, which it's interesting. It's interesting.
2523240	2528760	Boy, reducing yourself down to numbers. But it's still true. It's still the truth.
2529800	2539800	It's a painful truth. That same anxiety that led me to struggle with the SAT verbal tests,
2540520	2547720	it's still within me in all ways of life. So maybe that's not anxiety. Maybe that's something,
2548680	2551720	you know, like personality is also pretty stable.
2552280	2559560	Personality is stable. Personality does impact the way you navigate life.
2560920	2561880	There's no question.
2562440	2567000	Yeah. And we should say that the G factor in intelligence is not just about some kind of
2567640	2578280	number on a paper. It's also has to do with how you navigate life, how easy life is for you
2578840	2585720	in this very complicated world. So personality is all tied into that in some deep fundamental way.
2585720	2592040	But now you've hit the key point about why we even want to study intelligence and personality,
2592040	2597800	I think to a lesser extent, but that's my interest is more on intelligence. I went to
2597800	2603240	graduate school and wanted to study personality, but that's kind of another story how I got kind
2603240	2609000	of shifted from personality research over to intelligence research. Because it's not just
2609000	2616200	a number. Intelligence is not just an IQ score. It's not just an SAT score. It's what those numbers
2616200	2627000	reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life. It has been said that life is one long
2627000	2638520	intelligence test. And who can't relate to that? And if you doubt, see, another problem here is a
2638520	2644760	lot of critics of intelligence research, intelligence testing tend to be academics who by
2644760	2652040	and large are pretty smart people. And pretty smart people by and large have enormous difficulty
2652040	2660680	understanding what the world is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75. It is a completely different
2660680	2670680	everyday experience. Even IQ scores of 85, 90, you know, there's a popular television program,
2670680	2678280	Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with everyday people with everyday problems, and you can see the full
2678280	2685160	range of problem-solving ability demonstrated there. And sometimes she does it for laughs,
2685160	2694840	but it really isn't funny because people who are, there are people who are very limited in their
2694840	2705400	life navigation, let alone success, by having, by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot
2705400	2710600	be taught. We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts, you know, the United States
2710600	2716440	military, which excels at training people. I mean, I don't know that there's a better organization
2716440	2723000	in the world for training diverse people. And they won't take people with IQs under, I think,
2723000	2732840	83 is the cutoff because they have found you, they are unable to train people with lower IQs to do
2732840	2738600	jobs in the military. So one of the things that G-Factor has to do with is learning? Absolutely.
2738600	2746360	Some people learn faster than others. Some people learn more than others. Now, faster, by the way,
2746360	2751720	is not necessarily better, as long as you get to the same place eventually.
2753640	2759640	But, you know, there are professional schools that want students who can learn the fastest
2759640	2768360	because they can learn more, or learn deeper, or all kinds of ideas about why you select people
2768360	2775000	with the highest scores. And there's nothing funnier, by the way, to listen to a bunch of academics
2775080	2780920	complain about the concept of intelligence and intelligence testing. And then you go to a faculty
2780920	2785960	meeting where they're discussing who to hire among the applicants. And all they talk about is how
2785960	2791400	smart the person is. We'll get to that. We'll sneak up to that in different ways. But there's
2791400	2796760	something about reducing a person to a number that in part is grounded to the person's genetics
2796760	2802760	that makes people very uncomfortable. But nobody does that. Nobody in the field actually does that.
2803720	2811160	That is a worry that is a worry like...
2813960	2817640	Well, I don't want to call it a conspiracy theory. I mean, it's a legitimate worry,
2818200	2825560	but it just doesn't happen. Now, I had a professor in graduate school who was the only person I ever
2825560	2835000	knew who considered the students only by their test scores. And later in his life, he kind of
2835000	2842840	backed off that. Let me ask you this. So we'll jump around. I'll come back to a book.
2845400	2853240	I tend to... I've had political discussions with people. And actually, my friend Michael
2853240	2862280	Malis, he's an anarchist. I disagree with him on basically everything except the fact that
2863000	2870520	love is a beautiful thing in this world. And he says this test about left versus right,
2870520	2875880	whatever. It doesn't matter what the test is, but he believes... The question is, do you believe that
2875880	2885000	some people are better than others? The question is ambiguous. Do you believe some people are better
2885000	2893560	than others? And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no. It's a poetic question. It's ambiguous
2893560	2900680	question, right? Like, you know, people want to... Maybe the temptation to ask better at what?
2900680	2909160	Better like sports and so on. No. To me, I stand with the sort of the fauny documents of this country,
2909800	2916120	which is all men are created equal. There's a basic humanity. And there's something about
2917320	2924280	tests of intelligence. Just knowing that some people are different, like the science of
2924280	2931400	intelligence that shows that some people are genetically, in some stable way across a lifetime,
2932280	2940360	have a greater intelligence than others. Makes people feel like some people are better than
2940360	2947480	others. And that makes them very uncomfortable. And I... Maybe you can speak to that. The fact that
2947480	2957400	some people are more intelligent than others in a way that cannot be compensated through education,
2958600	2965560	through anything you do in life. What do we do with that? Okay, there's a lot there.
2966760	2974040	We haven't really talked about the genetics of it yet, but you are correct in that it is
2974120	2980760	my interpretation of the data that genetics has a very important influence on the g-factor.
2981560	2987640	This is controversial. We can talk about it. But if you think that genetics, that genes are
2987640	2993720	deterministic, are always deterministic, that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed.
2995160	3002200	But we know now in the 21st century that many genes are not deterministic, that are probabilistic.
3002680	3011640	Meaning their gene expression can be influenced. Now, whether they're influenced only by other
3011640	3019000	biological variables or other genetic variables or environmental or cultural variables,
3019000	3027000	that's where the controversy comes in. And we can discuss that in more detail if you like.
3027080	3036120	But to go to the question about better, people better, there's zero evidence that smart people
3036840	3046680	are better with respect to important aspects of life, like honesty, even likability.
3047880	3053320	I'm sure you know many very intelligent people who are not terribly likable or terribly kind
3053320	3059720	or terribly honest. Is there something to be said? So one of the things I've recently reread
3059720	3067880	for the second time, I guess that's what the word reread means, the rise and fall of the third
3067880	3076440	Reich, which is I think the best telling of the rise and fall of Hitler. And one of the interesting
3076440	3092280	things about the people that, how should I say it, justified or maybe propped up the ideas
3092280	3099160	that Hitler put forward is the fact that they were extremely intelligent. They were in the
3099160	3109400	intellectual class. It was obvious that they thought very deeply and rationally about the world.
3109400	3115960	So what I would like to say is one of the things that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities
3115960	3123640	in the history of humanity have been committed by very intelligent people. So that means that
3123720	3132680	intelligence doesn't make you a good person. I wonder if there's a g-factor for intelligence.
3132680	3139640	I wonder if there's a g-factor for goodness. The Nietzschean good and evil, of course that's
3139640	3144200	probably harder to measure because it's such a subjective thing, what it means to be good.
3145240	3150280	And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing because how do we know?
3151160	3157000	But it's independent, whatever it is, it's independent of intelligence. So I agree with you
3157000	3165800	about that. But let me say this, I have also asserted my belief that more intelligence is
3165800	3175320	better than less. It doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people, but all things being
3175320	3181160	equal, would you like to be smarter or less smart? So if I had a pill, I have two pills,
3181160	3185480	I said, this one will make you smarter, this one will make you dumber. Which one would you like?
3186360	3190760	Are there any circumstances under which you would choose to be dumber? Well, let me ask you this.
3191480	3197800	That's a very nuanced and interesting question. You know, there's been books written about this,
3197800	3203720	right? Now we'll return to the hard questions, the interesting questions, but let me ask about
3203720	3214200	human happiness. Does intelligence lead to happiness? No. So, okay, so back to the pill then.
3214920	3225720	So why, when would you take the pill? So you said IQ 80, 90, 100, 110, you start going through the
3225800	3236200	quartiles and is it obvious, isn't there diminishing returns and then it starts becoming negative?
3237240	3247400	This is an empirical question. And so that I have advocated in many forums more research
3248200	3255320	on enhancing the g-factor. Right now there's, there have been many claims about enhancing
3255320	3261320	intelligence with, you mentioned the NVAC training, it was a big deal a few years ago,
3261320	3267800	it doesn't work. Data is very clear, it does not work. Or doing like memory tests, like training
3267800	3275160	and so on. Yeah, it may give you a better memory in the short run, but it doesn't impact your g-factor.
3278120	3283880	It was very popular a couple of decades ago that the idea that listening to Mozart
3284520	3289080	could make you more intelligent. There was a paper published on this with somebody I knew
3289080	3295800	published this paper, intelligence researchers never believed it for a second, been hundreds of
3295800	3301480	studies, all the meta-analyses, all the summaries and so on, show it, there's nothing to it,
3302200	3311480	nothing to it at all. But wouldn't it be something, wouldn't it be world-shaking
3312680	3316840	if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence, which we haven't really talked
3316840	3322360	about yet, but IQ scores and the g-factor is thought to be a normal distribution,
3322680	3332360	and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter. Even a half a standard deviation would
3332360	3341400	be world-shaking, because there are many social problems, many, many social problems that are
3341400	3350280	exacerbated by people with lower ability to reason stuff out and navigate everyday life.
3351240	3358520	I wonder if there's a threshold. So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting
3359320	3366280	of the normal distribution may not be the optimal way of shifting. Maybe it's better to
3367160	3373880	whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions is like really pushing the lower up versus
3374760	3380920	trying to make the people at the average more intelligent. So you're saying that if in fact
3380920	3386920	there was some way to increase g, let's just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,
3387640	3395160	we should only give it to people at the lower end. No, it's just intuitively I can see that
3395160	3402040	life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased. It becomes less and less, it is
3402040	3408280	a empirical scientific question, but it becomes less and less obvious to me that more intelligence
3409240	3417320	is better. At the high end, not because it would make life easier, but it would make
3417880	3425320	whatever problems you're working on more solvable. And if you are working on artificial
3425320	3433160	intelligence, there's a tremendous potential for that to improve society.
3433160	3439880	I understand. So at whatever problems you're working on, yes, but there's also the problem
3439880	3447720	of the human condition. There's love, there's fear and all of those beautiful things that sometimes
3447720	3451480	if you're good at solving problems, you're going to create more problems for yourself.
3452040	3458280	It's, I'm not exactly sure. So ignorance is bliss is a thing. So there might be a place,
3458280	3463640	there might be a sweet spot of intelligence, given your environment, given your personality,
3463640	3468680	all of those kinds of things. And that becomes less beautifully complicated, the more and more
3468680	3474600	intelligent you become. But that's a question for literature and not for science perhaps.
3474600	3480600	Well, imagine this, imagine there was an IQ pill and it was developed by a private company.
3481560	3488760	And they are willing to sell it to you. And whatever price they put on it, you are willing
3488760	3493640	to pay it because you would like to be smarter. Yes. But just before they give you a pill,
3494200	3504120	they give you a disclaimer form to sign. Yes. Don't hold us, you understand that this pill
3504120	3508440	has no guarantee that your life is going to be better. And in fact, it could be worse.
3509240	3514360	Well, yes, that's how lawyers work. But I would love for science to answer the question,
3515080	3517800	to try to predict if your life is going to be better or worse,
3518520	3523160	when you become more, more or less intelligent. It's a, it's a fascinating question
3523160	3525560	about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.
3527480	3533240	Some of the things we see as bugs might be actually features may be crucial to our
3534200	3539960	overall happiness. Our limitations might lead to more happiness than less. But again,
3539960	3546360	more intelligence is better at the lower end. That's more, that's something that's less arguable
3546360	3551560	and, and, and, and fascinating if possible to increase. But you know, there's virtually no
3551560	3559000	research that's based on a neuroscience approach to solving that problem. All the solutions that
3559000	3566760	have been proposed to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem are essentially based
3566760	3573960	on the blank slate assumption that, you know, enriching the environment, removing barriers,
3574600	3579560	all good things, by the way, I'm not against any of those things. But there's no empirical evidence
3579560	3587160	that they're going to improve the general reasoning ability or make people more employable.
3587720	3590280	Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.
3591720	3594280	That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.
3596040	3601480	There are many profound aspects of that story. It was a film that was very good.
3602920	3607160	The film was called Charlie for the younger people who are listening to this.
3608680	3614920	You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something, but it was a story about
3615800	3622440	a person with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure in the brain and he slowly
3622440	3632680	became a genius. And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary. It's a fascinating story,
3632680	3638280	really. That goes in contrast to the basic human experience that each of us individually have,
3638280	3645240	but it raises the question of the full range of people you might be able to be,
3646680	3651560	given different levels of intelligence. You've mentioned the normal distribution.
3652760	3660040	So let's talk about it. There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994, written by psychologist
3660120	3666920	Richard Hearnstein and political scientist Charles Murray. Why was this book so controversial?
3668520	3675240	This is a fascinating book. I know Charles Murray. I've had many conversations with him.
3675240	3683800	Yeah, what is the book about? The book is about the importance of intelligence in everyday life.
3684200	3692840	That's what the book is about. It's an empirical book. It has statistical analyses of very large
3692840	3701560	databases that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent are correlated to all kinds of
3701560	3711960	social problems and social benefits. And that in itself is not where the controversy about
3711960	3719240	that book came. The controversy was about one chapter in that book. And that is a chapter about
3719240	3725880	the average difference in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans.
3726760	3731960	And these are the terms that were used in the book at the time and are still used to some extent.
3732920	3746840	And historically, or really for decades, it has been observed that disadvantaged groups
3748040	3758200	score on average lower than Caucasians on academic tests, tests of mental ability,
3758200	3764200	and especially on IQ tests. And the difference is about a standard deviation, which is about 15
3764200	3773560	points, which is a substantial difference. In the book, Hearnstein and Murray in this one chapter
3774120	3784920	assert clearly and unambiguously that whether this average difference is due to genetics or not,
3785560	3792360	they are agnostic. They don't know. Moreover, they assert they don't care because you wouldn't
3792360	3798440	treat anybody differently knowing that if there was a genetic component or not, because that's a
3798440	3805000	group average finding. Every individual has to be treated as an individual. You can't make any
3805000	3812360	assumption about what that person's intellectual ability might be from the fact of an average
3812360	3822200	group difference. They're very clear about this. Nonetheless, people took away, I'm going to choose
3822200	3828200	my words carefully because I have a feeling that many critics didn't actually read the book,
3829000	3833880	they took away that Hearnstein and Murray were saying that blacks are genetically inferior.
3834840	3840280	That was the take home message. And if they weren't saying it, they were implying it because they had
3840280	3849560	a chapter that discussed this empirical observation of a difference. And isn't this horrible?
3850440	3862680	And so the reaction to that book was incendiary. What do we know about from that book and the
3862680	3872360	research beyond about race differences and intelligence? It's still the most incendiary
3872360	3880280	topic in psychology. Nothing has changed that. Anybody who even discusses it is easily called
3880280	3887400	a racist just for discussing it. It's become fashionable to find racism in any discussion
3888360	3898840	like this. It's unfortunate. The short answer to your question is there's been very little
3898840	3910440	actual research on this topic since the Belcher, even before. This really became incendiary in
3910440	3917960	1969 with an article published by an educational psychologist named Arthur Jensen. Let's just
3917960	3924200	take a minute and go back to that to see the bell curve in a little bit more historical perspective.
3924840	3934280	Arthur Jensen was an educational psychologist at UC Berkeley. I knew him as well. And in 1969
3934280	3943000	or 1968, the Harvard Educational Review asked him to do a review article on the
3944680	3953320	early childhood education programs that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.
3954680	3961160	This was before the federally funded Head Start program. Head Start had not really gotten underway
3961160	3967400	at the time Jensen undertook his review of what were a number of demonstration programs.
3968600	3975640	And these demonstration programs were for young children around kindergarten age,
3975640	3982360	and they were specially designed to be cognitively stimulating, to provide lunches,
3983080	3991720	do all the things that people thought would minimize this average gap of intelligence tests.
3991720	3999160	There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists that the cause of the gap was
3999160	4006440	unequal opportunity due to racism, due to all negative things in the society. And if you could
4007400	4014680	compensate for this, the gap would go away. So early childhood education back then was called
4014680	4022280	literally compensatory education. Jensen looked at these programs. He was an empirical guy. He
4022280	4032040	understood psychometrics. And he wrote a, it was over 100 page article detailing these programs
4032120	4038120	and the flaws in their research design. Some of the programs reported IQ gains of
4038120	4045400	on average five points, but a few reported 10, 20, and even 30 point gains. One was called the
4045400	4053560	miracle in Milwaukee. That investigator went to jail ultimately for fabricating data. But the
4053560	4059400	point is that Jensen wrote an article that said, look, the opening sentence of this article is
4059400	4064120	classic. The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right, but it's,
4064120	4071240	we have tried compensatory education and it has failed. And he showed that these games
4072680	4079720	were essentially nothing. You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all from these
4079720	4088120	really earnest efforts to increase IQ. But he went a step further, a fateful step further.
4088680	4095880	He said, not only have these efforts failed, but because they have had essentially no impact,
4095880	4102040	we have to re-examine our assumption that these differences are caused by environmental things
4102040	4109160	that we can address with education. We need to consider a genetic influence, whether there's
4109160	4113960	a genetic influence on this group difference. So you said that this is one of the more
4113960	4119640	controversial works ever. I think it's the most infamous paper in all of psychology,
4119640	4128280	I would go on to say. Because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy on this question.
4128280	4132120	Skimpy and controversial. It's always been controversial, but it was even skimpy and
4132120	4139080	controversial. It's kind of a long story that I go into a little bit in more detail in the book
4139080	4146520	Neuroscience of Intelligence. But to say he was vilified is an understatement. I mean,
4146520	4154040	he couldn't talk at the American Psychological Association without bomb threats clearing the
4154040	4161320	lecture hall. Campus security watched him all the time. They opened his mail. He had to retreat
4161320	4170440	to a different address. This was one of the earliest kinds, this is before the internet,
4170440	4182040	and kind of internet social media mobs. But it was that intense. And I have written that overnight,
4182760	4188920	after the publication of this article, all intelligence research became radioactive.
4189800	4199640	Nobody wanted to talk about it. And then nobody was doing more research. And then
4199640	4206520	the bell curve came along. And the Jensen controversy was dying down. I have stories that
4206520	4211640	Jensen told me about his interaction with the Nixon White House on this issue. I mean, it was,
4211640	4217800	this was like a really big deal. It was some unbelievable stories, but he told me this,
4217800	4225480	so I kind of believe these stories. Nonetheless, 25 years later, 25 years later, all the silence
4225480	4233720	basically saying, you know, this nobody wants to do this kind of research. There's so much pressure,
4233720	4242440	so much attack against this kind of research. And here's sort of a bold, stupid, crazy people that
4242440	4247640	decided to dive right back in. I wonder how much discussion that was, do we include this chapter
4247640	4256200	or not? Murray has said they discussed it, and they felt they should include it. And they were
4256200	4265400	very careful in the way they wrote it, which did them no good. So as a matter of fact, when the
4265400	4273160	bell curve came out, it was so controversial. I got a call from a television show called Nightline,
4273160	4279800	it was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel, who had this evening show, I think it was on late at
4279800	4287080	night, talked about news, it was a straight up news thing. And producer called and asked if I would
4287080	4294920	be on it to talk about the bell curve. And I said, you know, she asked me what I thought
4294920	4299880	about the bell curve as a book. I said, look, it's a very good book. It talks about the role of
4299880	4307080	intelligence in society. And she said, no, no, what do you think about the chapter on race?
4307080	4313000	That's what we want you to talk about. I remember this conversation. I said, well,
4315240	4322520	she said, what would you say if you were on TV? And I said, well, what I would say is that it's
4322520	4329240	not at all clear if there's any genetic component to intelligence,
4331960	4338760	any differences. But if there were a strong genetic component, that would be a good thing.
4341080	4347000	And, you know, complete silence on the other end of the phone. And she said, well, what do you mean?
4347960	4355160	And I said, well, if it's the more genetic any difference is, the more it's biological. And
4355160	4361720	if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it. I see. That's interesting. She said,
4361720	4367240	would you say that on television? Yes. I said, no. And so that was the end of that.
4367240	4381240	So that's for more like biology is within the reach of science. And the environment is a public
4381240	4389000	policy, social and all those kinds of things. From your perspective, whichever one you think
4389000	4395560	is more amenable to solutions in the short term is the one that excites you. But you're saying
4395560	4410280	that it's good. The truth of genetic differences, no matter what the between groups is a painful,
4411560	4417960	harmful, potentially, potentially dangerous thing. So let me ask you to this question,
4417960	4421880	whether it's Bell Curve or any research on race differences,
4425000	4430760	can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world? Can that be used to increase the
4430760	4436200	amount of hate in the world? Do you think about this kind of stuff? I've thought about this a lot,
4436200	4446840	not as a scientist, but as a person. And my sense is, there is such enormous
4447960	4455560	reservoirs of hate and racism that have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data
4456520	4465800	that speak against that. No, I don't want to give racist groups of veto power over what
4465800	4473240	scientists study. If you think that the differences, and by the way, virtually no one disagrees that
4473240	4480280	there are differences in scores, it's all about what causes them and how to fix it. So if you
4480280	4488040	think this is a cultural problem, then you must ask the problem, do you want to change anything
4488040	4494040	about the culture? Or are you okay with the culture because you don't feel it's appropriate to change
4494040	4499960	a person's culture? So are you okay with that and the fact that that may lead to disadvantages in
4499960	4507400	school achievement? It's a question. If you think it's environmental, what are the environmental
4507960	4515880	parameters that can be fixed? I'll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the atmosphere,
4515880	4523080	lead in paint, lead in water. That's an environmental toxin that society has the means to
4523720	4528200	eliminate, and they should. Yeah, just to sort of try and define some
4529640	4537640	insight and conclusion to this very difficult topic. Is there been research on environment
4537640	4541240	versus genetics, nature versus nurture on this question of race differences?
4544280	4549480	No one wants to do this research. First of all, it's hard research to do. Second of all, it's a
4549480	4554520	minefield. No one wants to spend their career on it. Tenured people don't want to do it,
4554520	4562360	let alone students. The way I talk about it, well, before I tell you the way I talk about it,
4562360	4568040	I want to say one more thing about Jensen. He was once asked by a journalist straight out,
4568040	4575400	are you a racist? His answer was very interesting. His answer was, I've thought about that a lot,
4575720	4583640	and I've concluded it doesn't matter. Now, I know what he meant by this.
4583640	4585800	The guts to say that. Wow.
4585800	4590440	He was a very unusual person. I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome to tell you the
4590440	4596040	truth, because I saw him in many circumstances. He would be canceled on Twitter immediately
4596040	4600680	with that sentence. Yeah, but what he meant was he had a hypothesis,
4601640	4607800	yeah, and with respect to group differences, he called it the default hypothesis. He said,
4607800	4613400	whatever factors affect individual intelligence are likely the same factors that affect group
4613400	4620200	differences. It was the default, but it was a hypothesis. It should be tested, and if it turned
4620200	4625560	out, empirical test didn't support the hypothesis, he was happy to move on to something else.
4626360	4635160	He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal, that it's an empirical question.
4635960	4638680	We should look at it, and let's see what happens.
4638680	4644520	The scientific method cannot be racist from his perspective. It doesn't matter what the
4644520	4651960	scientists, if they follow the scientific method, it doesn't matter what they believe.
4651960	4658600	And if they are biased, and they consciously or unconsciously bias the data,
4659400	4667480	other people will come along to replicate it, they will fail, and the process over time will work.
4668120	4675960	So let me push back on this idea, because psychology to me is full of gray areas,
4676200	4684360	and what I've observed about psychology, even replication crisis aside, is that
4684920	4690680	something about the media, something about journalism, something about the virality of
4690680	4700600	ideas in the public sphere, they misinterpret. They take up things from studies willfully or
4700600	4708920	from ignorance misinterpret findings, and tell narratives around that. I personally believe,
4708920	4714680	for me, I'm not saying that broadly about science, but for me, it's my responsibility to
4714680	4722200	anticipate the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted. So I've had, I thought about
4722200	4731720	this a lot, because I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles, and cars, people dying cars.
4732840	4738840	There's people that have written me letters saying emails, nobody writes letters, I wish they did,
4739880	4745000	that have blood in my hands, because of things that I would say positive or negative, there's
4745000	4750680	consequences. In the same way, when you're a researcher of intelligence, I'm sure you might get
4750760	4758040	emails, or at least people might believe that finding your study is going to be used by a
4758040	4763880	large number of people to increase the amount of hate in the world. I think there's some
4763880	4772120	responsibility on scientists, but for me, I think there's a great responsibility to anticipate the
4772120	4778840	ways things will be misinterpreted. And there you have to, first of all, decide whether you want
4778840	4785560	to say a thing at all, or do the study at all, publish the study at all, and to the words with
4785560	4793080	which you explain it. I find this on Twitter a lot, actually, which is when I write a tweet,
4793080	4801720	and I'm usually just doing it so innocently, I'll write it, it takes me like five seconds to write
4801720	4808120	it, or whatever, 30 seconds to write it, and then I'll think, all right, I'll close my eyes, open,
4808120	4813080	and try to see how will the world interpret this? What are the ways in which this will be
4813080	4820760	misinterpreted? And I'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see, yeah, so in my mind, it's clear,
4820760	4825400	but that's because it's my mind from which this tweet came, but you have to think in a fresh
4825400	4835000	mind that sees this, and it's spread across a large number of other minds, how will the interpretation
4835080	4841000	morph? I mean, for a tweet, this is a silly thing, it doesn't matter, but for a scientific
4842520	4848760	paper and study and finding, I think it matters. So I don't know, I don't know what your thoughts
4848760	4855960	about that, because maybe for Jensen, the data is there, what do you want me to do? This is a
4855960	4862120	scientific process has been carried out. If you think the data was polluted by bias,
4862120	4871320	do other studies that reveal the bias, but the data is there? I'm not a poet,
4872280	4877400	I'm not a literary writer, what do you want me to do? I'm just presenting you the data.
4877400	4881080	What do you think on that spectrum? What's the role of a scientist?
4881080	4889240	The reason I do podcasts, the reason I write books for the public is to explain what I think
4889240	4896680	the data mean and what I think the data don't mean. I don't do very much on Twitter other than to
4896680	4903720	retweet references to papers, I don't think it's my role to explain these because they're complicated,
4903720	4914280	they're nuanced, but when you decide not to do a scientific study or not to publish a result,
4914280	4921000	because you're afraid the result could be harmful or insensitive,
4921720	4929880	that's not an unreasonable thought, and people will make different conclusions and decisions
4929880	4936920	about that. I wrote about this, I'm the editor of a journal called Intelligence,
4936920	4943080	which publishes scientific papers. Sometimes we publish papers on group differences,
4944040	4949480	those papers sometimes are controversial. These papers are written for a scientific audience,
4949480	4955240	they're not written for the Twitter audience, so I don't promote them very much on Twitter,
4957480	4965800	but in a scientific paper you have to now choose your words carefully also because those papers
4965800	4973800	are picked up by non-scientists, by writers of various kinds, and you have to be available to
4973800	4982600	discuss what you're saying and what you're not saying. Sometimes you are successful at having
4982600	4990440	a good conversation like we are today that doesn't start out pejorative. Other times I've been asked
4990440	4997400	to participate in debates where my role would be to justify race science. Well, you can see,
4998040	5005000	you start out, and that was a BBC request that I received.
5005560	5011800	I have so much, it's a love-hate relationship, mostly hate with these shallow journalism
5011800	5019480	organizations, so they would want to use you as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate as to
5019720	5025880	there is race differences between groups and make that into a debate and put you in a role of...
5027720	5031000	Justifying racism, that's what they're asking me to do.
5031000	5035480	...forces like educating about this field of the science of intelligence.
5035480	5042840	Yeah, I want to say one more thing before we get off the normal distribution. You also asked me,
5042840	5049480	what is the science after the bell curve? And the short answer is there's not much new work,
5049480	5055240	but whatever work there is supports the idea that there still are group differences.
5056280	5060360	It's arguable whether those differences have diminished at all or not,
5061720	5068120	and there is still a major problem in underperformance for school achievement.
5069080	5076200	For many disadvantaged and minority students, and there so far is no way to fix it.
5077240	5083640	What do we do with this information? Is this now a task? Now, we'll talk about the future
5085560	5091080	on the neuroscience and the biology side, but in terms of this information as a society,
5091080	5095080	in the public policy, in the political space, in the social space, what do we do with this
5095080	5102600	information? I've thought a lot about this. The first step is to have people interested in policy
5103240	5109800	understand what the data actually show to pay attention to intelligence data.
5109800	5116680	You can read policy papers about education, and using your word processor, you can search for
5116680	5123080	the word intelligence. You can search a 20,000 word document in a second and find out the word
5123080	5131480	intelligence does not appear anywhere in most discussions about what to do about achievement
5131480	5137640	gaps. I'm not talking about test gaps. I'm talking about actual achievement gaps in schools, which
5137640	5143080	everyone agrees is a problem. The word intelligence doesn't appear among educators.
5143880	5146600	That's fascinating. As a matter of fact, in California,
5147560	5153720	there has been tremendous controversy about recent attempts to revise the curriculum for math
5154360	5161320	in high schools. We had a Stanford professor of education who was running this review
5161960	5170600	assert there's no such thing as talent, a mathematical talent. She wanted to get rid of the
5170600	5176520	advanced classes in math because not everyone could do that. Of course, this has been very
5176520	5182280	controversial. They've retreated somewhat, but the idea that a university professor was in charge
5182280	5193560	of this who believes that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist, this is rather shocking,
5193560	5199320	let alone the complete absence of intelligence data. By the way, let me tell you something about
5199320	5207000	what the intelligence data show. Let's take a race out of it. Even though the origins of these
5207000	5215320	studies were a long time ago, I'm blocking on the name of the report, the Coleman report was a
5215320	5223480	famous report about education. They measured all kinds of variables about schools, about teachers,
5223480	5231880	and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome. They found the most predictive
5231880	5239000	variables of education outcome where the variables the student brought with him or her
5239000	5247240	into the school, essentially their ability. When you combine the school and the teacher
5247240	5252760	variables together, the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the
5252760	5258120	teachers, their education, you put all the teacher and school variables together, it barely
5258120	5268840	accounted for 10% of the variance. This has been replicated now. The best research we have
5269400	5277320	shows that school variables and teacher variables together account for about 10% of student academic
5277400	5285480	achievement. Now, you want to have some policy on improving academic achievement. How much money
5285480	5292440	do you want to put into teacher education? How much money do you want to put into the quality of
5292440	5297000	the school administration? You know who you can ask? You can ask the Gates Foundation,
5298040	5304120	because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that. At the end of it, because they're
5304120	5309560	measurement people, they want to know the data. They found it had no impact at all,
5309560	5320120	and they've pulled out of that program. Boy, let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's
5321320	5326600	just the two of us. Just the two of us, but I'm going to say some funny and ridiculous things.
5327480	5332840	You're surely not approving of it, but there's a movie called Clerks.
5334520	5341080	I've seen it. There's a funny scene in there where a lovely couple are talking about the
5341080	5349560	number of previous sexual partners they had. The woman says that, I believe she just had a handful,
5349560	5354120	like two or three or something like that, sexual partners, but then she also mentioned
5355080	5362520	that she, what's that called, a fallacious? What's the scientific? She gave a blow job
5363080	5374040	to 37 guys, I believe it is. That has to do with the truth. Sometimes knowing the truth
5375880	5381880	can get in the way of a successful relationship of love of some of the human flourishing.
5382840	5388520	And that seems to me that's at the core here, that facing some kind of
5389320	5395560	truth that's not able to be changed, it makes it difficult to sort of
5397400	5404840	is limiting as opposed to empowering. That's the concern. If you sort of test for intelligence
5404920	5410520	and lay the data out, it feels like you will give up on certain people. You will
5412120	5418920	sort of start bidding people as like, well, this person is like, let's focus on the average people
5418920	5424680	or let's focus on the very intelligent people. That's the concern. And there's a kind of
5425800	5433000	intuition that if we just don't measure and we don't use that data, that we would treat everybody
5433000	5440600	equal and give everybody equal opportunity. If we have the data in front of us, we're likely to
5441240	5449320	misdistribute the amount of sort of attention we allocate, resources we allocate to people.
5449320	5457080	That's probably the concern. It's a realistic concern, but I think it's a misplaced concern
5457640	5462840	if you want to fix the problem. If you want to fix the problem, you have to know what the
5462840	5469560	problem is. Now, let me tell you this. Let's go back to the bell curve, not the bell curve,
5469560	5478440	but the normal distribution. 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,
5480360	5485960	which means they're very hard. If you have an IQ under 85, it's very hard to find gainful
5485960	5496040	employment at a salary that sustains you at least minimally in modern life. Not impossible,
5496040	5505640	but it's very difficult. 16% of the population of the United States is about 51 or 52 million people
5505640	5515640	with IQs under 85. This is not a small issue. 14 million children have IQs under 85.
5517960	5523640	Is this something we want to ignore? Does this have any, what is the Venn diagram between,
5524360	5530680	you know, when you have people with IQs under 85 and you have achievement in school
5531400	5539560	or achievement in life? There's a lot of overlap there. This is why, to go back to the IQ pill,
5539560	5551080	if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end, that would have a big impact.
5551640	5556040	If I could maybe before we talk about the impact on life and so on,
5556760	5562520	some of the criticisms of the bell curve. So Stephen Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve
5562520	5567960	rests on four incorrect assumptions. It would be just interesting to get your thoughts on the four
5567960	5573400	assumptions, which are intelligence must be reducible to a single number, intelligence must
5573400	5579560	be capable of rank ordering people in a linear order, intelligence must be primarily genetically
5579560	5586840	based and intelligence must be essentially immutable. Maybe not as criticisms, but as
5587960	5592760	thoughts about intelligence. Yeah, we could spend a lot of time on him.
5593640	5605000	Stephen Jay Gould, yeah. He wrote that in what about 1985, 1984. His views were overtly political,
5605000	5610600	not scientific. He was a scientist, but his views on this were overtly political,
5610600	5618200	and I would encourage people listening to this if they really want to understand his criticisms.
5618840	5628920	They should just Google what he had to say and Google the scientific reviews of his book,
5629640	5635480	the mismeasure of man, and they will take these statements apart. They were wrong,
5636040	5643160	not only were they wrong, but when he asserted in his first book that there was no biological
5643160	5651560	basis essentially to IQ. By the time the second edition came around, there were studies of MRIs
5651560	5657720	of showing that brain size, brain volume were correlated to IQ scores, which he declined to
5657720	5666040	put in his book. I'm learning a lot today. I didn't know the extent of his work. I was just
5666040	5670920	using a few little snippets of criticism. That's interesting. There's a battle here. He wrote
5670920	5676280	a book, Mismeasure of Man, that's missing a lot of the scientific grounding.
5676280	5681960	His book is highly popular in colleges today. You can find it in any college bookstore under
5681960	5686600	assigned reading. It's highly popular. The Mismeasure of Man? Yes, highly influential.
5686600	5691400	Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man? I'm undereducated about this. Is this the book
5691400	5696600	basically criticizing the ideas in the bulk of it? Yes, where those four things came from.
5697480	5706360	It is really a book that was really taken apart point by point by a number of people who actually
5706360	5711320	understood the data. He didn't care. He didn't care. He didn't modify anything.
5711400	5717960	It's a politically... Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic, like I said, I believe
5721480	5729640	the impact of the work as it is misinterpreted has to be considered because it's not just
5729640	5733400	going to be scientific discourse. It's going to be political discourse. There's going to be
5733960	5740440	debates. There's going to be politically motivated people that would use messages in
5740440	5751400	each direction, make something like the bulk of the enemy or the support for one's racist beliefs.
5753720	5759640	I think you have to consider that, but it's difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler to
5760840	5767560	justify a lot of his beliefs. It's not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler
5768040	5774440	or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil, but there's a balance there.
5775400	5780680	This is really interesting. I didn't know. Is there any criticism of the book you find compelling
5780680	5784840	or interesting or challenging to use from a scientific perspective? There were factual
5784840	5792600	criticisms about the nature of the statistics that were used, the statistical analyses. These
5792600	5798600	were more technical criticisms. They were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles where he took
5798600	5805800	all the criticisms and spoke to them. People listening to this podcast can certainly find all
5805800	5813080	those online. It's very interesting, but Murray went on to write some additional books, two in
5813080	5819400	the last couple of years. One about human diversity, where he goes through the data
5820200	5829320	refuting the idea that race is only a social construct with no biological meaning. He discusses
5829320	5834840	the data. It's a very good discussion. You don't have to agree with it, but he presents data in a
5834840	5841480	cogent way. He talks about the critics of that and he talks about their data in a cogent,
5841480	5848840	not personal way. It's a very informative discussion. The book is called Human Diversity.
5848840	5853400	He talks about race and he talks about gender, same thing, about sex differences.
5854600	5861320	And more recently, he's written what might be his final say on this, a book called Facing Reality,
5863000	5870360	where he talks about this again. He can certainly defend himself. He doesn't need me
5871080	5877480	to do that, but I would urge people who have heard about him and the bell curve
5878120	5885240	and who think they know what's in it. You are likely incorrect and you need to read it for yourself.
5886280	5894120	But it is scientifically, it's a serious subject. It's a difficult subject. Ethically,
5894120	5900680	it's a difficult subject. Everything you said here calmly and thoughtfully is difficult. This
5900680	5907800	is difficult for me to even consider that g-factor exists. I don't mean from like,
5907800	5915160	that somehow g-factors inherently racist or sexist or whatever. It's just, it's difficult in the way
5915160	5921400	that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult, that we are limited by our biology.
5921960	5928760	It's difficult. And it's, at least from an American perspective, you would like to believe
5928760	5936680	that everything is possible in this world. Well, that leads us to what I think we should
5936680	5945480	do with this information. And what I think we should do with this information is unusual.
5946440	5953480	Uh-oh. Because I think what we need to do is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular
5953480	5963640	biology of learning and memory because one definition of intelligence is based on how
5963640	5969960	much you can learn and how much you can remember. Yes. And if you accept that definition of intelligence,
5970920	5977400	then there are molecular studies going on now and Nobel Prize is being won
5978200	5983960	on molecular biology or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory.
5985400	5992040	Now, the step those researchers, those scientists need to take when it comes to intelligence
5993000	6002760	is to focus on the concept of individual differences. Intelligence research has individual
6002760	6011080	differences as its heart because it assumes that people differ on this variable and those
6011080	6019720	differences are meaningful and need understanding. Cognitive psychologists who have morphed into
6019800	6026040	molecular biologists studying learning and memory hate the concept of individual differences
6026040	6033800	historically. Some now are coming around to it. I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner
6034760	6042040	for his work on memory and I asked him about individual differences and he said,
6042040	6049480	don't go there. It'll set us back 50 years. I said, don't you think they're the key though
6049480	6055960	to understand? Why can some people remember more than others? He said, you don't want to go there.
6055960	6060600	I think the 21st century will be remembered by the technology and the science that
6062120	6066760	goes to individual differences because we have now data. We have now the tools to much,
6066760	6073480	much better to start to measure, start to estimate, not just on the sort of through tests and IQ
6073480	6079640	test type of things, sort of outside the body kind of things, but measuring all kinds of stuff
6079640	6085400	about the body. So yeah, truly going to the molecular biology, to the neurobiology, to the
6085400	6096520	neuroscience. Let me ask you about this life. How does intelligence correlate with or lead to
6096760	6100760	or has anything to do with career success? You've mentioned these kinds of things and
6101960	6106680	is there any data, you had an excellent conversation with Jordan Peterson, for example.
6106680	6112680	Is there any data on what intelligent means for success in life?
6113400	6122040	Success in life. There is a tremendous amount of validity data that looked at
6122920	6133720	intelligence test scores and various measures of life success. Now, of course, life success is a
6133720	6145320	pretty broad topic and not everybody agrees on what success means, but there's general agreement
6145320	6154360	on certain aspects of success that can be measured. And those including life expectancy,
6154360	6164680	like you said. Life expectancy. Now, there's life success. Life expectancy. I mean,
6165560	6172760	that is such an interesting finding, but IQ scores are also correlated to things like
6172840	6181960	income. Now, okay, so who thinks income means you're successful? That's not the point. The point
6181960	6190120	is that income is one empirical measure in this culture that says something about your level
6190120	6196920	of success. You can define success in ways that have nothing to do with income. You can define
6196920	6209720	success based on your evolutionary natural selection success. And even that, by the way,
6209720	6217560	is correlated to IQ in some studies. So, however you want to define success,
6219880	6226760	IQ is important. It's not the only determinant people get hung up on. Well, what about personality?
6226760	6233000	What about so-called emotional intelligence? Yes, all those things matter. The thing that matters
6233560	6240280	empirically, the single thing that matters the most is your general ability, your general mental
6240280	6248280	intellectual ability, your reasoning ability. And the more complex your vocation, the more complex
6248280	6256360	your job, the more G matters. G doesn't matter and a lot of occupations don't require complex thinking.
6257000	6262520	And there are occupations like that and G doesn't matter. Within an occupation,
6264040	6272760	the G might not matter so much. So that if you look at all the professors at MIT
6276360	6282280	and had a way to rank order them on, you know, there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying,
6283000	6289160	that, you know... Also, when you get past a certain threshold, then there's impact on wealth,
6289160	6294360	for example, or career success. However, that's defined in each individual discipline, but
6295080	6299480	after a certain point, it doesn't matter. Actually, it does matter in certain things. So,
6299480	6308120	for example, there is a very classic study that was started at Johns Hopkins when I was a graduate
6308120	6311800	student there. I actually worked on this study at the very beginning, the study of
6311800	6320040	Mathematically and Scientifically Precocious Youth. And they gave junior high school students,
6320040	6330360	age 11 and 12, the standard SAT math exam. And they found a very large number of students
6331320	6337560	scored very high on this exam, not a large number. I mean, they found many students when
6337560	6344200	they cast the net, all of Baltimore, they found a number of students who scored as high on the
6344200	6351960	SAT math when they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins freshmen. And they said, gee, now this
6351960	6361640	is interesting, what shall we do now? And on a case by case basis, they got some of those kids
6361640	6369320	into their local community college math programs. Many of those kids went on to be very successful.
6370200	6376040	And now there's a 50-year follow-up of those kids. And it turns out,
6377560	6385720	these kids were in the top 1%. Okay, so everybody in this study is in the top 1%. If you take that
6385800	6393720	group, that rarefied group and divide them into quartiles, so that you have the top 25% of the
6393720	6407960	top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%, you can find on measurable variables of success,
6407960	6414840	the top quartile does better than the bottom quartile. In the top 1%, they have more patents,
6414840	6420440	they have more publications, they have more tenure at universities. And this is based on,
6421240	6425000	you're dividing them based on their score at age 12.
6425880	6432200	I wonder how much interesting data is in the variability, in the differences.
6436360	6442040	That's very interesting, but it's also, I don't know, somehow painful. I don't know why it's so
6442040	6451080	painful, that that's so, that G-Facture so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.
6451080	6456520	This is interesting that you find that painful. Do you find it painful that people with charisma
6457160	6462920	are very successful, can be very successful in life, even though having no other attributes other
6462920	6470280	than their famous and people like them? Do you find that painful? Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.
6471080	6476120	So one of the things, again, this is like I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial,
6476680	6483080	but one of the things the psychologist, the personality psychologist, he can maybe speak
6483080	6490200	to this because he had interest in this for time, is she was saying that personality,
6492040	6499160	technically speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime. It's the thing you're,
6499160	6502680	I don't know if she was actually implying that you're born with it. Well, it's a trait.
6502680	6508920	It's a trait. It's a trait that's relatively stable over time. I think that's generally correct.
6508920	6515640	So do the degree your personality is stable over time? Yes, that too is painful,
6516760	6523320	because what's not painful is the thing, if I'm fat, not of shape, I can exercise
6524280	6532360	and become healthier in that way. If my diet is a giant mess and that's resulting in some kind of
6533080	6537000	conditions that my body is experiencing, I can fix that by having a better diet.
6538040	6545400	That's sort of my actions, my willed actions can make a change. If charisma is part of the
6545400	6551480	personality, that's the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that is stable.
6551880	6558520	Well, yeah, yeah, that's painful too, because it's like, oh, shit, I'm stuck with this. I'm
6558520	6565160	stuck with this. Well, I mean, this pretty much generalizes to every aspect of your being. This
6565160	6570360	is who you are. You've got to deal with it. And what it undermines, of course, is a realistic
6570360	6581320	appreciation for this undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country that if you work
6581320	6588040	hard, you can be anything you want to be, which has morphed from the original idea that if you
6588040	6597560	work hard, you can be successful. Those are two different things. And now we have, if you work
6597560	6605080	hard, you can be anything you want to be. This is completely unrealistic. I'm sorry, it just is.
6605080	6610920	Now you can work hard and be successful. There's no question. But you know what? I could work
6610920	6617960	very hard and I am not going to be a successful theoretical physicist. I'm just not.
6618680	6624040	That said, I mean, we should, because we had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat
6624040	6631640	the fact that you're not going to be a theoretical physicist. It's not judgment on your basic
6631640	6639640	humanity. Returning again to the old men, which means men and women are created equal. So again,
6639640	6644440	some of the differences we're talking about in quote unquote, success, wealth,
6644680	6654840	number of, whether you win a Nobel Prize or not, that doesn't put a measure on your basic
6654840	6663000	humanity and basic value and even goodness of you as a human being. Because that,
6664120	6672840	that your basic role and value in society is largely within your control. It's some of these
6672920	6677880	measures that we're talking about. It's good. It's good to remember this.
6679320	6686200	One question about the Flynn effect. What is it? Are humans getting smarter over the years,
6686200	6693480	over the decades, over the centuries? The Flynn effect is, James Flynn passed away about a year
6693480	6706040	ago, published a set of analyses, going back a couple of decades, when he first noticed this,
6706040	6715480	that IQ scores, when you looked over the years, seemed to be drifting up. Now, this was not
6715480	6722840	unknown to the people who make the test, because they renorm the test periodically, and they have
6722840	6731400	to renorm the test periodically, because what 10 items correct meant relative to other people
6732520	6739560	50 years ago is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today. People are getting more
6739560	6746600	things correct. Now, the scores have been drifting up about three points, IQ scores have been drifting
6746600	6753320	up about three points per decade. This is not a personal effect. This is a cohort effect.
6753880	6759800	It's not for an individual, but- The world. How do you explain, so what's the definition?
6759800	6767000	This has presented intelligence researchers with a great mystery. Two questions. First,
6767000	6773800	is it effect on the 50% of the variance that's the G factor or on the other 50%
6773880	6782920	and there's evidence that it is a G factor effect. Second, what on earth causes this and
6782920	6789560	doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor cannot be genetic, because the scale of natural
6789560	6799080	selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. It's been used to try to undermine
6799080	6807480	the idea that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence, but certainly it can be the
6807480	6814520	Flynn effect can affect the non-genetic aspects of intelligence, because genes account for maybe
6814520	6823080	50% of the variance, maybe higher, it could be as high as 80% for adults, but let's just say 50%
6823080	6831400	for discussion. So, the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery. It's still a mystery. That's
6831400	6835480	interesting. It's still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out. I told you before I edited
6835480	6841160	a journal on intelligence and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn, so I'm
6841160	6848840	starting to see papers now. I'm really the latest research on this. I think most people who specialize
6848840	6856680	in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect are coming to the view based on data that
6856680	6865960	it has to do with advances in nutrition and healthcare. And there's also evidence that the
6865960	6875080	effect is slowing down and possibly reversing. Oh boy. So, how would nutrition, nutrition would
6875160	6882680	still be connected to the g-factor? So, nutrition as it relates to the g-factor, so the biology that
6882680	6891800	leads to the intelligence. Yes. That would be the claim. The hypothesis being tested by the
6891800	6900520	research. Yes, and there's some evidence from infants that nutrition has made a difference.
6900520	6907720	So, it's not an unreasonable connection, but does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence?
6907720	6915080	Not logically at all. But it is very interesting, so that if you take an IQ test today,
6916760	6925560	but you take the score and use the tables that were available in 1940, you're going to wind up
6925560	6935240	with a much higher IQ number. So, are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago? No,
6935240	6943720	but we might be able to solve problems a little better and make use of our g because of things
6943720	6950680	like Sesame Street and other curricula in school. More people are going to school,
6950920	6958360	so there are a lot of factors here to disentangle. It's fascinating though. It's fascinating that
6958360	6965960	there's not clear answers yet that as a population, we're getting smarter. When you just zoom out,
6965960	6970120	that's what it looks like as a population getting smarter. It's interesting to see what the effects
6970120	6975880	of that are. I mean, this raises the question. We've mentioned it many times, but haven't clearly
6975880	6982040	addressed it, which is nature versus nurture question. So, how much of intelligence is nature?
6982040	6987640	How much of it is nurture? How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment?
6987640	6993480	All of it. All of it is genetics. No, all of it is nature and nurture.
6994920	7003560	So, yes. Okay. But how much of the variance can you apportion to either?
7004520	7012200	Most of the people who work in this field say that the framing of that, if the question is framed
7012200	7018520	that way, it can't be answered because nature and nurture are not too independent influences.
7019240	7027080	They interact with each other and understanding those interactions is so complex that many
7027080	7035160	behavioral geneticists say it is today impossible and always will be impossible
7035160	7042280	to disentangle that no matter what kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic
7042280	7050760	informatics. But there's still to push back on that. That same intuition from behavioral geneticists
7051480	7055720	would lead me to believe that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor.
7057160	7063480	It's super complex. Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome,
7065080	7072360	but because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources of data, not just one study,
7072360	7082840	but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the idea that whatever interactions
7082840	7091320	between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated, they can be studied,
7092680	7099320	and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of intelligence.
7099320	7107880	Yes. And we'll do this exact question because doesn't the stability of the G factor give you
7107880	7113800	at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?
7113800	7122840	Yes. I think it's clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness
7122840	7135400	of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain that identical
7135400	7145720	twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores. These are all important observations
7146360	7154120	that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that there's a biological basis. And does anyone
7154120	7160120	believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain? I mean, it's so obvious.
7160920	7164440	Well, indirectly definitely has to do with it, but the question is
7165320	7173720	environment interacting with the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?
7174680	7184760	Well, some would say that the raw hardware of the brain as it develops from conception
7185560	7192920	through adulthood or at least through the childhood, that that so-called hardware that you
7192920	7202040	are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think, that it is
7202040	7210280	probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment and other
7210280	7220520	factors like that, including chance, that chance affects the way the neurons are connecting during
7220520	7231160	gestation. It's not, hey, it's pre-programmed. So there is pushback on the concept that genes
7231160	7239640	provide a blueprint, that it's a lot more fluid. Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot, a lot,
7240120	7251000	happens in the first few months of development. So for in nine months inside the mother's body,
7251000	7258520	and in the, you know, the months, the few months afterwards, there's a lot of fascinating stuff,
7258520	7266040	like including chance and luck, like you said, how things connect up. The question is afterwards,
7266040	7269880	the neuroplasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is relative to the environment,
7269880	7275960	how much that affects the g-factor, but that's where the whole conclusions of the studies that
7275960	7282840	we've been talking about is that seems to have less and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly.
7283800	7291240	Yes, and I do think there is more of a genetic, my view, and I'm not an expert on this, I mean,
7291240	7296680	genetics is a highly technical and complex subject. I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral
7296680	7306520	geneticist, but my reading of this, my interpretation of this, is that there is a genetic blueprint
7306520	7314120	more or less, and that has a profound influence on your subsequent intellectual development,
7314120	7321560	including the g-factor. And that's not to say things can't happen to, I mean,
7321560	7329400	if you think of that genes provide a potential, fine, and that various variables impact that
7329400	7338600	potential. And every parent of a newborn, implicitly or explicitly, wants to maximize that potential.
7339320	7345480	This is why you buy educational toys. This is why you pay attention to organic baby food.
7345480	7352440	This is why you do all these things because you want your baby to be as healthy and as smart as
7352440	7358680	possible. And every parent will say that. Is there a case to be made? Can you steal me on the case
7359640	7369240	that genetics is a very tiny component of all this, and the environment is essential?
7369240	7374760	I don't think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component. I think the data support the
7374760	7379960	idea that the genetics is a very important, and I don't say component, I say influence.
7381080	7386760	A very important influence, and the environment is a lot less than people believe.
7387640	7391480	Most people believe environment plays a big role. I'm not so sure.
7391480	7398120	I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where, what you just said, it might be wrong?
7398920	7407000	Can you imagine a world, and what kind of evidence would you need to see to say,
7407000	7412360	you know what, the intuition, the study so far, like reversing the direction. So one of the cool
7412360	7417880	things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data, and the rate of the data is
7419240	7425880	escalating because of the digital world. So when you start to look at a very large scale of data,
7427080	7431960	both from the biology side and the social side, we might be discovering some very counterintuitive
7431960	7439560	things about society. We might see the edge cases that reveal that if we actually scale those edge
7439560	7446840	cases, and they become like the norm, that we'll have a complete shift in our, like you'll see
7447960	7457560	g-factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens in later life. So in any case you
7457560	7462600	can make, or for where your current intuitions are wrong. Yes, and it's a good question because I
7462600	7468600	think everyone should always be asked, what evidence would change your mind? It's certainly,
7468600	7473880	not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working on any
7473880	7485320	aspect of science. I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly by
7485320	7492120	now. It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early
7492120	7497800	childhood education, all these things that have been earnestly tried and well-funded,
7497800	7503960	well-designed studies would show some effect, and they don't. They don't. What if school,
7503960	7510120	the way we've tried school, compensatory school sucks and we need to do better? That's what
7510120	7516760	everybody said to Jensen. He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier. Maybe we need not do
7517480	7523640	pre-kindergarten, but pre-pre-kindergarten. It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't get it
7523640	7533800	right. But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something would have
7533800	7540760	worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability level at 0.05
7540760	7547560	on some means. That's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.
7548600	7557480	Population level interventions like schooling that you would see, this actually has an effect.
7557480	7565160	Yes. When you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when those
7565160	7570600	adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their adoptive
7570600	7576840	parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents whom they've
7576840	7586120	never met. These are powerful observations. It would be convincing to you if the reverse was
7586120	7594280	true. Yes, that would be more. There is some data on adoption that indicates the adopted children
7594280	7604600	are moving a little bit more toward their adoptive parents. To me, the overwhelming, I have this
7604600	7610760	concept called the weight of evidence, where I don't interpret any one study too much. The weight
7610760	7615560	of evidence tells me genes are important. But what does that mean? What does it mean that
7615560	7622520	genes are important? Knowing that gene expression, genes don't express themselves in a vacuum.
7622520	7628520	They express themselves in an environment. The environment has to have something to do with it,
7628520	7635480	especially if the best genetic estimates of the amount of variance are around 50 or even if it's
7635480	7644840	as high as 80%, it still leaves 20% of non-genetic. Now, maybe that is all luck. Maybe that's all
7644840	7656200	chance. I could easily believe that. But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions,
7657320	7662680	and nothing works, including memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing
7662680	7668920	computer games, none of that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.
7668920	7677080	Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?
7677080	7687080	Yes. And there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents' IQ and the
7688600	7697160	high IQ parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child in addition to
7697160	7701880	the genes, it's that environment. So there are all these interactions that,
7703720	7710840	but think about the number of books in a household. This was a variable that's correlated
7710840	7720120	with IQ. It is. Yeah. Well, why? Especially if the kid never reads any of the books. It's because
7720840	7726760	more intelligent people have more books in their house. And if you're more intelligent,
7727800	7735080	and there's a genetic component to that, the child will get those genes or some of those genes,
7735080	7742200	as well as the environment. But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly
7742200	7749800	impacts the child. So the two scenarios on this are you find that, and this was used to
7750920	7757000	get rid of the SAT test, or the SAT scores highly correlated with the social economic status of the
7757000	7764040	parents. So all you're really measuring is how rich the parents are. Okay, well, why are the parents
7764040	7775720	rich? Yes. And so you could, the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright
7775720	7784360	make more money. They can afford homes in better neighborhoods, so their kids get better schools.
7784360	7790200	Now the kids grow up bright. Where in that chain of events does that come from?
7790760	7798840	Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design, where you look at siblings
7798840	7806600	that have the same biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that. Most studies
7806600	7814360	of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed design. So any
7814360	7821960	conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause of the IQ
7823000	7829560	is a stretch. And where you do find genetically informative designs,
7831000	7838760	you find most of the variance in your outcome measures are due to the genetic component,
7838760	7847080	and sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very much
7847080	7853880	variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance. So when you actually look at
7853880	7859800	it in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically informed designs,
7861000	7865320	but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.
7865320	7868520	Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between
7872280	7879480	fertility or the number of kids that you have and g-factor? So you know the kind of conventional
7879480	7887800	wisdom is people of maybe higher economic status or something like that or having fewer children.
7888520	7893880	I just loosely hear these kinds of things. Is there data that you're aware of in one direction
7893880	7898680	or another on this? Well, strange questions always get strange answers.
7900680	7904600	Yes. Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?
7904600	7911640	The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family,
7913640	7919800	the firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.
7920520	7927720	It's not clear that those studies hold up over time, and of course what you see also
7928360	7935160	is that families where there are multiple children, four, five, six, seven, you know,
7935160	7945560	really big families, the social economic status of those families usually in the modern age is
7945560	7951880	not that high. Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids,
7951880	7961240	I'm not sure exactly. But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility,
7962760	7970360	but I'm not sure that the data are very strong that the firstborn child is always the smartest.
7970360	7974280	It seems like there's some data to that, but I'm not current on that.
7974760	7977880	How would that be explained? That would be a nurture.
7978520	7983320	Well, it could be nurture, it could be in uterine environment. I mean,
7987400	7993800	and this is why this, you know, like many areas of science, you said earlier that
7993800	7998600	there are a lot of gray areas and no definitive answers.
7999080	8009400	This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem, the more questions you get,
8010280	8018440	not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated. And the idea that we have people
8018440	8026680	on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, that's pretty amazing.
8027640	8033080	And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang,
8033080	8038120	we can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.
8038760	8044280	I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.
8045720	8049400	It's unclear to me. I think we over emphasize.
8049400	8050920	Well, that's a very humbling statement.
8051720	8057320	Maybe it's very human centric egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super
8057320	8065000	complicated, but biology is a trick you want to unravel consciousness. What is that?
8067080	8072120	I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real
8073480	8080360	fundamental problems of the human brain. And therefore, I think they must be related.
8081480	8088920	Part problems like walk together, holding hands, kind of idea.
8088920	8094200	You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain
8094200	8099080	imaging, trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off when
8099080	8105480	someone loses consciousness? And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness
8105480	8111080	is regained? And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire. He was really brilliant
8111080	8117400	at this. These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography
8118360	8127160	long before fMRI. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain,
8127160	8131640	and the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up. And then you could make
8131640	8140840	a picture of glucose use in the brain. And he was amazing. He managed to do this in normal
8140840	8149640	volunteers he brought in and anesthetized as if they were going into surgery. He managed all
8149640	8159800	the human subjects requirements on this research. And he was brilliant at this. And what we did
8159800	8166520	is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions. On one occasion, he gave them
8166520	8176760	enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy. And on another occasion, they came in
8176760	8187000	and he fully anesthetized them. And he would say, Mike, can you hear me? And the person would say,
8187000	8198600	oh, yeah. And then we would scan people under no anesthetic condition. So the same person.
8199400	8207320	And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off. He subsequently
8207320	8213240	tried to do this with fMRI, which has a faster time resolution. And you could do it in real time
8213240	8217640	as the person went under and then regained consciousness where you couldn't do that with
8217640	8223240	PET. You had to have three different occasions. And the results were absolutely fascinating.
8223240	8228760	We did this with different anesthetic drugs. And different drugs impacted different parts of the
8228760	8235960	brain. So we were naturally looking for the common one. And it seemed to have something to do with
8235960	8244760	the thalamus and consciousness. This was actual data on consciousness. Real consciousness, actual
8244760	8251880	consciousness. What part of the brain turns on? What part of the brain turns off? It's not so clear.
8253000	8257880	But maybe it has something to do with the thalamus. The sequence of events seemed to
8257880	8264280	have the thalamus in it. Boy. Now here's the question. Are some people more conscious than
8264280	8270680	others? Are there individual differences in consciousness? And I don't mean it in the
8271720	8276920	psychedelic sense. I don't mean it in the political consciousness sense. I just mean it in everyday
8276920	8282680	life. Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others? And are those the people
8282680	8289720	we might actually label more intelligent? So now the other thing I was looking for is whether the
8289720	8294600	parts of the brain we were seeing in the anesthesia studies were the same parts of the
8294600	8301240	brain we were seeing in the intelligent studies. Now this is, you know, this was very complicated,
8301240	8306280	expensive research. We didn't really have funding to do this. We were trying to do it on the fly.
8306280	8313000	I'm not sure anybody has pursued this. You know, I'm retired now. He's gone on to other things.
8313880	8321000	But I think it's an area of research that would be fascinating to see the parts. There are a lot
8321000	8327000	more imaging studies now of consciousness. I'm just not up on them. But basically the question is
8327000	8334200	which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution, spatial and temporal way,
8334200	8341160	which part of the brain lights up when you're doing intelligence tasks? And which parts of the
8341160	8345000	brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and see the interplay between them?
8345720	8350920	Try to infer. That's the challenge of neuroscience. Without understanding deeply,
8352520	8358920	looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole thing works.
8359640	8365320	Well, imagine this. Here's a simple question. Does it take more anesthetic drug
8366280	8376920	to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is 140, than a person with an IQ of 70?
8378680	8386840	That's an interesting way to study it. If the answer to that is a stable yes,
8386840	8393080	that's very interesting. So I tried to find out. And I went to some anesthesiology textbooks
8393080	8404040	about how you dose and they dose by weight. And what I also learned, this is a little bit off
8404040	8413160	subject, anesthesiologists are never sure how deep you are. And they usually tell by poking you with
8413160	8419000	a needle and if you don't jump, they tell the surgeon to go ahead. I'm not sure that's literally
8419000	8426920	true, but it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are. It has to do with
8426920	8433960	the same kind of measurements that you're doing with the consciousness. It's difficult to know.
8434520	8439400	So I don't lose my train of thought. I couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by
8439400	8445880	intelligence. I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know. I said,
8445880	8454120	can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as a proxy for IQ?
8454120	8458840	Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make some
8458840	8464200	inferences as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school. Can we do a chart review?
8464200	8472040	And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose. And no, he said, no. So to this day,
8472600	8480280	the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high IQ
8481160	8487560	or less? Or less? It could go either way. Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of
8487560	8496920	intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic
8497400	8505160	and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was negatively
8505160	8511000	correlated to how well they did on the test, which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis,
8511000	8518360	which is still being studied today. And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain
8518440	8529080	information processing is more related to intelligence than just more activity.
8529080	8534520	Yeah, it'll be interesting. Again, it's the total hypothesis of how much in the relationship between
8534520	8542280	intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those two, if there's correlation, they could
8542280	8553640	be inversely correlated. Wouldn't that be funny? If you, the consciousness factor, the C factor
8553640	8562600	plus the G factor equals one. It's a nice trade off. You get a trade off, how deeply you experience
8562600	8569640	the world versus how deeply you're able to reason through the world. What a great hypothesis.
8570600	8573800	Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.
8573800	8580280	Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from an AI
8580280	8589080	perspective. I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but there's the famous touring
8589080	8597400	test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation of
8597960	8606840	intelligence that Alan Turing proposed. Basically conversation being, if you can fool a human to
8606840	8616360	think that a machine is a human that passes the test, I suppose you could do a similar thing
8619080	8626680	for humans. If I can fool you that I'm intelligent, then that's a good test of intelligence,
8627560	8639480	like you're talking to two people, and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.
8642280	8646440	It's an interesting test because yeah, maybe charisma can be very useful there,
8647320	8651080	and you're only allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.
8651640	8659320	All that to say is, what are good tests of intelligence for machines? What do you think
8659320	8662520	it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?
8663640	8671320	I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things, I rapidly reach
8671320	8682760	the limits of my knowledge and imagination. When Alexa first came out, and I think
8683960	8689720	there was a competing one, well, there was Siri with Apple, and Google had Alexa.
8690360	8692280	No, Amazon had Alexa.
8692280	8694760	Amazon had Alexa. Google has Google.
8695640	8701880	Something. I propose to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each,
8702840	8705880	and then ask it questions from the IQ test.
8708760	8716360	But it became apparent that they all search the internet, so they all can find answers to
8716360	8723400	questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me. Now, I don't know if
8723400	8731000	you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers backwards to me. I don't know what would
8731000	8737880	happen. I've never done it. One answer to your question is, you're going to try it right now.
8737880	8740440	Let's try it. Let's try it. No, no, no.
8740440	8747240	Yes, Siri. It would actually probably go to Google search, and it would be all confusing
8747240	8750200	kind of stuff. It would fail.
8750200	8753640	Well, then I guess there's a test that it would fail.
8754520	8763560	Well, but that has to do more with the language of communication versus the content.
8763560	8769400	So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English, and the test was administered in
8769400	8771560	English, that's not really the test of thought.
8771560	8775080	Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.
8776040	8780840	Yeah, so that's because I happen to know how those are programmed.
8780840	8784600	There's a very hard coded, and there's definitely a lack of intelligence there.
8785240	8795080	There's something like IQ tests. There's a guy, artificial intelligence researcher,
8795800	8800760	Francois Chollet. He's a Google. He's one of the seminal people in machine learning.
8800760	8805480	He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.
8805480	8808760	Oh, I haven't heard that. I'd just like to know about that.
8808760	8813160	I'll actually email you this because it'd be very interesting for you.
8813160	8817000	It doesn't get much attention because people don't know what to do with it,
8818360	8824280	but it deserves a lot of attention, which is it basically does a pattern type of tests
8824520	8831160	where you have to do one standard one. You're given three things,
8831160	8836760	and you have to do a fourth one, that kind of thing. You have to understand the pattern here,
8836760	8841000	and for that, it really simplifies to...
8844600	8851640	So the interesting thing is he's trying not to achieve high IQ. He's trying to achieve
8852040	8857240	pretty low bar for IQ. Things that are kind of trivial for humans,
8859400	8865000	and they're actually really tough for machines, which is playing with these concepts of
8865960	8873720	symmetry, of counting. If I give you one object, two objects, three objects, you'll know the last
8873720	8880040	one is four objects. You can count them. You can cluster objects together. It's both visually and
8880040	8886200	conceptually. We could do all these things with our mind that we take for granted, the object-ness
8886200	8894920	of things. We can figure out what spatially is an object and isn't, and we can play with those
8894920	8902600	ideas, and machines really struggle with that. So he really cleanly formulated these IQ tests.
8902600	8908360	I wonder what that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it'd be a very low IQ.
8909320	8915000	But that's exactly the kind of formulation like, okay, we want to be able to solve this. How do we
8915000	8921080	solve this? And he does this as a challenge, and nobody's been able to... It's similar to the Alexa
8921080	8928680	Prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational challenge. Nobody's been able to do well on his.
8928680	8934680	But that's an interesting... Those kinds of tests are interesting, because we take for granted all
8935480	8945880	the ability of the human mind to play with concepts and to formulate concepts out of novel
8945880	8954600	things. Things we've never seen before. We were able to use that. I've talked to a few people that
8954600	8961800	design IQ tests online. They write IQ tests, and I was trying to get some questions from them,
8961800	8965960	and they spoke to the fact that we can't really share questions with you, because
8966680	8972360	part of the... First of all, it's really hard work to come up with questions.
8973720	8979000	It's really, really hard work. It takes a lot of research, but it also takes a lot of novelty
8979000	8987080	generating. You're constantly coming up with really new things. And part of the point is that
8987720	8993400	they're not supposed to be public. They're supposed to be new to you when you look at them.
8993400	8997240	It's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness of the problem,
8998440	9003000	at least a part of what makes the problem hard, as you've never seen it before.
9003000	9007960	Right. That's called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what's called crystallized
9007960	9015720	intelligence, which is your knowledge of facts. You know things, but can you use those things
9015720	9024920	to solve a problem? Those are two different things. I don't want to miss opportunity to
9024920	9030280	talk about this. I spoke about the neurobiology, the molecular biology of intelligence. Do you
9030280	9039640	think one day we'll be able to modify the biology or the genetics of a person to
9041560	9044920	modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence? We started this conversation
9045000	9049080	by talking about a pill you could take. Do you think that such a pill would exist?
9049080	9057160	Metaphorically, I do. And I am supremely confident that it's possible because I am
9057160	9060840	supremely ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology.
9063800	9064920	Ignorance is bliss.
9064920	9068760	Well, I have written that the nightmares of neurobiologists,
9069560	9077160	understanding the complexities, this cascade of events that happens at the synaptic level,
9079880	9087240	that these nightmares are what fuel some people to solve. So some people, you have to be
9087240	9093640	undaunted. I mean, yeah, this is not easy. Look, we're still trying to figure out cancer.
9094520	9099160	Yeah. It was only recently that they figured out why aspirin works.
9100280	9108760	You know, these are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective of the history of science
9109400	9116360	is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.
9117400	9118600	It seemed impossible at the time.
9118600	9120920	And seemed impossible at the time.
9120920	9126520	And so one of the things you look at at companies like Neuralink, you have brain,
9126520	9131800	computer interfaces, you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines,
9131800	9139880	measuring, but also sending signals to the human mind. You start to wonder what impact that has on
9140680	9145880	the g-factor. Modifying in small ways or in large ways, the functioning,
9146680	9153400	the mechanical electrical chemical functioning of the brain.
9154120	9159640	I look at everything about the brain. There are different levels of explanation.
9159640	9166840	On one hand, you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry and then you have
9167800	9176440	neurons. And then you have dendrites. And then you have synapses. And then you have
9177480	9186840	the neurotransmitters and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals. And then you have
9186840	9193960	all the things that influence neurotransmitters. And then you have the individual differences
9193960	9205160	among people. Yeah, it's complicated. But 51 million people in the United States have IQs
9205160	9216600	under 85 and struggle with everyday life. Shouldn't that motivate people to take a look at this?
9217000	9226360	Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that we have to remember that the science of
9226360	9234920	intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition. The thing
9234920	9243000	that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world is perhaps loosely
9243000	9251240	correlated, but it's not dependent entirely on intelligence. Absolutely. I certainly agree with
9251240	9262680	that. So for anyone sort of listening, I'm still not convinced that more intelligence is always
9262680	9268360	better if you want to create beauty in this world. I don't know. Well, I didn't say more
9268360	9274280	intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty. I just said all things being equal,
9274280	9280200	more is better than less. That's all I mean. Yeah, but that's sort of that I just want to
9280200	9287800	sort of say because to me, one of the things that makes life great is the opportunity to create
9287800	9293400	beautiful things. And so I just want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what
9294120	9300520	some IQ test says. At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people.
9301400	9306840	And to also inspire us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.
9307720	9313080	Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college,
9315960	9320680	whether they're thinking about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of? Is
9320680	9328760	there advice you can give? Whether they're in the they want to pursue psychology or biology
9328760	9332760	or engineering or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?
9333640	9343320	I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is. But I can't say if you're
9343400	9348840	interested in psychology or if you're interested in science and the science
9350120	9359080	around the big questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness.
9360040	9365480	We haven't really talked about brain illnesses and what we might learn from,
9366360	9370920	you know, if you are trying to develop a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease,
9370920	9379560	you are trying to develop a drug to impact learning and memory, which are core to intelligence.
9380200	9386520	So it could well be that the so-called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical company trying
9386520	9391320	to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease. Because that's exactly what you're trying to do, right?
9391320	9397160	Yeah. Well, what will that what will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have Alzheimer's
9397160	9405960	disease? So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology, who are interested in
9405960	9418440	science to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions. And the most important thing
9418440	9425240	I can tell you, if you're going to be in kind of a research environment, is you got to follow
9425240	9430440	the data where the data take you. You can't decide in advance where you want the data to go.
9430440	9435160	And if the data take you to places that you don't have the technical expertise to follow,
9436040	9442120	like, you know, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I'm not going to
9442120	9449400	become a molecular biologist now, but I know people who are. And my job is to get them interested
9449400	9457160	to take their expertise into this direction. And that it's not so easy, but and if the data
9457160	9462440	takes you to a place that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in this world,
9464520	9474040	no, I would say it's probably a good idea to still push forward boldly, but to communicate
9474040	9482040	the interpretation of the results with skill, with compassion, with a greater
9482040	9488120	breadth of understanding of humanity, not just the science of the impact of the results.
9488680	9496360	One famous psychologist wrote about this issue that somehow a balance has to be found between
9496360	9501960	pursuing the science and communicating it with respect to people's sensitivities,
9501960	9509480	the legitimate sensitivities. Somehow he didn't say how somehow somehow. And this is every part
9509480	9517880	of that sentence somehow and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader. Let me ask
9517880	9524520	you, you said big questions, the biggest or one of the biggest. We already talked about
9524520	9528360	consciousness and intelligence, one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest questions.
9528360	9534440	But let's talk about the why. Why are we here? What's the meaning of life?
9535080	9536120	Oh, I'm not going to tell you.
9537000	9542600	You know, you're not going to tell me. This is very, I'm going to have to wait for your next book.
9543320	9549160	The meaning of life, you know, we do the best we can to get through the day.
9552200	9556680	And then there's just a finite number of the days. Are you, are you afraid of the
9556680	9564760	finiteness of it? You think about it more and more as I get older. Yeah, I do. And it's one of
9564760	9573800	these human things that it is finite. We all know it. Most of us deny it and don't want to think
9573800	9580680	about it. Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning. You try to do the rational
9580680	9586840	thing. Sometimes you, it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited
9586840	9597160	and you want to get things done. I don't know where I am on that. It is just one of those things
9597160	9602120	that's always in the back of my mind. And I don't think that's uncommon.
9603000	9610040	Well, it's just like g-factor and intelligence. It's a hard truth that's there. And sometimes
9610040	9615240	you kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at it, but it's still there.
9615240	9623640	Yeah. Yes, you can escape it. And think about the g-factor and intelligence is everybody
9624600	9633240	knows this is true on a personal daily basis. Even if you think back to when you were in school,
9634920	9642280	you know who the smart kids were. When you are on the phone talking to a customer service
9642280	9649320	representative that in response to your detailed question is reading a script back to you and
9649400	9656040	you get furious at this. Have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person
9656040	9661480	a moron? You're not listening to me. Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people
9661480	9669160	who they think are not at their level. It's just common because that's the way human beings are.
9669160	9676920	That's the way life is. But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence. We have a
9676920	9683720	poor and we're not always a great. Our judgment of human character of other people is not as good
9684360	9694760	as a battery of tests. That's where bias comes in. That's where our history, our emotions,
9694760	9700680	all of that comes in. So people on the internet, there's such a thing as the internet and people
9700680	9709160	on the internet will call each other dumb all the time. That's the worry here is that
9710920	9718200	we give up on people. We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small
9718200	9723560	number of interactions as if that's it. They're hopeless. That's just in their genetics. But
9724200	9731320	I think no matter what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should not
9731320	9738600	have compassion for our fellow man. That's exactly what the science does say. It's not
9740120	9746520	opposite of what the science is. Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned
9746520	9754440	about intelligence, everything points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat
9754440	9762200	people as individuals respectfully and with compassion. Because through no fault of their own,
9762200	9769400	some people are not as capable as others and you want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to come up
9769400	9777320	with theories about why that might be true. Fine. I would like to fix some of it as best I can.
9777880	9785080	And everybody is deserving of love. Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.
9785880	9791000	I'm just getting warmed up here. I know. I know you can go for another
9791000	9796520	many hours, but to respect your extremely valuable time, this is an amazing conversation.
9796520	9803240	Thank you for the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the
9803240	9808280	neuroscience of intelligence, just the work you're doing. It's a difficult topic. It's a
9808280	9815000	topic that's controversial and sensitive to people and to push forward boldly. And in that nuanced way,
9815000	9820120	just thank you for everything you do. And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence,
9820760	9825480	of consciousness. Well, thank you for asking me. I mean, there's nothing like good conversation
9825480	9830840	on these topics. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Hire. To support this
9830840	9835800	podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some
9835800	9843000	words from Albert Einstein. It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.
9843000	9847960	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
