00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
The following is a conversation with Sean Kelly, a philosopher at Harvard specializing in existentialism and the philosophy of mind.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
And now, here's my conversation with Sean Kelly.

00:20.000 --> 00:34.000
Your interests are in postcontain European philosophy, especially phenomenology and existentialism. So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
So it's a hard question. I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
You are.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
I am, yeah. Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.

00:44.000 --> 00:56.000
I mean, the traditional thing to say about what existentialism is, is that it's a movement in mid 20th century, mostly French, some German philosophy.

00:56.000 --> 01:07.000
And some of the major figures associated with it are people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, maybe Martin Heidegger.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
But that's a weird thing to say about it, because most of those people denied that they were existentialists.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
And in fact, I think of it as a movement that has a much longer history.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
So when I try to describe what the core idea of existentialism is, it's an idea that you find expressed in different ways in a bunch of these people.

01:29.000 --> 01:42.000
One of the ways that it's expressed is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the view that there is no God and at least his form of existentialism.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
He calls it atheistic existentialism. There is no God.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
And since there is no God, there must be some other being around who does something like what God does.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any possibility for significance in a life.

01:59.000 --> 02:17.000
And that being is us. And the feature of us, according to Sartre and the other existentialists, that puts us in the position to be able to play that role is that we're the beings for whom, as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
That's the catchphrase for existentialism. And then you have to try to figure out what it means.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
What is existence? What is presence? And what does precedes mean?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, exactly. What is existence? What is essence? And what is precedes?

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it and other people will talk about it differently.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
But here's the way Sartre thinks about it. This is not, I think, the most interesting way to think about it, but I'll get you started.

02:42.000 --> 02:54.000
Sartre says, there's nothing true about what it is to be you until you start existing, until you start living.

02:54.000 --> 03:11.000
And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is to be existing, the way we do, is to be making decisions, to be making choices in your life, to be sort of taking a stand on what it is to be you by deciding to do this or that.

03:11.000 --> 03:25.000
And the key feature of how to do that right, for Sartre, is to do it in the full recognition of the fact that when you make that choice, nobody is responsible for it other than you.

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
So you don't make the choice because God tells you to. You don't make the choice because some utilitarian calculus about what it's right to do tells you to do.

03:36.000 --> 03:50.000
You don't make the choice because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it. There's literally nothing on the basis of which you make the choice other than the fact that in that moment, you're the one making it.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
You are conscious thinking being that made a decision. So all the questions about physics and free will are out the window.

03:59.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, that's right. If you were a determinist about the mind, if you were a physicalist about the mind, if you thought there was nothing to your choices other than the activity of the brain that's governed by physical laws, then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate like you're not the ground of that choice.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
The ground of that choice was the physical universe and the laws that govern it, and then you'd have no responsibility.

04:26.000 --> 04:38.000
And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special about us, used to be special about God, is that we're responsible for becoming the being that makes the choices that we do.

04:38.000 --> 04:53.000
And Sartre thinks that that's simultaneously empowering. I mean, it practically puts us in the place of God and also terrifying because what responsibility? How can you possibly take on that responsibility?

04:54.000 --> 05:11.000
And he thinks it's worse than that. He thinks that it's always happening. Everything that you do is the result of some choice that you've made, the posture that you sit in, the way you hold someone's gaze when you're having a conversation with them or not,

05:11.000 --> 05:24.000
the choice to make a note when someone says something or not make a note. Everything that you do presents you as a being who makes decisions and you're responsible for all of them.

05:24.000 --> 05:35.000
So it's constantly happening. And furthermore, there's no fact about you independent of the choices and actions you've performed.

05:36.000 --> 05:45.000
So you don't get to say, Sartre's example, I really am a great writer, just haven't written my great book yet. If you haven't written your great book, you're not a great writer.

05:45.000 --> 05:58.000
And so it's terrifying. It puts a huge burden on us. And that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism, human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.

05:59.000 --> 06:08.000
Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to become someone through making them. And we can't get away from that.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
But to him, it's terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating.

06:14.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous individual to be liberated by it. Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.

06:24.000 --> 06:39.000
I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition. But what's liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain way, you're the ground of your own being.

06:39.000 --> 06:49.000
You become what you do through existing. So that's one form of existentialism. That's a stark atheistic version of it. There's lots of other versions.

06:49.000 --> 07:01.000
But it's somehow organized around the idea that it's through living your life that you become who you are. It's not facts that are sort of true about you, independent of your living your life.

07:02.000 --> 07:14.000
But then if there's no God in that view, does any of the decisions matter? So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?

07:14.000 --> 07:25.000
Good. Okay. Great question. There was two different ways that you're asking it. Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
Or is there any way that you can criticize someone for doing, for living the way they do if you're an existentialist?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Including yourself.

07:34.000 --> 07:44.000
Including yourself, yeah. Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make of yourself or of others.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
And it's the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for your choices.

07:50.000 --> 08:04.000
He gives these two sort of amazing examples. I don't know if it reads as well as for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris, but it's about a waiter.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
He gives this in his big book Being and Nothingness.

08:07.000 --> 08:21.000
And he says, so waiters played still do, I think, in a certain way in Paris. A big role in Parisian society to be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity, being a certain way.

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
Taking control of and charge of the experience of the people that you're waiting on, but also really being the authority, like knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go.

08:33.000 --> 08:53.000
And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it that he's doing it because he believes that's the way a waiter should act.

08:54.000 --> 09:05.000
So there's some sense in which he's passing off the responsibility for his actions onto some idea of what those actions should be. He's not taking responsibility for it.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other than him.

09:12.000 --> 09:25.000
So he starts acting in bad faith. And that's criticisable because it's acting in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.

09:25.000 --> 09:35.000
So you're not taking responsibility. So that's one example. And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager, you've known someone who does that.

09:35.000 --> 09:46.000
If teenagers try on roles, they think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool. So I'll dress like this. Or if I spoke like this or acted like this.

09:46.000 --> 09:56.000
And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out what their identity is to go through a phase like that. But if you continue to do that, then you're really passing.

09:56.000 --> 10:16.000
That's one example. And the other example he gives is an example, not of passing off responsibility by pretending that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all.

10:16.000 --> 10:40.000
So he says, you're always everything you do is a result of your choices. And so he gives this other example. There you are on the first date, first date. And the date, the evening reaches moments when might be appropriate for one person to hold the hand of the other.

10:40.000 --> 10:57.000
That's the moment in the date where you are. And so you make a choice. You decide, I think it's that time and you hold the hand. And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on SART's view. Either they reject the hand, not that time.

10:57.000 --> 11:14.000
And I'm taking responsibility for that. Or they grasp the hand back. That's a choice. But there's a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the hand there cold, dead and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.

11:15.000 --> 11:36.000
And SART says, that's also bad faith. That's also acting as if we're kind of being that we're not, because it pretends that it's possible not to make a choice. And we're the beings who are always making choices. That was a choice. And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing that you don't have to take responsibility for.

11:36.000 --> 11:52.000
So both of the examples you've given, there's some sense in which the social interactions between humans is the kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a human in the view of existentialism should take on.

11:52.000 --> 12:12.000
So like, isn't the basic conversation a delegation of responsibility? Just holding a hand there. You're putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person. And for the waiter, if you're existing a society, you are generally trying on a role.

12:13.000 --> 12:34.000
All of us are trying on a role. Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try as opposed to walking around naked all the time. There's like standards of how you operate. And that's a decision that's not my own. That's me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them.

12:34.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah, exactly. So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that. Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue to how you should live well. So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.

12:55.000 --> 13:16.000
Why is hell other people for Sartre? Well, because other people are making choices also. And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice they made is one that I should copy or one that I should sort of promote.

13:16.000 --> 13:43.000
But if I do it because they did it, then I'm in bad faith for Sartre. So it is as if Sartre's view is like we would be better if we were all alone. I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position. And this is really just mostly Sartre in a certain period of his formation. But anyhow, we can imagine that view. And I think there's something to the idea that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in the mid 40s.

13:44.000 --> 14:02.000
Can you dig into hell as other people? Is there some, obviously it's kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly to really explore that point. But is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience of what it means to be human?

14:03.000 --> 14:25.000
I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this. Like, it's not just that you wear clothes because people wear clothes in our society. Like you have a particular style. You wear a particular kind of clothes. And for Sartre, to have that style authentically in good faith rather than in bad faith, it has to come from you. You have to make the choice.

14:25.000 --> 14:48.000
But other people are making choices also. And like you're looking at their choices and you're thinking, that guy looks good. Maybe I could try that one on. And if you try it on because you were influenced by the fact that you thought that guy was doing it well, then there's some important sense in which, although that's a resource for a choice for you, it's also acting in bad faith.

14:48.000 --> 15:00.000
And God wouldn't do that, right? God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions. And if that's the model, then that's, I think that's the sense in which he thinks hell is other people.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
What do you think parenting is then? It's like what, because God doesn't have a parent.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Aren't we significantly influenced first of all in the first few years of life?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Absolutely.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
And even the teenager is resisting, learning through resistance.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Absolutely.

15:20.000 --> 15:32.000
I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre's aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
And there's many ways in which we're not like the traditional view of what God was.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
One is that we're not self-generating. We have parents.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
We're raised into traditions and social norms.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
And we're raised into an understanding of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
And I think that's a deep intuition. I think that's exactly right.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks he's sort of taking this from,

16:06.000 --> 16:15.000
but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger's German phenomenological view.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our thrownness.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
We're thrown into a situation. We're thrown into history.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
We're thrown into our parental lineage. And we don't choose it.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
That's stuff that we don't choose. We couldn't choose.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we're not.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning that we never chose.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
We have an end that we're often trying to resist or put off or something.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
And in between, there's a whole bunch of stuff that organizes us without our ever having made the choice

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
and without the kind of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
We have a complicated relationship to that stuff.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And I think we should talk about that at a certain point.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
But the first move is to say, Sartre's just got a sort of descriptive problem.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.000
He's missed this basic fact that there has to be an awful lot about us

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
that's settled without our having made the choice to settle it that way.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Right. The thrownness of life.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
That's a fundamental part of life. You can't just escape it.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Exactly. You can't escape it altogether.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Altogether.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah, exactly. You can't escape it altogether.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
But nevertheless, you are riding a wave and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
You can't control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it,

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
you should be making certain kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
So why does this matter at all?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
The chain of decisions you make.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Good. Well, because they constitute you, they make you the person that you are.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
So what's the opposite view?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
What's this view against?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward.

18:13.000 --> 18:22.000
Plato says in the Republic, it's a kind of myth, but he says people will understand their condition.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, if we tell them this myth, he says, look, when you're born, there's just a fact about you.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Those are the three kinds of people there are, and you're born that way.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
If your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
And if your soul is silver, well, you're not going to be a philosopher king.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior and we should make you that.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer or laborer or something like that.

18:53.000 --> 19:02.000
And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of anything you do about it.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And so that's the alternative view.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And you could have modern versions of it.

19:07.000 --> 19:18.000
You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ or your genetic makeup or the percentage of fast-switch muscle fibers you've got or whatever.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
It could be something totally independent of any choice that you've made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could make a choice.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
And it categorizes you.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
It makes you the person that you are.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
That's the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against.

19:35.000 --> 19:42.000
So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you can make.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Radical freedom.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, radical freedom.

19:52.000 --> 20:00.000
And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we got to understand the way in which our freedom is limited by certain things.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
We're limited by certain aspects of the kind of being that we are.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense.

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
And sort of these folks start with the idea that, look, whatever we are, that's a kind of limit point that we're not going to reach.

20:18.000 --> 20:27.000
So what are the ways in which we're constrained that that being the way the medieval's understood him wasn't constrained?

20:27.000 --> 20:37.000
So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yes, good.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Excellent.

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before him is Nietzsche.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
Nietzsche is writing in the end of the 19th century in various places where he published things.

20:53.000 --> 21:03.000
But largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition of the modern world as nihilistic.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
And that's a descriptive claim.

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
He's looking around him, trying to figure out what it's like to be us now.

21:13.000 --> 21:23.000
And he says it's a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century BCE.

21:23.000 --> 21:38.000
In 1300, like what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's the way they understood themselves.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.000
And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden.

21:47.000 --> 21:56.000
And to have the project of trying to understand how as a sinful being, you could nevertheless live a life of virtuous life.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
How could you do that?

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
And it had to do with for them getting in the right relation to God.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
Nietzsche says, that doesn't make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And what does that mean?

22:11.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves as a culture isn't a role that God can play anymore.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
And so Nietzsche says, the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
And Nietzsche says, the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn't make sense anymore.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
That's like Sartre's atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
And so the question is, what does ground our existence?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
And the answer is, nihil, nothing.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing outside of us that grounds our existence.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
How do we live?

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Nietzsche emphasizes something else.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
He says, we're artists of life.

23:18.000 --> 23:27.000
And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they're responding to something.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what's going to make sense of the situation.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
This is what I have to write.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is the way I have to dance.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
This is the way I've got to play the music.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living itself.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
And there's a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist when Nietzsche was writing,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
but I think Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I mean, he talks about improvisation.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
There's classical improvisation.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I mean, he was a composer and a pianist.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.

24:18.000 --> 24:27.000
And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite a while in the 60s,

24:27.000 --> 24:42.000
tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
And that gives us a certain kind of freedom.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
But we don't have the radical freedom that starts things.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
So what's the story?

24:52.000 --> 25:03.000
Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things were great, he says.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
He's a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
And he says, I'm playing the, I'm back in the solo and I'm playing these chords.

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
He's like, it just, like, that's what you got to say.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
It didn't work right there.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, you know, I screwed up, we were tight, everything was working.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
And I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
And he said, Miles paused for a moment.

25:41.000 --> 25:49.000
And then all of a sudden he went on in a way that made my chord right.

25:51.000 --> 26:02.000
And I think that idea that, like, you could be an artist who responds to what's thrown at you in such a way as to make it right.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
By what measure?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Everyone could hear it is all you can say.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Everyone knew, wow, that really works.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
And I think that's not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
He couldn't have just played anything.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
But the constraints aren't like pre-existing.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
They're sort of what's happening now in the moment for these listeners and these performers.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
We're involved, but we're not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it the way Sartre thinks.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Our choices have to be responsive to our situation.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
And they have to make the situation work.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
They have to make it right.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And there's something about music, too.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
So you basically have to make music of all the moments of life.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
And there is something about music.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Why is music so compelling?

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
And when you listen to it, something about certain kinds of music, it connects with you.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
It doesn't make any sense.

27:07.000 --> 27:14.000
But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical masterpiece.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Exactly.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
And I think what's interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force there?

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
There's a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
God creates ex nihilo out of nothing.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
because it's about how there's nothing at our ground.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don't create out of nothing.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Miles Davis, it wasn't nothing.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
That situation pre-existed him.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It was given to him.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
But he was responding to that situation in a way that made it right.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
He wasn't just creating out of nothing.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
He was creating out of what was already there.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
Because you're given a climbing hand, you're going to have to make art and music out of that.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Exactly.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
That's the responsibility for both of them.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for his day, because you have to create.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
So the emphasis isn't just on making decisions.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
It's on creating.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
But also on listening, right?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
I mean, Miles Davis was listening.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
He heard that.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
He knew it was wrong.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
What do you mean by that statement?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah.

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
What's in your sense the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that our world today provides?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Good.

28:53.000 --> 29:02.000
So I mean, I think that there's something super perceptive about Nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition at the end of the 19th century.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
So not so far from the condition that I think we're currently in.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
And I think there's an interesting question, what we're supposed to respond, what we're supposed to do in response.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
But what is the condition that we're currently in?

29:14.000 --> 29:28.000
When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for us anymore as a culture.

29:29.000 --> 29:37.000
And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology, but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
They say we live in a secular age.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Our age is a secular age.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And so what do people mean when they say that?

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
It could be wrong.

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
Well, first thing is, it doesn't mean there are no religious believers because there are plenty.

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
There are lots of people who go to church or synagogue or mosque, you know, every week or more.

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
And there are people who really find that to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.

30:19.000 --> 30:32.000
But it does mean that for those people, the role that their religious belief plays in their life isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
So what's that role?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
We'll go back to the High Middle Ages.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
That was clearly not a secular age.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
That was a religious age.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
And so there we are in 1300.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Dante is writing the Divine Comedy or something.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?

30:50.000 --> 31:10.000
Well, it meant not just that the default was that you were a Christian in the West, but that your Christianity, your religious belief, your religious affiliation justified certain assumptions about people who didn't share that religious belief.

31:11.000 --> 31:26.000
So you're a Christian in the West in 1300 and you meet someone who's a Muslim and the fact that they don't share your religious belief justifies the conclusion that they're less than human.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
And that was the ground of the crusades.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
That was the religious wars of the High Middle Ages.

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
To say that we live in a secular age is to say that there aren't a lot of people who have religious belief, there are.

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
But it's to say that their religious belief doesn't justify that conclusion.

31:48.000 --> 32:02.000
If you're a religious believer and you meet me and suppose I'm not a religious believer, learning that about me doesn't justify your concluding that I'm less than human.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Most of the time we think that's a good thing.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
We let a thousand flowers bloom.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
There are lots of ways to live a good life.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive kind of liberal thought.

32:18.000 --> 32:35.000
But it's also true that it's an undermining thought because it means if you're a religious believer now, your belief can't ground your understanding of what you ought to be aiming at in the life in the way it used to be able to.

32:35.000 --> 32:52.000
You can't say, as a religious believer, I know it's right to do this because you also know that if you meet someone who doesn't share that religious belief and so doesn't think it's right to do that necessarily or does but for different reasons, you can't conclude that they've got it wrong.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.

32:56.000 --> 33:16.000
Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude as a public statement to others, but within your own mind, it's almost like an existentialist version of belief, which is like you create the world and around you.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
It doesn't matter what others believe.

33:19.000 --> 33:33.000
It's actually almost like empowering thought as opposed to the more traditional view of religion where it's like a tribal idea, where you share that idea together.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
Here you have the full, back to Sartre, full responsibility of your beliefs as well.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Good, good.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
But what you're describing is not a religious believer.

33:44.000 --> 33:51.000
You're describing someone who's found in themselves the ground of their existence rather than in something outside of themselves.

33:52.000 --> 34:10.000
I mean, if you go full Sartrean, then well, you're not in a position to criticize others for the choices that they make, but you are in a position to criticize them for the way in which they make them, either taking responsibility or not taking responsibility.

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
But the religious believer used to be able to say, look, the choices that I make are right because God demands that I make them.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
And nowadays, and so it would be wrong to make any others.

34:25.000 --> 34:34.000
And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age, say, well, you can't quite do that and be a religious believer.

34:34.000 --> 34:41.000
Your religious belief can't justify that move, and so it can't ground your life in the way it does.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
So it's sort of unsettling.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
I think that's one of the interpretations of what Nietzsche might have meant when he said God is dead.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
God can't play the role for religious believers in our world that he used to.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But we nevertheless find meaning.

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
I mean, you don't see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas that are overtaken modern culture.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
So a secular world is still full of meaning.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Good.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Well, I think that's the interesting question.

35:06.000 --> 35:14.000
I think it's certainly possible for a secular world to be a world in which we live meaningful lives, worthwhile lives,

35:14.000 --> 35:23.000
lives that are sort of worthy of respect and that we can be proud of aiming to live.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
But I think it is a hard question what we're doing when we do that.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
And that is the question of existence.

35:30.000 --> 35:36.000
So what does it mean to exist in a way that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
That's the question for existentialism.

35:40.000 --> 35:49.000
So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important existentialist to understand for others?

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Maybe other existentialists, not just one.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Yeah, good.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
So Sartre is the grounding, strong, atheistic existentialism statement.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Who else is there?

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
I'm teaching an existentialism course now and I think the tradition goes back at least to the 17th century.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
And I'll just tell you some of the figures that I'm teaching there.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
We could talk about any of them that you like.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
The figure I start with is Pascal.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
Pascal, French mathematician from the 17th century.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
He died.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
I'm terrible with dates, but I think 1661 or something like that, middle of the 17th century.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Brilliant polymath.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Sort of we have computer languages named after him.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
He built the first mechanical calculating machine.

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
But he was also deeply invested in his understanding of what Christianity was.

36:45.000 --> 36:54.000
And he thought that everyone before him had really misunderstood what Christianity was.

36:54.000 --> 37:06.000
That they'd really attempted to think about it, not as a way of living a life, but as a set of beliefs that you can have and which you can justify.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
And I think that's the first move that's really pretty interesting.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky developed that move.

37:17.000 --> 37:27.000
And all of those take themselves to be defending an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity, an existential interpretation of Christianity.

37:27.000 --> 37:38.000
And then I think there are other figures, other theistic figures, figures like Camus and Fanon, who are mid-20th century figures.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
And then I'll just mention the figure who I think is the most interesting is Martin Heidegger.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
He's a complicated figure.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
By the way, when you said Camus, you meant atheistic.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
So we've got sports cards, we have the different existentialists.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
So maybe let's go to Dostoevsky.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
All right, okay, let's do it.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.

38:15.000 --> 38:22.000
And I love the optimism and the love the main character has for the world.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Knows from underground as well.

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
But what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think are existentialist?

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Excellent.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
So let me talk about the brother's Karimovsov.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Partly because that's the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Maybe the best.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
So I'm super excited about it.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
But what is the brother's Karimovsov about?

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Spoiler alert.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I mean, the father gets murdered.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And the question is who did it?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Who's responsible for it?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
But it's responsibility for a murder.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
That's what we're talking about.

39:17.000 --> 39:24.000
And there's a bunch of brothers, each of whom has pretty good motivation

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
for having murdered the father.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
The father's a jerk.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
I mean, he's, you know, if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
He's a force of chaos.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
And he's nasty in all sorts of ways.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
But still, it's not good to murder people.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
So what's the view of Dostoyevsky?

39:46.000 --> 39:54.000
I mean, it's this intense exploration of what it means to be involved in various ways

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
with an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
And how even through this kind of action, you can achieve some kind of salvation?

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
That's Dostoyevsky's word for it.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
You can, but salvation here and now, not like you live some afterlife

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
where you're, you know, paradise for eternity.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Who cares about that?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Says one of the characters.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
That doesn't make my life now any good.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
And it doesn't justify any of the bad things that happen in my life now.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
What matters is, can we live well in the face of these things that we do

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and have to take responsibility for?

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
So it's this intense exploration of notions and gradations of guilt

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
and responsibility and the possibility of love and salvation in the face of those.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
It is incredibly human work.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
But I think Dostoyevsky is the opposite of Sartre.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
And let me just, I think it's so fascinating.

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
I don't know anybody else who notices this, but Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoyevsky

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
when he's developing his view.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It's close to a passage.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It doesn't appear quite in this way.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It's in the form of an argument.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Sartre puts it in the form of an argument.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
He says, look, there's a conditional statement is true.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
And then there's a second premise.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
There is no God.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
That's Sartre's view.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
I mean, he's an atheist.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
There is no God.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Conclusion?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Everything is permitted.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
And that's Sartre's radical freedom.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
And if you think about the structure of the brothers Karamazov,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I think Dostoyevsky, though he never says it this way,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
would run the argument differently.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
It's a modus tolens instead of a modus bonens.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
The argument for Dostoyevsky would go like this.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Yeah, conditional statement.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
But look at your life.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Not everything is permitted.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
You do horrible, atrocious things.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Like, be involved in the death of your father.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And there is a price to pay.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
That's not a livable moment to take, to have to take responsibility,

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
to have to recognize that you're at fault,

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
or you're somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you were

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
and letting that happen or bringing it about that it does happen,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
is to pay a price.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way that everything is permitted.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Look at the facts of your existence.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
So not everything is permitted.

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
Therefore, there is a God.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
And the presence of a God for Dostoyevsky, I think, is just found

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
in this fact that when we do bad things, we feel guilty for them.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
We find ourselves to be responsible for things,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
even when we didn't intend to do them,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
but we just allowed ourselves to be involved in them.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
And the nature of God for Dostoyevsky is, I mean, unclear.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
I mean, it's a very complex exploration in itself.

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
And he basically, God speaks through several of his characters in complicated ways.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
So it's not like a trivial version of God.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
It's totally not trivial.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
And it's not a being that exists outside of time.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
None of that is sort of relevant for Dostoyevsky.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to us,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
which is the mood of joy?

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but so I'm a Russian speaker.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
And one of the, I kind of listened to my heart.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
And what my heart says is I need to take on this project.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
So there's a couple of famous translators of Dostoyevsky and Dostoyevsky

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
that live in Paris currently.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
So I'm going to take the journey.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoyevsky, about Dostoyevsky

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
and like a series of conversations.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
And the reason I fell in love with this idea is I just realized,

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
in translating from Russian to English, how deep philosophical,

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
how much deep philosophical thinking is required.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
Just like single sentences, they spent like weeks debating single sentences.

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
So, and all of that is part of a journey to Russia for several reasons.

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
But I just, I want to explore something in me that long still understand

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
and to connect with the roots where I come from.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
So, maybe can you comment, whether it's on the Russian side

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
or the German side or other French side,

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
is there something in your own explorations of these philosophies

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
that you find that you miss because you don't deeply know the language?

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
Or like how important is it to understand the language?

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
Good. I think it's super important.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
And I'm always embarrassed that I don't know more languages

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
and don't know the languages I know as well as I would like to.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
But there's a way in.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
So I do think different languages allow you to think in different ways.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
There's a sort of a mode of existence, a way of being that's captured by a language

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
that it makes certain ways of thinking about yourself or others more natural.

45:41.000 --> 45:46.000
And it closes off other ways of thinking about yourself and others.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
The Heidegger, who is this philosopher that I'm interested in says at one point,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
language is the house of being.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
And I think that means something like it's by living in a language

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
that you come to understand or that possibilities for understanding

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
what it is to be you and others and anything are opened up.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
And different languages open up different possibilities.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories.

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
to truly to help you understand maybe fall in love with the words.

46:37.000 --> 46:44.000
And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of the language.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
It's understanding something much deeper.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
The music of the language or something.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
The music of the ideas.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Absolutely. Something like that.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
It's very hard to say exactly what that is.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce, read some sentences.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
They have a different cadence.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
They have a different tonality.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
They have different music to use your word.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
And all of a sudden you think about them differently.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
And the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you when they're read in certain ways.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
That's what great actors can do.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
But I think language is rich like that.

47:22.000 --> 47:30.000
And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
when we think about its logical form.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
When we think about the sort of claims of philosophical logic that you can make

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
or how do you translate this proposition into some symbolic form.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
I think that's part of what goes on in language.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can

47:50.000 --> 47:57.000
when great poets or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
it's way more than that.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
I feel like some of the ideas that are conveyed through language

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
actually can be put outside of language.

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
but for an English audience and not rely purely on translators.

48:22.000 --> 48:29.000
There would of course be translators there that help me dance through this mess of language.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
But also like my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian to English back and forth

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
for an English speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
So not this pure, this is Russian, it's going to be translated to English

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
or this is English, it's going to be translated to Russian.

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
But dance back and forth and try to share with people who don't speak one of the languages

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
the music that they're missing and sort of almost hear that music

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
because if you're sitting in another room and you hear the music through the wall

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
I get a sense of it.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human being.

49:08.000 --> 49:14.000
And I wonder whether it's possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
in a way that can be conveyed to people who don't speak that particular language.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I think it's a super exciting project.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I look forward to following it.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I'll tell you one thing that does happen.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
So we read Dostoevsky in translation.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room which is super helpful.

49:31.000 --> 49:39.000
But I also encourage my students to some of them will have different translations than others.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
And that can be really helpful for the non-native speaker

49:43.000 --> 49:51.000
because by paying attention to the places where translators diverge in their translations

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
of a given word or a phrase or something like that

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have in English

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
And then you can start to ask about what those differences are.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
And I think there's a kind of magic to it.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
for people who really grew up in them especially who speak them as natives.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
And that's a really powerful thing that actually doesn't exist enough of

50:24.000 --> 50:33.000
is, for example, for Dostoevsky most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
And there's a lot of discussions about who did it better and so on.

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
But I would love to, I'm a computer science person, I would love to do a diff

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
where you automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying

50:48.000 --> 50:56.000
and use that like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
I heard the individual translators and interviews and blog posts

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
and articles discuss particular phrases that they differ on

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
but like to do that for an entire book, that's a fascinating exploration.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
As an English speaker, just to read the differences in the translations

51:15.000 --> 51:22.000
you probably can get some deep understanding of ideas in those books

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
by seeing the struggle of the translators to capture that idea.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
That's a really interesting idea.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Absolutely.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
And you can do that for other projects and other languages too.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
One of the, I don't know, I have this weird huge range of interests

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
and some days I'll find myself reading about something.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
At one point I was interested in 14th century German mysticism.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Okay, turns out there's somebody who's written volumes and volumes about this.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
He's fantastic.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
And I was interested in reading Meister Eckhart.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
I wanted to know what was interesting about him.

51:58.000 --> 52:05.000
And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who's the great scholar of this period, made

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
he translated Christianity into the vernacular.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
He started giving sermons in German to the peasants.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Sermons used to be in Latin and nobody could speak Latin.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don't know?

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
So he translated it into German.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
But in doing it, the resources of the German language are different from the resources

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
of the Latin language.

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
And there's a word in Middle High German, Grund, which we translated as ground.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
And it's got this earthy feel to it.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out of

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty to it.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
And there's no Latin word for that.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
But in Eckhart's interpretation of Christianity, Grund, that's like the fundamental thing.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
You don't understand God until you understand the way in which he is our ground.

53:06.000 --> 53:15.000
And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets a kind of German cant that makes sense to the people who speak German

53:15.000 --> 53:23.000
and that reveals something totally different about what you could think that form of existence was

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done in Latin.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Yeah, that's fascinating.

53:29.000 --> 53:36.000
So, okay, we talked about Dostoyevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature.

53:36.000 --> 53:44.000
Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as a way to explore human nature.

53:44.000 --> 53:52.000
So he is probably my favorite existentialist, probably one of the more accessible existentialists.

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
And like you said, one of the people who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
So what are your thoughts about Camus?

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
What role does he play in the story of existentialism?

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
So, I find Camus totally fascinating.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
I really do.

54:07.000 --> 54:15.000
And for years, I didn't teach Camus because the famous thing that you're referring to, the myth of Sisyphus,

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
which is a sort of essay, it's published as a book, super accessible, really fascinating.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
He's a great writer, really engaging.

54:23.000 --> 54:31.000
The opening line is something like, there is but one truly significant philosophical question.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
And that is the question of suicide.

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
And I thought, I can't teach my 18-year-olds of, you know, like how...

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Yeah.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I just thought, that's terrible.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Like, how can I...

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I mean, it's not wrong.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Like, that's a...

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
But do I want to bring that into the classroom?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And so I read it...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I read the essay.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I avoided it for a long time because...

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Just because of that line.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
And I thought, I'm not going to be able to make sense of this in a way that will be helpful for anyone.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I sat down to read it.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
I thought, I've got to really confront it.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
And I read it and it's incredibly engaging.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I mean, it's really, really beautiful.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
And Camus was against suicide, which just turns out to be good.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I was happy about that.

55:19.000 --> 55:26.000
But he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence amounts to.

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
And it's being absurd as a kind of technical term for him.

55:36.000 --> 55:48.000
And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole presents itself to you as if it's got a meaning.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
But really it doesn't.

55:51.000 --> 55:58.000
So there's this tension between the way things seem to be on their surface

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
and what really turns out to be true about them.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And he gives these great examples.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
You probably remember these.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
He says, there you are.

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
You're walking along the street and there's a plate glass window in a building.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
And through the window, you see somebody talking on a cell phone.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
I mean, I imagine it as a cell phone, but Camus for didn't.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
But you see somebody talking on a cell phone and he's animated.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
He's talking a lot as if things really meant something.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
And yet Camus says, it's a dumb show.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
And it's not dumb in the sense, just in the sense that it's stupid.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
It's dumb in the sense that it's silent.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
It presents itself as if it's got some significance and yet its significance is withheld from you.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
And he says, that's what our lives are like.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
Everything in our lives presents themselves to us as if it's got a significance, but it doesn't.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It's absurd.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
And then he says, really what our lives are like?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
They're like the lives of Sisyphus.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
Just day after day.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
You do the same thing.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
You wake up at a certain time.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
You get on the bus.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
You go to work.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
You take your lunch break.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
You get off.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
I have a colleague who once said to me something like this.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
It was about October or so in the fall semester.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I said, how's it going, Dick?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
He said, well, you know how it is.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I'm just going through.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
And that's the way my life is.

57:32.000 --> 57:39.000
And Camus thinks that experience, which you can sometimes have, reveals something true

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
about what human lives are like.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus who rolls this boulder up the hill

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
from morning till night.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
And then at night he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Over the course of the night he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life.

58:00.000 --> 58:07.000
Like we're condemned to our lives, but we do have one bit of freedom and it's the only

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
thing that we can hang on to.

58:10.000 --> 58:18.000
It's the freedom to stick it to the gods who put us in this position by embracing this

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
existence rather than giving up and committing suicide.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
And I thought, well, it's kind of a happy ending.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
But I also thought it's a dim view of what our existence amounts to.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
So I think there's something fascinating about that.

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
But what I came to believe and I tried to write about this once, I know you read the thing

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
about a liveness that I published once.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
That's secretly a criticism of Camus.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I don't think I mentioned Camus in there.

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong or he's missed some important aspect of it.

58:56.000 --> 59:03.000
Because in Camus' view, when you experience your day as sort of going on in this deadening way

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
and you're just doing the things that you always do, the way you always do them.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
For Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
But I think there's some aspect, at least for me.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
And maybe he just didn't feel this or didn't have access to it.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Maybe others don't.

59:20.000 --> 59:27.000
But for me, there's an extra part to it, which is somehow that, yes, that's the way things are.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
And it's inadequate.

59:30.000 --> 59:37.000
And there's something that's missing from that aspect of our existence that could be there.

59:37.000 --> 59:45.000
And it feels like our lives are not about just putting up with that and sticking it to the gods by embracing it.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
But seeking that absent part of it.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
The part that's recognizable in its absence in your experience of that.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And that's what I think.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when you feel truly alive.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And that's what you mean by the word aliveness, which is a fascinating and a powerful word.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah, that's what I mean by it.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I mean, I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when they really felt alive.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And it could happen in a moment when, I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Or maybe you feel it in that moment where you grab for the hand on the first date and the gesture is reciprocated.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Or maybe you feel it in some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing or watching somebody else do a peak athletic thing.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But I think there are moments when it feels like it's not like the way Camu is describing things.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And it's better because of that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:07.000
So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about going to a darker territory, is to think about suicide.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And I've known people in my life who suffer from clinical depression.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And, you know, whatever the chemistry is in our brain, there is a certain kind of feeling that is to be depressed.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Where you look in the mirror and ask, do I want to kill myself today?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
This is the question that Camu asks, this question, this philosophical question.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And there is people who, when they're depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill myself or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is, that's chemistry in our mind.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And then on the flip side of that, for me, I've had some low points, but I've been very fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great music or any of that.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Like, as you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it's cold.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And for some reason, the coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I don't know, there was a joy in that.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I can't put it into words, but I just felt great.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there's a nice breeze and it's amazing.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000
That seems like I'm getting some nice dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And that is the source of aliveness.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:05.000
However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And so the one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of suicide.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way often.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Like basically every day is, you know, what if I die today?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It's more like contemplating your mortality every single day.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You know, it just reminds me how amazing life is.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And that's chemistry. I don't know what that is, but that's certainly not some kind of philosophical decision I made.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I've been given of the dopamine.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So that question of suicide.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
By the way, do you find that formulation of the question of existentialism?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I know you didn't want to teach it because obviously suicide is a very difficult word, especially for young minds.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
But do you think that's a useful formulation of the question of existentialism?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I think there is something to it.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:42.000
If you read the question as the question, what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That's a deep question.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah, that's a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they ought to continue to live that life.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000
The famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending execution.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I think there's something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness and the vulnerability of one's existence

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
is super important.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And I think that if we didn't have that, our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
If they weren't risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And it's only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance that they do.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So yeah, I think not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the questions at the core of existentialism.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is an action.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn't make sense because you know, imagine you're in like a hotel and you're saying the room I'm in sucks.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:12.000
But like there's other rooms, so like maybe explore those other rooms, maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Like basically embracing the fact that you don't know everything and there's, you need time to explore everything.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:30.000
It's like once you've explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision, but it's unfair to make a decision.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It's, I would say, unethical to make a decision until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah. And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.000
There's one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
He's asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that's worth living in.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And I think that character is, as you say, very ill.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And it's possible and often because, as you say, of, you know, brain chemistry, physiology.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So there's certainly a physical ground to that situation, to that condition.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
But I think it is possible for someone to be in that situation.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I think that Ivan Karamazov, who's the character who's asking this question, is, you know, maybe let's say chemically depressed or something like that.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But I think there's more to it too.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And I think that Dostoevsky's real view is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on its own.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Like the way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves from others.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The way we care for the lives that we lead affects the chemistry of our brain, which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:09.000
So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved, is going to come through the love of his brother Alyosha.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors is Herman Hesse.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Do you ever include him in our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I haven't.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Maybe I should.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
What should I read?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
What should I think about including?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
No, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
There's a existentialist ideal pervading most of his work.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But there's more of like with Siddhartha, there's more almost like a Buddhist sort of like watch the river and become the river.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
This kind of idea that what it means to truly experience the moment.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
There is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it's not just about,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
we've been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen, like you said, from Nietzsche.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Like what it means to really take in the world and experience the moment.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So he's very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience the full absurdity of the moment.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And for him, I'm starting to forget, Steppenwolf I think is humor.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000
It's part of the absurdity, which I think modern day internet explores very well with memes and so on.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that's able to deal with absurdity.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You got to like laugh at it.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you're absolutely right.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Kierkegaard, who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and then so on, is actually an incredibly funny writer.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school who left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
He's a very successful guy.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And then he came back 25 years later and wrote, finished his dissertation.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And I was the reader on the dissertation.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
There may be a conflict of interest, I'm not quite sure.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But his dissertation was about, he called it Kierkegaard and the funny, which is kind of a funny title.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000
But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading, Kierkegaard does have this idea that there's something destabilizing about humor

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000
that's crucial to the sort of the important possibilities for us.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And so there's the idea that there's a moment when a joke is being set up, when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And then the punchline comes and the rug is pulled out from under you.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And for a moment, it's like you're falling.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:17.000
There's nothing supporting you until you're captured by your totally new understanding of what was going on.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to it.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And that's like the riskiness.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
That's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000
If there aren't risks in your life, if your life is totally safe, then there's no possibility of significance.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And so I think on Eric's reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:54.000
with the experience of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000
When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it's got a kind of salience for you.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Speaking of jokes and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So existentialism in film and literature.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism, was experienced in the great work of art, modern work of art called Big Lebowski.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I don't know if you've ever seen that film, but there's a group of nihilists in that film.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
They're just like, they don't care about anything.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I think they happen to be German, at least they have German accents.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And if you would all ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And I did actually re-watch it not so long ago.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
We have kids.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I thought maybe it's time.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It wasn't really time for the 11-year-old.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
No.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
So somewhat inappropriate.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But I have never taught that film, so I'd have to think more.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
We could talk about it.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Okay.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So I would love to because there is a, feels like there's a philosophical depth to that film.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
So there's a person that just the main character.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The Jeff Bridges character.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Jeff Bridges character.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Yeah.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians and he just kind of walks around in a very relaxed way.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And irradiates both a love for life, but also just an acceptance of like it is what it is kind of philosophy.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And then there's a bunch of characters that have very busy lives trying to do some big projects that are dramatic in some way.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Make some huge amounts of money.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot by Esteschi in a certain kind of sense.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And then there's these players, I mean they're phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don't care to enjoy life.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
They want to mess with life in some kind of way.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And of course there's interesting personalities that, what is it, Jesus, the bowler.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And then there's the John Goodman character that's talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely and so on.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Okay.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
All right.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Good.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Well, that's helpful.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Thank you for reminding me of all that.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I think, so one thing to say is that the nihilists, the group of nihilists who call themselves nihilists,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I think they've got a bad misinterpretation of what nihilism is supposed to be.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And this happened actually in the 20s.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:16.000
There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot of Nietzsche.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Nietzsche, you know, was a kind of hero for the Nazis even, I think based on a pretty bad misunderstanding of what he was up to.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000
But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first and they were students.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
They'd read a lot of Nietzsche and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:44.000
The only way that there's any significance in life is through our will to sort of powerfully bring something about.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And if we're going to do that in a way that reflects the fact that nothing means anything, then what we should do is take these things, these actions that people always thought were bad,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and do them and show that there's nothing wrong with doing them.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And so they decided they would murder someone, not because they were angry at them, just someone they'd never met.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It was important that it was someone they'd never met.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It was a totally unmotivated act.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And they thought, we'll embrace nihilism by showing that we can act in such a way as to do something that morality thinks is bad and through our will bring it about that we desire to do it.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
For no reason that has anything to do with its potentially being interpretable as good.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And I think that's a terrible misreading of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism is.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I mean, I think read that against the Miles Davis thing.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Miles Davis' aim is to creatively bring it about that something works well in a situation where he is kind of constrained.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
So they thought two things.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.000
One, there are no constraints at all, not even the constraints of the situation that we find ourselves in.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And two, we only become the beings that we really are when we act against what you might have thought the constraints were.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And I just think that's a bad misreading of what that kind of nihilism is up to.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski has got that kind of bad misreading.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
But then the major characters are much more interesting.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Go ahead, if you want to say something.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So there's some kind of apathy to their particular nihilism.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy as a philosophy part of that nihilism?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Sort of like from an existentialist perspective, how important is it to care about stuff, like really take on life?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:56.000
What does existentialism have to say about just sitting back and just not caring?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Excellent.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So apathy is like a really important word.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
The Greek word is apathy.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It means without passions.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier, really thought that passions are what get in the way if you're living well.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Because to live well, you have to think clearly about what you should do.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And you shouldn't let your resentments and your angers and your petty animosities direct your behavior.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So Stoicism, again, huge caricature.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
But it's an aim not to care because caring is bad.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And there's certain forms of existentialism, certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoyevsky and Heidegger and Sart in his own way.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing, where what's crucial about us is that we do care.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Heidegger says care is the being of Dasein.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Dasein is his name for us.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And you can't not do that.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You can pretend you're not doing it, but you're just caring in a different way.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It's like Sart saying you can pretend you're not taking responsibility.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Or you could pretend that you don't have to make a decision.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
That is making a decision.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Not caring is a way of caring.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in think that we do care.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
That's constitutive of what it is to be us.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And so they all think that the Stoics got it wrong.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But that leaves open a huge range of moves about how we inhabit that existence well.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Let me ask about Ayn Rand.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Okay.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So it just so happens that I've gotten, she's entered a few conversations in this podcast.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And just looking at academic philosophy or just philosophers in general, they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Do you have a sense of why that is?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Does she ever come into play, her ideas of objectivism come into play of discussions of a good life from the perspective of existentialism?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
In how you teach it and how you think about it?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Is she somebody who you find it all interesting?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
So no, I don't think she is.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
But it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I read it in high school.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I read The Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
But that's at this point a very long time ago.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I think I read something about objective epistemology or something too.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So, you know, my view about her could be based on a total misunderstanding of what she's up to.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But sort of my caricature of her and tell me if I've got it wrong is that she's sort of motivated by a kind of,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism, but maybe let's, in the context of our discussion, tie it back to Sartre,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:22.000
a kind of view according to which we're the being who has to contend with the fact that we're radically free to do stuff.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And we're just not being courageous or brave enough when we don't do that.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And the people to admire are the people who make stuff out of nothing.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So maybe that's a bad caricature.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
No, no, no.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I think, no, I think that's pretty accurate.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I'm not, again, very knowledgeable about the full depth of her philosophy.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:51.000
But I think she takes a view of the world that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:59.000
but makes stronger statements about epistemology that, first of all, everything is knowable.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And there's some, you should always operate through reason.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Like reason is very important.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's like you start with a few axioms and you build on top of that.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And the axioms that everybody should operate on are the same.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Again, reality is objective.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It's not subjective.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:30.000
So from that, you can derive the entirety of how humans should behave at the individual level and at the societal level.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And there's a few conclusions.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
She would talk about virtue of selfishness and sort of a lot of people use that to dismiss her look.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
She's very selfish and so on.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
She actually meant something very different.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It's more like the Sartre thing.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Take responsibility for yourself.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Understand what forces you're operating under and make the best of this life.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And that's how you can be the best member of societies by making the best life you can.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Just focus on yourself, fix your own problems first and then that will make you the best member of society,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I think the reason she's disliked, obviously on the philosophy side, she's disliked because a little bit like Nietzsche,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
she's like, she's literary.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I think the reason she's publicly disliked in sort of public conversations is because of how sure she is of herself.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
So that which is some of the philosophy been known to do, like make very strong statements like hell is other people,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
but she was making very strong statements about basically everything.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:54.000
The reason I bring her up is she is an influential thinker that is not for some reason often brought up as such.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It's not acknowledged how influential she is.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I was recently looking at like a list of the most important women of the 20th century in terms of thought,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
not science, but like thought and she wasn't in that list.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I see this time and time again and it doesn't make sense to me why she's so kind of dismissed

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.000
because clearly she's an author of some of the most read books ever

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
and she clearly had very strong ideas that should be contended with.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000
That's why it kind of didn't make sense to me because she's also a creature of her time and an important one.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
She's a creation of the Soviet Union, somebody who left because of that.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So some of the strength of her ideas has to do with how much she dislikes that particular philosophy and way of life.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000
But also she's a creature of like Sartre and like that whole like Nietzsche and so on.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Now one of the other criticisms is she doesn't integrate herself into this history.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.000
She keeps basically kind of implying that she's purely original in all her thoughts

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
even though she's kind of citing a lot of other people.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000
But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing as if they are truly original and they're not.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
It is interesting and also what's interesting about her is she is a woman.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000
She is a strong feminist and it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:42.000
it seems like she's a very important person in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Interesting.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Yeah.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Well, so I mean, I don't have a lot to add.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I will just say this.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I mean, the way she and Beauvoir seemed to me from your description of her and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
they seem pretty opposite from one another.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Like one of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir is that she takes seriously the thing that Sartre didn't,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:20.000
which is our thrownness, which is the sense in which we're born into a situation that's already got a significance for her.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints or at least there shouldn't be.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
We're pretty close as privileged white males.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
If we just get rid of the last bits of them, we would be God like we're supposed to be.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I think she reckons, one's not born but becomes a woman, she says.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So how does that happen?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Well, you're thrown into your culture and your culture starts treating you in a certain way because of your gender.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And that starts to form your understanding and your experience of things.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And by the time you're grown up, well, you're pretty well formed by that.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
That seems a fact.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It's a fact about Sartre too, though it was harder for him to notice it because he was formed into his privilege.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
But the world reminds us of our thrownness for some more than others.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And for people who have to contend on a daily basis with the fact that the social position they're thrown into is one that negates them.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Or one that oppresses them.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Or one that sort of pushes them to the side in some way or another.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I mean, the black experience is interesting in this respect too.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
France Fanon, who's a contemporary of Sartre and Beauvoir's, writes about it.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And it's very familiar, the things that he's saying now, but he writes back in the 50s about being a black man in Paris and getting on an elevator with a woman alone.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And how her reaction to him, not knowing him, not having any views about any reason to have any views about him, sort of puts him in a particular social position with respect to her.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And if you don't have that experience, it's much harder to recognize the way in which what we're thrown into is something we might not have chosen.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:40.000
So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence, which as you describe Ayn Rand's views, she sounds more like Sartre.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:47.000
She sounds more like either it's not an aspect of our existence, or at least we ought to sort of aim at it's not being.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Yeah, almost act as if it's not.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Act as if it's not.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And so I think from my point of view, I don't pretend that I'm explaining the public reception of her.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her in this intellectual context.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
From my point of view, that's something big to miss.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
And the ambition to think that really what's happening is that we're all the same.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
We're all rational beings.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:25.000
We're all beings who if we just got the axioms of our existence right and made good judgments and reasoned in an appropriate way would optimize ourselves.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:33.000
That feels to me like a kind of natural end point of the philosophical tradition.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view that helps us in that direction and the enlightenment moves us further in that direction.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:52.000
But from my point of view, that movement has led us astray because it's missed something really important that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Yeah, it misses the music.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Exactly.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
It misses the music.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Let's talk about thrownness.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Yeah.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So can we talk about Heidegger?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Okay.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
So who is this philosopher?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
What are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Okay.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
So Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I do know when he was born, 1889.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I know that only by accident.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000
It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein and Austrian philosopher was born and the same year that Hitler was born.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
So if I've remembered my dates right and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And it's interesting that the three of them were born at the same time.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But then it's also interesting that Heidegger was a Nazi.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I mean, this is a very disturbing fact about his personal political background.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And so it's something that anyone who thinks that things that he said might be interesting has got to contend with.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Wittgenstein is Austria also.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:14.000
But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi, you have to remember, I mean, there was millions of Nazis too.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
So they're parts of their, that's the history of the world.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:26.000
There's a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis in that part of history.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Absolutely.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And one of the discussion points is, well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I mean, he went to parties with them and stuff.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Or did he really believe in the ideology?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And that's a choice point.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And we could talk about it if you want.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
He held a political position.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
That's one of the relevant parts.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
That's like the president of the university.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And that was in Germany, all the universities are state universities.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And so that's a political appointment.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Can we just pause on this point?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Yeah.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.000
From an existentialist perspective, what's the role for standing up to evil?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So, I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say about these things because he was a bit of a political figure.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Like, do you have a responsibility not just for your decisions, but if the world you see around you is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside is ethical.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Do you have a responsibility to stand up to that even if it costs you your life or your well-being?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
You ask from an existential perspective and there's lots of different positions that you could have.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So, let me tell you something in the area of what I think I might believe, which comes out of this tradition.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And it's this.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:13.000
If you live in a community where people are being dragged down by the norms of the community rather than elevated, then there's two things that you have to recognize.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000
One is that you bear some responsibility for that, not necessarily because you chose it.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Maybe you reviled it.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Maybe you were against it.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000
But there's some way in which we all act in accordance with the norms of our culture.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
We all give in to them in some way or another.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And if those norms are broken, then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves to be responsible for broken norms.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
We've become responsible for broken norms.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And I do think you have to face up to that.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I think that let's just take gender norms.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Maybe the gender norms are broken.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Maybe the way men and women treat one another or the way men treat women is broken.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Maybe it is.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I'm not making a substantive claim.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I'm just saying, lots of people say it is.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:18.000
And if you're in a culture where those norms take root, you don't get to just isolate yourself and pull yourself out of the culture and think, I don't have any responsibility.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
You're already a part of the culture.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Even if you're isolating yourself from it, that's a way of rejecting the sort of part you play in the culture.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
But it's not a way of getting behind it.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Now you're playing that role differently.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You're saying, I don't want to take responsibility for what's going on around me.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And that's a way of taking responsibility by refusing to do it.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So I think we're implicated in whatever's going on around us.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And if we're going to do anything in our lives, we ought to recognize that.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Recognize that even in situations where you maybe didn't decide to do it, you could be part of bringing other people down and then devote yourself to trying to figure out how to act differently so that the norms update themselves.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And I think this is not a criticism of people.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
But Aleosha, who we mentioned in the Brothers Karamazov, he's a character.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
He's a kind of saintly character in the Brothers Karamazov.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:37.000
But one crucial moment in that story is when he realizes how awful he's been being to someone without ever even intending to do that.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It's Grushenka, who's this sort of fascinating woman.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And she's a very erotic woman.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
She's sort of sexual.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And Aleosha, in my reading of it, is kind of attracted to her.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
But he's a young kid.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
He's 20 or whatever.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And he's kind of embarrassed about it.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And he lives in the monastery and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest and he's kind of embarrassed by it.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
So what does he do?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Every time they run across one another in the street, he averts his gaze.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And why is he doing that?

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Because he's kind of embarrassed.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
But how does Grushenka experience it?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Well, she knows she's a fallen woman.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And she knows that Aleosha has this other position in society.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So her read on it is, he's passing judgment on me.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
He can see that he doesn't want to be associated with me.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
He can see that I'm a fallen woman.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
He knows that in order to maintain his purity,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
he's got to avoid me.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
That's not what Aleosha intended to do.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
But that's the way it's experienced.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
And so there's this way.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
He comes to recognize, oh my God,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000
like what I'm supposed to do is love people in Dostoevsky's view of things.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I'm making her life worse.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I'm making her feel terrible about herself.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And if I actually came to know her, I'd recognize her condition is difficult.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
She's living a difficult life.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
She's making hard choices.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And why don't I see that in her face instead of this other thing

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
that's making me want to avoid her?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And that's a huge moment.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
But the idea is that we're implicated in bringing other people down,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
whether we want to be or not.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And that's our condition.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
The requirement to understand that is to be almost to a radical degree,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
be empathetic and to listen to the world.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
It's not so simple.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
All of this is messy.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
For example, this is me talking.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It's clear to me that, for example, the woke culture has bullying built into it,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
has some elements of the same kind of evil built into it.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And when you're part of the wave of wokeness standing up for social rights,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
you also have to listen and think, are we going too far?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Are we hurting people?

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Are we doing the same things that others, that we're fighting against,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
that others were doing in the past?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
So it's not simple.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Once you see that there's evil being done, that it's easy to fix.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:27.000
No, in our society, there's something about our human nature

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
that just too easily stops listening to the world, to empathizing with the world.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And we label things as evil.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
This is through human history.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
This is evil.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
You mentioned tribes.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
This religious belief is evil.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And so we have to fight it and we become certain and dogmatic about it.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.000
It seems like a life that accepts and responsibility for the norms we're in

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
has to constantly be sort of questioning yourself

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
and questioning, like listening to the world fully and richly

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:13.000
without being weighed down by any one sort of realization.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You just always constantly have to be thinking about the world.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Am I wrong?

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I mean, the very last thing you said,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
you've constantly got to be thinking about the world.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
You've constantly got to be listening.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
You've constantly got to be attending.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
And it's not simple.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
All that sounds exactly right to me.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And the phrase that rings through my head is another one from the Brothers Karamazov.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Dimitri, this passionate, sort of sometimes violent brother

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
who is also sort of deeply cares.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Because he's passionate, he's sort of got care through and through,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
but it's breaking him apart.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.000
He says at one point, God and the devil are fighting in the battlefield

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
is the heart of man.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And I just think, yeah, it's not simple.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And the idea that there might be a purely good way of doing things

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
is just not our condition.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Everything we do is going to be sort of undermined by some aspect of it.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
There's not going to be a kind of pure good in human existence.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And so it's sort of required that we're going to have to be empathetic,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000
that we're going to have to recognize that others are dealing with that just as we are.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So I apologize for distracting us.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
We were talking about Heidegger.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And the reason we were distracted is he happened to also be a Nazi.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
He nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
What are the ideas he's brought to the world?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Okay.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So that's a big, huge question.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
and he's not really wrong to think this,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
maybe even from the pre-Socratics forward,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
from like the sixth century BC to now,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
has been motivated by a certain kind,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
or has been grounded on a certain kind of assumption

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
that it didn't have the right to make,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
and that it's led us astray,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000
and that until we understand the way in which it's led us astray,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
we're not going to be able to get to grips with the condition we now find ourselves in.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
So let me start with what he thinks the condition we now find ourselves in is.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I'm just going to sort of mush it all together for the purposes of today.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things that we need to contend with

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
when we think about what it is to be us now

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000
is that the right name for our age is a technological age.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Now, what does it mean for our age to be a technological age?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Well, it means that we have an understanding of what it is for anything at all to be at all,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000
that we never really chose that sort of animating the way we live our lives,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000
that's animating our understanding of ourselves and everything else,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
that is quite limited,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
organized around the idea that to be something

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:41.000
is to be what's sitting there as an infinitely flexible reserve

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
to be optimized and made efficient.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And Heidegger thinks that that's not just the way we think of silicon circuits,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000
or the river when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
we're optimizing the flow of the river so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
and we can use it in any way at all.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
It's the way we understand ourselves, too.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000
We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential that needs to be made efficient and optimized.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And when I talk with my students about it, I ask them,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
like, what's your calendar look like?

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
What's the goal of your day?

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Is it to get as many things into it as possible?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Is it to feel like I've failed unless I've made my life so efficient

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
that I'm doing this and this and this and this and this,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
that I can't let things go by?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:52.000
The feeling that I think we all have that there's some pressure to do that,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:00.000
to relate to ourselves that way is a clue to what Heidegger thinks the technological age is about.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
And he thinks that's different from every other age in history.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century at the beginning of the Enlightenment

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000
as subjects who represent objects.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Descartes thought that a subject is something, some mental sort of realm

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
that represents the world in a certain way.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And we are closed in on ourselves in the sense that we have a special relation to our representations.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
That's what the realm of the subject is.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
But others, in the Middle Ages, we were created in the image and likeness of God.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And in the pre-Socratic age, to be was to be what wooshes up and lingers for a while

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
and fades away the paradigm of what is where thunder storms

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.000
and the anger of the gods, Achilles' battle fury.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And it overtakes everything and stays for a while and then leaves.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
The flowers blooming in spring.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
And that's very different from the way we experience ourselves.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
So the question is, what are we supposed to do in the face of that?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition that's motivated everything from the pre-Socratics forward

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:29.000
is that there is some entity that's the ground of the way we understand everything to be.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
For the Middle Ages, it was God.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
That was the entity that made things be the things that they are.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
For the Enlightenment, it was us, maybe first art.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
It's us.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:47.000
And Heidegger thinks whatever it is that stands at the ground of what we are, it's not another thing.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
It's not another entity.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
And we're relating to it in the wrong way if we think of it like that.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
There's some way, and this is partly why I was interested in Meister Eckhart.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.000
He says, what there is, is there's giving going on in the world.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And we're the grateful recipient of it.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And the giving is like whatever it is, it's the social norms that we're thrown into.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
We didn't choose them.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
They were given to us.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
And that's the ground.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000
That is what makes it possible for anything to be intelligible at all.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:25.000
If we lived outside of communities, if we lived in a world where there were no social norms at all,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
nothing would mean anything.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Nothing would have any significance.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Nothing would be regular in the way that things need to be regular in order for there to be departures

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
or manifestations of that regularity.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:45.000
So community norms are crucial, but they're also always updating.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:53.000
We have some responsibility for what they are and the way in which they're updating themselves.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:06.000
So those norms are somehow giving significance to us in a way that we're implicated in.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
We have some relation to.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
And all that gets covered over if you think of us as efficient resources to be optimized.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Is that a conflicting view that we are resources to be optimized?

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact that there is a ground that we stand on?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Absolutely.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So what Heidegger thinks is that he calls this the supreme danger of the technological age,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
is that without ever having chosen it, without ever having decided it,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
this is the way we understand what it is to be us.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:46.000
But he thinks that it's also, he says, quoting Holderlin, this 18th century German poet,

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000
he says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So what does that mean?

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000
It means that this is the understanding that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
It's the gift that was given to us.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
It's supremely dangerous.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000
If we let ourselves live that way, we'll destroy ourselves.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:14.000
But it's also the saving possibility because if we recognize that we never chose that,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.000
that it was given to us, but also we were implicated in its being given,

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.000
and we could find a way to supersede it, that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
He calls the ground the groundless ground.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:38.000
It's not like an entity which is there, solid, stable, like God, who's eternal and non-changing.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000
It's always updating itself, and we're always involved in its being updated.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000
We're only involved in it in the right way if we listen, like Miles Davis.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Optimization is not a good way to live life.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:02.000
If you thought that it was obviously clear that that was the relevant value,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
so obviously clear that it never even occurred to you to ask whether it was right to think that,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
then you would be in danger.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Got it.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.000
There is some in this modern technological age in the full meaning of the word technology

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000
that's updated to actual modern age with a lot more technology going on.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space actually are somehow drawn to that optimization,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:39.000
as if that's going to save us, as if the thing that truly weighs us down is the inefficiencies.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Exactly.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I think if you think about other contexts, what are the moments when ...

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
We're unique in this respect.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
This period in history is unlike any previous period.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Nobody ever felt that way.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
But think about, but it's also true that no previous period in history was nihilistic.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Our condition is tied up.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000
That sort of thing is meant to be a response to the felt lack of a ground.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
No previous epoch in history felt that way.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
They didn't have our problem.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:23.000
It was much more natural to them to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for us,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
what we were calling moments of aliveness before.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Think about the context in which they felt them.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
They weren't efficient, optimized contexts.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Think about the Greeks.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
They never read Homer.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
It is a bizarre world back there.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:45.000
But one of the things that's bizarre is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:52.000
that the only thing that seems to run through all of the different Greek cultures

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:00.000
is the idea that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Because Zeus is the God of strangers and Zeus will be angry.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
That's what they say.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
But how does it manifest itself?

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Odysseus, he's trying to get home and he gets shipwrecked on an island.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And he's trying to figure out how he's been at sea for 10 days.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
He's starving.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000
He's bedraggled and he sees now Cissa, the princess who's beautiful.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
And he's like, boy, I better get some clothes or something.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
So she takes him to the palace.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:40.000
They have three days of banquets and festivals before they even ask his name.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
It's like, here's a stranger.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger because this is where significance lies.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Now, we don't have to feel that way.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000
But the idea that that's one of the places where significance could lie

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.000
is pretty strongly at odds with the idea that our salvation is going to come from optimization and efficiency.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Now, maybe something about the way we live our lives will have that integrated into it.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
But it's at odds with other moments.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Let me ask you a question about Hubert Dreyfus.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:23.000
He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours, unfortunately no longer with us.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
You wrote with him the book titled All Things Shining,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:39.000
First, can you maybe speak about who that man was, what you learned from him?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000
And then we could maybe ask how do we find through the classics, meaning in a secular age?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Okay.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:58.000
So, Hubert Dreyfus was a very important philosopher of the late 20th, early 21st century.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
He was my teacher.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
That's where he taught.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000
He plays an interesting and important role in the history of philosophy in America

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:25.000
because in a period when most philosophers in America and in the English-speaking world

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000
were not taking seriously 20th century French and German philosophy, he was.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And he was really probably the most important English-speaking interpreter of Heidegger,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
the German philosopher that we've been talking about.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
He was an incredible teacher.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
A lot of his influence came through his teaching.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher was his sort of mix of intellectual humility

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
with sort of deep, insightful authority.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
You've taught huge classes because people love to go see him.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:20.000
And I taught for him for many years and say, you know, I've been reading this text for 40 years,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
but the question you asked is one I've never asked.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
And it would be true.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.000
He would find in what people said things that were surprising and new to him.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
And that's humility, actually.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
That is listening to the world.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Absolutely.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Absolutely.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And he was always ready to be surprised by something that someone said.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And there's something astonishing about that.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000
So his influence was, you know, for people who didn't know him through his interpretations of these texts,

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
he wrote about a huge range of stuff.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But for people who didn't know him, it was through his presence.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
It was through the way he carried himself in his life.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
And so in any case, that's who he was.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Because we, I graduated after many years as a graduate student.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I didn't start in philosophy.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I started in math, math and computer science, actually.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience for a few years.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
It's a fascinating journey.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
We'll get to it through our friendly conversation about artificial intelligence.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Okay.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I'm sure.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Because you're basically fascinated with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
but rooted in a curiosity of mind through its artificial, through the engineering of mind.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:48.000
So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually is because of his, to begin with,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
was because of his criticisms of what was called traditional symbolic AI in the 70s and 80s.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:59.000
So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer science,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
a lot of computational neuroscience.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:07.000
I noticed that you had, you interview a lot of people in this world.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate, Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton,

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
a big book on neural networks.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
So I had, I was interested in that.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Not so interested in traditional AI, like sort of Lisp programings, things that went on in the 80s.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Because it felt sort of, you know, when you made a system do something,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000
all of a sudden it was an uninteresting thing to have done.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
The fact that you'd solved the problem that made it clear that the problem wasn't an interesting one to solve.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000
That's right.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And I had that experience.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And Bert had criticisms of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI, GOFI.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And I was attracted to those criticisms because it felt to me that there was something lacking in that project.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And I didn't know what it was.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I just felt its absence.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:12.000
And then I learned that all his arguments came from his reading of this phenomenological and existential tradition.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And so I had to try to figure out what those folks were saying.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
And it was a long road, let me tell you.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
It took me a long time.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
But it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
And eventually we went on to write a book together, which was a great experience.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And that's a book that I definitely would not have had the chutzpah to try to write if it weren't for Bert.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Because it was really about great literature in the history of the West from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:54.000
There's a huge chapter on Melville, a big chapter on David Foster Wallace, who Bert didn't care about at all.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
But I was fascinated by it.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And so learning to think that way while writing that book with him was an amazing experience.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:15.000
So I have to admit, one of my failings in life, one of many failings is I've never gotten through Moby Dick or any of Melville's works.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:28.000
So maybe can you comment on, before we talk about David Foster Wallace, who I have gotten through, what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Good.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel of the 19th century.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So the Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick and they're diametrically opposed, which is one of the really interesting things.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:48.000
So the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of existential interpretation of Russian Orthodox Christianity.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:08.000
It sort of starts with the observation that the form of Christianity that Ishmael is familiar with is broken.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It's not going to work in his living, his life.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
He has to leave it.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
He has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
And Ishmael is the wailing boat captain?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000
So he's not the captain.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
That's Ahab.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Ahab is the captain.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Yeah, right.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Let me back up.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
The famous opening line to the book is, call me Ishmael.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
And Ishmael is the main character in the book.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
He's a nobody.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
He's you and me.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
He's the everyday guy.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
He's like a nobody on the ship.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
He's not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
He's right in the middle.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:55.000
And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of Abraham in the Old Testament.

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:01.000
He is the, I think if I have it right, again, someone will correct me.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I think he's the one that Islam traces its genesis to.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion, like Judaism and Christianity.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:21.000
But Judaism and Christianity trace their lineage through Isaac, the quote unquote legitimate son of Abraham.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham, who he had with a girlfriend.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:38.000
He's named after the non-Christian sort of son of Abraham.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And the book starts out with this, what does he call it?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Something like a dark and misty November mood.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:56.000
He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his, I can't remember what the word is, but his hypos.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
That's what he calls them.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
He's in a mood.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
He's depressed.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
He's down.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Things are not going well.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And that's where he starts.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:18.000
And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage with this captain, Ahab, who is this incredibly charismatic, deeply disturbing character,

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:25.000
who is a captain who's got lots of history and wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
That's what they do.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
They harpoon these whales and bring them back and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
He's an authority figure.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:44.000
And he is megalomaniacally obsessed with getting one particular whale, which is called Moby Dick.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest, the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:02:00.000
And Ahab wants to get him because a number of years earlier, he had an encounter with Moby Dick where Moby Dick bit off his leg.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And he survived, but he had this deeply religious experience in the wake of it.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Like, what is the meaning of my suffering?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick, this Leviathan at the center of it, should treat me this way?

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:30.000
And so his task is not just to go whaling, it's to figure out the meaning of the universe through going whaling

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.000
and having a confrontation with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:44.000
And the confrontation is so weird because Melville points out that whales, their faces are so huge.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Their foreheads are so huge.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000
And their eyes are on the side of them that you can never actually look them in the eye.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.000
And it's kind of a metaphor for God, like you can't ever look God in the face.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.000
You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe by looking God in the face.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
But Ahab wants to.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
He says he's got a paste-bored mask of a face.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
But I'll strike through the mask and find out what's behind.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:22.000
And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing and he's like going whaling because he's in a bad mood.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And maybe this will make things better.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
And he makes friends with this guy Quiquewag.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And Quiquewag is a pagan.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
He's from an island in the South Pacific.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000
And he's got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:45.000
He's party-colored, like every different color, says Ishmael, is these tattoos.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:58.000
And they are the writing on his body, he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe as understood through his culture.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:06.000
And so somehow Quiquewag is this character who is like not Christian at all.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
He's supposed to be the king.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
He's the son of the king and probably his father's died by now.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
And if he went home, he'd be the king.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
But he's off on a voyage too, trying to understand who he is before he goes back and leads his people.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:32.000
And he's got the mystery of the universe tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:41.000
And it's through his relation with Quiquewag that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding of what we might be about.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
So that's Moby Dick in a nutshell.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000
And connected to a book I have read, which is funny.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:56.000
There's probably echoes that represent the 20th century now in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:07.000
That also has similar, I guess, themes, but more personal, more focused on the...

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I mean, I guess it's less about God.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.000
It's almost more like the existentialist version of Moby Dick and hence shorter.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000
A lot shorter.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Yeah, well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.000
But do you see echoes and do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:29.000
It's been since ninth grade that I've been Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than the Fountainhead.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
So I didn't know we were going to go there.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I mean, I find Hemingway interesting.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:44.000
But Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him is that we have to confront the dangers and the difficulties of our life.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and manliness.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
And I think there's something interesting about that.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
He's for risk in a certain way.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
And I think that's important.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.000
But now I don't have any right to say this since it's been so long since I read it.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I do feel like there's...

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.000
I don't remember a sense for quite the tragedy of it.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Maybe there is.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Is it a melancholy novel?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I don't even remember.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000
No, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000
It has a sense of this is how life is.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:36.000
And it has more about old age and that you're not quite the man you used to be feeling of this is how time passes.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:43.000
And then the passing of time and how you get older and this is one last fish.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000
It's less about this is the fish.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
It's more like this is one last fish.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:56.000
And asking who was I as a man as a human being in this world?

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Wonderful.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.000
But it's one fish, which is just sort of all the other fish too.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:13.000
And that is a big difference because for Ahab, no other fish will do than Moby Dick.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.000
It's got to be the biggest, the most powerful, the most tormenting.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000
It's got to be the one that you've got history with that has defiled you.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.000
And it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
What about David Foster Wallace?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:36.000
So why is he important to you in the search of meaning in a secular age?

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Good.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000
So I'll just just to finish the Moby Dick thing.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I think what's interesting about Melville is that he thinks our salvation comes not if we get in the right relation to monotheism or Christianity,

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.000
but if we get in the right relation to polytheism to the idea that there's not a unity to our existence.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
But there are lots of little meanings and they don't cohere.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Sometimes, you know, like in Homer, sometimes you're in love.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
They go off and run away and the Trojan War begins.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
And sometimes you're in a battle fury.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Their love is Aphrodite's realm and the battle fury, that's Ares realm and that's a totally different world.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
And they're not even, I mean, they're related.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Mostly you're just in different sort of local meaningful worlds.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And Melville seems to think that that's a thing that we could aim to bring back.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:47.000
He says we have to lure back the Mary May Day gods of old and lovingly enthrone them in the now egotistical sky, the now unhaunted hill.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000
That's what we live in this world where hills aren't haunted with significance anymore.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000
And the sky is just a bunch of stuff that we're studying with physics and astrophysics and stuff.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:04.000
But they used to be awe-inspiring and we have to figure out how to get in that relation to them.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.000
But not by trying to give a unity to our existence through developing habits and practices that get written on our body.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:19.000
And so his is about the end of Judeo-Christianity and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:29.000
In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting about him is that I think he is a great observer of the contemporary world.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
And he's a very funny writer.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I mean, he's really funny, but he's a great observer of the contemporary world.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:44.000
And what he thought was at the core of the contemporary world was this constant temptation to diversion through entertainment.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000
That's a different story than Heidegger's story about efficiency and optimization.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
But it's the other side of it.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Like, what is this temptation sort of diverting us from?

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000
The ability to be more efficient.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:08.000
So, you know, you're tempted to go watch some stupid film or television show or something that's dumb and not really very interesting.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:15.000
But you read that temptation as a temptation precisely in virtue of it's taking you away from your optimizing your existence.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
And so I think there are two sides of the same coin.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I think he's brilliant at describing it.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in that it was something that we needed to confront.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
And find a way out of.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
And his characters are trying to do that.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000
And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000
One, I mean, David Foster Wallace committed suicide.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
And when I, and it's very sad.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:49.000
And he clearly did have, you know, sort of, there was a physiological basis to his condition.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
He knew it.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000
He was treating it for decades with medication.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
He had electroshock therapy a number of times.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
It's just very, very sad story.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.000
When I decided that we were going to write about David Foster Wallace.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:16.000
The first thing I was worried about is what can you, can you like obviously a motivating factor, maybe the motivating factor in his committing suicide was his physiological condition.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
But there was, there's, there's this, there was a question.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Could you think, I mean, he's obsessed with the condition, with what we need to do to achieve our salvation, to live well, to make our lives worth living.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:49.000
So in addition to the physiological thing, which probably most of it, the question for me was, could you find in his writing what his, what he was identifying as the thing we needed to do?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
That he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.000
And he, and he talks as if that's, that's the difficulty for him.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
So, so that, that's one side of him.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And I did want to find that.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000
I think there's another side of him that's very different, but you were going to ask.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
No, please.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
What's the other side?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I mean, what I write about in the, in the chapter mostly is what I think he's got as our, as, as our saving possibility.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:33.000
He thinks our saving possibility, he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to Kenyon, is that we have the freedom to interpret situations however we like.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
So what's the problem case for him?

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000
He says, look, you know, the problem case, we have, we have it all the time.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
You get pissed off at the world.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You know, some, some big SUV cuts you off on the highway and you're pissed off and you might express your anger with one finger or another directed at that person.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:04.000
And he says, but actually, you know, you're being pissed off as the result of your having made an assumption.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000
And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Like the assumption is that you're the center of the universe and you shouldn't assume that.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:24.000
And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says, is to recognize the possibility that maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Like maybe that guy is racing to the hospital, you know, to take care of his dying spouse who's been there suffering, you know, from cancer.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Or maybe he's, you know, on the way to pick up a sick child or maybe he's, and it's not an action directed.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000
That was your assumption, not something that was inherent in the situation.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
And I think there's something interesting about that.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I think there's something right about that.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:06.000
At the same time, I don't think he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories and whether they're true or not doesn't matter.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:10.000
What matters is that they free us from this assumption.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Yes.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000
And I think they only free us from this assumption if they're true.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you and that's part of the situation.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000
And like you can't pretend that it's not part of the situation.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:32.000
So you have to listen to what's actually happening and then you have to figure out how to make it right.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000
You can just tell whatever story you like about it.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
And I think that's actually too tough.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000
I don't think we have that kind of freedom.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:58.000
And he writes these incredibly moving letters when he's trying to write The Pale King, which is the unfinished novel that really sort of drove him to distraction.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:11.000
At the center of the novel is this character who one of the characters at the center of the novel is a guy who's doing the most boring thing you could possibly imagine.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000
He is an IRS tax examiner.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:21.000
He's going over other people's tax returns trying to figure out whether they follow the rules or not.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:27.000
And like just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day is just terrifying.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:40.000
And he puts this guy in an enormous warehouse that extends for miles where person after person after person is in rows of desks sort of nameless.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Each of them doing this task.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:48.000
So he's in nowhere doing nothing and it's got to be intensely boring.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000
And now the main character is trying to teach himself to do that.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
And the question is how do you put up with the boredom?

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.000
How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And the main character is able to confront that condition with such bliss that he literally levitates from happiness while he's going over other people's tax returns.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And that's my metaphor for what I think Wallace must have imagined we have to try to aspire to.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And I think that's unlivable.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I think there's something else we could achieve.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:50.000
And the other thing that we can achieve that I think is something that he also is onto but doesn't write about as often is something more like achieving peak moments of significance in a situation when something great happens.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000
And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
He loved tennis.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Are you a tennis lover?

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I'm not a lover of tennis, but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
I see the beauty in it, the artistry.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I just like that as a sport.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Good.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Okay.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Well, I didn't play much tennis, but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
And I always thought it was boring to watch.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:23.000
But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer, you're like, wow, I've been missing something.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000
And the article which appeared in the New York Times magazine was called Roger Federer as religious experience.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Oh, wow.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
There you go.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:40.000
And he says, look, there's something astonishing about watching someone who's got a body like us and having a body is a limitation.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.000
It's like the sight of sores and pains and agony and exhaustion.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And it's the thing that dies in the end.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.000
And so it's what we have to confront.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
If you didn't have a body, there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000
But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:20.000
That when you watch someone who's got one and is extraordinary at the way they use it, you can recognize how that limitation can be to some degree transcended.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And that that's what we can get when we watch Federer or some other great athlete sort of doing these things that transcend the limitations of their bodies.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And that that's the kind of peak experience that we're capable of that could be a kind of salvation.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
That's a very different story.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
And I think that's a livable story.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:51.000
And I don't know if it would have saved him, but I feel like I wish he'd developed that side of the story more.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Can we talk about, and first of all, let me just comment that I deeply appreciate that you said you were going to say something.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
The fact that you're listening to me is amazing, like that you care about other humans.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
I really appreciate that.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
We should be in this way listening to the world.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
So that's a meta comment about many of the things we're talking about.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:26.000
But you mentioned something about levitating and a task that is infinitely boring and contrasting that with essentially levitating on a task that is great.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Like the highest achievement of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Now, I often say this.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this, but he said that the key to life is to be unboreable.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
That is the embodiment of this philosophy.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:52.000
And when people ask me for advice, like young students, you know, I don't find this interesting.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000
I don't find this interesting.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
How do I find the thing I'm passionate for?

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:04.000
This would be very interesting to explore because you kind of say that that may not be a realizable thing to do, which is to be unboreable.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
But my advice usually is life is amazing.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Like you should be able to, you should strive to discover the joy, the levitation in everything.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:23.000
And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time, that might be the thing you should stick to.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.000
But everything should be full of joy.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:38.000
So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring is a thing that will prevent you from discovering the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:45.000
But you're saying being unboreable is not actionable for a human being.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000
So, okay, excellent question, deep question.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:21:01.000
And you might think because of the title of the book that Bert and I wrote, All Things Shining, that I think all things are shining.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:07.000
But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal to be unboreable.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I do believe that you're right that a lot of times when people are bored with something,

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
it's because they haven't tried hard enough.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:27.000
And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored with something is that they haven't paid attention well enough and that they haven't listened, as you were saying.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000
So I do think there's something to that.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I think that's a deep insight.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:42.000
On the other hand, the perfection of that insight is that nothing is ever anything less than joyful.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:59.000
And I actually think that Dostoyevsky and Melville both agree, but in very different ways, that life involves a wide range of moods and that all of them are important.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
It involves grief.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Like, I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grieve.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.000
And it's not in the first instance joyful.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:17.000
It's related to joy because it makes the joys you feel when you feel them more intense.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:23.000
But it makes them more intense by putting you in the position of experiencing the opposite.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:36.000
And it's only because we're capable of a wide range of passionate responses to situations that I think the significances can be as meaningful as they are.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000
So Melville, again, has this sort of interest.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I mean, let's just say the guilt and the grief in the Brothers Karamazov.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
He's grieving.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
It's super important that he's grieving.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:04.000
He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving where he sees the sort of deep sort of beauty of everything that is, but it comes through the grief, not by avoiding the grief.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:11.000
And Melville says something like, Ishmael says something like, he says, I'm like a Catskill Mountain Eagle.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
The Catskills Mountains nearby.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:20.000
He says who's sort of flying high above the earth, going over the peaks and down into the valleys.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I have these ups and these downs, but they're all invested with a kind of significance.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:32.000
They all happen at an enormously high height because it's through the mountains that I'm flying.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:37.000
And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up, but it's really down.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
It's just that it's a way of being up because it makes the ups even upper.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that can be destructive.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I mean, I tend to see, for example, grief, a loss of love as part of love in that it's a celebration of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:11.000
So it's all part of the same experience, but if you turn it into an optimization problem where everything can be unboreable, then that can in itself be destructive.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Yeah.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Yeah.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace on the internet where it's a video of him and there is like a foreign sounding reporter asking him questions.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000
I think there's an accident of some sort, German, I think, something like that.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
And I don't know, it just painted a picture of such a human person.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
We were talking about listening.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:40.000
The interviewer, if I may say, wasn't a very good one in the beginning.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:53.000
So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things of just kind of generic questions and just kind of asking very basic questions, but he brought out something in her over time.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her and also sensitive to being thinking and acting human in this world.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000
That's just painted such a beautiful picture that people should go definitely check out.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:20.000
They made me really sad that we don't get this kind of picture of other thinkers, all of the ones we've been talking about, just that almost this little accidental view of this human being.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000
I don't know.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
It was a beautiful one.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.000
And I guess there's not many like that, even of him.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Yeah.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Yeah.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:34.000
No, I think he was more than his writing ability, which was extraordinary.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
He had developed a style that was, I think, unlike anyone else's style.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:50.000
It was his sensitivity to other people and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:58.000
He wants, in one of his essays, I think it's the one called an incredibly fun thing I'll never do again.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I do know that one about cruise ships.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball that just sort of walks around the ship noticing things.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000
And he was incredibly good at that.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:21.000
But I also worry that that reflects something that you find in Ivan, in the Brothers Karamazov.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part, when he's away at school as a young, a college, as a young boy, he makes money by going around town to where tragic events have occurred.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Someone just got run over by a carriage or someone, you know, something just happened.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.000
And being the first one there, he always knows somehow where these things are going to happen.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:52.000
And writing about it, giving this really good description and then signing it, I witness.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:27:02.000
And it's as if Ivan's understanding of his life is that he was supposed to be a witness to it.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000
He was supposed to see others but not get involved.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.000
He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things from happening.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.000
He just wants to report on them when he sees them.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.000
And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person, character.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:34.000
And it's his isolation from others, from the love of others and his inability, his desire not to love others because that attaches him to someone that I think is really at the ground of his condition.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
And I think that aim to be isolated, which many people have nowadays.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:50.000
I mean, you see it in the underground man too, just sort of taking yourself out of the world because you don't want to have to take responsibility for being involved with others.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I think that's a bad move.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.000
And I do worry that maybe, I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000
I have no right to comment, you know, on his life.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000
But he portrays himself in that one episode as a person who does that.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
And I think that's dangerous.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah, there's some sense in which being sensitive to the world.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Like I find myself, the source of joy for me is just being really sensitive to the world, to experience.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:25.000
There's some way, it's quite brilliant where you're saying that that could be isolating.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:31.000
It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species on an island.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
You don't want to interfere with it.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
You find it so beautiful that you don't want to interfere with its beauty.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:49.000
So there is some sense in which that isolates you and then you find yourself deeply alone away from the experiences that bring you joy.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
And that could be destructive.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
That's fascinating how that works.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.000
And in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals in his brain.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:09.000
But some of it is the path, his philosophy of life let him down.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000
And that's the danger we need you to in gazing into the abyss.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Your job is a difficult one because doing philosophy changes you.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Yeah.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:29.000
And you may not know how it changes you until you're changed and you look in the mirror.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:38.000
You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review saying that AI can't be an artist.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000
You mentioned Burt and criticism of symbolic AI.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible, the capacity for artistry and creativity in our robot friends?

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Yeah, I can try.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:17.000
So to make the argument, you have to have in mind what counts as art, what counts as a creative artistic act.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:31.000
I mean, we say that good art is original, but not everything that's never been done before is good art.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.000
So there has to be more than just doing something new.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:48.000
It has to be somehow doing something new in a way that speaks to the audience or speaks to some portion of the audience at least.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:31:00.000
It has to be doing something new in such a way that some people who see or interact with it can see themselves anew in it.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:13.000
So I think that art is inherently a creative act, sorry, a kind of communicative act that it involves a relation with other people.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:18.000
So think about the conditions for that working.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Someone, I talk in that article, I can't remember, something about new music.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I think I don't talk about Stravinsky, but let's say Stravinsky.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there's riots.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:39.000
It is new and people hate it.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:42.000
It sounds like a cacophony.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
It sounds awful.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.000
It's written according to principles that are not like the principles of music composition that people are familiar with.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:03.000
But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff, I mean, we now can recognize that it wasn't a failed communicative act.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:07.000
It just hadn't reached its time yet.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:15.000
And now that way of composing music is like, you know, it's in Disney movies.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:22.000
It's so part of our musical palette that we don't have that response.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
It changed us.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.000
It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
So that's a deep communicative act.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000
It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:42.000
But it did ultimately establish a new understanding for all of us of what counts as good art.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:47.000
And that's the kind of deep communication that I think good art can do.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:57.000
It can change our understanding of ourselves and of what a good manifestation of something of ourselves in a certain domain is.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
And use the term socially embedded.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000
That art is fundamentally socially embedded.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Yeah.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:16.000
And I really like that term because I see like my love for artificial intelligence and the kind of system that we can bring to the world that could make for an interesting

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:24.000
and more lively world and one that enriches human beings is one where the AI systems are deeply socially embedded.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Good.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Yeah.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:32.000
So that and that actually is in contrast to the way artificial intelligence have been talked about throughout its history.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:41.000
And certainly now both on the robotics side and the AI side, it's especially on the tech sector where the businesses around AI,

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:48.000
they kind of want to create systems that are like servants to humans.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:55.000
And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness of where art will be part.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:04.000
I think that there is no reason why you can't integrate AI systems in the way you integrate new humans to the picture.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.000
There are just the full diversity and the flaws.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000
All of that adds to the thing.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Now, you know, some people might say that AlphaZero is this system from DeepMind that was able to achieve, you know, solve the game,

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:28.000
it beat the best people in the world that the game of go with no supervision from humans.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:36.000
But more interestingly to me on the side of creativity, it was able to surprise a lot of grandmasters with the kind of moves that came up with.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Now, to me, that's not the creativity, the magic that's socially embedded that we're talking about.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:50.000
That is merely revealing the limitations of humans to discover.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.000
It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I think creativity is not just even socially embedded.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:07.000
It's the way you're saying it's part of the communicative act.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000
It's the interactive, it's the dance with the culture.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:17.000
And so it has to be like for AlphaZero to be creative, truly creative,

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:22.000
it would have to be integrated in a way where it has a Twitter account.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And it becomes aware of the impact it has on the other grandmasters with the moves that's coming up.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:37.000
And there's one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero, which I just love so much,

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
is I don't know if you're familiar with chess.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I am, yeah.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:47.000
So it does certain things that most chess players, even at the highest level, don't do,

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:55.000
which is it sacrifices pieces, it gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves before it pays you back.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
So to me that's beautiful.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:03.000
That's art if only AlphaZero understood the artistry of that,

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:09.000
which is I'm going to mess with you psychologically because I'm going to do two things.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:14.000
One, make you feel overconfident that you're doing well,

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.000
but actually also once you realize you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you,

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.000
you're going to feel really nervous about what's on the way.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
This is the calm before the storm.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.000
And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece of this chess game.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
If only AlphaZero was then messing with you additionally to that

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000
and was cognizant of this doing that, then it becomes art.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
And then it's integrated into society in that way.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:52.000
And I believe it doesn't have to actually have an understanding of the world in the way that humans have.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000
It can have a different one.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:59.000
It can be like a child is as clueless about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:02.000
And that's part of the magic of it, just being flawed,

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:07.000
being lacking understanding all interesting kinds of ways, but interacting.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
So to me, it's possible to create art for AI,

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.000
but exactly as you're saying in a deeply socially embedded way.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Good.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Well, I think we agree, but let me just highlight the thing that makes me think that we agree,

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:36.000
which is that I think for people, for a community to allow themselves to recognize in a certain kind of creative act,

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I'm thinking of Stravinsky here, but we could think of a chess thing,

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:50.000
to recognize in a certain kind of creative act a new and admirable, worthy way of thinking about what's significant in the situation.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000
You have to believe that it wasn't random.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:04.000
You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way because he was receptive to what needed to be said now.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:16.000
And so you said if only AlphaZero could do all this by virtue of recognizing that this was the thing that needed to be done,

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000
then it would be socially embedded in the right way.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
And I think I agree with that.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:28.000
First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain, a game-playing domain, go or chess.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Go is more complicated than chess, but either one of them,

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:39.000
because there really are only a finite range of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point,

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000
it's a combinatorial problem in the end.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Now, obviously AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem in a combinatorial way.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.000
That would take too much energy.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000
You couldn't do it.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.000
It sort of explodes the problem.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:03.000
So it does it in this other way that's interesting, this pattern recognition way, roughly.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:17.000
And in that context, it may well be that it can see, having had lots and lots of experience in the training stuff against itself or against another version of itself,

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.000
it can see that the sacrifice here is going to pay dividends down the road.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000
See, I put that in quotation marks.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:38.000
That's to say, it's got a high weight to this move here as a result of experience in the past where that move down the line led to this improvement.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:46.000
So in that finite context, I think the game-players can trust it, and they talk that way.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
It's got a kind of authority.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:58.000
They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's playing from the future.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:08.000
It's making these moves that are just outlandish, and there's a kind of brilliance to them that we can't really understand.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
We'll be catching up to it forever.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:18.000
I think in that context, it's mapped the domain, and the domain is mappable because it's a combinatorial problem, roughly.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:41.000
But in something like music or art of a non-finite form, it feels to me like it's a little harder for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something about us that demands that he write this way.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.000
That doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite the same way.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Now, we could ask the system, why did you do it?

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.000
We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:59.000
And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of communicative act.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:07.000
And I think lots of times, artists will often say, look, I can't communicate better than what I've done in the piece of work.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
That is the statement.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
We humans aren't able to answer the why either.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:22.000
But I do think the question here is, well, first of all, language is finite, certainly when expressed through a tweet.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000
So it is also a combinatorial problem.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.000
The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:46.000
And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions to chess is deeply surprising when it was first addressed with IBM Dblue and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:53.000
I think in that same way, language can be addressed and communication can be addressed.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:06.000
I don't see, having done this podcast, many reasons why everything I'm doing, especially as a digital being on the internet, can't be done by an AI system eventually.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:12.000
So I think we're being very human-centric and thinking we're special.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:29.000
I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating like touch and the magic of body language and the music of all of that because it's so deeply integrated through the long evolutionary process of what it's like to be on Earth.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:44.000
And what is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on is the way we apply our evolutionary history on the way we act on the internet and the way we act online.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:53.000
And as more and more of the world becomes digital, you're now operating in a space where AI is behind much less so.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Like we're both starting at zero.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I think that's super interesting. Do you know this author, Brian Christian? Is that someone you've ever heard of?

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Sounds familiar.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:09.000
He's a guy who competed in the, what is it called? The Lobner Competition.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:10.000
The Lobner Prize, yeah.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Yeah, the Turing Test thing.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:21.000
So, and I'll just tell you the story, but I think it's directly related to the last thing you said about where we're starting in the same place.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:30.000
He competed in this competition, but not, he didn't enter a program that was supposed to try to pass the Turing Test.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:38.000
The Turing Test, you know, there's three people. There's the judge, there's the program, and then there's someone who's a human the way they do it.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:43.000
And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions, which is the computer and which is the human.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
So little known fact, there's two prizes in that competition.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:54.000
There's the most human computer prize. That's the computer that wins the most. And then there's the most human-human prize.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:00.000
And he competed for the most human-human prize. And he won it. He kept winning it.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:11.000
And so he tried to think about what it is that you have to be able to do in order to convince judges that you're human instead of a computer.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
And that's an interesting question, I think.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:29.000
And what he came to, my takeaway from his version of this story, is that it is true that computers are winning these contests more and more, you know, as technology progresses.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:36.000
But there's two possible explanations for that. One is that the computers are becoming more human.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:41.000
And the other is that the humans are becoming more like computers.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:45:01.000
And he says, actually, the more we live our lives in this world where, in this sort of technological world, where we have to moderate our behavior so that it's readable by something that's effectively, you know, a computer,

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:09.000
the more we become like that. And he says, it happens even when you're not interacting with a computer.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:16.000
He says, have you ever been to the, you know, on the phone with a call, you know, center? And they're going through their script.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:21.000
And that's what they've got to do. They've got to go through their script, because that's how they keep their job.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:28.000
And they ask you this question, and you've got to answer it. And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person, even though it's a person,

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:38.000
because they've so given up everything that's involved normally with being able to make judgments and decisions and act in situations and take responsibility.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:52.000
And so I think that's the other side of it. It is true that technology is amazing and can solve huge ranges of problems and do fantastic things.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:08.000
It's also true that we're changing ourselves in response to it. And the one thing I'm worried about is that we're changing ourselves in such a way that the norms for what we're aiming at are being changed

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:21.000
to move in the direction of this sort of efficiently in an optimized way, solving a problem and move away from this other kind of thing that we were calling aliveness or significance.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.000
And so that's the other side of the story.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:44.000
And that's the worry, but it's very possible that there is, for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs, we may not see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see it as us being dragged into this over-optimized world.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:55.000
But that may be, this is, in fact, it is a world that opens up opportunities to truly experience life.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:05.000
And there's interesting to think about all the people growing up now, who their early experience of life is always mediated through a digital device,

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:22.000
not always, but more and more often mediated through that device, and how we're both evolving, the technologies evolving and the humans are evolving, to then maybe open a door to a whole world where the humans and the technology or AI systems are interacting as equals.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:28.000
So now I'm going to agree with you. You might be surprised that I'm going to agree with you, but I think that's exactly right.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:37.000
I don't want to be the person who's saying, our job is to resist all of this stuff. I don't want to be a Luddite. That's not my goal.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:45.000
The goal is to point out that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:54.000
The point is to get in the right relation to that understanding of what we are. That allows us to find the joy in it.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:00.000
And I think that's a hard thing to do. It's hard to understand even what we're supposed to be doing when we do it.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Maybe I'm more than you. I'm not of the right generation to be able to do that. But I do think that's got to be the move.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:15.000
The move is not to resist it. It's not a nostalgic move. It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:24.000
That's not the relation of it controlling you and depriving you of stuff. But if you're recognizing some great joy that can be found in it.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:33.000
When I interact with Lego robots, I see there's magic there. And I just feel like the person who hears the music when others don't.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.000
And I don't know what that is. And I'd love to explore that.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Because it seems to, it's almost like the future talking. And I'm trying to hear what it's saying. Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that. Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:09.000
And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore. I mean, I'm not now closed off from that even though my views are changed and I don't work in that world.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:15.000
But I do think, I think it's interesting to figure out what's at the ground of that response. Yeah.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:25.000
We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout in a secular age. But let me ask you the big, ridiculous question. Almost too big.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:32.000
What is the meaning of this thing we got going on? What is the meaning of life?

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.000
You're saving the softball for the end.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
The easy one.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:46.000
I don't know what the meaning of life is. I think there's something that characterizes us that's not the thing that people normally think characterizes us.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:57.000
The traditional thing to say in the philosophical tradition, even in the AI tradition, which is a kind of manifestation of philosophy from Plato 4.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:06.000
The traditional thing to say is that what characterizes us is our rationality, that we're intelligent beings, that we're the ones that think.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:11.000
And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:15.000
But I think there's more to it, too.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:34.000
I think we're capable of experiencing simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything that's meaningful in our existence and also the real significance of it.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:42.000
And that sounds like a contradiction. How could it really be significant and not be based on anything?

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.000
But I think that's the contradiction that somehow characterizes us.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:55.000
And I think that we're the being that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us and live in the light of it.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.000
That's the thing that I think is really at our core.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:03.000
And so how do we do that? I will say this one thing.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:13.000
And I learned it from a philosopher from a guy named Albert Borgman, who's a German philosopher, lived in Montana now, taught in Montana for his whole career.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:17.000
And I say this to my students at Harvard now.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:20.000
He said, this is the way that I think about my life.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:23.000
And I hope you'll think about your life, too.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:37.000
And you should think about your life hoping that there will be many moments in it about which you can say, there's no place I'd rather be.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000
There's no thing I'd rather be doing.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.000
There's no buddy I'd rather be with.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:49.000
And this I will remember well.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.000
And I think if you can aim to fill your life with moments like that, it will be a meaningful one.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:06.000
I don't know if that's the meaning of life, but I think if you can hold that before you, it'll help to clarify this mystery and this sort of bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Sean, this conversation was incredible.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
And those four requirements have certainly been fulfilled for me.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:17.000
This was a magical moment in that way.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
And I will remember it well.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Thank you so much.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.000
This is great.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Thank you.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Thank you for having me, Lex.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
I really, really enjoyed it.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.000

And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:45.000
In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me, there lay an invincible summer.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
