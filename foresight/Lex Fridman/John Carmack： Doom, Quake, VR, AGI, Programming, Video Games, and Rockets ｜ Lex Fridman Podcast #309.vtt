00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters and he was slowly moving around and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.

00:06.960 --> 00:14.760
It was all still keyboard. We didn't even have mice set up at that time, but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

00:14.760 --> 00:20.440
The wall disappears in a little animation and there's a monster like right there and he practically fell out of his chair.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.440
It was just like, ah, and games just didn't do that.

00:24.600 --> 00:32.040
You know, the games were, the gods eye view, you were a little invested in your little guy, you can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,

00:32.040 --> 00:34.840
but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.240
You weren't inside the game.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.240
Something in the back of your brain, some reptile brain thing is just going, oh shit, something just happened.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.040
And that was one of those early points where it's like, yeah, this is going to make a difference.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.040
This is going to be powerful and it's going to matter.

00:51.040 --> 00:59.040
The following is a conversation with John Carmack, widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers ever.

00:59.040 --> 01:09.040
He was the co-founder of id Software and the lead programmer on several games that revolutionized the technology, the experience and the role of gaming in our society,

01:09.040 --> 01:15.040
including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake.

01:15.040 --> 01:27.040
He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR, helping to create portals into virtual worlds and to define the technological path to the metaverse and meta.

01:27.040 --> 01:34.040
And now he has been shifting some of his attention to the problem of artificial general intelligence.

01:34.040 --> 01:39.040
This was the longest conversation on this podcast at over five hours.

01:40.040 --> 01:46.040
And still, I could talk to John many, many more times and we hope to do just that.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.040
This is the Lexington podcast.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.040
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:52.040 --> 01:57.040
And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.040
What was the first program you've ever written?

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
Do you remember?

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
Yeah, I do.

02:02.040 --> 02:12.040
So I remember being in a Radio Shack going up to the TRS-80 computers and learning just enough to be able to do 10-print John Carmack.

02:12.040 --> 02:23.040
And it's kind of interesting how, of course, I've, you know, Carnegie and Enrichie kind of standardized Hello World is the first thing that you do in every computer programming language and every computer,

02:23.040 --> 02:30.040
but not having any interaction with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things, it was just like, well, what am I going to say?

02:30.040 --> 02:31.040
My name.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.040
And then you learn how to do go to 10 and have it scroll all off the screen.

02:35.040 --> 02:39.040
And that was definitely the first thing that I wound up doing on a computer.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.040
Can I ask you a programming advice?

02:41.040 --> 02:44.040
I was always told in the beginning that you're not allowed to use go-to statements.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.040
That's really bad programming.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
Is this correct or not?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.040
Jumping around code.

02:48.040 --> 02:56.040
Can we look at the philosophy and the technical aspects of the go-to statement that seems so convenient, but it's supposed to be programming?

02:56.040 --> 03:00.040
Certainly back in the day, in basic programming languages, you didn't have proper loops.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.040
You didn't have four-wiles-and-repeats.

03:02.040 --> 03:07.040
You know, that was the land of Pascal for people that kind of generally had access to it back then.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.040
So you had no choice but to use go-tos.

03:10.040 --> 03:16.040
And as you made what were big programs back then, which were a thousand line basic program, is a really big program.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.040
They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.

03:19.040 --> 03:23.040
You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.

03:23.040 --> 03:31.040
So you would wind up fixing things in one place, add a little patch, and there's reasons why structured programming generally helps understanding.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.040
But go-tos aren't poisonous.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.040
Sometimes they're the right thing to do.

03:35.040 --> 03:50.040
Usually it's because there's a language feature missing like nested breaks or something where it can sometimes be better to do a go-to cleanup or go-to error rather than having multiple flags, multiple if statements littered throughout things.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.040
But it is rare.

03:51.040 --> 03:58.040
I mean, if you grep through all of my code right now, I don't think any of my current code bases would actually have a go-to.

03:58.040 --> 04:06.040
But deep within sort of the technical underpinnings of a major game engine, you're going to have some go-tos in a couple places probably.

04:06.040 --> 04:15.040
Yeah, the infrastructure on top of like the closer you get to machine code, the more go-tos you're going to see, the more of these like hacks you're going to see.

04:15.040 --> 04:22.040
Because the set of features available to you in low-level programming languages is limited.

04:22.040 --> 04:31.040
So print John Carmack, when is the first time, if we could talk about love, that you fell in love with programming?

04:31.040 --> 04:34.040
You said like this is really something special.

04:34.040 --> 04:42.040
It really was something that was one of those love at first sight things where just really from the time that I understood what a computer was.

04:42.040 --> 04:50.040
I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes with the real-to-real tape decks.

04:50.040 --> 05:05.040
And for people nowadays, it can be a little hard to understand what the world was like then from information gathering where I would go to the libraries and there would be a couple books on the shelf about computers and they would be very out of date even at that point.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.040
Just not a lot of information, but I would grab everything that I could find and, you know, devour everything.

05:10.040 --> 05:17.040
Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers, I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.

05:17.040 --> 05:24.040
It just, it felt like this magical thing to me, this idea that the computer would just do exactly what you told it to.

05:24.040 --> 05:31.040
I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw sort of issues there where you'd better be really, really careful with what you're telling it to do.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
But it wasn't going to back talk you.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
It wasn't going to have a different point of view.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
It was going to carry out what you told it to do.

05:37.040 --> 05:43.040
And if you had the right commands, you could make it do these pretty magical things.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.040
And so what kind of programs did you write at first?

05:46.040 --> 05:48.040
So beyond the print John Carmack.

05:48.040 --> 05:56.040
So I can remember as going through the learning process where you find at the start you're just learning how to do the most basic possible things.

05:56.040 --> 06:02.040
And I can remember stuff like Superman comic that Radio Shack commissioned to have.

06:02.040 --> 06:12.040
It's like Superman had lost some of his super brain and kids had to use Radio Shack TRS-80 computers to do calculations for it to help him kind of complete his heroics.

06:12.040 --> 06:20.040
And I'd find little things like that and then get a few basic books to be able to kind of work my way up.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.040
And again, it was so precious back then.

06:22.040 --> 06:26.040
I had a couple books that would teach me important things about it.

06:26.040 --> 06:30.040
I had one book that I could start to learn a little bit of assembly language from.

06:30.040 --> 06:34.040
And I'd have a few books on basic and some things that I could get from the libraries.

06:34.040 --> 06:40.040
But my goals in the early days was almost always making games of various kinds.

06:40.040 --> 06:45.040
I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games.

06:45.040 --> 06:51.040
And being able to do some of those things myself on the computers was very much what I aspired to.

06:51.040 --> 06:56.040
And it was a whole journey where if you learn normal basic, you can't do any kind of an action game.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
You can write an adventure game.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.040
You can write things where you say, what do you do here?

07:00.040 --> 07:03.040
I get sword, attack troll, that type of thing.

07:03.040 --> 07:09.040
And that can be done in the context of basic, but to do things that had moving graphics.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.040
There were only the most limited things you could possibly do.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.040
You could maybe do breakout or pong or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.

07:16.040 --> 07:25.040
And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers.

07:25.040 --> 07:31.040
They had a mode called low resolution graphics where of course all graphics were low resolution back then.

07:31.040 --> 07:37.040
But regular low resolution graphics, it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.040
But they could have 16 different colors.

07:39.040 --> 07:45.040
And I wanted to make a game kind of like the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
And I could move a little ship around.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.040
You could manage to do that in basic, but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.

07:53.040 --> 08:02.040
And I remember at the time just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled,

08:02.040 --> 08:06.040
where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen were basically the same thing.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.040
And all those computers could scroll their text screen reasonably.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.

08:12.040 --> 08:19.040
And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode.

08:19.040 --> 08:24.040
And I could draw graphics and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.

08:24.040 --> 08:30.040
And then the system would scroll it all up using an assembly language routine that I didn't know how to write back then.

08:30.040 --> 08:37.040
So that was like this first great hack that sort of had analogs later on in my career for a lot of different things.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.040
So I found out that I could draw a screen.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.040
I could do a line feed at the bottom.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.040
We would scroll it up once.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.040
I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.

08:44.040 --> 08:53.040
And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen, which was interesting in that that played a big part later on in the idSoftware days as well.

08:53.040 --> 09:04.040
So do efficient drawing where you don't have to draw the whole screen, but you draw from the bottom using the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
Yeah.

09:05.040 --> 09:13.040
Where so much of, until recently, game design was limited by what you could actually get the computer to do.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.040
Where it's easy to say, like, OK, I want to scroll the screen.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.040
You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
And nowadays, that works just fine.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.040
Computers are ludicrously fast.

09:24.040 --> 09:30.040
But up until a decade ago or so, there were all these things everybody wanted to do.

09:30.040 --> 09:42.040
But if they knew enough programming to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow to be a good experience, either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.

09:42.040 --> 09:51.040
So so much of kind of the first couple of decades of the programming work that I did was largely figuring out how to do something that everybody knows how they want it to happen.

09:51.040 --> 09:58.040
It just has to happen two to ten times faster than sort of the straightforward way of doing things would make it happen.

09:58.040 --> 10:06.040
And it's different now because at this point, lots of things you can just do in the most naive possible way and it still works out.

10:06.040 --> 10:12.040
You don't have nearly the creative limitations or the incentives for optimizing on that level.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.

10:14.040 --> 10:23.040
But I do generally, I'm not going to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit where back in my day, programmers had to do real programming.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.040
It's amazing that you can just kind of pick an idea and go do it right now.

10:27.040 --> 10:35.040
And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out how to make your wishes happen.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.040
Well, there's still, see, that's true.

10:38.040 --> 10:49.040
But let me put on my old man with a fist hat and say that probably the thing that will define the future still requires you to operate at the limits of the current system.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
So we'll probably talk about this.

10:51.040 --> 11:03.040
But if you talk about building the metaverse and building a VR experience that's compelling, it probably requires you to not to go to assembly or maybe not literally,

11:03.040 --> 11:08.040
but sort of spiritually to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.

11:08.040 --> 11:15.040
And that really was why virtual reality was specifically interesting to me where it had all the ties to.

11:15.040 --> 11:24.040
You could say that even back in the early days, I have some old magazine articles that's talking about DOOM as a virtual reality experience back when just seeing anything in 3D.

11:24.040 --> 11:29.040
So you could say that we've been trying to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning.

11:29.040 --> 11:41.040
And in the modern era of virtual reality, especially on the mobile side of things, when it's standalone, you're basically using a cell phone chip to be able to produce these very immersive experiences.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.040
It does require work.

11:43.040 --> 11:53.040
It's not at the level of what an old school console game programmer would have operated at where you're looking at hardware registers and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses.

11:53.040 --> 12:01.040
But it is still definitely a different level than what a web developer or even a PC steam game developer usually has to work at.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
And again, it's great.

12:02.040 --> 12:09.040
There's opportunities for people that want to operate it either into that spectrum there and still provide a lot of value to the world.

12:09.040 --> 12:15.040
Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.

12:15.040 --> 12:19.040
What would you say is the best programming language?

12:19.040 --> 12:22.040
Your favorite, but also the best.

12:22.040 --> 12:29.040
You've seen throughout your career, you're considered by many to be the greatest programmer ever.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.040
I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.040
But if you put it on anyone, it's you.

12:34.040 --> 12:38.040
So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions of what's the best band of all time.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
But in your case, what's the best programming language?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
Everything has all the caveats about it.

12:44.040 --> 12:51.040
Nowadays, I do program a reasonable amount of Python for AIML sorts of work.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.040
I'm not a native Python programmer.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.040
It's something I came to very late in my career.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.040
I understand what it's good for.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.040
But you don't dream in Python.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
I do not.

13:01.040 --> 13:10.040
And it has some of those things where there's some amazing stats when you say if you just start, if you make a loop, a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,

13:10.040 --> 13:17.040
you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower than a proper GPU tensor operation.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
And these are staggering numbers.

13:19.040 --> 13:26.040
You know, you can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.040
So your intuition is about inefficiencies within the Python sort of?

13:30.040 --> 13:34.040
It keeps hitting me upside the face where it just, it's gotten to the point now I understand.

13:34.040 --> 13:38.040
It's like, OK, you just can't do a loop if you care about performance in Python.

13:38.040 --> 13:47.040
You have to figure out how you can reformat this into some big vector operation or something that's going to be done completely within a C++ library.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.040
But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient.

13:50.040 --> 13:55.040
And you just see stuff that people are able to cobble together by just import a few different things.

13:55.040 --> 13:59.040
And you can do stuff that nobody on Earth could do 10 years ago.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.040
And you can do it in a little cookbook thing that you copy pasted out of a website.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.040
So that is really great.

14:04.040 --> 14:10.040
When I'm sitting down to do what I consider kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.

14:10.040 --> 14:18.040
And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that where I'm not big into the modern template metaprogramming sorts of things.

14:18.040 --> 14:23.040
I see a lot of train wrecks coming from some of that over abstraction.

14:23.040 --> 14:33.040
I spent a few years really going kind of deep into the kind of historical Lisp work and Haskell and some of the functional programming sides of things.

14:33.040 --> 14:38.040
And there is a lot of value there in the way you think about things.

14:38.040 --> 14:50.040
And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code based on what I learned about the value that comes out of not having this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of.

14:50.040 --> 14:58.040
Because something that many people don't really appreciate till they've been at it for a long time is that it's not the writing of the program initially.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.040
It's the whole lifespan of the program.

15:00.040 --> 15:09.040
And that's when it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates, but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change.

15:09.040 --> 15:24.040
And then the thing that I've really been learning in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is it's also how well it hands off between a continuous kind of revolving door of programmers taking over maintenance and different things and how you get people up to speed in different areas.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.040
And there's all these other different aspects of it.

15:27.040 --> 15:32.040
C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.040
Probably not the best.

15:34.040 --> 15:53.040
And there's some really interesting aspects to this where in some cases languages that are not generally thought well of for many reasons like C is derided pretty broadly that, yes, obviously all of these security flaws that happen with the memory and unsafeness and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there.

15:53.040 --> 16:08.040
But there is this underappreciated aspect to the language is so simple, anyone can go and if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace and not have to learn what paradigms they're using because there just aren't that many available.

16:08.040 --> 16:12.040
I think there's some really, really well written C code.

16:12.040 --> 16:21.040
I find it great that if I'm messing around with something an open BSD say, I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.

16:21.040 --> 16:29.040
It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do to make whatever change that I need to.

16:29.040 --> 16:37.040
While you can have more significant languages, like it's a downside of Lisp where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.

16:37.040 --> 16:42.040
I think that it did help my thinking about programming in some ways.

16:42.040 --> 16:57.040
But the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is that if you write a huge Lisp program, you've basically invented your own kind of language and structure because it's not the primitives of the language you're using very much.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.040
It's all of the things you've built on top of that.

16:59.040 --> 17:07.040
And then a language like Racket, kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions, it's essentially touted as a language for building other languages.

17:07.040 --> 17:27.040
And I understand the value of that for a tiny little project, but the idea of that for one of these long term supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me where all of those abstractions that you're like, OK, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself on all of these things that we've built on top of that.

17:27.040 --> 17:35.040
And it was interesting to see how when Google made go, a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like, wow, this is not a state of the art language.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.040
This language is just so simple and almost crude.

17:38.040 --> 17:42.040
And you could see the programming language people just looking down at it.

17:42.040 --> 17:49.040
But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying this is the good things about C. Everybody can just jump right in and use it.

17:49.040 --> 17:54.040
You don't need to restructure your brain to write good code in it.

17:54.040 --> 17:59.040
So I wish that I had more opportunity for doing some work in go.

17:59.040 --> 18:04.040
Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about that I'm not fit past judgment on.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.040
I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.

18:07.040 --> 18:11.040
I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust just as an exercise.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.040
But that was a few years ago and I haven't really used it since.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.040
The best programming language is the one that works generally that you're currently using.

18:19.040 --> 18:26.040
Because that's another trap is in almost every case I've seen when people mixed languages on a project, that's a mistake.

18:26.040 --> 18:32.040
I would rather stay just in one language so that everybody can work across the entire thing.

18:32.040 --> 18:36.040
And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects that use kind of React framework.

18:36.040 --> 18:41.040
So you've got JavaScript here and then you have C++ for real work.

18:41.040 --> 18:45.040
And then you may have Java interfacing with some other part of the Android system.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.040
And those are all kind of horrible things.

18:47.040 --> 18:54.040
And that was one thing that I remember talking with Boz at Facebook about it where like,

18:54.040 --> 18:58.040
man, I wish we could have just said we're only hiring C++ programmers.

18:58.040 --> 19:08.040
And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective, well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough with the thousands of programmers they've got there.

19:08.040 --> 19:15.040
It is not necessarily a dying breed, but you can sure find a lot more Java or JavaScript programmers.

19:15.040 --> 19:21.040
And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.

19:21.040 --> 19:28.040
It's like, well, you just, you go out and you find those programmers and you don't hire the other programmers that don't do the languages that you want to use.

19:28.040 --> 19:37.040
But right now, I guess, yeah, they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work for the UI side of things when you go find UI programmers, they're JavaScript programmers.

19:37.040 --> 19:47.040
I wonder if that's because there's a lot of JavaScript programmers, because I do think that great programmers are rare, that it's not, you know,

19:47.040 --> 19:56.040
if you just look at statistics of how many people are using different programming languages, that doesn't tell you the story of what the great programmers are using.

19:56.040 --> 20:01.040
And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to, which is the fundamentals of a language.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.040
What does it encourage you?

20:02.040 --> 20:06.040
How does it encourage you to think what kind of systems does it encourage you to build?

20:06.040 --> 20:15.040
There's something about C++ that has elements of creativity, but forces you to be an adult about your programming.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
Well, it expects you to be an adult.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.040
It does not force you to.

20:19.040 --> 20:29.040
So it brings out people that are willing to be creative in terms of building large systems and coming up with interesting solutions,

20:29.040 --> 20:39.040
but at the same time have the sort of the good software engineering practices that amend themselves to real-world systems.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.040
Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.

20:43.040 --> 20:50.040
So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years and humans are long gone,

20:50.040 --> 20:55.040
something tells me that most of the systems they find will be running JavaScript.

20:55.040 --> 21:01.040
I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation, it's written in JavaScript.

21:01.040 --> 21:08.040
You know, for the longest time, even still, JavaScript didn't get any respect,

21:08.040 --> 21:12.040
and yet it runs so much of the world and an increasing number of the world.

21:12.040 --> 21:16.040
Is it possible that everything will be written in JavaScript one day?

21:16.040 --> 21:21.040
So the engineering under JavaScript is really pretty phenomenal.

21:21.040 --> 21:29.040
The systems that make JavaScript run as fast as it does right now are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways.

21:29.040 --> 21:36.040
It does feel like it is not an optimal language for all the things that it's being used for

21:36.040 --> 21:45.040
or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps in something like this without type systems and so on.

21:45.040 --> 21:50.040
But I think for a lot of people, it does reasonably the necessary things.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.040
It's still a C-flavored language.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.040
It's still a braces and semicolon language.

21:55.040 --> 22:02.040
It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript and then understand the roots of where it came from.

22:02.040 --> 22:08.040
I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing for most programs to be written in.

22:08.040 --> 22:15.040
It's funny that I still, just this morning, I was on, I was seeing a Twitter thread of a bunch of really senior game dev people

22:15.040 --> 22:18.040
arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.

22:18.040 --> 22:22.040
You will run into some people that are top-notch programmers that just say,

22:22.040 --> 22:24.040
no, this is literally not a good thing.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.040
Oh, because it makes you lazy?

22:26.040 --> 22:28.040
Yes, that it makes you not think about things.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
And I do disagree.

22:29.040 --> 22:37.040
I think that there is so much objective data on the vulnerabilities that have happened in C and C++ programs,

22:37.040 --> 22:40.040
sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.

22:40.040 --> 22:44.040
It's like nobody is good enough to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.040
You write enough C code, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

22:47.040 --> 22:51.040
And garbage collection is a very great thing for the vast majority of programs.

22:51.040 --> 22:56.040
It's only when you get into the tightest of real-time things that you start saying it's like,

22:56.040 --> 23:00.040
no, the garbage collection has more costs than it has benefits for me there,

23:00.040 --> 23:04.040
but that's not 99 plus percent of all the software in the world.

23:04.040 --> 23:09.040
So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.

23:09.040 --> 23:14.040
And so much of programming is not the language itself.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.040
It's the infrastructure around everyone that surrounds it,

23:17.040 --> 23:22.040
all the libraries that you can get and the different ways you can deploy it,

23:22.040 --> 23:24.040
the portability that it gives you.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.040
And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things,

23:27.040 --> 23:31.040
where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,

23:31.040 --> 23:36.040
the web stack about everything that has to go when you do something really trivial in JavaScript

23:36.040 --> 23:40.040
and it shows up on a web browser to kind of x-ray through that

23:40.040 --> 23:44.040
and see everything that has to happen for your one little JavaScript statement

23:44.040 --> 23:48.040
to turn into something visible in your web browser.

23:48.040 --> 23:53.040
It's very, very disquieting, just the depth of that stack

23:53.040 --> 23:59.040
and the fact that so few people can even comprehend all of the levels that are going on there.

23:59.040 --> 24:05.040
But it's again, I have to caution myself to not be the in the good old days old man about it

24:05.040 --> 24:08.040
because clearly there's enormous value here.

24:08.040 --> 24:13.040
The world does run on JavaScript to a pretty good approximation there

24:13.040 --> 24:15.040
and it's not falling apart.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.040
There's a bunch of scary stuff where you look at console logs

24:18.040 --> 24:21.040
and you just see all of these bad things that are happening,

24:21.040 --> 24:24.040
but it's still kind of limping along and nobody really notices.

24:24.040 --> 24:30.040
But so much of my systems design and systems analysis goes around.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.040
You should understand what the speed of light is,

24:33.040 --> 24:36.040
like what would be the best you could possibly do here.

24:36.040 --> 24:39.040
And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,

24:39.040 --> 24:44.040
you can be a thousand times off your speed of light velocity for something

24:44.040 --> 24:46.040
and it's still be okay.

24:46.040 --> 24:51.040
And in fact, it can even sometimes still be the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint

24:51.040 --> 24:56.040
where there's a lot of things that you don't want to have to parachute in someone like me

24:56.040 --> 25:01.040
to go in and say, make this web page run a thousand times faster.

25:01.040 --> 25:08.040
Make this web app into a hardcore native application that starts up in 37 milliseconds

25:08.040 --> 25:11.040
and everything responds in less than one frame latency.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.040
That's just not necessary.

25:13.040 --> 25:17.040
And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars to do software like that

25:17.040 --> 25:21.040
when they can take somebody right out of a boot camp and say, spin up an application for this,

25:21.040 --> 25:27.040
often being efficient is not really the best metric.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.040
It's like that applies in a lot of areas where it's kind of interesting

25:31.040 --> 25:36.040
how a lot of our appliances and everything are all built around energy efficiency,

25:36.040 --> 25:41.040
sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways or higher costs in other ways

25:41.040 --> 25:47.040
where there's interesting things where energy or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world

25:47.040 --> 25:50.040
and that could change our engineering trade-offs for the way we build certain things

25:50.040 --> 25:56.040
where you could throw away efficiency and actually get more benefits that actually matter.

25:56.040 --> 26:02.040
That's one of the directions I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy

26:02.040 --> 26:04.040
when I was kind of like, what do I want to do next?

26:04.040 --> 26:10.040
It was either going to be cost-effective nuclear fission or artificial general intelligence.

26:10.040 --> 26:18.040
And one of my pet ideas there is like, people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is

26:18.040 --> 26:24.040
and there would be ways that you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less,

26:24.040 --> 26:31.040
but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper, that could be a radical innovation and something like that.

26:31.040 --> 26:37.040
So there's some of these thoughts around direct fission energy conversion, fission fragment conversion

26:37.040 --> 26:41.040
that maybe you build something that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
even if it winds up being less efficient.

26:43.040 --> 26:49.040
So that applies a lot in programming where it's always good to know what you could do

26:49.040 --> 26:54.040
if you really sat down and took it far because sometimes there's discontinuities

26:54.040 --> 26:56.040
around user reaction times.

26:56.040 --> 27:02.040
There are some points where the difference between operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
not that huge.

27:04.040 --> 27:08.040
You'll see it in web page statistics, but most of the usability stuff, not that great.

27:08.040 --> 27:13.040
But if you get down to 50 milliseconds, then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.

27:13.040 --> 27:17.040
It's just like doing your bidding instantly rather than you're giving it a command,

27:17.040 --> 27:20.040
twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.

27:20.040 --> 27:25.040
So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard to get over some threshold,

27:25.040 --> 27:30.040
but there are broad basins in the value metric for lots of work

27:30.040 --> 27:33.040
where it just doesn't pay to even go that extra mile.

27:33.040 --> 27:38.040
And they're craftsmen that just don't want to buy that and more power to them.

27:38.040 --> 27:43.040
If somebody just wants to say, no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.040
I'm never going to do something that's not as good as I could possibly make it.

27:46.040 --> 27:50.040
I respect that and sometimes I am that person,

27:50.040 --> 27:55.040
but I try to focus more on the larger value picture and you do pick your battles

27:55.040 --> 28:00.040
and you deploy your resources into play that's going to give you sort of the best user value in the end.

28:00.040 --> 28:09.040
Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth as a kind of programming effort,

28:09.040 --> 28:15.040
it seems like efficiency isn't the thing that's being optimized for.

28:15.040 --> 28:20.040
Like natural selection is very inefficient, but it kind of adapts

28:20.040 --> 28:24.040
and through the process of adaptations, building more and more complex systems

28:24.040 --> 28:28.040
that are more and more intelligent, the final result is kind of pretty interesting.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.040
And so I think of JavaScript the same way.

28:31.040 --> 28:36.040
It's like this giant mess that things naturally die off if they don't work

28:36.040 --> 28:41.040
and if they become useful to people, they kind of naturally live

28:41.040 --> 28:46.040
and you build this community, large community of people that are generating code

28:46.040 --> 28:51.040
and some code is sticky, some is not and nobody knows the inefficiencies

28:51.040 --> 28:55.040
or the efficiencies or the breaking points like how reliable this code is

28:55.040 --> 29:00.040
and you kind of just run it, assume it works and then get unpleasantly surprised

29:00.040 --> 29:03.040
and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.

29:03.040 --> 29:07.040
So that's a really good analogy and we can go a lot of places with that

29:07.040 --> 29:11.040
where in the earliest days of programming when you had finite,

29:11.040 --> 29:13.040
you could count the bytes that you had to work on this,

29:13.040 --> 29:17.040
you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf to be one less instruction

29:17.040 --> 29:20.040
than the other person's multiply routine to kind of get through

29:20.040 --> 29:23.040
and it was so perfectly crafted.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.040
It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program

29:26.040 --> 29:31.040
because there just were not that many, you couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways

29:31.040 --> 29:35.040
and in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work

29:35.040 --> 29:39.040
where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,

29:39.040 --> 29:43.040
well, we're going to do billions and billions of programmable weights here,

29:43.040 --> 29:48.040
you have to turn it down into something that is symbolic and crafted like that

29:48.040 --> 29:55.040
but that's definitely not the way DNA and life and biological evolution and things work.

29:55.040 --> 30:01.040
On the one hand, it's almost humbling how little programming code is in our bodies.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
We've got a couple billion base pairs

30:03.040 --> 30:06.040
and it all fits on a thumb drive for years now

30:06.040 --> 30:09.040
and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.040
You've got maybe 50 megabytes and this is not like Shannon Limit

30:13.040 --> 30:18.040
perfectly information dense conveyances here.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.040
It's like these are messy codes.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.040
They're broken up into amino acids.

30:22.040 --> 30:27.040
A lot of them don't do important things or they do things in very awkward ways

30:27.040 --> 30:31.040
but it is this process of just accumulation on top of things

30:31.040 --> 30:37.040
and you need scale, both you need scale for the population for that to work out

30:37.040 --> 30:40.040
and in the early days in the 50s and 60s,

30:40.040 --> 30:44.040
the ancient era of computers where you could count

30:44.040 --> 30:46.040
when they say like when the internet started even in the 70s,

30:46.040 --> 30:48.040
there were 18 hosts or something on it.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.040
It was this small finite number

30:50.040 --> 30:54.040
and you were still optimizing everything to be as good as you possibly could be

30:54.040 --> 30:59.040
but now it's billions and billions of devices and everything going on

30:59.040 --> 31:03.040
and you can have this very much natural evolution going on

31:03.040 --> 31:07.040
where lots of things are tried, lots of things are blowing up,

31:07.040 --> 31:11.040
venture capitalists lose their money when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack

31:11.040 --> 31:14.040
and things completely failed or failed to scale

31:14.040 --> 31:17.040
but good things do come out of it

31:17.040 --> 31:22.040
and it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution of the way different things happen

31:22.040 --> 31:24.040
like mentioning Hello World at the beginning.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.040
It's funny how some little thing like that

31:26.040 --> 31:29.040
where everybody, every programmer knows Hello World now

31:29.040 --> 31:32.040
and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision

31:32.040 --> 31:35.040
that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C

31:35.040 --> 31:38.040
and early examples of things like that.

31:38.040 --> 31:42.040
So millions of experiments are going on all the time

31:42.040 --> 31:46.040
but some things do kind of rise to the top and win the fitness war

31:46.040 --> 31:50.040
for whether it's mind space or programming techniques or anything.

31:50.040 --> 31:54.040
Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called Code Golf

31:54.040 --> 31:59.040
where people compete to write the shortest possible program for a particular task

31:59.040 --> 32:01.040
in all the different kinds of languages

32:01.040 --> 32:07.040
and it's really interesting to see folks kind of

32:07.040 --> 32:13.040
that are masters of their craft really play with the limits of programming languages.

32:13.040 --> 32:17.040
It's really beautiful to see and across all the different programming languages

32:17.040 --> 32:20.040
you get to see some of these weird programming languages

32:20.040 --> 32:22.040
and mainstream ones,

32:22.040 --> 32:25.040
the difference between Python 2 and 3,

32:25.040 --> 32:28.040
you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java

32:28.040 --> 32:30.040
and you get to see JavaScript, all of that.

32:30.040 --> 32:39.040
And it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth of possibility

32:39.040 --> 32:44.040
there is within programming languages that Code Golf kind of tasks reveal.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.040
Most of us if you do any kind of programming

32:47.040 --> 32:51.040
with the boring kind of very vanilla type of code,

32:51.040 --> 32:53.040
that's the way to build large systems

32:53.040 --> 32:56.040
but it's nice to see that the possibility of creative genius

32:56.040 --> 33:00.040
is still within those languages, it's laden within those languages.

33:00.040 --> 33:06.040
So given that you are once again one of the greatest programmers ever,

33:06.040 --> 33:08.040
what do you think makes a good programmer?

33:08.040 --> 33:11.040
Maybe a good modern programmer.

33:11.040 --> 33:17.040
So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta to the TPM organization

33:17.040 --> 33:22.040
and my biggest point was everything that we're doing

33:22.040 --> 33:26.040
really should flow from user value, all the good things that we're doing.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.040
It's like we're not technical people,

33:28.040 --> 33:32.040
it's like you shouldn't be taking pride just in the specific thing

33:32.040 --> 33:35.040
like Code Golf is the sort of thing, it's a fun puzzle game

33:35.040 --> 33:38.040
but that really should not be a major motivator for you.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.040
It's like we're solving problems for people

33:40.040 --> 33:42.040
or we're providing entertainment to people,

33:42.040 --> 33:44.040
we're doing something of value to people

33:44.040 --> 33:46.040
that's displacing something else in their life.

33:46.040 --> 33:51.040
So we want to be providing a net value over what they could be doing

33:51.040 --> 33:53.040
but instead they're choosing to use our products.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.040
And that's where, I mean it sounds triter corny

33:56.040 --> 34:00.040
but I fundamentally do think that's how you make the world a better place.

34:00.040 --> 34:05.040
If you have given more value to people than it took you and your team to create

34:05.040 --> 34:07.040
then the world's a better place.

34:07.040 --> 34:10.040
People have gone from something of lesser value

34:10.040 --> 34:13.040
chosen to use your product and their life feels better for that

34:13.040 --> 34:18.040
and if you've produced that economically, that's a really good thing.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.040
On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money

34:22.040 --> 34:25.040
you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into a woodchipper there

34:25.040 --> 34:29.040
and you should maybe not feel so good about what you're doing.

34:29.040 --> 34:33.040
So being proud about like a specific architecture

34:33.040 --> 34:37.040
or specific technology or a specific code sequence that you've done

34:37.040 --> 34:41.040
it's great to get a little smile like a tiny little dopamine hit for that

34:41.040 --> 34:45.040
but the top level metric should be that you're building things of value.

34:45.040 --> 34:49.040
Now you can get into the argument about how you, you know, what is user value

34:49.040 --> 34:51.040
how do you actually quantify that

34:51.040 --> 34:53.040
and there can be big arguments about that

34:53.040 --> 34:55.040
but it's easy to be able to say,

34:55.040 --> 34:59.040
okay this pissed off user there is not getting value from what you're doing.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
This user over there with the big smile on their face

35:01.040 --> 35:04.040
the moment of delight when something happened

35:04.040 --> 35:06.040
there's a value that's happened there.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.040
I mean, you have to at least accept that there is a concept of user value

35:10.040 --> 35:13.040
even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it

35:13.040 --> 35:16.040
you can usually make relative arguments about it.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.040
Well, this was better than this, we've improved things.

35:19.040 --> 35:25.040
So, you know, being a servant to the user is your job when you're a developer

35:25.040 --> 35:30.040
you want to be producing something that other people are going to find valuable

35:30.040 --> 35:36.040
and if you are technically inclined then finding the right levers to be able to pull

35:36.040 --> 35:40.040
to be able to make a design that's going to produce the most value

35:40.040 --> 35:42.040
for the least amount of effort

35:42.040 --> 35:46.040
and it always has to be kind of divide, there's a ratio there where you

35:46.040 --> 35:48.040
it's a problem at the big tech companies

35:48.040 --> 35:52.040
you know, whether it's, you know, MetaGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon

35:52.040 --> 35:55.040
companies that have almost infinite money

35:55.040 --> 35:59.040
I mean, I know their CFO will complain that it's not infinite money

35:59.040 --> 36:03.040
but from most developer standpoints it really does feel like it

36:03.040 --> 36:08.040
and it's almost counterintuitive that if you're working hard as a developer on something

36:08.040 --> 36:11.040
there's always this thought, if only I had more resources

36:11.040 --> 36:16.040
more people, more RAM, more megahertz, then my product will be better

36:16.040 --> 36:20.040
and that sense that at certain points it's certainly true

36:20.040 --> 36:22.040
that if you are really hamstrung by this

36:22.040 --> 36:27.040
removing an obstacle will make a better product, make more value

36:27.040 --> 36:30.040
but if you're not making your core design decisions

36:30.040 --> 36:34.040
in this fiercely competitive way where you're saying

36:34.040 --> 36:38.040
feature A or feature B, you can't just say let's do both

36:38.040 --> 36:41.040
because then you're not making a value judgment about them

36:41.040 --> 36:43.040
you're just saying well they both seem good

36:43.040 --> 36:46.040
I don't want to necessarily have to pick out which one is better

36:46.040 --> 36:49.040
or how much better and tell team B that

36:49.040 --> 36:53.040
sorry we're not going to do this because A is more important

36:53.040 --> 36:57.040
but that notion of always having to really critically value

36:57.040 --> 37:00.040
what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend

37:00.040 --> 37:03.040
even the opportunity cost of doing something else

37:03.040 --> 37:05.040
that's super important

37:05.040 --> 37:08.040
Well let me ask you about the big debates that you're mentioning

37:08.040 --> 37:12.040
of how to measure value

37:12.040 --> 37:19.040
is it possible to measure it kind of numerically

37:19.040 --> 37:23.040
or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route

37:23.040 --> 37:28.040
of imagining sort of somebody using a thing

37:28.040 --> 37:30.040
and imagining a smile on their face

37:30.040 --> 37:34.040
imagining the experience of love and joy that you have

37:34.040 --> 37:36.040
when you use the thing

37:36.040 --> 37:37.040
that's from a design perspective

37:37.040 --> 37:40.040
or if you're building more like a lower level thing

37:40.040 --> 37:44.040
for like Linux you imagine a developer that might come across this

37:44.040 --> 37:50.040
and use it and become happy and better off because of it

37:50.040 --> 37:52.040
so where do you land on those things

37:52.040 --> 37:57.040
is it measurable, so I imagine like Meta and Google

37:57.040 --> 37:59.040
will probably try to measure the thing

37:59.040 --> 38:02.040
they'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement or something

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
let's measure engagement

38:03.040 --> 38:06.040
and then I think there is a kind of

38:06.040 --> 38:09.040
I mean I admire the designer ethic of like

38:09.040 --> 38:13.040
think of a future that's immeasurable

38:13.040 --> 38:15.040
and you try to make somebody in that future

38:15.040 --> 38:17.040
that's different from today happy

38:17.040 --> 38:20.040
so I do usually favor

38:20.040 --> 38:23.040
if you can get any kind of a metric that's good

38:23.040 --> 38:25.040
by all means listen to the data

38:25.040 --> 38:27.040
but you can go too far there

38:27.040 --> 38:29.040
where we've had problems where it's like

38:29.040 --> 38:30.040
hey we had a performance regression

38:30.040 --> 38:33.040
because our fancy new telemetry system

38:33.040 --> 38:35.040
is doing a bazillion file rights

38:35.040 --> 38:37.040
to kind of archive this stuff

38:37.040 --> 38:39.040
because we needed to collect information to determine

38:39.040 --> 38:42.040
if we were doing, you know, if our plans were good

38:42.040 --> 38:45.040
so when information is available

38:45.040 --> 38:47.040
you should never ignore it

38:47.040 --> 38:49.040
for actual users using the thing

38:49.040 --> 38:51.040
human beings using the thing

38:51.040 --> 38:53.040
large number of human beings

38:53.040 --> 38:55.040
and you get to see sort of at large numbers

38:55.040 --> 38:57.040
so there's zero to one problem of when you're doing something really new

38:57.040 --> 38:59.040
you do kind of have to make a guess

38:59.040 --> 39:02.040
but one of the points that I've been making at Meta

39:02.040 --> 39:05.040
is we have more than enough users now

39:05.040 --> 39:08.040
that anything somebody wants to try in VR

39:08.040 --> 39:11.040
we have users that will be interested in that

39:11.040 --> 39:15.040
who do not get to make a completely green field blue sky pitch

39:15.040 --> 39:17.040
and say I'm going to do this

39:17.040 --> 39:19.040
because I think it might be interesting

39:19.040 --> 39:20.040
I challenge everyone

39:20.040 --> 39:22.040
there are going to be people

39:22.040 --> 39:25.040
whether it's, you know, working in VR on your

39:25.040 --> 39:27.040
like on your desktop replacement

39:27.040 --> 39:30.040
or communicating with people in different ways

39:30.040 --> 39:32.040
or playing the games

39:32.040 --> 39:35.040
there are going to be probably millions of people

39:35.040 --> 39:37.040
or at least if you pick some tiny niche

39:37.040 --> 39:39.040
that we're not in right now

39:39.040 --> 39:41.040
there are still going to be thousands of people out there

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
that have the headsets

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
that would be your target market

39:44.040 --> 39:45.040
and I tell people

39:45.040 --> 39:46.040
pay attention to them

39:46.040 --> 39:48.040
don't invent fictional users

39:48.040 --> 39:50.040
don't, you know, make an Alice Bob Charlie

39:50.040 --> 39:54.040
that fits whatever matrix of tendencies

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
that you want to break the market down to

39:56.040 --> 39:58.040
because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users

39:58.040 --> 40:00.040
when you've got real users

40:00.040 --> 40:02.040
that you could be working with

40:02.040 --> 40:04.040
but, you know, on the other hand

40:04.040 --> 40:07.040
there is value to having a kind of wholeness

40:07.040 --> 40:09.040
of vision for a product

40:09.040 --> 40:13.040
and companies like Meta have, you know

40:13.040 --> 40:15.040
they understand the trade-offs

40:15.040 --> 40:17.040
where you can have a company like SpaceX

40:17.040 --> 40:20.040
or, you know, Apple and the Steve Jobs era

40:20.040 --> 40:23.040
where you have a very powerful leading personality

40:23.040 --> 40:25.040
that I, you know, that can micromanage

40:25.040 --> 40:27.040
at a very low level and can say

40:27.040 --> 40:29.040
it's like, no, that handle needs to be different

40:29.040 --> 40:32.040
or that icon needs to change the tint there

40:32.040 --> 40:35.040
and they clearly get a lot of value out of it

40:35.040 --> 40:37.040
they also burn through a lot of employees

40:37.040 --> 40:39.040
that have horror stories to tell about

40:39.040 --> 40:41.040
working there afterwards

40:41.040 --> 40:43.040
my position is that

40:43.040 --> 40:46.040
you're at your best when you've got a leader

40:46.040 --> 40:49.040
that is at their limit of what they can kind of comprehend

40:49.040 --> 40:51.040
of everything below them

40:51.040 --> 40:53.040
and they can have an informed opinion

40:53.040 --> 40:55.040
about everything that's going on

40:55.040 --> 40:57.040
and you take somebody, you've got to believe

40:57.040 --> 41:00.040
that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience

41:00.040 --> 41:02.040
you would hope that they've got wisdom

41:02.040 --> 41:05.040
that just out of boot camp person

41:05.040 --> 41:07.040
contributing doesn't have

41:07.040 --> 41:09.040
and that if they're like, well, that's wrong there

41:09.040 --> 41:11.040
you probably shouldn't do it that way

41:11.040 --> 41:13.040
or even just don't do it that way

41:13.040 --> 41:14.040
do it another way

41:14.040 --> 41:16.040
so there's value there

41:16.040 --> 41:18.040
but it can't go beyond a certain level

41:18.040 --> 41:20.040
I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him

41:20.040 --> 41:22.040
saying things that are just wrong

41:22.040 --> 41:24.040
right in front of me about technical things

41:24.040 --> 41:27.040
because he was not operating at that level

41:27.040 --> 41:29.040
but when it does work

41:29.040 --> 41:32.040
and you do get that kind of passionate leader

41:32.040 --> 41:34.040
that's thinking about the entire product

41:34.040 --> 41:36.040
and just really deeply cares about

41:36.040 --> 41:38.040
not letting anything slip through the cracks

41:38.040 --> 41:40.040
I think that's got a lot of value

41:40.040 --> 41:42.040
but the other side of that is the people saying

41:42.040 --> 41:44.040
that, well, we want to have these independent teams

41:44.040 --> 41:46.040
that are bubbling up the ideas

41:46.040 --> 41:48.040
because it's almost

41:48.040 --> 41:50.040
it's anti-capitalist or anti-free market

41:50.040 --> 41:53.040
to say it's like I want my great leader

41:53.040 --> 41:55.040
to go ahead and dictate all these points there

41:55.040 --> 41:57.040
where clearly free markets bring up things

41:57.040 --> 41:59.040
that you don't expect

41:59.040 --> 42:01.040
like in VR we saw a bunch of things

42:01.040 --> 42:03.040
like it didn't turn out at all the way

42:03.040 --> 42:06.040
the early people thought were going to be the key applications

42:06.040 --> 42:08.040
and things that would not have been approved

42:08.040 --> 42:11.040
by the dark cabal

42:11.040 --> 42:14.040
making the decisions about what gets into the store

42:14.040 --> 42:17.040
turn out to in some cases be extremely successful

42:17.040 --> 42:20.040
so I definitely kind of wanted to be

42:20.040 --> 42:22.040
there's a point where I did make a pitch

42:22.040 --> 42:24.040
it's like, hey, make me VR dictator

42:24.040 --> 42:26.040
and I'll go and get shit done

42:26.040 --> 42:29.040
and that's just, it's not in the culture at Metta

42:29.040 --> 42:31.040
and they understand the trade-offs

42:31.040 --> 42:33.040
and that's just not the way

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
that's not the company that they want

42:35.040 --> 42:37.040
the team that they want to do

42:37.040 --> 42:39.040
It's fascinating because VR

42:39.040 --> 42:41.040
and we'll talk about it more

42:41.040 --> 42:44.040
it's still unclear to me

42:44.040 --> 42:47.040
in what way VR will change the world

42:47.040 --> 42:49.040
because it does seem clear that VR will

42:49.040 --> 42:51.040
somehow fundamentally transform this world

42:51.040 --> 42:54.040
and it's unclear to me how

42:54.040 --> 42:57.040
let me know when you want to get into that

42:57.040 --> 43:00.040
hold on a second

43:00.040 --> 43:03.040
stick to the you being the best programmer ever

43:03.040 --> 43:06.040
in the early days when you didn't have

43:06.040 --> 43:08.040
adult responsibilities of leading teams

43:08.040 --> 43:10.040
and all that kind of stuff

43:10.040 --> 43:13.040
and you can focus on just being a programmer

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
what did the productive day

43:15.040 --> 43:18.040
in the life of John Carmack look like

43:18.040 --> 43:21.040
how many hours of the keyboard, how much sleep

43:21.040 --> 43:24.040
how much source of calories that fueled the brain

43:24.040 --> 43:27.040
what was it like, what time did you wake up

43:27.040 --> 43:30.040
so I was able to be remarkably consistent

43:30.040 --> 43:33.040
about what was good working conditions for me

43:33.040 --> 43:35.040
for a very long time

43:35.040 --> 43:37.040
I was never one of the programmers

43:37.040 --> 43:40.040
that would do all-nighters going through

43:40.040 --> 43:42.040
work for 20 hours straight

43:42.040 --> 43:44.040
it's like my brain generally starts turning to mush

43:44.040 --> 43:47.040
after 12 hours or so

43:47.040 --> 43:50.040
but the hard work is really important

43:50.040 --> 43:52.040
and I would work for decades

43:52.040 --> 43:54.040
I would work 60 hours a week

43:54.040 --> 43:56.040
I would work a 10 hour day, 6 days a week

43:56.040 --> 43:59.040
and try to be productive at that

43:59.040 --> 44:01.040
now my schedule shifted around a fair amount

44:01.040 --> 44:03.040
when I was young without any kids

44:03.040 --> 44:05.040
any other responsibilities

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
I was on one of those cycling schedules

44:07.040 --> 44:09.040
where I'd kind of get in an hour later

44:09.040 --> 44:12.040
each day and roll around through the entire time

44:12.040 --> 44:14.040
and I'd wind up kind of pulling in

44:14.040 --> 44:16.040
at 2 or 3 in the afternoon sometimes

44:16.040 --> 44:18.040
and then working again past midnight

44:18.040 --> 44:20.040
or 2 in the morning

44:20.040 --> 44:23.040
and that was when it was just me

44:23.040 --> 44:25.040
trying to make things happen

44:25.040 --> 44:28.040
and I was usually isolated off in my office

44:28.040 --> 44:30.040
people generally didn't bother me much

44:30.040 --> 44:33.040
and I could get a lot of programming work done

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
that way

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
I did settle into a more normal schedule

44:37.040 --> 44:39.040
when I was taking kids to school

44:39.040 --> 44:40.040
and things like that

44:40.040 --> 44:42.040
So kids were the forcing function

44:42.040 --> 44:44.040
that got you to wake up at the same time

44:44.040 --> 44:46.040
It's not clear to me that there was

44:46.040 --> 44:48.040
much of a difference in the productivity

44:48.040 --> 44:49.040
with that

44:49.040 --> 44:51.040
where I kind of feel

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
if I just get up when I feel like it

44:53.040 --> 44:55.040
it's usually a little later each day

44:55.040 --> 44:57.040
but I just recently made

44:57.040 --> 44:59.040
the focusing decision to try to push my schedule

44:59.040 --> 45:01.040
back a little bit earlier to

45:01.040 --> 45:03.040
getting up at 8 in the morning

45:03.040 --> 45:05.040
and trying to shift things around

45:05.040 --> 45:07.040
I'm often doing experiments

45:07.040 --> 45:09.040
with myself about what should I be doing

45:09.040 --> 45:11.040
to be more productive

45:11.040 --> 45:13.040
and one of the things that I did realize

45:13.040 --> 45:15.040
was happening in recent months

45:15.040 --> 45:18.040
where I would go for

45:18.040 --> 45:19.040
a walk or a run

45:19.040 --> 45:21.040
I cover like four miles a day

45:21.040 --> 45:23.040
and I would usually do that

45:23.040 --> 45:25.040
just as the sun's going down

45:25.040 --> 45:26.040
here in Texas now

45:26.040 --> 45:28.040
and it's still really damn hot

45:28.040 --> 45:30.040
but I'd go out at 8.30 or something

45:30.040 --> 45:32.040
and cover the time there

45:32.040 --> 45:33.040
and then the showering

45:33.040 --> 45:35.040
and it was putting a hole in my day

45:35.040 --> 45:37.040
where I would have still a couple hours

45:37.040 --> 45:38.040
after that

45:38.040 --> 45:40.040
and sometimes my best hours were at night

45:40.040 --> 45:41.040
when nobody else is around

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
nobody's bothering me

45:42.040 --> 45:44.040
but that hole in the day was a problem

45:44.040 --> 45:46.040
so just a couple weeks ago

45:46.040 --> 45:48.040
I made the change to go ahead

45:48.040 --> 45:50.040
and say alright I'm going to get up a little earlier

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
I'm going to do a walk or get out there first

45:52.040 --> 45:54.040
so I can have more uninterrupted time

45:54.040 --> 45:56.040
so I'm still playing with factors like this

45:56.040 --> 46:00.040
as I kind of optimize my work efforts

46:00.040 --> 46:02.040
but it's always been

46:02.040 --> 46:04.040
it was 60 hours a week

46:04.040 --> 46:05.040
for a very long time

46:05.040 --> 46:07.040
to some degree I had a little thing

46:07.040 --> 46:09.040
in the back of my head where I was almost jealous

46:09.040 --> 46:10.040
of some of the programmers

46:10.040 --> 46:12.040
that would do these marathon sessions

46:12.040 --> 46:13.040
and I had like Dave Taylor

46:13.040 --> 46:14.040
one of the guys that he had

46:14.040 --> 46:15.040
he would be one of those people

46:15.040 --> 46:17.040
that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes

46:17.040 --> 46:19.040
and all the kind of classic hacker tropes

46:19.040 --> 46:20.040
about things

46:20.040 --> 46:22.040
and a part of me was like

46:22.040 --> 46:24.040
always a little bothered that that wasn't me

46:24.040 --> 46:26.040
that I wouldn't go program

46:26.040 --> 46:27.040
20 hours straight

46:27.040 --> 46:29.040
because I'm falling apart

46:29.040 --> 46:32.040
and not being very effective after 12 hours

46:32.040 --> 46:33.040
I mean yeah 12 hour programming

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
that's fine when you're doing that

46:35.040 --> 46:38.040
but you're not doing smart work

46:38.040 --> 46:39.040
much after

46:39.040 --> 46:40.040
at least I'm not

46:40.040 --> 46:41.040
but there's a range of people

46:41.040 --> 46:42.040
I mean that's something that a lot of people

46:42.040 --> 46:44.040
don't really get in their gut

46:44.040 --> 46:45.040
where there are people

46:45.040 --> 46:47.040
that work on four hours of sleep

46:47.040 --> 46:48.040
and are smart

46:48.040 --> 46:49.040
and can continue to do good work

46:49.040 --> 46:50.040
but then there's a lot of people

46:50.040 --> 46:52.040
that just fall apart

46:52.040 --> 46:54.040
so I do tell people that

46:54.040 --> 46:56.040
I always try to get eight hours of sleep

46:56.040 --> 46:57.040
it's not this

46:57.040 --> 46:59.040
you know push yourself harder

46:59.040 --> 47:00.040
get up earlier

47:00.040 --> 47:01.040
I just do worse work

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
where I know there's

47:03.040 --> 47:04.040
you can work a hundred hours a week

47:04.040 --> 47:06.040
and still get eight hours of sleep

47:06.040 --> 47:08.040
if you just kind of prioritize things correctly

47:08.040 --> 47:10.040
but I do believe in working hard

47:10.040 --> 47:12.040
working a lot

47:12.040 --> 47:14.040
there was a comment that

47:14.040 --> 47:16.040
Game Dev made that

47:16.040 --> 47:18.040
that I know there's a backlash

47:18.040 --> 47:19.040
against really hard work

47:19.040 --> 47:20.040
in a lot of cases

47:20.040 --> 47:22.040
and I get into online arguments

47:22.040 --> 47:23.040
about this all the time

47:23.040 --> 47:25.040
but it was basically saying

47:25.040 --> 47:26.040
yeah 40 hours a week

47:26.040 --> 47:27.040
that's kind of a part-time job

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
and if you were really in it

47:29.040 --> 47:31.040
you're doing what you think is important

47:31.040 --> 47:33.040
what you're passionate about

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
working more gets more done

47:35.040 --> 47:38.040
and it's just really not

47:38.040 --> 47:39.040
possible to argue with that

47:39.040 --> 47:41.040
if you've been around the people

47:41.040 --> 47:43.040
that work with that level of intensity

47:43.040 --> 47:44.040
and just say

47:44.040 --> 47:45.040
it's like no

47:45.040 --> 47:46.040
they should just stop

47:46.040 --> 47:47.040
and we had

47:47.040 --> 47:49.040
I kind of came back around to that

47:49.040 --> 47:50.040
a couple years ago

47:50.040 --> 47:53.040
where I was using the fictional example of

47:53.040 --> 47:54.040
alright

47:54.040 --> 47:55.040
some people say

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
they'll say with a straight face

47:57.040 --> 47:58.040
they think no

47:58.040 --> 47:59.040
you are less productive

47:59.040 --> 48:01.040
if you work more than 40 hours a week

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
and they're generally misinterpreting things

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
where your marginal productivity

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
for an hour after eight hours

48:07.040 --> 48:09.040
is less than in one of your peak hours

48:09.040 --> 48:11.040
but you're not literally getting less done

48:11.040 --> 48:13.040
there is a point where you start breaking things

48:13.040 --> 48:14.040
and getting worse

48:14.040 --> 48:16.040
worse behavior and everything out of it

48:16.040 --> 48:18.040
where you're literally going backwards

48:18.040 --> 48:21.040
but it's not at eight or ten or twelve hours

48:21.040 --> 48:23.040
and the fictional example I would use was

48:23.040 --> 48:25.040
imagine there's an asteroid

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
coming to impact

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
to crash into earth

48:28.040 --> 48:30.040
destroy all of human life

48:30.040 --> 48:32.040
do you want

48:32.040 --> 48:33.040
Elon Musk

48:33.040 --> 48:34.040
or the people working at SpaceX

48:34.040 --> 48:36.040
that are building the interceptor

48:36.040 --> 48:38.040
that's going to deflect the asteroid

48:38.040 --> 48:40.040
do you want them to clock out at five

48:40.040 --> 48:41.040
because damn it

48:41.040 --> 48:43.040
they're just going to do worse work

48:43.040 --> 48:45.040
if they work another couple hours

48:45.040 --> 48:47.040
and you know it seems absurd

48:47.040 --> 48:49.040
and that's a hypothetical though

48:49.040 --> 48:50.040
and everyone can dismiss that

48:50.040 --> 48:52.040
but then when coronavirus was hitting

48:52.040 --> 48:54.040
and you have all of these medical personnel

48:54.040 --> 48:56.040
that are clearly pushing themselves

48:56.040 --> 48:58.040
really really hard

48:58.040 --> 48:59.040
and I'd say it's like

48:59.040 --> 49:00.040
okay

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
do you want all of these scientists

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
working on treatments and vaccines

49:04.040 --> 49:05.040
and caring for all of these people

49:05.040 --> 49:07.040
are they really screwing everything up

49:07.040 --> 49:09.040
by working more than eight hours a day

49:09.040 --> 49:11.040
and of course people say

49:11.040 --> 49:13.040
I'm just an asshole to say something like that

49:13.040 --> 49:15.040
but it's the truth

49:15.040 --> 49:17.040
working longer gets more done

49:17.040 --> 49:19.040
so that's kind of

49:19.040 --> 49:21.040
the layer one

49:21.040 --> 49:23.040
but I'd like to also say that

49:23.040 --> 49:25.040
at least I believe

49:25.040 --> 49:27.040
depending on the person, depending on the task

49:27.040 --> 49:29.040
working more

49:29.040 --> 49:31.040
and harder

49:31.040 --> 49:33.040
will make

49:33.040 --> 49:35.040
you better for the next week

49:35.040 --> 49:37.040
in those peak hours

49:37.040 --> 49:39.040
so there's something about

49:39.040 --> 49:41.040
a deep dedication to a thing

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040
that

49:43.040 --> 49:45.040
kind of gets deep in you

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
so the hard work isn't just about

49:47.040 --> 49:49.040
the raw hours of productivity

49:49.040 --> 49:51.040
it's the

49:51.040 --> 49:53.040
it's the thing it does to you

49:53.040 --> 49:55.040
in the weeks

49:55.040 --> 49:57.040
and months after too

49:57.040 --> 49:59.040
you're tempering yourself in some ways

49:59.040 --> 50:01.040
and I think you know it's like

50:01.040 --> 50:03.040
you know dreams of sushi

50:03.040 --> 50:05.040
if you really dedicate yourself completely

50:05.040 --> 50:07.040
to making the sushi

50:07.040 --> 50:09.040
to really putting in the long hours

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
day after day after day

50:11.040 --> 50:13.040
you become a true craftsman

50:13.040 --> 50:15.040
of the thing you're doing

50:15.040 --> 50:17.040
now there's of course discussions about

50:17.040 --> 50:19.040
are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships

50:19.040 --> 50:21.040
are you sacrificing a lot of other possible

50:21.040 --> 50:23.040
things you could do with that time

50:23.040 --> 50:25.040
but if you're talking about purely

50:25.040 --> 50:27.040
being

50:27.040 --> 50:29.040
a master

50:29.040 --> 50:31.040
of your art

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
that more hours isn't just about

50:33.040 --> 50:35.040
doing more

50:35.040 --> 50:37.040
it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing

50:37.040 --> 50:39.040
and I don't gain say anybody that

50:39.040 --> 50:41.040
wants to work the minimum amount

50:41.040 --> 50:43.040
they've got other priorities in their life

50:43.040 --> 50:45.040
my only argument that I'm making

50:45.040 --> 50:47.040
it's not that everybody should work hard

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
it's that if you want to accomplish something

50:49.040 --> 50:51.040
working longer and harder

50:51.040 --> 50:53.040
is the path to getting it accomplished

50:53.040 --> 50:55.040
well let me ask you about this then

50:55.040 --> 50:57.040
why the mythical

50:57.040 --> 50:59.040
work-life balance

51:01.040 --> 51:03.040
for an engineer it seems like

51:03.040 --> 51:05.040
that's one of the professions

51:05.040 --> 51:07.040
for a programmer

51:07.040 --> 51:09.040
where

51:09.040 --> 51:11.040
working hard does lead to

51:11.040 --> 51:13.040
greater productivity in it

51:13.040 --> 51:15.040
but it also raises the question

51:15.040 --> 51:17.040
of

51:17.040 --> 51:19.040
personal relationships

51:19.040 --> 51:21.040
and all that kind of stuff family

51:21.040 --> 51:23.040
how are you able to

51:23.040 --> 51:25.040
find work-life balance

51:25.040 --> 51:27.040
you can give maybe even outside yourself

51:27.040 --> 51:29.040
have you been able to arrive

51:29.040 --> 51:31.040
at any wisdom on this

51:31.040 --> 51:33.040
part in your years of life

51:33.040 --> 51:35.040
I do think that there's a wide range of people

51:35.040 --> 51:37.040
where different people have different needs

51:37.040 --> 51:39.040
it's not a one size fits all

51:39.040 --> 51:41.040
certainly what works for me

51:41.040 --> 51:43.040
I can tell enough

51:43.040 --> 51:45.040
that I'm

51:45.040 --> 51:47.040
different than a typical average person

51:47.040 --> 51:49.040
in the way things impact me

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
the things that I want to do

51:51.040 --> 51:53.040
my goals are different

51:53.040 --> 51:55.040
my endeavors to impact things

51:55.040 --> 51:57.040
are different where

51:57.040 --> 51:59.040
I have literally never

51:59.040 --> 52:01.040
felt burnout and I know

52:01.040 --> 52:03.040
there's lots of brilliant smart people

52:03.040 --> 52:05.040
that do world-leading work

52:05.040 --> 52:07.040
that get burned out and

52:07.040 --> 52:09.040
it's never hit me

52:09.040 --> 52:11.040
I've never been at a point where

52:11.040 --> 52:13.040
I'm like

52:13.040 --> 52:15.040
I just don't care about this

52:15.040 --> 52:17.040
I don't want to do this anymore

52:17.040 --> 52:19.040
but I've always had the flexibility

52:19.040 --> 52:21.040
to work on lots of interesting things

52:21.040 --> 52:23.040
and have a great time working on that

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
and so much of that

52:25.040 --> 52:27.040
so much of the ability to actually work hard

52:27.040 --> 52:29.040
is the ability to have multiple things

52:29.040 --> 52:31.040
to choose from and to use

52:31.040 --> 52:33.040
your time on the most appropriate thing

52:33.040 --> 52:35.040
there are time periods

52:35.040 --> 52:37.040
where it's the best time

52:37.040 --> 52:39.040
for me to read a new research paper

52:39.040 --> 52:41.040
that I need to really be thinking hard about it

52:41.040 --> 52:43.040
then there's a time that maybe I should just

52:43.040 --> 52:45.040
scan and organize my old notes

52:45.040 --> 52:47.040
because I'm just not on top of things

52:47.040 --> 52:49.040
then there's the time that

52:49.040 --> 52:51.040
let's go bang out a few hundred lines

52:51.040 --> 52:53.040
of code for something

52:53.040 --> 52:55.040
so switching between them

52:55.040 --> 52:57.040
has been real valuable

52:57.040 --> 52:59.040
so you always have kind of joined

52:59.040 --> 53:01.040
your heart for all the things you're doing

53:01.040 --> 53:03.040
and that is the kind of work-life

53:03.040 --> 53:05.040
balance as a first step

53:05.040 --> 53:07.040
so you're always happy

53:07.040 --> 53:09.040
well happy

53:09.040 --> 53:11.040
a lot of people would say that often

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
I look like kind of a grim person

53:13.040 --> 53:15.040
with just sitting there with a neutral expression

53:15.040 --> 53:17.040
or even like knitted brows and a frown

53:17.040 --> 53:19.040
on my face as I'm staring at something

53:19.040 --> 53:21.040
that's what happiness looks like for you

53:21.040 --> 53:23.040
yeah it's kind of true

53:23.040 --> 53:25.040
where that's like okay I'm pushing

53:25.040 --> 53:27.040
through this I'm making progress here

53:27.040 --> 53:29.040
I am you know

53:29.040 --> 53:31.040
I know that doesn't work for everyone

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
I know it doesn't work for most people

53:33.040 --> 53:35.040
but what I am always trying to do

53:35.040 --> 53:37.040
in those cases is I don't want to let

53:37.040 --> 53:39.040
somebody that might be a person like that

53:39.040 --> 53:41.040
be told by someone else that

53:41.040 --> 53:43.040
no don't try it don't even try

53:43.040 --> 53:45.040
that out as an option where

53:45.040 --> 53:47.040
I you know work-life balance

53:47.040 --> 53:49.040
versus kind of your life's work

53:49.040 --> 53:51.040
where there's a small subset

53:51.040 --> 53:53.040
of the people that can be very happy

53:53.040 --> 53:55.040
being obsessive about things

53:55.040 --> 53:57.040
and you know obsession

53:57.040 --> 53:59.040
can often get things done

53:59.040 --> 54:01.040
that just practical, prudent

54:01.040 --> 54:03.040
pedestrian work won't

54:03.040 --> 54:05.040
or at least won't for a very long time

54:05.040 --> 54:07.040
there's legends of

54:07.040 --> 54:09.040
your nutritional intake

54:09.040 --> 54:11.040
in the early days

54:11.040 --> 54:13.040
what can you say about

54:13.040 --> 54:15.040
being a program

54:15.040 --> 54:17.040
as a kind of athlete

54:17.040 --> 54:19.040
so what

54:19.040 --> 54:21.040
what was the nutrition that fueled

54:21.040 --> 54:23.040
I have never been that great

54:23.040 --> 54:25.040
on really

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
paying attention to it where

54:27.040 --> 54:29.040
I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot

54:29.040 --> 54:31.040
you know I've never been like a big heavy guy

54:31.040 --> 54:33.040
but it was

54:33.040 --> 54:35.040
interesting where one of the things that I can remember

54:35.040 --> 54:37.040
being an unhappy teenager not having

54:37.040 --> 54:39.040
enough money and like one of the things

54:39.040 --> 54:41.040
that bothered me about not having enough money

54:41.040 --> 54:43.040
is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to

54:43.040 --> 54:45.040
so I got rich and then

54:45.040 --> 54:47.040
I bought a whole lot of pizza

54:47.040 --> 54:49.040
that was the defining like that's what being rich felt like

54:49.040 --> 54:51.040
there was a lot of little things

54:51.040 --> 54:53.040
like I could buy all the pizza and comic books

54:53.040 --> 54:55.040
and video games that I wanted to

54:55.040 --> 54:57.040
and it really

54:57.040 --> 54:59.040
didn't take that much

54:59.040 --> 55:01.040
but the pizza was one of those things

55:01.040 --> 55:03.040
and it's absolutely true that for a long time

55:03.040 --> 55:05.040
it did software I had a pizza

55:05.040 --> 55:07.040
delivered every single day you know the delivery guy

55:07.040 --> 55:09.040
knew me my name

55:09.040 --> 55:11.040
and I didn't find out until years later

55:11.040 --> 55:13.040
that apparently I was such a good

55:13.040 --> 55:15.040
customer that they just never raised

55:15.040 --> 55:17.040
the price on me and I was using this

55:17.040 --> 55:19.040
six year old price for the pizzas that they

55:19.040 --> 55:21.040
were still kind of sending my way every day

55:21.040 --> 55:23.040
so you were doing

55:23.040 --> 55:25.040
eating once a day

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
or were you... it would be spread out

55:27.040 --> 55:29.040
you know you have a few pieces of pizza you have some more later on

55:29.040 --> 55:31.040
and I'd maybe have something at home

55:31.040 --> 55:33.040
it was one of the nice things

55:33.040 --> 55:35.040
that Facebook meta is

55:35.040 --> 55:37.040
they do they feed you quite well you get

55:37.040 --> 55:39.040
a different

55:39.040 --> 55:41.040
I guess now it's doordash sorts of things delivered

55:41.040 --> 55:43.040
but they take care of making sure that everybody

55:43.040 --> 55:45.040
does get well fed

55:45.040 --> 55:47.040
and I probably had better food those

55:47.040 --> 55:49.040
six years that I was working in the meta office

55:49.040 --> 55:51.040
there than I used to before

55:51.040 --> 55:53.040
but I

55:53.040 --> 55:55.040
it's worked out okay for me my health has always been good

55:55.040 --> 55:57.040
I get a pretty good amount of exercise

55:57.040 --> 55:59.040
and I don't

55:59.040 --> 56:01.040
eat to excess and I avoid a lot of other

56:01.040 --> 56:03.040
kind of not so good for you

56:03.040 --> 56:05.040
things so I'm still doing quite well

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
did you have

56:07.040 --> 56:09.040
a kind of

56:09.040 --> 56:11.040
I don't know

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
spiritual experience with food

56:13.040 --> 56:15.040
or coffee or any of that kind of stuff

56:15.040 --> 56:17.040
I mean

56:17.040 --> 56:19.040
the programming experience with music

56:19.040 --> 56:21.040
or

56:21.040 --> 56:23.040
like I listen to brown noise on a program

56:23.040 --> 56:25.040
or like creating an environment

56:25.040 --> 56:27.040
and the things you take into your body

56:27.040 --> 56:29.040
just everything you construct

56:29.040 --> 56:31.040
can become a kind of ritual that

56:31.040 --> 56:33.040
empowers the whole process the program

56:33.040 --> 56:35.040
relationship with pizza or

56:35.040 --> 56:37.040
it would really be with Diet Coke

56:37.040 --> 56:39.040
there still is that sense of

56:39.040 --> 56:41.040
drop the can down crack open the can

56:41.040 --> 56:43.040
of Diet Coke alright now I mean business

56:43.040 --> 56:45.040
we're getting to work here

56:45.040 --> 56:47.040
still to this day

56:47.040 --> 56:49.040
is Diet Coke a still partner

56:49.040 --> 56:51.040
yeah probably 8 or 9 a day

56:51.040 --> 56:53.040
nice okay

56:53.040 --> 56:55.040
what about your setup

56:55.040 --> 56:57.040
how many screens

56:57.040 --> 56:59.040
what kind of keyboard is there something interesting

56:59.040 --> 57:01.040
what kind of IDE

57:01.040 --> 57:03.040
Linux what operating system

57:03.040 --> 57:05.040
laptop or any interesting

57:05.040 --> 57:07.040
thing that brings you joy

57:07.040 --> 57:09.040
so I kind of migrated cultures

57:09.040 --> 57:11.040
where early on through all of game dev

57:11.040 --> 57:13.040
there was sort of one culture there

57:13.040 --> 57:15.040
which was really quite distinct from the more

57:15.040 --> 57:17.040
the Silicon Valley venture

57:17.040 --> 57:19.040
you know culture for things

57:19.040 --> 57:21.040
it's their different groups and they have

57:21.040 --> 57:23.040
pretty different mores and the way they think about things

57:23.040 --> 57:25.040
where and I still do

57:25.040 --> 57:27.040
think a lot of the big companies can learn

57:27.040 --> 57:29.040
can learn things from

57:29.040 --> 57:31.040
the hardcore game development side of things

57:31.040 --> 57:33.040
where it still boggles my mind

57:33.040 --> 57:35.040
how hostile

57:35.040 --> 57:37.040
to debuggers and IDEs

57:37.040 --> 57:39.040
that so much of them

57:39.040 --> 57:41.040
the kind of big money get billions of dollars

57:41.040 --> 57:43.040
Silicon Valley venture backed

57:43.040 --> 57:45.040
funds are

57:45.040 --> 57:47.040
sorry so you're saying like

57:47.040 --> 57:49.040
big companies like Google and Meta are hostile

57:49.040 --> 57:51.040
to they are not big on

57:51.040 --> 57:53.040
debuggers and IDEs like

57:53.040 --> 57:55.040
so much of it is like emacs BIM

57:55.040 --> 57:57.040
for things and we just assume

57:57.040 --> 57:59.040
that debuggers don't work

57:59.040 --> 58:01.040
most of the time for the systems

58:01.040 --> 58:03.040
and a lot of this comes from a sort of

58:03.040 --> 58:05.040
Linux bias on a lot of things

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
where I did come up through

58:07.040 --> 58:09.040
the personal computers and then the DOS

58:09.040 --> 58:11.040
and then I am windows

58:11.040 --> 58:13.040
and it was

58:13.040 --> 58:15.040
Borland tools and then visual studio

58:15.040 --> 58:17.040
and

58:17.040 --> 58:19.040
you appreciate the buggers

58:19.040 --> 58:21.040
very much so I mean a debugger is how you

58:21.040 --> 58:23.040
get a view into a system that's too complicated

58:23.040 --> 58:25.040
to understand I mean anybody that thinks

58:25.040 --> 58:27.040
just read the code and think about it

58:27.040 --> 58:29.040
that's an insane statement in the

58:29.040 --> 58:31.040
you can't even read all the code on a big system

58:31.040 --> 58:33.040
you have to do experiments

58:33.040 --> 58:35.040
on the system and doing that

58:35.040 --> 58:37.040
by adding log statements

58:37.040 --> 58:39.040
recompiling and rerunning it

58:39.040 --> 58:41.040
is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it

58:41.040 --> 58:43.040
I mean yes you can always

58:43.040 --> 58:45.040
get things done even if you're working with stone

58:45.040 --> 58:47.040
knives and bear skins that's

58:47.040 --> 58:49.040
that is the mark of a good programmer is

58:49.040 --> 58:51.040
that given any tools you will figure

58:51.040 --> 58:53.040
out a way to get it done but

58:53.040 --> 58:55.040
it's amazing what you can do with

58:55.040 --> 58:57.040
sometimes much much better tools

58:57.040 --> 58:59.040
where instead of just going through this

58:59.040 --> 59:01.040
iterative compile run

59:01.040 --> 59:03.040
debug cycle and you have the

59:03.040 --> 59:05.040
you have the old Lisp direction of like

59:05.040 --> 59:07.040
you've got a REPL and you're working interactively

59:07.040 --> 59:09.040
and doing amazing things there but

59:09.040 --> 59:11.040
in many cases a debugger as a very powerful

59:11.040 --> 59:13.040
user interface that can

59:13.040 --> 59:15.040
stop examine all the different things in your

59:15.040 --> 59:17.040
program set all these different breakpoints

59:17.040 --> 59:19.040
and of course you can do that with GDB

59:19.040 --> 59:21.040
or whatever there but

59:21.040 --> 59:23.040
this is one of the user interface fundamental

59:23.040 --> 59:25.040
principles where when something is

59:25.040 --> 59:27.040
complicated to do you won't

59:27.040 --> 59:29.040
use it very often there's people

59:29.040 --> 59:31.040
that will break out GDB when they're at

59:31.040 --> 59:33.040
their wits end and they just have beat

59:33.040 --> 59:35.040
their head against a problem for so long

59:35.040 --> 59:37.040
but for somebody that kind of grew

59:37.040 --> 59:39.040
up in game dev it's like they were running into

59:39.040 --> 59:41.040
the debugger anyways before they even knew

59:41.040 --> 59:43.040
there was a problem and you would just

59:43.040 --> 59:45.040
stop and see you know what was happening

59:45.040 --> 59:47.040
and sometimes you could fix things even before

59:47.040 --> 59:49.040
you you know even

59:49.040 --> 59:51.040
before you did one compile cycle you could

59:51.040 --> 59:53.040
be in the debugger and you'd say well I'm just

59:53.040 --> 59:55.040
going to change this right here and yep

59:55.040 --> 59:57.040
that did the job and fix it and go on

59:57.040 --> 59:59.040
and for people that don't know GDB is

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040
sort of popular I guess Linux

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
debugger

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.040
primarily for C++

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.040
they handle most of the languages but

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.040
it's you know it's based on C as the

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.040
original kind of Unix heritage

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.040
and it's kind of like command line it's not user friendly

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.040
it's not it doesn't allow for clean

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.040
visualizations and you're exactly right

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.040
so that you're using this kind of debugger

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.040
usually when you're at what's end

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.040
and there's a problem that you can't figure out

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.040
why by just looking at the codes if to

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040
find it that's how I guess

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.040
normal programmers use it but you're

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
saying there should be tools that kind of

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.040
visualize and help you as

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.040
part of the programming process

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.040
just the normal programming process

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.040
to understand the

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.040
code deeper. Yeah when I'm working on

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040
like my CC++ code

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.040
I'm always running it from the debugger

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.040
you know just I type in the code

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.040
I run it many times the first thing I

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.040
do after writing code is

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040
set a breakpoint and step through the function

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.040
now other people will say it's like oh I do that in my head

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040
well your head is a faulty

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.040
interpreter of all those things there

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.040
and I've written brand new code

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.040
I want to step in there and I'm going to single

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.040
step through that examine lots of things

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.040
and see if it's actually doing what I expected

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.040
it to. It is

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.040
a kind of companion

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.040
the debugger like

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.040
you're now coding in an interactive way with another

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.040
being

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.040
the debugger is a kind of dumb

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040
being but it's a reliable being

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040
that is an interesting question of what role

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.040
does AI play in that kind of

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.040
with codex and these kind of

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.040
ability to generate

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.040
code might be you might

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040
start having tools that

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.040
understand the code in interesting

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.040
deep ways that can work with you.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.040
I mean there's a whole spectrum there

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040
from static code analyzers

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040
and various kind of dynamic tools

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040
they're up to AI that can

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.040
conceivably grok these programs that

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.040
literally no human can understand

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040
they're too big, too intertwined, too

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.040
interconnected but it's not beyond

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.040
the possibility of understanding

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040
it's just beyond what we can hold

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.040
in our heads as kind of mutable state

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.040
while we're working on things

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040
and I'm a big proponent

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.040
again of things like static analyzers

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040
and some of that stuff where

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.040
you'll find some people that don't like

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.040
being scolded by a program

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.040
for how they've written something where

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.040
it's like oh I know better and sometimes

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040
you do but that was something that

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.040
I was it was very

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.040
very valuable for me when

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.040
not too many people get an opportunity

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.040
like this to have this is almost one of those

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040
spiritual experiences as a programmer and

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.040
awakening to

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.040
the id software code bases were a couple

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.040
million lines of code and

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.040
at one point I had used a few of the

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.040
different analysis tools but

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.040
I made a point to really

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.040
go through and scrub the code base

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.040
using every tool that I could find

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.040
and it was eye-opening where we had

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.040
a reputation for having some of the

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.040
most robust strongest code

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.040
where there were some great things

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.040
that I remember hearing from

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.040
Microsoft telling us about crashes on XBox

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.040
and we had this tiny number that they said

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040
were probably literally hardware

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
errors and then you have other

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.040
significant titles that just have

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040
millions of faults that are getting recorded

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040
so I was proud of our code on a lot

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040
of levels but when I took this

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040
code analysis squeegee through

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.040
everything it was

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040
it was shocking how many

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040
errors there were in there things

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.040
that you can say okay this was this was

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.040
a copy paste not changing something right

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.040
here lots of things that were

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.040
the most the most common problem

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.040
was something in a printf

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.040
format string that was the wrong data type

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040
that could cause crashes there and

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040
you really want the warnings for things like

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040
that then the next most common was

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.040
missing a check for null that could actually

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.040
happen that could blow things up and

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.040
those are obviously like top CC

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.040
plus plus things everybody has those problems

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.040
but the long tail of all

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040
of the different little things that could go wrong

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040
there and we had good programmers

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040
and my own code so that I'd be looking at

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.040
it's like oh I wrote that code that's definitely

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.040
wrong we've been using this for

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.040
a year and

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040
it's this somewhere you know this

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.040
mine sitting there waiting for us to step on

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040
and

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.040
it was humbling it was and I

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.040
reached the conclusion that

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.040
anything that can be syntactically

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.040
allowed in your language

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.040
if I'm it's going to show up

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.040
eventually in a large enough code base

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040
I you're not going to good intentions

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040
aren't going to keep it from happening

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040
you need automated tools and guard

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.040
rails for things and those start with

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.040
things like static types and or even

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.040
type hints in the more dynamic languages

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.040
but the people that

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.040
rebel against that that basically

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.040
say that slows me down

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.040
doing that there's something to that I get

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.040
that I've written you know I cobbled things

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.040
together in a notebook I

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.040
like wow this is great that it just happened

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.040
but yeah that's kind of sketchy but it's working

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040
fine I don't care it does come back to

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.040
that that value analysis

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040
where sometimes it's right to not care

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.040
but when you do care

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.040
if it's going to be something that's going to

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.040
live for years and it's going to have other people

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.040
working on it I and it's going to be

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.040
deployed to millions of people

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.040
then you want to use all of these tools

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.040
you want to be told it's like no you

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040
screwed up here here and here and that does

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.040
require kind of an ego check about

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.040
things where you have

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.040
to to be open to the fact

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.040
that everything that you're doing is just littered

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040
with flaws it's not that oh you

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.040
occasionally have a bad day it's just

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040
whatever stream of code you output

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.040
there's going to be a statistical regularity

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.040
of things that you just make mistakes

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.040
on and I

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.040
and I do think there's the whole

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.040
argument about test-driven design

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.040
and unit testing versus kind

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.040
of analysis and different things

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.040
I am more in favor of the analysis

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.040
and the stuff that just like you can't run

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040
your program until you fix this rather

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040
than you can run it and hopefully

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040
a unit test will catch it in some way

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.040
yeah in my private code

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.040
I have asserts everywhere

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.040
just there's something

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.040
pleasant to me

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.040
pleasurable to me about sort of the

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.040
dictatorial rule of like

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.040
this should be true at this point

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.040
in too many

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.040
times

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040
I've made mistakes

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.040
that shouldn't have been made

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.040
and I would assume

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.040
I wouldn't be the kind of person that would make that mistake

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040
but I keep making that mistake therefore

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.040
an assert really catches me

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.040
really helps all the time

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.040
so my code I would say like

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.040
10 to 20 percent of my private code

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.040
just for personal use is probably

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.040
and there are active comments

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040
one of those things that in theory

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.040
they don't make any difference to the program

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.040
and if it was all operating the way

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.040
you expected it would be then

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.040
they will never fire

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.040
but even if you have it right

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.040
and you wrote the code right initially

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.040
then circumstances change

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040
the world outside your program changes

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.040
and in fact that's one of the things where

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.040
I'm kind of fond

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.040
in a lot of cases of static array size

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.040
declarations where I went through this

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.040
period where it's like okay now we have general

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.040
collection classes we should just make everything

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.040
variable because

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.040
I had this history of in the early days

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.040
you get doom which had

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.040
some fixed limits on it then everybody started

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.040
making crazier and crazier things and they kept bumping

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.040
up the different limits this many lines

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.040
this many sectors

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.040
and it seemed like a good idea

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.040
well we should just make this completely generic

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.040
it can go kind of go up to whatever

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.040
and

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.040
there's cases where that's the right thing to do

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.040
but it also the other

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.040
aspect of the world changing around you

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040
is it's good to be informed

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.040
when the world has changed more than you thought

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.040
it would and if you've got a continuously

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.040
growing collection you're never going to

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.040
find out you might have this quadratic

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.040
slowdown on something where you thought

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.040
oh I'm only ever going to have a handful

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.040
of these but something changes

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.040
and there's a new design style and all of a sudden

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.040
you've got 10,000 of them

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.040
so I kind of like in many cases

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.040
picking a number

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.040
of some nice brown power of 2 number

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.040
and setting it up in there

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040
and having an assert saying it's like hey

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040
you hit this limit

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.040
you should probably think are the choices that you've

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.040
made around all of this still relevant

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.040
if somebody's using 10 times

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.040
more than you thought they would

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.040
yeah this code was originally written

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040
with this kind of world view

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040
with this kind of set of constraints

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.040
you were thinking of the world in this way

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.040
if something breaks

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.040
that means you got to rethink the initial stuff

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.040
and it's nice for it to

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.040
for it to do that

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.040
is there any stuff like keyboard

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.040
or monitors

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.040
I'm fairly pedestrian on

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.040
a lot of that where I did move

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.040
to triple monitors like in the last several

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.040
years though I had been dual monitor

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.040
for a very long time and

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.040
and it was one of those things where

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.040
probably years later than

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.040
I should have I'm just like well the video cards now

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040
generally have three output ports

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040
I should just put the third monitor up there

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.040
that's been a pure win I've been very happy with that

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.040
but no

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.040
I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.040
or anything

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.040
the key things is an IDE that has

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.040
helpful debuggers has helpful tools

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.040
so it's not the emacs

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.040
vim route and then die coke

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040
yeah so I did spend you know I

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040
spent one of my week long retreats

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040
where I'm like okay I'm going to make myself

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040
use it was actually

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.040
classic vi which I know people will say you should never

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040
have done that you should have just used vim

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.040
but you know I gave it the good try

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.040
it's like okay I'm being in

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.040
kind of classic Unix developer mode

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040
here and I worked

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040
for a week on it I used

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.040
Anki to like teach myself the

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.040
the different little key combinations for

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040
things like that and in the end it was just like

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.040
alright this was kind of like my

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.040
Civil War reenactment phase you know it's

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.040
like I'm going out there doing it like they used to

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040
in the old days and it was kind of fun

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.040
in that regard so many people right now

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.040
screaming

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.040
as they're listening to this so again the

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040
out is that this was not modern vim

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.040
but still I yes

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.040
I was very happy to get back to

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.040
my visual studio at the end

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040
yeah I'm actually I struggle with this a lot

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
because

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.040
so use a kinesis keyboard and

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.040
I use emacs primarily

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.040
and I feel like

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.040
I can exactly as you said

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.040
I can understand the code I can navigate the

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.040
code there's a lot of stuff you could build

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040
within emacs with using lisp

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040
you can customize a lot of things for yourself

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.040
to help you

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.040
introspect the code like to help

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.040
you understand the code and visualize different

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.040
aspects of the code you can even run the buggers

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.040
but it's work

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.040
and the world moves past you

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040
and the better and better ideas that constantly

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.040
being built and that

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.040
puts a kind of

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.040
I need to take the same kind of

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.040
retreat as you're talking about but now

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.040
I'm still fighting the Civil War

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.040
I need to kind of move into the 21st century

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040
and it does seem like the world is

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040
or a large chunk of the world is moving

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.040
towards visual studio code which is

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040
kind of interesting to me against the javascript

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.040
ecosystem on the one hand

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040
and IDs are one of those

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.040
things that you want to be infinitely

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.040
fast you want them to just kind of

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040
immediately respond

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.040
and like I mean heck I've got there's someone

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.040
I know I'm an old school game dev guy

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040
that still uses visual studio 6

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.040
and on a modern computer

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.040
everything is just absolutely

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.040
instant on something like that

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040
because it was made to work on a computer that's

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040
10,000 or 100,000

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.040
times slower so just everything happens

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.040
immediately and all the

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.040
modern systems just feel

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.040
you know they feel so crufty when

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.040
it's like oh why is this refreshing the screen

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.040
and moving around and updating over here

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.040
and something blinks down there and you should

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.040
update this and there's

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040
you know there are things that

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040
we've lost with that incredible flexibility

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.040
but

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040
lots of people get tons of value from it

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040
and I am super happy that that seems

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.040
to be winning over even a lot of the old

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040
Vim and Emacs people that they're kind of like

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.040
hey visual studio codes maybe you know

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040
not so bad I am

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.040
that may be the final peacekeeping solution

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.040
where everybody is reasonably

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.040
happy with something like

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.040
that. So can you explain

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.040
what a .plan file is and

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.040
what role that played in your life

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.040
does it still continue to play a role?

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.040
Back in the early early days of

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.040
grid software one of

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.040
our big things that was unique with what we

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.040
did is I had adopted

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.040
next stations or kind of next

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.040
step systems from Steve Jobs's

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040
out in the

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040
out in the woods away from Apple company

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.040
and

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.040
they were basically it was kind of

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.040
interesting because I did not really have a background

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040
with the Unix system so many of the people

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.040
they get immersed in that

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.040
in college and

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.040
you know and that's you know that

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.040
a lot of cultural expectations for them

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.040
and I didn't have any of that

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.040
but I knew that

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.040
my background was I was a huge Apple 2

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040
fanboy I was always

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.040
a little suspicious of the Mac I was

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040
not really what I what kind of I wanted

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.040
to go with

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040
but when Steve Jobs left Apple

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.040
and started next this computer

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.040
did just seem like one of those amazing things

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.040
from the future where it had all of this cool

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.040
stuff in it and we were still

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040
back in those days working on DOS

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040
everything blew up you had reset buttons

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.040
because your computer would just freeze

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.040
if you're doing development work literally

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.040
dozens of times a day your computer was just

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.040
rebooting constantly and so this idea

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.040
of yes any of the

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040
the Unix workstations would have given a

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.040
stable development platform where

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.040
you don't crash and reboot all the time

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.040
but next also had

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.040
this really amazing graphical

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.040
interface and it was great for building

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.040
tools and it used

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.040
Objective-C as the kind of an interesting

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040
oh wow

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.040
the next was Unix based

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.040
it's that Objective-C so it has a lot of the

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.040
elements that became Mac

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.040
I mean the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.040
by next where that took over

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.040
and became what the modern Mac

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.040
system is and defined some of the developer

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.040
like

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.040
the tools and the whole community

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.040
yeah you've still got if you're programming

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.040
on Apple stuff now there's still all these NS

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040
somethings which was originally next

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.040
step objects of different kinds of things

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.040
but one of the aspects

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.040
of those Unix systems

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.040
was they had this notion of

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.040
a dot plan file where

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.040
a dot file is an invisible

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.040
file usually in your home

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.040
directory or something and there was a trivial

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.040
server running on most Unix systems

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.040
at the time that

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.040
when somebody ran a trivial

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.040
little command called finger

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040
you could do finger and then somebody's

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040
address it could be anywhere on the internet

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.040
if you were connected correctly

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040
and all that server would do was

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.040
read the dot plan file

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.040
in that user's home directory

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.040
and then just spit it out to you

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.040
and originally the idea was that could be

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.040
whether you're on vacation what your current

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040
project was it's supposed to be like

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.040
the plan of what you're doing

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.040
and people would use it for

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.040
various purposes but all it did

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.040
was dump that file

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.040
to the terminal of whoever issued

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.040
the finger command

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.040
and at one point

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.040
I started just keeping a list

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040
of what I was doing in there

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.040
which would be what I was working on in the day

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.040
and I would have this little

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.040
syntax I kind of got to myself about

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040
here's something that I'm working on

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040
I put a star when I finish it

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.040
I could have a few other little bits of punctuation

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.040
and at the time it was

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040
it started off as being just like my to-do list

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.040
and it would be these

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.040
trivial obscure little things like

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040
I fixed something

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.040
with collision detection code

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.040
and the fireball do something different

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.040
and just little one-liners

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.040
that people that were following the games

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.040
could kind of decipher

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.040
but I did wind up

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.040
starting to write much more in-depth things

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.040
I would have little notes

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040
of thoughts and insights

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.040
and then I would eventually start having little essays

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040
I would sometimes dump into the .plan files

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040
interspersed with the work logs

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.040
of things that I was doing

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.040
so in some ways it was like a super early

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.040
protoblog where

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040
I was kind of dumping out what I was working on

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040
but it was interesting enough that

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.040
there were a lot of people

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.040
that were interested in this

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.040
so most of the people didn't have Unix workstation

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.040
so there were the websites

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.040
back in the day that would follow the doom and quake development

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040
that would

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.040
basically make a little service that would go grab

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040
all the changes and then people could just get it

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040
with a web browser and there was a period

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
where like all of the little

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.040
kind of Dallas gaming diaspora

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.040
of people that were at all in that orbit

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040
there were a couple dozen

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.040
.plan files going on which was

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040
and this was some years before

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.040
blogging really became kind of a thing

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.040
and it was kind of a

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040
a premonition of

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.040
sort of the way things would go and there was

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040
it's all been collected

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.040
it's available online in different places

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.040
and it's kind of fun to go back and look through

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
what I was thinking

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.040
what I was doing in the different areas

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040
Have you had a chance to look back? Is there some interesting

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.040
very low level specific

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.040
to do items

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.040
maybe things you've never completed

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.040
all that kind of stuff and high level

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.040
philosophical essay type of stuff

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040
there's some good stuff

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040
on both where

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.040
a lot of it was low level nitpicky

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040
details about game dev

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.040
and I've learned

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.040
enough things where there's no project

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.040
that I worked on that I couldn't go back

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040
and do a better job on now

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.040
I mean you just you learn things hopefully

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.040
if you're doing it right you learn things as you get older

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.040
and you should be able to do a better job

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.040
at all of the early things

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.040
and there's stuff in

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040
Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like oh clearly

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040
I could go back and do a better job

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.040
at this whether it's something in the rendering

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.040
engine side or how I implemented

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040
the monster behaviors

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.040
or managed resources or anything like that

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040
Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040
Yeah I do

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040
I mean sometimes I'll get the

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.040
I'll look at it and say yeah I had a pretty clear

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.040
view of I was doing good work there

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040
and I haven't really

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.040
hit the point where

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.040
there was another programmer, Graham Divine

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.040
he had worked at id and

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.040
7th guest and he made some

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.040
comment one time where he said he looked back at some of his

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.040
old notes and he was like wow I was

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.040
really smart back then

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.040
and I don't hit

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040
that so much where I mean I look at it

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.040
and I always know that yeah

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.040
there's all the you know with aging you get

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.040
certain changes in how you're

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.040
able to work problems but all of the

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.040
problems that I've worked I

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.040
you know I'm sure that I could do a better

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.040
job on all of them. Oh wow

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.040
so you can still step right in if you could travel

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.040
back in time and talk to that guy

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.040
you would teach him a few things. Yeah absolutely

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.040
that's awesome

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.040
What about the high level philosophical stuff?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040
Is there some insights that

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040
stand out that you remember?

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.040
There's things that

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.040
I was understanding about

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.040
development and I

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.040
in the industry and so on that were

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.040
in a more primitive

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.040
stage where

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.040
I definitely learned a lot

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.040
more in the later years about

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.040
business and organization

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.040
and team structure

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.040
there were

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.040
I mean there were definitely things that I was

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.040
not the best person

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.040
or even a very good person about managing

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040
like how a team should

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.040
operate internally, how people should work together

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.040
I was just

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.040
you know just get out

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.040
of my way and let me work on the code

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.040
and do this and more and more

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.040
I've learned how

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040
in the larger scheme of things

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.040
how sometimes relatively

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.040
unimportant some of those things are where it is

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.040
this user value generation

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040
that's the overarching

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.040
importance for all of that and I

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.040
didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.040
correctly through a lot of my

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040
you know my earlier years

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040
and there's things that

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.040
you know I could have gotten more

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.040
out of people handling things in different ways

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.040
I am you know I could have made

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040
you know in some ways more

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040
successful products by following things

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.040
in different ways there's mistakes that we

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.040
made that we couldn't really have

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.040
known how things would have worked out but

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.040
it was interesting to see in later years companies

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.040
like Activision showing that hey you really

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
can just do the same game

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.040
make it better every year and you can

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.040
look at that from a negative standpoint and say

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040
it's like oh that's just being derivative and all that

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040
but if you step back again

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.040
and say it's like no are the people buying it

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.040
still enjoying it are they enjoying it more

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.040
than what they might have bought otherwise

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.040
and you can say no that's

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.040
that's actually a great value creation

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.040
engine to do that if you're in a position

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.040
where you can

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.040
you know don't be forced into reinventing

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040
everything just because you think that you need

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040
to

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.040
you know lots of things about

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.040
business and team stuff that could be done

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.040
better but the technical work

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.040
the kind of technical visionary type stuff

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.040
that I laid out I still feel pretty good

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.040
about there are some classic old

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.040
ones about my defending of OpenGL

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.040
versus D3D

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.040
which turned out

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.040
to be one of the more probably important

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.040
momentous things there where

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.040
it never it was always

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.040
a rearguard action on Windows where

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040
Microsoft was just not going to let

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.040
that win but when I look back

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.040
on it now that fight

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.040
to keep OpenGL relevant for

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.040
a number of years there meant

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.040
that OpenGL was there when

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.040
mobile started happening and

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.040
OpenGL ES was the thing that

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.040
drove all of the acceleration

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.040
of the mobile industry and it's

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.040
really only in the last few years

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.040
as apples moved to metal and some of

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.040
the other companies have moved to Vulcan

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.040
that that's moved away but

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.040
really stepping back and

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040
looking at it's like yeah I sold tens

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.040
of millions of games for different things

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.040
but billions

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.040
and billions of devices wound up

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.040
with an appropriate

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.040
capable graphics API

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.040
do in no small part

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.040
to me thinking that that was really important

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.040
that we not just

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.040
give up and use Microsoft's

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.040
at that time

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.040
really terrible API.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.040
The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.040
terrible. They were terrible at the start

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.040
but a few versions on

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040
they were actually quite good and there was a completely

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.040
fair argument to be made that

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.040
by the time DX9 was out

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.040
it was probably a better programming environment

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.040
than OpenGL but it was still

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.040
a wonderful good thing

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.040
that we had an open standard that could

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.040
show up on Linux and Android

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.040
and iOS and eventually WebGL

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.040
still to this day so

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.040
that was one

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.040
that would be on my greatest hits list of things

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.040
that I kind of pushed with. The impact it had

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.040
on billions of devices yes

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.040
so let's talk about it

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.040
can you tell the origin story of idsoftware?

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.040
Again

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.040
one of the greatest game developer companies

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.040
ever it created

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.040
Wolfenstein 3D

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.040
games that define

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.040
my life also in many ways

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.040
as a thing that made me realize what computers are capable

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.040
of in terms of graphics

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.040
in terms of performance

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.040
it just unlocked something deep

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.040
in me in understanding

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.040
what these machines are all about as games can do that

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.040
so Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.040
and just all the

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.040
incredible engineering innovation that went into

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.040
that. So how did it all

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.040
start?

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.040
So I'll caveat up front that I usually

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.040
don't consider myself the

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.040
historian of the software side of

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.040
things. I usually do

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.040
kind of point people at John Romero

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.040
for stories about the early days

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.040
where

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.040
I've never been like I've commented that

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.040
I'm a remarkably unsentimental person

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.040
in some ways where I don't really

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.040
spend a lot of time unless I'm explicitly

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.040
prodded to go back and think about the

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.040
early days of things and

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.040
I didn't

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.040
necessarily make the effort to

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.040
archive everything exactly in my brain

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.040
and the more that I work on machine learning

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.040
and AI and the aspects of memory

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.040
and how when you go back and polish certain

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.040
things it's not necessarily exactly

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.040
the way it happened but

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.040
having said all of that from

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.040
my view the way everything happened

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.040
that led up to that was

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.040
after I was

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.040
an adult and kind of taking

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.040
a few college classes deciding to drop

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.040
out I was doing

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.040
hardscrabble contract

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040
programming work really struggling to

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.040
kind of keep groceries and pay my rent

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040
and things and the company

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.040
that I was doing the most work for was

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.040
a company called Softdisk Publishing

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.040
which had the

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.040
Sounds Bizarre Now business model

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.040
of monthly subscription software.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.040
Before there was an internet

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.040
that people could connect to and get software

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.040
you would pay

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.040
a certain amount and every month they would send

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.040
you a disk that had some random software

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.040
on it and people that were into

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040
computers thought this was kind of cool

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.040
and they had different ones for the Apple 2

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040
the 2GS, the PC, the Mac,

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.040
the Amiga

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.040
lots of different things here so quirky little

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.040
business but I was doing a lot

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.040
of contract programming for them where

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.040
I'd write tiny little games and

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.040
sell them for $300, $500

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.040
and one of the things

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.040
that I was doing again

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.040
to keep my head above water here was

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.040
I decided that I could make

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.040
one program and I could

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.040
port it to multiple systems

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040
so I would write a game like

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.040
Dark Designs or Catacombs

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.040
and I would develop it on the Apple 2

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.040
the 2GS and the IBM PC

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.040
which apparently

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.040
was the thing that really kind of

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.040
piqued the attention of the

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.040
people working down there like Jay Wilbur

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.040
was my primary editor and Tom Hall

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040
was a secondary editor

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.040
and they kept asking me it's like hey

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040
you should come down and work for us here

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.040
and I

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.040
pushed it off a couple times because I was

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.040
really enjoying my freedom of kind of being

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040
off on my own even if I was barely

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.040
getting by I loved it I was

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.040
doing nothing but programming all day

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.040
but I did have enough

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040
close scrapes with like damn I'm just

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.040
really out of money that maybe I should

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.040
get an actual job

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.040
rather than contracting these kind of one at

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.040
a time things and Jay Wilbur

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.040
was great he was like fed exing me the checks

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.040
when I would need them to kind of

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.040
get over whatever hump I was at

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.040
so I took the

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.040
I finally took them up on their offer to come

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.040
down to Shreveport Louisiana

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.040
I was in Kansas City at the time

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.040
drove down

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.040
to through the Ozarks and everything

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.040
down to Louisiana

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.040
and saw the soft disk

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040
offices went through talked to a bunch of

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.040
people met the people I had been working

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.040
with remotely at that time

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.040
but the most important thing for me was

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.040
I met two programmers

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.040
there John Romero and Lane Roth

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.040
that for the first time ever I had met

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.040
programmers that knew more

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.040
cool stuff than I did where

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.040
the world was just different back then I

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.040
was in Kansas City it was one of those

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.040
smartest kid in the school does all the

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.040
computer stuff the teachers don't have anything

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.040
to teach him but all I had to learn from

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.040
was these few books at the library

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.040
it was not much at all

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.040
and there were some aspects of programming

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.040
that were kind of black magic to me

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.040
like it's like oh he knows how to format

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.040
a track on I am you know on a

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.040
low-level drive programming

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.040
interface and this was

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.040
I was still not at all

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.040
sure I was going to take the job but I met

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.040
these awesome programmers that

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.040
were doing cool stuff and my Romero had

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.040
worked at Origin Systems and he had done

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040
like you know so many different games

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040
ahead of time

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.040
that I did kind of quickly decide like yeah

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.040
I'll go take the job down there

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.040
and I

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040
settled down there moved in

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.040
and started working on more little projects

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.040
and the first kind of

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040
big change that happened down there

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.040
was the company wanted to make a gaming

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.040
focused a PC gaming focused

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040
subscription just like all their other

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.040
was the same formula that they used for

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.040
everything pay a monthly fee

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.040
and you'll get a disc with

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.040
one or two games just every month

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.040
and no choice in what you get but we think

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.040
it'll be fun and that was the model they

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.040
were comfortable with and said all right

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.040
we're going to start this gamers edge department

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.040
and all of us that were

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.040
interested in that like me Romero

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.040
I Tom Hall was kind of helping

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.040
us from from his side of things

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.040
Jay would peak in and we had a few other

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.040
programmers

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.040
working with us at the time and we were going

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.040
to to just start making games

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.040
just the same model

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040
and we dived in and it was

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.040
fantastic you know you have to make new games

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040
every month every month

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.040
yeah and this

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.040
in retrospect looking back at it

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.040
that sense that I had done all this contract

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.040
programming and John Romero had done

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040
like far more of this where he had done

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.040
one of his teaching himself efforts

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040
was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.040
that sense of like I'm just going to go make

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.040
26 different games give him a different

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.040
theme and you learn

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.040
so much when you go through and you

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040
crank these things out like on a

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.040
bi-weekly monthly basis something like that

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040
start to finish it's not like an

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.040
idea it's not just

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.040
from the very beginning to the very end

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.040
it's done

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:25.040
it has to be done there's no delaying

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.040
it's done and you've got deadlines

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.040
and that kind of

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.040
rapid iteration pressure cooker

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040
environment was super important

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040
for all of us developing the skills

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.040
that I you know that brought us

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040
to where we eventually went to I mean

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.040
people would say like in the history of the Beatles

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.040
like it wasn't them being the Beatles

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.040
it was them playing all of these other

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040
you know early works that that opportunity

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.040
to craft all of their skills before they were

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040
famous that was very

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040
critical to their later successes

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.040
and I think there's a lot of that here

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.040
where we did these games that

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.040
nobody remembers lots

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.040
of little things that contributed

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.040
to building up the skill set for the things that

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.040
eventually did make us famous

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.040
and just to ask you wrote the

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.040
gambler I had to

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.040
write it in a month just

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.040
make money and nobody

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.040
remembers that probably because he had to

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.040
figure out because it's literally

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.040
he didn't have enough

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.040
time to write it fast enough

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.040
to come up with hacks

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040
literally

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.040
pressure and limitation of resources

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.040
is surprisingly

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.040
important and it's

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.040
counterintuitive in a lot of ways where you just think

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.040
that if you've got all the time in the world

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.040
and you've got all the resources in the world

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.040
of course you're going to get something better

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.040
but sometimes it really does work out that

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.040
you know innovations

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040
and other necessity and you know where you can

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.040
resource constraints and you have to do

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.040
things when you don't have a choice

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.040
it's surprising what you can do.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.040
Is there any good games written in that time

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.040
would you say? Some of them are still fun to go back

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.040
and play where you get the

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.040
they were

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.040
all about kind of the more modern term is

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.040
game feel about how just the exact

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.040
feel that things it's not the grand

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.040
strategy of the design but how

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.040
running and jumping and shooting

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.040
those things I feel in the

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.040
in the moment and some of those are still

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.040
if you sat down on them you kind of go

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040
it's a little bit different it doesn't have the same

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.040
movement feel but you move over and you're like

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040
bang jump bang it's like

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.040
hey that's kind of cool still

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.040
so you can get lost in the rhythm of the game

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.040
like is that what you mean by feel

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.040
just like

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.040
there's something about it that pulls you in

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.040
nowadays again people talk about

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.040
compulsion loops and things where it's that

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.040
that sense of exactly

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.040
what you're doing what your fingers are doing on

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.040
the keyboard what your eyes are seeing

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.040
and they're going to be the sequences of things

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.040
grab the loot shoot the monster jump

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.040
over the obstacle get to the end of the level

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.040
these are eternal aspects of game design

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.040
in a lot of ways but

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.040
there are better and worse ways to do all of

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.040
them and we did so many of these

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.040
games that it was I we got

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.040
a lot of practice with it

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.040
so one of the kind of weird things

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.040
that was happening at this time is John

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.040
Romero was getting some

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.040
some strange fan mail and back

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.040
in the days this was before email

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.040
so we literally got letters sometimes

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.040
and telling him it's like oh I want

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.040
to talk to you about your games I want to

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.040
reach out different things

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.040
and I eventually

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.040
turned out that these were all coming from

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040
Scott Miller at Apigee Software

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040
and he was

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040
reaching out through he didn't think he could

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040
contact John directly that he would get

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.040
intercepted so he was trying to get him to

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.040
contact him through like back channel

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.040
fan mail because he basically was

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.040
saying hey I'm making all this money

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.040
on shareware games I want

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.040
you to make shareware games because

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.040
he had seen some of the games that Romero

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.040
had done and

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.040
you know we looked at Scott Miller's

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.040
games and we didn't think they were

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.040
very good I am we're like

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.040
that can't be making the kind of money

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.040
that he's saying he's making ten grand or something

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.040
I am off of this game

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.040
and we really thought that he was full of

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.040
shit that it was a lie trying to get

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.040
I had to get him into this

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.040
but so that was kind of going on at

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.040
I am you know at one level

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.040
he was and it was funny the moment

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.040
when Romero realized that he had some of

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.040
these letters pinned up on his wall like all of his

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.040
fans and then we noticed that they all had the same

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.040
return address with different names on them

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.040
which was a little bit of a two-edged sword

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.040
there trying to

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.040
figure out the puzzle laid out before

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040
him yeah what happened after I kind

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.040
of coincident with that was

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.040
I was working on a lot of the new technologies

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.040
where

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.040
I was now full on the IBM PC

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.040
for the first time where I was really

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.040
a long hold out on Apple II forever

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.040
and I you know I loved my Apple II

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.040
it was the computer I was wished I had when I was

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.040
growing up and when I finally did have one

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.040
I was I was kind of clinging on

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.040
to that well-passed it's sort of good use

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:49.040
by the best computer ever made you would you say

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.040
I wouldn't

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040
make judgments like that about it

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.040
but it was positioned in such a way especially

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.040
in the school systems that it impacted

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.040
a whole lot of American

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.040
programmers at least where

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.040
there was programs that the Apple II's got

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.040
into the schools and they had enough

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.040
capability that lots of interesting things

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.040
happened with them you know in Europe

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.040
it was different you had your Amiga's and

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.040
Atari's and you know I'm

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040
acorns in the UK and things that

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.040
that had different things but in the United States

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.040
it was probably the Apple II made the most

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040
impact for a lot

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.040
of programmers of my generation

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.040
but so I was really digging into

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.040
the IBM and this was

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.040
even more so with the total focus

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.040
because I had moved to another city where I

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.040
didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.040
I had a little apartment

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040
and then at Softisk again the things

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.040
that that drew me to it I had

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.040
a couple programmers that knew more than I

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.040
did and they had a library

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.040
they had a set of books and

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.040
a set of magazines they had a couple years of

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.040
magazines the old Dr. Dobbs Journal

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.040
and all of these magazines that had

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:53.040
information about things

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.040
and so I was just

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.040
in total immersion mode it was

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.040
eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.040
particularly the IBM for

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.040
everything that I was doing

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.040
and I was digging into a lot of these

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.040
low-level hardware details that people

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.040
weren't usually paying attention to

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.040
the way the IBM EGA

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.040
cards worked

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.040
which was fun for me I hadn't had experience

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.040
with things at that level

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.040
and back then you could get

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.040
hardware documentation just down at the register

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.040
levels this is where the CRTC

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.040
register is this is how the color

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.040
registers work and how the different things

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.040
are applied and they were designed for

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.040
a certain reason they were designed

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.040
for an application they were had an intended

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.040
use in mind but I was

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.040
starting to look at other ways

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040
that they could perhaps be exploited that they weren't

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.040
initially intended for.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.040
Could you comment on like first of all

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.040
what operating system was there what what

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.040
instructions that was like what

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.040
what are the what are we talking about?

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.040
DOS and x86 so 16-bit

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.040
8086 the two

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.040
86's were there and three 86's

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.040
existed they were rare

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.040
we had a couple for our development systems

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.040
but we were still targeting

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.040
the more broad I

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.040
it was all DOS 16-bit

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.040
none of this was kind of DOS extenders

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.040
and things. How different is it from the systems

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.040
of today's it's kind of the precursor

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.040
that's similar? Very little

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.040
if you open up command.exe

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.040
on or com on

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.040
windows you see some of the remnants

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.040
of all of that but it was a different world

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040
it was the 640k is enough

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.040
world and nothing was protected

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.040
it crashed all the time you had

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.040
TSR's or terminate and stay

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.040
resident hacks on top of things

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.040
that would cause configuration problems

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.040
all the hardware was manually

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.040
configured in your auto-exec

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040
so it was a very different world

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.040
but the code is still the same similar

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.040
you would still write it my earliest

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.040
code there was written in Pascal that was

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.040
what I had learned

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.040
between basic

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.040
and C++ there was Pascal

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.040
when basic assembly language

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.040
some of my intermediate

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.040
stuff was well you had to for performance

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040
basic was just too slow

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.040
most of the work that I was doing as a contract

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.040
programmer in my teenage years

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.040
was assembly language

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:07.040
you wrote games in assembly?

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.040
yeah complete games

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.040
in assembly language

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.040
and it's thousands and thousands of lines

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.040
every letter acronyms for the

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.040
instructions

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.040
you don't earn the once again

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.040
greatest programmer ever labeled

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.040
without being able to write a game in assembly

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.040
but that's again everybody wrote there

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.040
everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.040
it was kind of a

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.040
everybody serious

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.040
it was an outlier to use Pascal

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.040
a little bit where there was one famous

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.040
program called wizardry

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.040
it was one of the great early role playing games

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.040
that was written in Pascal

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.040
but it was almost nothing

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.040
used Pascal there but I did learn Pascal

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.040
and I remember doing all of my

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040
like to this day I sketch in data structures

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.040
when I'm thinking about something

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.040
I'll open up a file

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040
and I'll start writing struct definitions

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.040
for how data is going to be laid out

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.040
and Pascal was kind of formative to that

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.040
because I remember designing my RPGs

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.040
in Pascal record structures

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.040
and things like that

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.040
and so I had gotten a Pascal compiler

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.040
for the Apple 2GS that I could work on

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.040
the first IBM game that I developed

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.040
I did in Pascal

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.040
and that's actually kind of an interesting story

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.040
again talking about the constraints

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.040
and resources where

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.040
I had an Apple 2GS I didn't have an IBM PC

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.040
I wanted to port my

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.040
applications to IBM

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.040
because I thought I could make more money on it

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.040
so what I wound up doing

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.040
is I rented a PC for a week

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.040
and bought a copy of

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.040
Turbo Pascal and so I had

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.040
a hard one week and this was cutting into

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.040
a minimal profit margin I had there

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.040
but I had this computer for a week

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.040
I had to get my program ported

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.040
before I had to return the PC

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040
and that was kind of the first thing

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.040
that I had done on the IBM PC

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.040
and what led me to taking the job at Softisk

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.040
and Turbo Pascal

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040
how's that different from regular Pascal

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.040
is it different compiler or something like that

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.040
so it was a product of Borland

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.040
which before Microsoft kind of killed them

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.040
they were the hot stuff

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.040
developer tools company

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.040
Turbo Pascal and Turbo C

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.040
and Turbo Prologue I mean all the different things

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.040
but what they did was

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.040
they took a supremely pragmatic approach

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.040
of making something useful it was

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:17.040
one of these great examples where

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.040
Pascal was an academic language

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.040
and you had things like the UCSDP

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.040
system that Wizardry was actually

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.040
written in that they did

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.040
they did manage to make a game with that

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.040
but it was

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.040
not a super practical system

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.040
while Turbo Pascal was

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040
called Turbo because it was blazingly fast

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.040
to compile I mean really

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.040
ridiculously 10 to 20 times

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.040
faster than most other compilers at the

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.040
time but it also had very

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.040
pragmatic access to look you can just

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.040
poke at the hardware in these different ways

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.040
and we have libraries that let you do things

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.040
and it was a pretty good

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.040
it was a perfectly good way to write games

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.040
and this is one of those things where people have talked

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.040
about different paths that computer

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.040
development could have taken

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040
where C took over the world

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.040
reasons that came out of UNIX

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.040
and eventually Linux

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.040
and that was not a foregone conclusion at all

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.040
and people can make

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.040
real reasoned rational arguments

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.040
that the world might have been better

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.040
if it had gone a Pascal route

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.040
I'm somewhat agnostic on that

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.040
where I do know from experience

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040
it was perfectly good enough to do

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.040
that and it had some fundamental

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.040
improvements like it had range checked

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.040
arrays as an option there which could

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.040
avoid many of C's

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040
as well as some kind of

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040
experimental hazards that happened in a security

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.040
space but C1

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.040
they were basically operating at about the same

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.040
level of abstraction it was

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.040
a systems programming language

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.040
but you said Pascal had more

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.040
emphasis on data structures

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.040
actually

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.040
in the tree of languages did Pascal

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.040
come before C

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.040
they were pretty contemporaneous

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.040
so Pascal's lineage went to

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.040
Modula 2 and eventually Oberon

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.040
of experimental language

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.040
but they were all good enough at that level

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.040
now some of the classic

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.040
academic oriented Pascal's were just missing

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.040
fundamental things like oh you can't access

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040
this core system thing because we're just using

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.040
it to teach students but

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.040
Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.040
to it really did make it

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.040
a completely capable language

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.040
and it had some reasons why

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.040
you could implement it as a single pass compiler

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.040
so it could be way way faster although

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.040
less scope for optimizations if you do it

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.040
that way and it did have

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.040
some range checking options it had a little bit

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040
better typing capability

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.040
properly typed enum sorts of things

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.040
and other stuff that C lacked

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.040
but you know C was also clearly

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.040
good enough and it wound up with a huge

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040
inertia from the Unix ecosystem

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040
and Pascal didn't have garbage collection

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.040
no it was not garbage

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.040
collected the same kind of thing the same manual

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.040
so you could still have your use after freeze

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.040
and all those other problems but

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.040
just getting rid of array overruns

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.040
at least if you were compiled with that

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.040
debugging option certainly would have avoided

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.040
a lot of problems and could have a lot

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.040
of benefits but so anyways that was the next

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.040
thing I had to learn C because C

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.040
was where it seemed like most

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.040
of the things were going

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.040
so I abandoned Pascal and I started working

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.040
in C I started hacking on these hardware

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040
things dealing with

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040
the graphics controllers and the EGA

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.040
systems and what we

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.040
most wanted to do so at that time

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040
we had

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.040
sitting in our darkened office playing

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.040
all the different console video games

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040
we were figuring out what do we want to

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040
what games do we want to make for our

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.040
gamers edge product there

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.040
and so we had one of the first

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.040
Super Nintendo's sitting there and we had

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.040
an older Nintendo looking at all those

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040
games and the core thing that those

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.040
consoles did that you just didn't get on

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.040
the PC games was this ability

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.040
to have a massive scrolling world

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040
where most of the games that you would make

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040
on the PC and earlier

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.040
personal computers would be a static

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.040
screen you move little things around on

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.040
it and you interact like that maybe

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.040
you go to additional screens as

01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.040
you move but arcade

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040
games and consoles had this

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.040
wonderful ability to just have a big

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.040
world that you're slowly moving your

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.040
window through and that was

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.040
for those types of games the kind of

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.040
action exploration adventure games that

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.040
was a super super important thing

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.040
and PC games just didn't do

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.040
that and what I

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040
had come across was a couple different

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.040
techniques for implementing

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.040
that on the PC and they're not

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.040
hard complicated things

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.040
when I explain them now they're

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040
they're pretty straightforward but just nobody was doing

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.040
you sound like Einstein describing his

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.040
five papers is pretty straightforward

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.040
I understand but they're

01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.040
nevertheless revolutions so side-scrolling

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.040
is a game-changer

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.040
it's a genius invention

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.040
and some of the consoles had different

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040
limitations about you could do one but not the

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.040
other and I and there were similar things

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.040
going on as advancements even in the console

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.040
space where you'd have like the original

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.040
Mario game was

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.040
like just horizontal scrolling and then later

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.040
Mario games added vertical aspects to

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.040
it different things that

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.040
you were doing to explore

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.040
you know kind of expand the capabilities there

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.040
and so much of the early game design for

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.040
decades was removing limitations

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.040
letting you do things that you envisioned

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.040
as a designer you wanted the player to

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.040
experience but the hardware just

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.040
couldn't really or you didn't know how

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.040
to make it happen it felt

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.040
impossible you can imagine

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.040
that you want to create like this

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.040
big world through which you can

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.040
side-scroll like through which you can

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.040
walk and then

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.040
you ask yourself a question how do I

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.040
actually build that in a way that's

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.040
like the the latency

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.040
is low enough the

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.040
hardware can actually deliver that

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.040
in such a way there's a compelling

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.040
yeah and we knew what we wanted to do because

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.040
we were playing all of these console games playing

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.040
all these Nintendo games and arcade games

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.040
clearly there is a whole world of awesome

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.040
things there that we just couldn't do on the

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.040
PC at least initially

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.040
because every programmer can tell it's

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.040
like if you want to scroll you can just redraw the whole

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.040
screen but then it turns out well you're going

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.040
five frames per second I view that's

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.040
not an interactive fun experience

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.040
you want to be going 30 or 60

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.040
frames per second or something and

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.040
it just didn't feel like that was possible it

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.040
felt like the PCs had to get five

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040
times faster for you to make a playable

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040
game there and

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040
interestingly I wound up with two

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040
completely different solutions

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.040
for the scrolling problem

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040
and this is

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.040
this is a theme that runs through everything

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.040
where all of these big technical advancements

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.040
it turns out there's always a couple different

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.040
ways of doing them and it's not

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.040
like you found the one true way

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.040
of doing it and we'll see this as we

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.040
go into 3d games and things later

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.040
but so the scrolling

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.040
the first set of scrolling tricks that I got

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.040
was

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.040
the hardware had this ability

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.040
to you could shift

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.040
like inside the window of memory

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.040
so the EGA cards at the time

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.040
had 256 kilobytes

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.040
of memory and it was

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.040
awkwardly set up in this planer

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.040
format where instead of

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.040
having 256 or

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.040
24 million colors

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.040
you had 16 colors which is 4 bits

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.040
so you had 4 bit planes

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.040
64k a piece of course

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.040
64k is a nice round number

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.040
for 16 bit addressing

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.040
so your graphics card had

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.040
a 16 bit window that you could

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.040
look at and you could tell it to start

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.040
the video scan out anywhere inside there

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.040
so there were a couple games

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.040
that had taken this approach if you could make

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.040
a 2x2 screen or a 1x4 screen

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.040
and you could do scrolling really

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.040
easily like that you could just lay it

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040
all out and just pan around there

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.040
but you just couldn't make it any bigger

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.040
because that's all the memory that was there

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:37.040
the first insight to the scrolling

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:39.040
that I had was well

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.040
if we make a screen that's just

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.040
one tile larger you know

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.040
we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.040
by 16 pixels the little classic

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.040
Mario block that you run into

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.040
lots of art gets drawn that way

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040
and your screen is a certain number of tiles

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.040
but if you had one little buffer region

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.040
outside of that

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.040
you could easily pan around inside that

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.040
16 pixel region that could be perfectly

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.040
smooth but then what happens

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.040
if you get to the edge and you want to keep going

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.040
the first way we did

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:09.040
scrolling was what I called

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.040
adaptive tile refresh

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.040
which was really just a matter of

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040
you get to the edge and then

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.040
you go back to the original point and then

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.040
only change the tiles that have actually

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.040
that are different between where it

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040
was in most of the games at the time

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.040
if you think about sort of your

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.040
classic Super Mario Brothers game

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.040
you've got big fields of blue sky

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.040
long rows of

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.040
the same brick texture

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.040
and there's a lot of commonality

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.040
it's kind of like a data compression thing

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.040
if you take the screen and you set it down

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.040
on top of each other in general

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.040
only about 10% of the tiles

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.040
were actually different there

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.040
so this was a way to

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.040
go ahead and say well I'm going to move it back

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.040
and then I'm only going to change those

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.040
10, 20 whatever percent

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.040
tiles there and that meant

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.040
that it was essentially five times

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.040
faster than if you were redrawing all of the

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.040
tiles and that worked well enough

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.040
for us to do a bunch of these games

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.040
for Gamers Edge

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.040
we had a lot of these scrolling games like

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.040
Slurnax and Shadow Knights and things like

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.040
that that we were cranking out at this high

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.040
rate that had this scrolling effect on it

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.040
and it worked well enough there were

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.040
design challenges there where

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.040
if you made the worst case, if you made a

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.040
checkerboard over the entire screen

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.040
you scroll over one and every single tile

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.040
changes and your frame rates now five frames

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.040
and because it had to redraw everything

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.040
so the designers had a little bit that they

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040
had to worry about they had to make these

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.040
relatively plain looking levels

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.040
but it was still pretty magical

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.040
it was something that we hadn't seen before

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.040
and

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.040
the first thing that we wound up doing

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.040
with that was I had just gotten this

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.040
working and Tom Hall was

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.040
sitting there with me and

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.040
we were looking over at our Super Nintendo

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.040
on the side there with Super Mario 3

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.040
running and we had

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.040
the technology, we had the tools

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040
set up there and we stayed up

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.040
all night and we basically cloned

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.040
the first level of Super Mario Brothers

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.040
Performance wise as well? Yeah

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.040
and so it and we had our little character running

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.040
and jumping in there it wasn't

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.040
it was close to pixel accurate as far as

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.040
all the backgrounds and everything

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.040
but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.040
together from previous games that I had

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.040
written I just kind of like really kit bash

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.040
the whole thing together to make this demo

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.040
and that was one of the rare cases

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:23.040
when I said I don't usually do these

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.040
all night programming things

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.040
there's probably only two memorable ones

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:29.040
that I can think about you know one was

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.040
the all nighter to go ahead and get

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:33.040
to get our dangerous Dave

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.040
in copyright infringement is how we titled it

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.040
because we had a game called dangerous Dave

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.040
was you know running around with the shotgun shooting

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.040
things and we were

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.040
just taking our most beloved game at the time

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.040
there the Super Mario 3

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.040
and sort of sticking Dave inside that with

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.040
this new scrolling technology that was

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.040
going perfectly smooth for

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.040
I am you know for them

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.040
as it ran and Tom

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.040
and I just kind of blurrily the next morning

01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.040
you know kind of left and we left a disc

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.040
on I you know on the desk

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.040
for John Romero and J Wilbur

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.040
to see and just said run this

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.040
and we eventually made it back in

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.040
later in the day and it

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.040
was you know like they grabbed us

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.040
and pulled us in you know pulled us into the room

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.040
and that was the point where they were

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.040
like we got to do something with this

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.040
you know we're going to make a company

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.040
we're going to go make our own games

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.040
where this was something that

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.040
we were able to just kind of hit them

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.040
with a hammer of an experience like wow

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.040
this is just like so much cooler than

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.040
what we thought was possible there

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.040
and initially we tried to

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:35.040
get Nintendo to let us make

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.040
Super Mario 3 on the PC

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.040
that's really what we wanted to do we're like hey

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.040
we can finish this it's line of sight

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.040
for this will be great and

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.040
we sent something to Nintendo

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.040
and we heard that it did get looked at

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040
in Japan and they just

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.040
weren't interested in that

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.040
but that's another one of those life could have gone

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.040
a very different way where we could have been

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.040
like Nintendo's house PC team

01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.040
you know at that point

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.040
and to find the direction of

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.040
you know

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.040
Wolfenstein and

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.040
Doom and Quake

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.040
could have been a Nintendo creation

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.040
yeah so at the same time

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.040
that we were just doing our first scrolling

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.040
demos

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.040
we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.040
and said it's like hey we do want to

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.040
make some games you know these things that you

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.040
think you want those are those are nothing

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.040
what do you see what we can actually do now

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.040
this is going to be amazing and

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.040
he just like popped right up and sent a check

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.040
to us where we at that point

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040
we still thought he might be a fraud that

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.040
he was just lying about all of this but he

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.040
was totally correct on how much money

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.040
he was making with his shareware titles

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.040
and this was his

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.040
kind of real brainstorm about this

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.040
where shareware was this idea that

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.040
software doesn't have a fixed price

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:49.040
if you use it you send out of the goodness

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.040
of your heart some money to the creator

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.040
and there were a couple utilities

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.040
that did make some significant success

01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040
like that but for the most part

01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.040
it didn't really work you know there wasn't

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.040
much software in a pure shareware

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.040
model that that was successful

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.040
the Apogee innovation

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.040
was to

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.040
take something call it shareware split

01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.040
it into three pieces you always made a

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:13.040
trilogy and you would put

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.040
the first piece out but then you buy

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.040
the whole trilogy for some

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:19.040
shareware amount which in reality

01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.040
it meant that the first part was a demo

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.040
where you kind of like the demo went

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.040
everywhere for free and you paid money to

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.040
to get the whole set but

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.040
it was still played as shareware and we were

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.040
happy to have the first one go everywhere

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.040
and it wasn't a crippled demo where the

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.040
first episode of all these trilogies it

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.040
was a real complete game and probably

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.040
20 times as many people played

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.040
that part of it thought they had a great game

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.040
had found memories of

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.040
it but never paid us a dime

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.040
but enough people were

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.040
happy with that where

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.040
it was really quite successful at these

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040
early games that we didn't think very much

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.040
of compared to commercial quality

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:57.040
games but they were doing really good

01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.040
business some fairly crude things

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.040
and people it was good

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.040
business people enjoyed it and

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.040
it wasn't like you were taking a crap shoot on what

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.040
you were getting you just played a third of the

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.040
experience and you loved it enough

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.040
to hand write out a check

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.040
and put it in an envelope and address it

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.040
and send it out to Apigee

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.040
to get the rest of them so

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.040
it was a really pretty feel good

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.040
business prospect there because

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.040
everybody was happy

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.040
they knew what they were getting

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.040
when they send it in and they would send in fan mail

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:29.040
if you're going to the trouble of addressing

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:31.040
a letter and I am filling out

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:33.040
an envelope you write something in it and

01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:35.040
there were just the literal bags of fan mail

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:37.040
for the shareware

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.040
games so people loved them

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.040
I should mention that for you

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.040
the definition of wealth is being

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.040
able to have

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.040
pizza whenever you want

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.040
for me there was a dream

01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.040
because I would play shareware games over

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.040
and over the part that's free

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.040
over and over and it was very

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.040
deeply fulfilling experience but

01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.040
I dreamed of a time when I

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.040
could actually afford

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.040
the full experience and this is kind of this

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.040
dream land beyond

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.040
the horizon

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.040
you could find out what else is there

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.040
in some sense

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:13.040
even just playing the shareware

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.040
was

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.040
the limitation of that

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.040
you know life is

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.040
limited eventually we all

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.040
die in that way shareware was like

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.040
somehow really fulfilling

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.040
to have this kind of mysterious thing

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.040
beyond what's free

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.040
always there it's kind of

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.040
I don't know that maybe

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.040
it's because a part of my childhood is playing

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:39.040
shareware games that was a really fulfilling

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.040
experience it's so interesting how that model

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.040
still brought joy

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.040
to so many people the 20x

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.040
people that played it I felt very good about

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.040
that I would run into people

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.040
that would say oh I loved that game

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.040
that you had early on Commander Keen

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.040
whatever and

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.040
they meant just the first episode

01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.040
that they got to see everywhere

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.040
the crap out of Commander Keen

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.040
and that was all good

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.040
but so we were

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.040
in this position where Scott Miller was

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.040
just fronting us cash and saying yeah make

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.040
you know make a game but

01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.040
we did not properly

01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.040
pull the trigger and say alright we're going to

01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.040
we're quitting our jobs we were like we're gonna

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.040
do both we're gonna keep working

01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.040
at soft disk working on this

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:23.040
and then we're going to go ahead

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.040
and make a new game for

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.040
Apogee at the same time

01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.040
and this eventually did lead to some legal

01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.040
problems and we had trouble

01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:33.040
it all got worked out in the end

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.040
but it was not a good call at the time

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.040
there and your legal mind at the time

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.040
was not stellar

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.040
you were not thinking

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:43.040
in terms of the illegal term no

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.040
I definitely wasn't none of us were

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.040
and in hindsight

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.040
yeah it's like how did we think we were going to get away

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:51.040
with like even using our work computers

01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.040
to write software for

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.040
you know our breakaway

01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.040
new company

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.040
it was not a good plan

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.040
how did Commander Keane come to be

01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.040
so the design process

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:05.040
we would start from we had some idea

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.040
what we wanted to do we wanted to do a

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:09.040
Mario like game it was going to be a

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.040
side scroller it was going to use the

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.040
technology we had some

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.040
sense of what it would have to look like because of the limitations

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.040
of this adaptive tile refresh

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.040
technology it had to have

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.040
fields of relatively constant tiles

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.040
you couldn't just paint up a background

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.040
and then move that around

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.040
the early design

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:29.040
or all the design for Commander Keane really came

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.040
from Tom Hall where

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040
he was

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.040
kind of the main creative mind

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.040
for the early in software stuff

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.040
where we had an interesting division of things

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:41.040
where Tom was

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:43.040
all creative in design I was

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:45.040
all programming John Romero was an interesting bridge

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.040
where he was both a very good

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.040
programmer and also a very good designer

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.040
and artist and kind of straddled

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.040
between the areas but Commander

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.040
Keane was very much Tom Hall's baby

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.040
and he came up

01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.040
with all the design and backstory

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.040
for the different things of kind of a

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.040
mad scientist little kid with

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.040
I am you know

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:07.040
building a rocket ship and a zap gun

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.040
and visiting alien worlds

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.040
and doing all this that the background

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.040
that we lay the game inside of

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.040
and there's not a whole lot

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.040
to any of these things you know design

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.040
for us was always just what we needed

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:21.040
to do to make the game that was going

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.040
to be so much fun to play

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.040
and we made our we laid out

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:27.040
our first trilogy of games you know the

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.040
shareware formula it's going to be three

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.040
pieces we make Commander Keane one two

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:33.040
and three and we just really

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.040
started

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.040
busting on all that work and it went together

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.040
really quickly it was like three months or

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.040
something that while we were still making

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.040
games every month for

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.040
for Gamers Edge we were sharing technology

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.040
between that I'd write a bunch of code for this

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:49.040
and we just kind of use it for both

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.040
again not a particularly good idea there

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.040
that had consequences for us

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.040
but in three months

01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:57.040
we got our first our first game

01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.040
out and all of a sudden it was

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.040
three times as successful as

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.040
the most successful thing Apogee had had before

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.040
and we were making like thirty thousand dollars

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.040
a month immediately

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:09.040
from the Commander Keane stuff

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:11.040
and that was again

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.040
a surprise to us it was more than we thought

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:15.040
that was going to that was going to make

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.040
and we said well we're going to

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.040
certainly roll into another set of titles

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.040
from this and in that three months

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.040
I had come up with a much better way

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.040
of doing the scrolling technology that

01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.040
was not the adaptive tile refresh

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.040
which in some ways was even simpler

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.040
and these things

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.040
so many of the great ideas of technology

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.040
are things that are back at the envelope

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040
designs I make this comment

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.040
about modern machine learning where

01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:41.040
all the things that are really important practically

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.040
in the last decade are each of them

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:45.040
fits on the back of an envelope there are these

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.040
simple little things they're not

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.040
super dense hard to understand

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:51.040
technologies

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:53.040
and so the the second scrolling

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.040
trick was just a matter of like

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:57.040
okay we know we've got this 64k

01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:59.040
window and

01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.040
the question was always like well you could make

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:03.040
a two by two but you can't go

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:05.040
off the edge

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.040
but I finally asked well what actually

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:09.040
happens if you just go off the

01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:11.040
edge if you take your start

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.040
and you say it's like okay

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:15.040
I can move over I'm scrolling I can move over

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.040
I can move down I'm scrolling

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:19.040
I get to what should be the bottom of the memory

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.040
window like well what if I just

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.040
keep going and I say I'm going to start

01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.040
at you know what happens if I start

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.040
at FFFE at the very

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.040
end of the 64k block

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.040
and it turns out it just

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.040
wraps back around to the top of the block

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.040
and I'm like oh well this makes

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.040
everything easy you can just scroll the

01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:39.040
screen everywhere and all you have to draw is just

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:41.040
one new line of tiles which everything

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:43.040
you expose it might be

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.040
unaligned off various parts of

01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:47.040
the of the screen memory

01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:49.040
but it just works that no longer had

01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:51.040
the problem of you had to have fields of

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.040
the similar colors because

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:55.040
it doesn't matter what you're doing you could be having

01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.040
a completely unique world

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.040
and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.040
on but it might be like you said

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.040
unaligned so it can be all over

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.040
the place and it turns out it doesn't matter

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.040
I would have two page flipped screens as long

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:09.040
as they didn't overlap they moved in series

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.040
through this two-dimensional

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.040
window of graphics

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:15.040
and that was one of those like well this is

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.040
so simple this just

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:19.040
this just works it's faster

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.040
there it seemed like there was no downside

01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.040
funny thing was

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.040
it turned out after we shipped

01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.040
titles with this there were

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.040
what they called super VGA

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.040
cards the cards that would allow higher

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.040
resolutions and

01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.040
different features that the standard ones didn't

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:37.040
and on some of those

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.040
cards this was a weird

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.040
compatibility quirk again because nobody

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.040
thought this was not what it was designed to do

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.040
and some of those cards had more

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.040
memory they had more than just

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.040
256k in four planes they

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.040
had 512k or a megabyte

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.040
and on some of those cards

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.040
I scroll my window

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.040
down and then it goes into uninitialized

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:59.040
memory that actually exists there

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.040
rather than wrapping back around at the top

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.040
and

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.040
then I was in the tough position of do I have to track

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:07.040
every single one of these and it was a mad

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:09.040
house back then with there were

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:11.040
20 different video card vendors

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.040
with all slightly different implementations

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.040
of their non-standard functionality

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.040
so either I needed to natively

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:19.040
program all of the

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.040
the VGA cards there to

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:23.040
map in that memory and keep

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:25.040
scrolling down through all of that

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.040
or I kind of punted and took the easy

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:29.040
solution of when you finally did run

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:31.040
the edge of the screen I accepted

02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:33.040
a hitch and just copied the whole screen up

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.040
there so on some of those

02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:37.040
those cards it was

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.040
a compatibility mode in the normal

02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:41.040
ones when it all worked fine everything was just

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:43.040
beautifully smooth but if you had one of those

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:45.040
cards where it did not wrap

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.040
the way I wanted it to you'd be

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:49.040
scrolling around scrolling around and

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:51.040
then eventually you'd have a little hitch where

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.040
200 milliseconds or something

02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.040
that was not super smooth as it

02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:57.040
froze a little bit and this was the binary

02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:59.040
thing is it one of the standard

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.040
screens or is it one of the weird ones

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:03.040
the super VGA ones yeah okay

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.040
and so we would default to and I think

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:07.040
that was one of those that changed over

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.040
the kind of course of deployment

02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:11.040
where early on we would have a normal mode

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.040
and then you would have you would enable the compatibility

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:15.040
flag if your screen did this crazy

02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:17.040
flickery thing when you got to a certain

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.040
point in the game and then

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:21.040
later I think it probably got enabled by

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.040
default as just more and more of the cards

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:25.040
I kind of did not do exactly

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.040
the right thing and that's the two-edged

02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:29.040
sword of doing unconventional

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.040
things with technology where

02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:33.040
you can find something that nobody thought about

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:35.040
doing that kind of scrolling trick when they set

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.040
up those cards but the

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:39.040
fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.040
when I was relying on that then

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.040
I wound up being broken on some of the later

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.040
cards let me take a bit

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.040
of a tangent but

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.040
ask about the hacker

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:51.040
ethic because you mentioned share

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.040
where it says it's an interesting world

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:55.040
the world of

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:57.040
people that make money

02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.040
business and the people

02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.040
that build systems the engineers

02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.040
and

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.040
what is the

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.040
hacker ethic you've been a man

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.040
of the people and you've

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.040
embodied at least the part of that

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.040
ethic what does it mean

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.040
what did it mean to you at the time what does it mean

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.040
to you today so Stephen Levy's

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.040
book Hackers was a really

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.040
formative book for me as a teenager

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.040
I mean I read it several times

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.040
and there was all

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.040
of the great lore of the early

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.040
MIT era of hackers

02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.040
ending up at the end with

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:33.040
it kind of went through the early

02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:35.040
MIT hackers and the Silicon Valley

02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.040
hardware hackers and then

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.040
the game hackers in part 3

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:41.040
and at that time as a teenager

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.040
I really

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.040
was kind of bitter in some ways like I

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.040
thought I was born too late I thought I missed

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.040
the window there

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.040
and I really thought I belonged

02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:53.040
in that third section of that book with the

02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:55.040
game hackers and they were talking about

02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:57.040
the Williams at Sierra

02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:59.040
and Origin Systems with Richard Garriott

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.040
and it's like I

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.040
really wanted to be there and

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.040
I knew that was now a few years

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:07.040
in the past it was

02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.040
it was not to be

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.040
but the early days especially

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:13.040
the early MIT hacker days talking

02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:15.040
a lot about this sense of

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:17.040
the hacker ethic that there was this sense

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.040
that it was about

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.040
sharing information being good

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:23.040
not keeping it to yourself

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:25.040
and that it's not a zero sum game

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:27.040
that you can share something

02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:29.040
with another programmer and it doesn't

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:31.040
take it away from you

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.040
you then have somebody else doing something

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:35.040
and I also think that there's

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.040
an aspect of it where it's this

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.040
ability to take

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.040
joy in other people's accomplishments

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.040
where it's not the cutthroat bit of

02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:45.040
I have to be first I have to be

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:47.040
recognized as the one that did

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.040
this in some way but

02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:51.040
being able to see somebody else

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.040
do something and say holy shit that's amazing

02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:55.040
you know and just taking joy

02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:57.040
in the ability of something amazing

02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:59.040
that somebody else does

02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:01.040
and the

02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:03.040
big thing that I was able to do

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:05.040
through in software was

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:07.040
this ability to eventually release the source code

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.040
for most of our like all of our

02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:11.040
really seminal game titles

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.040
and that was a stepping stone

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.040
process where we were kind

02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.040
of surprised early on where

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.040
people were able to

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.040
hack the existing games and of course I had

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.040
experience with that I remember hacking my copies

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.040
of Ultima so I give myself

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:27.040
9999 gold and raise my levels

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:29.040
and you know break out the sector editor

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.040
and so I was familiar with all of that

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.040
so it was just it was with a smile

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:35.040
when I started to see people doing that to our

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.040
games I am you know making

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.040
level editors for Commander Keen

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:41.040
or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:43.040
but I made the pitch

02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:45.040
internally that

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:47.040
we should actually release our own

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.040
tools for like what we did

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:51.040
what we used to create the games

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.040
and that was you know that was

02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.040
a little bit debatable about

02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:57.040
well you know we'll this let other

02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:59.040
we'll give people a leg up it's always like

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.040
what's that going to mean for the competition

02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.040
but the really hard

02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.040
pitch was to actually release

02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:07.040
the full source code for the games

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.040
and it was a balancing act with

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:11.040
the other people inside the company

02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:13.040
where it's interesting

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:15.040
how the programmers

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.040
generally did get

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:19.040
certainly I am the people

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:21.040
that I worked closely with they did kind

02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.040
of get that hacker ethic bit where

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:25.040
you wanted to share your code you were

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.040
you were proud of it you wanted other people to take it

02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:29.040
do cool things with it

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.040
but interestingly

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.040
the broader game

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:35.040
industry is a little more

02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:37.040
hesitant to embrace that than

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.040
like the group of people that we happen to have

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.040
at id software where it was

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.040
always a little interesting to me seeing how

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:45.040
a lot of people in the game modding

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:47.040
community were very possessive

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.040
of their code they did not want to share their

02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:51.040
code they wanted it to be theirs it was

02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:53.040
their you know claim to fame and

02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.040
that was much more like what we

02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:57.040
tended to see with artists where

02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:59.040
you know the artists understand something about

02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.040
credit and I you know wanting it to be

02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:03.040
known as their work and a lot of

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:05.040
the game programmers

02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.040
felt a little bit more like artists

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.040
than like hacker programmers in that

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.040
it was about building something

02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:13.040
that maybe felt more like art to them

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:15.040
than the more tool based

02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:17.040
and exploration based kind

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.040
of hacking culture side of things

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.040
yes so it's so interesting that this

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.040
kind of

02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:25.040
fear that credit will not

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:27.040
be sufficiently attributed to you

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:29.040
and that's one of the things that I

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.040
do bump into a lot because

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.040
I try not

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.040
to go clean I mean it's easy for me

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.040
to say because so much credit is heaped on

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:39.040
me for the the software side of

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.040
things but when people come up and

02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.040
they want to pick a fight and say no it's

02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:45.040
like that wasn't where first person gaming

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:47.040
came from and you can point to

02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:49.040
you know you can point to some of like things

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:51.040
on obscure titles that I was never aware

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.040
of or like the old play-doh systems

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:55.040
or you know each personal computer

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:57.040
had something that was 3d-ish

02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:59.040
and moving around and I'm

02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.040
you know and I'm happy to say it's like no

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.040
I mean I saw battle zone and star wars

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.040
in the arcades I had seen 3D graphics

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:07.040
I had seen all these things there

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.040
standing on the shoulders of lots of other people

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:11.040
but sometimes these examples they pull out

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.040
like I didn't know that existed I mean

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.040
there I had never heard of that before

02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:17.040
then that didn't contribute to

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.040
what I made but there's plenty of stuff

02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:21.040
that did and you know I

02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.040
I think there's good cases to be made

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:25.040
that obviously doom

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:27.040
and quake and Wolfenstein were formative

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:29.040
examples for what

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.040
everything that came after

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:33.040
that but I don't

02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:35.040
feel the need to go fight and say

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:37.040
claim primacy or initial

02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:39.040
invention of anything like that

02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.040
but a lot of people do want to

02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:43.040
I think when you fight for the credit in that way

02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:45.040
and it does go against the hacker ethic

02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.040
you destroy

02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.040
something fundamental about the culture

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:51.040
about the community that builds cool stuff

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.040
I think credit ultimately

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:57.040
so I had this

02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.040
sort of

02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:01.040
there's a famous wrestler and freestyle

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.040
wrestler called

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.040
and he always

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.040
preached that you should just

02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.040
focus on the art of the wrestling

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.040
and let people

02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.040
write your

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.040
story however they want

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.040
the

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:19.040
the highest form of the art is just

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:21.040
focusing on the art and that's something

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:23.040
that is something about the

02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:25.040
hacker ethic is just

02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:27.040
on building cool stuff

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.040
sharing it with other cool people

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:31.040
and credit will get

02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:33.040
assigned correctly

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:37.040
in the long arc of history

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:39.040
and I generally think that's true

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.040
and you've got

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.040
there's some things

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:45.040
there's a graphics technique that got labeled

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:47.040
car max reverse

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:49.040
literally named it and it turned out

02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:51.040
that I wasn't the first person to

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:53.040
figure that out like most scientific

02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:55.040
things or mathematical things you wind up like

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:57.040
oh this other person had actually done that

02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.040
somewhat before and then

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:01.040
there's things that get attributed to me like the inverse

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.040
square root hack that I actually didn't

02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:05.040
do I flat out that wasn't me and it's

02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:07.040
like it's weird how the memetic power

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:09.040
of the internet I cannot

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:11.040
you're like the marked point of programming

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.040
yes it's just everything just gets attributed

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:15.040
to you now even though you've never

02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.040
sought that the credit of things

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:19.040
I mean but

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.040
part of the fact that the humility behind

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:23.040
that is what attracts the

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.040
attributions

02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:27.040
let's talk about a game

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.040
you mean one of the greatest games

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.040
ever made I know you could talk about doing quake

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:33.040
and so on but to me Wolfenstein 3D

02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:35.040
was like wow

02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.040
it blew my mind

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:39.040
that a world like this could exist so

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:41.040
how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:43.040
in terms of the programming

02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:45.040
in terms of the design in terms of some

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.040
of the memorable technical challenges

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:49.040
and also

02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:51.040
actually just something you haven't mentioned

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:53.040
you know

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.040
how did these ideas

02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:57.040
come to be

02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:59.040
inside your mind the adaptive

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:01.040
side-scrolling

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.040
the solutions to these technical challenges

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:05.040
so I usually can

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:07.040
introspectively pull back

02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.040
pretty detailed

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.040
accounts of how technology

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:13.040
solutions and design choices on my

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.040
part came to be where

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:17.040
technically we had done two games

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.040
3D games like that before

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.040
where hover tank was the first one which

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:23.040
had flat shaded walls

02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:25.040
but did have the scaled enemies inside it

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.040
and then catacombs 3D

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:29.040
which had textured walls

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.040
scaled enemies and

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.040
some more

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:35.040
some more functionality like the disappearing

02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:37.040
walls and some other stuff

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:39.040
but what's really interesting from a game

02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:41.040
development standpoint is

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:43.040
those games catacombs 3D

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.040
hover tank and Wolfenstein

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:47.040
they literally used

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:49.040
the same code for

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.040
a lot of the character behavior that a 2D

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:53.040
game that I had made earlier called catacombs

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.040
did where

02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:57.040
it was an overhead view game kind of like gauntlet

02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:59.040
you're running around and you can open up doors

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.040
pick up items basic game stuff

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.040
and the thought was that

02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:05.040
this exact same

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:07.040
game experience just

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.040
presented in a different perspective

02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.040
it could be literally the same game

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.040
just with a different view into it

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.040
would have a dramatically different impact

02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.040
on the players

02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:19.040
so it wasn't

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.040
a true 3D you're saying that

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.040
you can kind of fake it you can

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.040
scale enemies meaning things that are

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.040
farther away you can make them smaller

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.040
so from the game was

02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:31.040
a 2D map like all of our games

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:33.040
use the same tool for creation

02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.040
we use the same map editor for creating

02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.040
Keen as Wolfenstein and

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:39.040
Hevertank and catacombs and all this stuff

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.040
so the game was a 2D grid

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.040
made out of blocks and you could say

02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.040
well these are walls these are where the enemies

02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:47.040
start then they start moving around

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.040
and these early games like catacombs

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.040
you played it strictly in a 2D view

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.040
it was a scrolling 2D view

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.040
and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.040
at the time to be able to do something like

02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:59.040
that and then

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.040
the thought that these early games

02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:03.040
all it did was take the same

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:05.040
basic enemy logic but instead of

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.040
seeing it from the god's eye view on top

02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:09.040
you were inside it and turning

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:11.040
from side to side yawing your view

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:13.040
and moving forwards and backwards and side to

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.040
side and

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.040
it's a striking thing where you always talk

02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.040
about wanting to isolate and factor changes

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.040
in values and this was one of those

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:23.040
most pure cases there where

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.040
the rest of the game changed very little

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:27.040
it was our normal kind of change the colors

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.040
on something and draw a different picture for

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:31.040
it but it's kind of the same thing

02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:33.040
but the perspective changed in a really

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:35.040
fundamental way and it was

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:37.040
dramatically different I can remember

02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.040
the reactions where

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:41.040
the artist Adrian that had been

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:43.040
drawing the pictures for it we had a cool

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:45.040
big troll thing in Catacombs 3D

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:47.040
and we had these walls that

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:49.040
you could get a key and you could make the blocks

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:51.040
disappear and really simple stuff

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.040
blocks could either be there or not there

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:55.040
so our idea of a door was being able to

02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:57.040
make a set of blocks just disappear

02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.040
and I remember the reaction where he

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.040
had drawn these characters and he was slowly

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.040
moving around and like people had no

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:05.040
experience with 3D navigation it was all still

02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:07.040
keyboard we didn't even have mice

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:09.040
set up at that time but

02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:11.040
slowly moving going up picked up a

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.040
key go to a wall the wall disappears

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:15.040
in a little animation and there's a monster

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:17.040
like right there and he practically

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.040
fell out of his chair it was just like

02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.040
and games just

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.040
didn't do that you know the games were

02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:25.040
the gods eye view you were a little invested

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.040
in your little guy you can be like

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:29.040
you know happy or sad when things

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.040
happen but you just did not get that kind

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.040
of startle reaction you weren't inside

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.040
your face something in the back of your

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.040
brain some reptile brain thing is just

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.040
going oh shit something just happened

02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.040
and that was one of those

02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:43.040
early points where it's like yeah this

02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.040
is going to make a difference this is

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:47.040
going to be powerful and it's going to matter

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.040
were you able to imagine that in the

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.040
idea stage or no so

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:53.040
not that exact

02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.040
thing so again we had cases

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.040
like the arcade games battle zone

02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.040
and star wars that you could kind of see

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.040
a 3D world and things coming at you

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.040
and you get some sense of it

02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.040
but nothing had done the kind

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.040
of worlds that we were doing and the sort

02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:09.040
of action based things 3D

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.040
at the time was really

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.040
largely about the simulation

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:15.040
thoughts and this is something

02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:17.040
that really might have

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.040
trended differently if not for

02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:21.040
the software approach in the games where

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.040
there were flight simulators

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:25.040
there were driving simulators you had

02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:27.040
like hard drive in and

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.040
Microsoft flight simulator and these were

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.040
doing 3D and general purpose

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.040
3D and ways that were

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.040
more flexible than what we were doing with

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:37.040
our games but they were looked at

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:39.040
as simulations they weren't trying

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:41.040
to necessarily be fast or responsive

02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:43.040
or letting you do

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:45.040
kind of exciting maneuvers

02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.040
because they were trying to simulate reality

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:49.040
and they were taking their cues from the big

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:51.040
systems the Evans in Sutherland and the silicon

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.040
graphics that were doing things

02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:55.040
but we were taking our cues from

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:57.040
the console and arcade games you know we

02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:59.040
had things that were

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.040
sort of quarter eaters that were doing

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:03.040
fast paced things that you could smack

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.040
you around rather than just smoothly

02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.040
gliding you from place to place

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:09.040
so quarter

02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:11.040
yeah and you know a funny thing is

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:13.040
so much that that built into us that

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:15.040
Wolfenstein still had

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.040
lives and you had like one of the biggest

02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:19.040
power-ups in all these games like was an

02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.040
extra life because you started off with

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:23.040
three lives and you lose your lives and

02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.040
then it's game over and there weren't

02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:27.040
any other games in most of this stuff

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:29.040
it was and it sounds almost crazy

02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:31.040
to say this but it was an innovation

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:33.040
in doom to not have lives

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:35.040
you know you could just play doom as long as you wanted

02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:37.040
you just restart at the start of the level

02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:39.040
and why not this is like

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:41.040
we aren't trying to take people's quarters

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.040
they've already paid for the entire game

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:45.040
we want them to have a good time

02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:47.040
and you would have some

02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:49.040
you know some old-timer purists that might think

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.040
that there's something to the epic journey

02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:53.040
of making it to the end having to restart

02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:55.040
tries but now more fun is had

02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:57.040
when you just let people kind of keep trying

02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:59.040
when they're stuck rather than having to go

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:01.040
all the way back and and learn different

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:03.040
things so you recommended the

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:05.040
game engine black book Wolfenstein 3D

02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:07.040
for technical exploration

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.040
of the game so looking back

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:11.040
30 years what are some

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:13.040
memorable technical innovations

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:15.040
that made this perspective

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:17.040
shift into this world that's

02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:19.040
so immersive that scares you when a monster appears

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.040
or some things you have to solve

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.040
so one of the interesting things

02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:25.040
that come back to the theme of

02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:27.040
deadlines and resource constraints

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:29.040
the game catacombs 3D

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:31.040
we shipped

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:33.040
we were supposed to be shipping this for gamers edge

02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:35.040
on a monthly cadence and

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:37.040
I had slipped I was actually

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:39.040
late it slipped like six weeks because

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.040
this was texture mapped walls

02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.040
doing stuff that I hadn't done before

02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:45.040
and

02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:47.040
at the six-week point it was still

02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.040
kind of glitchy and buggy there were things

02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.040
that I knew that if you had

02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:53.040
a wall that was like almost edge on

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.040
you could slide over to it you could see

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.040
some things freak out or vanish or not

02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.040
work and I hated that

02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.040
I but I was up against

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:03.040
the wall we had to ship the game

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.040
it was still a lot of fun to play it was novel

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.040
nobody had seen it it gave you that startle

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:09.040
reflex I reaction so

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:11.040
it was worth shipping

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:13.040
but it had these things that I knew

02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.040
were kind of flaky and janky and not

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.040
not what I was really proud of

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:19.040
so one of the

02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:21.040
things that I did very differently in Wolfenstein

02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:23.040
I was

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:25.040
I went catacombs used

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:27.040
almost a conventional

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:29.040
thing where you had segments that were

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:31.040
one-dimensional polygons basically that were

02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:33.040
clipped and back faced

02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:35.040
and done kind of like a very crude

02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:37.040
3D engine from the professionals

02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:39.040
but I wasn't getting it done

02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.040
right I was not doing a good

02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:43.040
enough job I didn't really have line of sight

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.040
to fix it

02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:47.040
right there's stuff that of course I look back

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:49.040
it's like oh it's obvious how to do this

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:51.040
do the math right do your clipping right

02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:53.040
check all of this how you handle the precision

02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:55.040
but I did not know how to do that

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:57.040
at that time the first 3D

02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.040
engine you wrote catacombs 3D

02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:01.040
you know hover tank had been a little bit before that

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:03.040
but that had the flat shaded walls so

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:05.040
the texture mapping on the walls was what

02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:07.040
was bringing in some of these challenges

02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:09.040
that was hard for me

02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.040
and I couldn't solve it right at the time

02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:13.040
can you describe what flat shading is in texture mapping

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.040
so in the the walls were

02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:17.040
solid color one of 16 colors

02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.040
I am in hover tank

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.040
so that's easy it's fast you just

02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.040
draw the solid color for everything

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.040
texture mapping is what we all see today

02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:27.040
where you have an image that is stretched

02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:29.040
and distorted onto the walls

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.040
or the surfaces that you're working with

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.040
and it was

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.040
you know it was a long time for me to just figure out

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.040
how to do that without it

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.040
distorting in the wrong ways and

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:41.040
and I did not get it all

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:43.040
exactly right in catacombs and I had

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:45.040
these flaws

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:47.040
so that was important enough to me

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.040
that rather than continuing to bang my head

02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:51.040
on that when I wasn't positive I was

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:53.040
going to get it I went with a completely

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:55.040
different approach for drawing for

02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.040
figuring out where the walls were which was

02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:59.040
a ray casting approach

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.040
which I had done in catacombs 3D

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:03.040
I had a bunch of C code

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:05.040
trying to make this work right and it wasn't

02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:07.040
working right in Wolfenstein

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:09.040
I wound up going to a very

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.040
small amount of assembly code

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.040
so in some ways they should be a slower

02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.040
way of doing it but by

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:17.040
making it a smaller amount of work that I could

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:19.040
more tightly optimize it worked

02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:21.040
out and Wolfenstein 3D was just

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:23.040
absolutely rock solid you know it was

02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:25.040
you know nothing glitched

02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:27.040
in there the game just was pretty much

02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:29.040
flawless through all of that and I was super

02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:31.040
proud of that

02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.040
but eventually like in the later games

02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.040
I went back to the more span

02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:37.040
based things where I could get more total efficiency

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:39.040
once I really did figure out how

02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:41.040
to do it so there were two

02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:43.040
sort of key technical things to Wolfenstein

02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.040
one was this ray casting

02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:47.040
approach which you still to this

02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:49.040
day you see people go and say let's

02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.040
write a ray casting engine because

02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.040
it's an understandable way of doing things

02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:55.040
that let you make games very much

02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:57.040
like that so you see raycasters in

02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:59.040
javascript raycasters in python people

02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:01.040
that are are basically going and

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.040
re-implementing that that approach

02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:05.040
to taking a tiled world

02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.040
and casting out into it it works

02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.040
pretty well but it's not the fastest way

02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:11.040
of doing it can you describe what ray casting is

02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:13.040
so you start off and you got

02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:15.040
your screen which is 320 pixels

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.040
across at the time if you haven't sized down

02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.040
in the window for for greater

02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:21.040
speed and at every pixel

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:23.040
there's going to be an angle from you got

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:25.040
your position in the world and you're going

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:27.040
to just run along that angle

02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.040
and keep going until you hit a block

02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.040
so up to 320

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.040
times across there it's going to throw

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:35.040
cast array out into the world

02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:37.040
from wherever your origin is

02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.040
until it runs into a wall and then it

02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:41.040
can figure out exactly where on the wall

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:43.040
it hits the performance challenge

02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:45.040
of that is as it's going out

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.040
every block it's crossing it checks

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:49.040
is this a solid wall

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.040
so that means that in like

02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.040
the early Wolfenstein levels you're in a

02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:55.040
small jail cell going out into a small

02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.040
hallway it's super efficient for that

02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:59.040
because you're only stepping across three

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.040
or four blocks but then if somebody

02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:03.040
makes a room that covers our maps

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:05.040
we're limited to 64 by 64 blocks

02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:07.040
if you made one room

02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:09.040
that was nothing but walls at the far

02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:11.040
space it would go pretty slow

02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:13.040
because it would be stepping across

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.040
80 tile tests or something

02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:17.040
along the way by the way the physics of our

02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.040
universe seems to be computing this very thing

02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.040
so this maps nicely to the

02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.040
actual physics of our world

02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:25.040
yeah you get like I follow a little bit

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.040
of something like Stephen Wolfram's work on

02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:29.040
you know interconnected network

02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:31.040
information states of that and

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.040
that's it's beyond what I can

02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.040
have an informed opinion on

02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:37.040
but it's interesting that people are

02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:39.040
considering things like that and have

02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:41.040
and have things that can back

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.040
it up yeah that's yeah

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:45.040
there's whole different sets of interesting stuff

02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:47.040
there so Wolfenstein 3D

02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:49.040
had ray casting so the ray casting

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.040
and then the other kind of key aspect

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:53.040
was what I called compiled

02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.040
scalers where the idea of

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.040
you saw this in the

02:21:57.040 --> 02:21:59.040
earlier classic arcade games

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.040
like space harrier and stuff where

02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:03.040
you would take a picture which is

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:05.040
normally drawn directly on the screen

02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:07.040
and then if you have the ability to make it

02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:09.040
bigger or smaller big chunky pixels

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:11.040
or physically small drop sampled pixels

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.040
that's the fundamental

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.040
aspect of what our characters were doing

02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:17.040
in these 3D games you would have

02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:19.040
it's just like you might have drawn a tiny little character

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:21.040
but now we can make them really big

02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:23.040
and make them really small move it around

02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:25.040
that was the limited kind of 3D

02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:27.040
that we had for characters to make them turn

02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:29.040
there were literally eight different views

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:31.040
of them you didn't actually have a 3D model

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:33.040
that would rotate you just had these cardboard

02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.040
cutouts but that was good enough for that

02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.040
startle fight reaction and

02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:39.040
it was kind of what we had to deal

02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:41.040
with there so a straight

02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:43.040
forward approach to do that you could just

02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.040
write out your doubly nested loop of

02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:47.040
you've got your stretch factor

02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:49.040
and it's like you've got a point you stretch by a little

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:51.040
bit it might be on the same pixel it might

02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:53.040
have skipped a pixel

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.040
you can write that out but it's not

02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:57.040
going to be fast enough where especially

02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:59.040
you get a character for that right in your

02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:01.040
face monster covering almost the entire

02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:03.040
screen doing that with a general

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:05.040
purpose scaling routine would have just

02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:07.040
been much too slow it would have worked

02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:09.040
when they're small characters but then it would get

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:11.040
slower and slower as they got closer to you

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.040
until right at the time when you most care

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.040
about having a fast reaction time

02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:17.040
the game would be chunking down

02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:19.040
so the fastest possible way

02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:21.040
to draw pixels

02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:23.040
at that time was

02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.040
to I am

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:27.040
instead of saying I've got a general

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:29.040
purpose I am

02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:31.040
version that can handle any scale

02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:33.040
I made I used

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.040
a program to make essentially

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.040
a hundred or more separate little

02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:39.040
programs that was optimized for

02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:41.040
I will take an image and I will draw it

02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:43.040
12 pixels tall I'll take an image

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:45.040
I'll draw it 14 pixels tall up

02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:47.040
by every two pixels even

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:49.040
for that so you would have the most

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:51.040
optimized code so that

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.040
in the normal case where

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:55.040
most of the world is fairly large

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:57.040
I like the pixels are big

02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:59.040
we did not have a lot of memory

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:01.040
so in most cases that meant that you would

02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:03.040
load a pixel color

02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.040
and then you would store it multiple times

02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.040
so that was faster

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:09.040
than even copying an image

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.040
in a normal conventional case

02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:13.040
because most of the time the image is expanded

02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:15.040
so instead of doing one read one

02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:17.040
write for a simple copy you might

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.040
be doing one read and three or four writes

02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:21.040
as it got really big and that

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.040
had the beneficial aspect of just when you

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:25.040
needed the performance most when things are

02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:27.040
covering the screen it was giving you the most

02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:29.040
acceleration for that by the way

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.040
were you able to

02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.040
understand this through

02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:35.040
thinking about it or were you testing

02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:37.040
like the right speed and like this again

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.040
comes back to I can

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:41.040
find the antecedents for things like this

02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:43.040
so in I am

02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:45.040
back in the Apple two days

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:47.040
the graphics were

02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:49.040
essentially single bits at a time

02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:51.040
and if you wanted to make your little

02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.040
spaceship if you wanted to make it

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.040
smoothly go across the world

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:57.040
if you just took the image and you drew it out at the next

02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:59.040
location you would move by seven pixels

02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:01.040
at a time so it would go chunk chunk chunk

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:03.040
if you wanted to make it move smoothly

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:05.040
you actually had to make seven versions

02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.040
of the ship that were pre-shifted

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:09.040
you could write a program that would shift it

02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:11.040
dynamically but on a one megahertz

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.040
processor that's not going anywhere fast

02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:15.040
so if you wanted to do a smooth

02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:17.040
moving fast action game

02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.040
you made separate versions of each of these

02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:21.040
sprites now there were

02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:23.040
a few more tricks you could pull that if it

02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:25.040
still wasn't fast enough you could make

02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:27.040
a compiled shape

02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:29.040
where instead of

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:31.040
this program that normally copies

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:33.040
an image and it says like get this byte

02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:35.040
from here stored here get this byte store this

02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:37.040
byte if you've got the memory

02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:39.040
space you could say I'm going

02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.040
to write the program that does nothing but draw

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:43.040
this shape it's going to be like

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:45.040
I'm going to load the immediate value

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:47.040
25 you know which is

02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:49.040
some bit pattern and then I'm going to store

02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.040
that at this location

02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:53.040
rather than loading something from memory

02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:55.040
that involved indexing registers

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:57.040
and this other slow stuff

02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:59.040
you could go ahead and say no I'm going to hard

02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:01.040
code the exact values of all of the image

02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:03.040
right into the program and this was always

02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.040
a horrible trade off there but you didn't have much

02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:07.040
memory and you didn't have much speed

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.040
but if you had something that you wanted to go really

02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:11.040
fast you could turn it into a program

02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:13.040
and that was

02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.040
you know knowing about that technique is what

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:17.040
made me think about some of these unwinding

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:19.040
it for the PC where people

02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.040
that didn't come from that background were less

02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:23.040
likely to think about that

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.040
I mean there's some deep parallels

02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:27.040
probably to human cognition as well

02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:29.040
there's something about

02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:33.040
optimizing and compressing

02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:35.040
the processing

02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:37.040
of a new information that requires

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.040
you to predict the possible

02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:41.040
ways in which

02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:43.040
the game or the world

02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:45.040
might unroll and you have

02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:47.040
something like compiled scalars always

02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:49.040
there so you have like

02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:51.040
optimum like you have a

02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:53.040
prediction of how the world will unroll and you have

02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:55.040
some kind of optimized

02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:57.040
data structure

02:26:57.040 --> 02:26:59.040
for that prediction and then you can modify

02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:01.040
if the world turns out to be different

02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:03.040
you can modify in a slight way

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.040
and as far as building out techniques

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.040
so much of the brain is about the associative context

02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:09.040
you know there just when you learn

02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:11.040
something it's in the context of something else

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:13.040
and you can have faint tiny little

02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:15.040
hints of things and I do think

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.040
there are some deep things around

02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:19.040
like sparse distributed memories and boosting

02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:21.040
that's like if you can just be slightly above

02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:23.040
the noise floor of having some hint

02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.040
of something you can have things refined

02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:27.040
into pulling the memory back up so

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:29.040
having a being a programmer

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.040
a tool box of like all of these things

02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:33.040
that things that I did in all of these

02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:35.040
previous lives of programming tasks

02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:37.040
that still matters to me about how

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:39.040
I'm able to pull up some of these things

02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:41.040
like in that case it was something I did on the

02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:43.040
Apple too then being relevant for the PC

02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:45.040
and I have still cases

02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:47.040
when I would when I would work on

02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:49.040
mobile development then be like okay

02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.040
I did something like this back in the

02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:53.040
doom days but now it's a different

02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:55.040
environment but I still had that tie

02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.040
I can bring it in and I can transform it

02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:59.040
into what the world needs right now

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:01.040
and I do think that's actually one of the

02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:03.040
very core things with human

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:05.040
cognition and brain like

02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:07.040
you know brain like functioning is

02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:09.040
finding these ways about you've got

02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:11.040
your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once

02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:13.040
you know it's it is just a set of all of

02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:15.040
this stuff that is just fetched back by

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:17.040
these queries that go into it

02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:19.040
and they can just be slightly above the noise

02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.040
floor with random noise in your neurons

02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.040
and synapses that are affecting exactly

02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:25.040
what gets pulled up. So you're saying

02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:27.040
there's very specific solutions for different

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:29.040
games you find

02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.040
that there's a kernel of

02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:33.040
a deep idea that's generalizable to

02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:35.040
other to other things. Yeah you

02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:37.040
can't predict what it's going to be but

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:39.040
that idea of like I called out that compiled

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:41.040
shaders in the forward that I wrote

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:43.040
for that the game engine black book

02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:45.040
as you know this is

02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.040
it's kind of an endpoint of unrolling

02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:49.040
code but that's one of those

02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:51.040
things that thinking about that and having that

02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:53.040
in your mind and I'm sure there are some programmers

02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:55.040
that you know hear about that think about

02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:57.040
it a little bit it's kind of the mind blown moment

02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:59.040
it's like oh you can just turn all of that

02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:01.040
data into code and

02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:03.040
nowadays you know you have instruction cache

02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:05.040
issues and that's not necessarily the best idea

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:07.040
but there are different

02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:09.040
it's an idea that has power

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.040
and has probably relevance in some other

02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:13.040
areas maybe it's in a hardware point of view

02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:15.040
that there's a way you approach building hardware

02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:17.040
that has that same you don't

02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:19.040
even have to think about iterating you just bake

02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:21.040
everything all the way into it in one

02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:23.040
place what is the story

02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:25.040
of how you came to program doom

02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:27.040
what is some memorable technical

02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:29.040
challenges or innovations within that game

02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:31.040
so the path that we went

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.040
after after Wolfenstein

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:35.040
got out and we were on this crazy

02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:37.040
arc where keen one through three

02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:39.040
more success than we thought keen

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.040
four through six even more success

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:43.040
Wolfenstein even more success so we were

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.040
on this this crazy trajectory

02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:47.040
for things so actually our first

02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:49.040
box commercial project was a commander keen

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.040
I am game but then

02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:53.040
Wolfenstein was going to have a game called

02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.040
spear of destiny which was

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:57.040
a commercial version 60 new levels

02:29:57.040 --> 02:29:59.040
so the rest of the team took the game

02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.040
engine pretty much as it was

02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:03.040
and started working on that we got

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:05.040
new monsters but it's

02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:07.040
basically reskins of the things

02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:09.040
there there's a really interesting aspect

02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:11.040
about that that I didn't appreciate until much

02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:13.040
much later about how

02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:15.040
Wolfenstein clearly did

02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:17.040
tap out its limit about what

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.040
you want to play and all

02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:21.040
the levels and a couple of our license things

02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:23.040
there was a hard

02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:25.040
creative wall that you did not really

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:27.040
benefit much by continuing to beat on it

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:29.040
but a game like

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:31.040
doom and other more modern

02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:33.040
games like minecraft or something

02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:35.040
there's kind of a turing completeness level

02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:37.040
of design freedom that you get in games

02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:39.040
that Wolfenstein really sat on one

02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:41.040
side of you know all the creative

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.040
people in the world could not go and do

02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:45.040
a masterpiece just with the technology

02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.040
that Wolfenstein had Wolfenstein

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.040
could do Wolfenstein but you really couldn't do

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:51.040
something crazy and different but it

02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.040
didn't take that much more capability

02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:55.040
to get to Wolfenstein with

02:30:55.040 --> 02:30:57.040
the freeform lines and a little

02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:59.040
bit more artistic freedom to get to the

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:01.040
point where people still announced

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.040
new doom levels today all these years

02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:05.040
after without having completely

02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:07.040
tapped out the creativity how did you

02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:09.040
put it turing complete

02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:11.040
design space design space like

02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.040
you know we have the kind of computational

02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:15.040
universality

02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:17.040
on a lot of things but for creativity

02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:19.040
but yeah there's things where

02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:21.040
a box can be too small

02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:23.040
but above a certain point

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.040
you kind of are at the point where

02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:27.040
you really have almost

02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:29.040
unbounded creative ability there and doom

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.040
was the first time you crossed that

02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:33.040
line yeah where there were

02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:35.040
thousands of doom levels created

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.040
and some of them still have something new

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:39.040
and interesting to say to the world about it

02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:41.040
is that line

02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:43.040
do you introspect what that line was

02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:45.040
is in the design space

02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:47.040
is it something about the programming

02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:49.040
capabilities that you were able

02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:51.040
to add to the game

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:53.040
so the graphics fidelity

02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:55.040
was a necessary part because the block

02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:57.040
limitations in Wolfenstein

02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:59.040
what we had right there

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.040
was not enough

02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.040
the full scale blocks although

02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:05.040
Minecraft I really did show

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.040
that perhaps blocks stacked

02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:09.040
in 3D and at one quarter

02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:11.040
scale of that one eighth in volume

02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:13.040
is then sufficient to have all of that

02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:15.040
but the wall

02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:17.040
sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:19.040
was too much of a creative limitation

02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:21.040
we licensed the technology to a few other teams

02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:23.040
none of them made

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:25.040
too much of a dent with that

02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:27.040
it just wasn't enough creative ability

02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:29.040
but a little bit more whether it was

02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.040
the variable floors and ceilings

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:33.040
and arbitrary angles in doom

02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:35.040
or the smaller

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:37.040
box blocks in Minecraft

02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:39.040
is then enough to open it up to

02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:41.040
just worlds and worlds of new capabilities

02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:43.040
what is binary

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:45.040
space partitioning

02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:47.040
which is one of the technologies

02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:49.040
jump around a little bit

02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:51.040
on the story path there

02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:53.040
so while the team was working on Spirit Destiny

02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:55.040
for Wolfenstein

02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:57.040
we had met another development team

02:32:57.040 --> 02:32:59.040
Raven Software while we were in Wisconsin

02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:01.040
and

02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:03.040
they had RPG background

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:05.040
and I still kind of love that

02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:07.040
they offered to do a game engine

02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:09.040
for them to let them do a

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:11.040
3D rendered RPG

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:13.040
instead of the like most RPG games

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:15.040
were kind of hand drawn they made it look

02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:17.040
kind of 3D but it was done just all with

02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:19.040
artist work rather than a real engine

02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:21.040
and

02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:23.040
after Wolfenstein this was still a tile

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:25.040
based world but I added floors and ceilings

02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:27.040
and some lighting and the ability to have

02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:29.040
some sloped floors in different areas

02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:31.040
and that was my intermediate step for a game called

02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:33.040
Shadowcaster

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:35.040
it had slowed down enough it was not

02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:37.040
fast enough to do our type of action

02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:39.040
things so that they had the screen

02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.040
cropped down a little bit so you couldn't

02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:43.040
go the full screen width like we would try to

02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:45.040
do in Wolfenstein

02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:47.040
but I learned a lot I got the floors

02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:49.040
and ceilings and lightings and it looked great

02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:51.040
they were great artists up there and it was

02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:53.040
it was an inspiration for us to look at some

02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:55.040
of that stuff

02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.040
but I had learned enough from that

02:33:57.040 --> 02:33:59.040
that I had the plan for I knew

02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:01.040
faster ways to do the the lighting

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.040
shadowing and I wanted to do this free form

02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:05.040
geometry I wanted to break out of this tile

02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:07.040
based 90 degree

02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:09.040
world limitations

02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:11.040
so we had that was when

02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:13.040
we got our next stations and we were working

02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:15.040
with these higher powered systems

02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:17.040
and we built

02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:19.040
an editor that let us draw kind of arbitrary

02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:21.040
line segments and I was working

02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:23.040
hard to try to make something that could

02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:25.040
render this fast enough

02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:27.040
I was pushing myself

02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.040
pretty hard and

02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:31.040
we were we were at a point where

02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:33.040
we could see some things that looked amazingly

02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.040
cool but it wasn't really fast enough

02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:37.040
for the way I was doing it

02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:39.040
I for this flexibility it was no longer

02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:41.040
I couldn't just ray cast into it

02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:43.040
and I had these very complex sets of lines

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:45.040
and simple little worlds were okay

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:47.040
but the cool things that we wanted to do

02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.040
just weren't quite fast enough

02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:51.040
and I wound up taking

02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:53.040
a break at that point and I

02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:55.040
did the the port I did two

02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:57.040
ports of our games

02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:59.040
I Wolfenstein to

02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:01.040
the I to the Super Nintendo

02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:03.040
it was I it was a crazy

02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:05.040
difficult thing to do which was an even

02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:07.040
slower processors like 2

02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:09.040
I a couple megahertz

02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:11.040
processor and it had

02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:13.040
been this whole thing where we had farmed out

02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:15.040
the I

02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:17.040
the work and it wasn't it wasn't going

02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:19.040
well and I took it back over

02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.040
and trying to make it go

02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:23.040
fast on there where it really

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.040
did not have much processing power

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:27.040
the pixels were stretched up hugely and it's

02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:29.040
you know it's pretty ugly when you looked at it

02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.040
but in the end it did come out fast enough

02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:33.040
to play and still be kind of fun from that

02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:35.040
but that was where I started

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:37.040
using BSP trees or binary

02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:39.040
space partitioning trees it was one of those

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:41.040
things I had to make it faster there

02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:43.040
it was a stepping stone where

02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:45.040
it was reasonably easy to understand

02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:47.040
in the grid world of Wolfenstein where

02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:49.040
it was all still 90 degree angles

02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:51.040
I'm BSP trees were

02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:53.040
I eased myself into it

02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:55.040
with that and it was a big success

02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.040
I am then when I came

02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.040
back to working on doom I had

02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:01.040
this new tool in my toolbox it was going

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.040
to be a lot harder with the arbitrary

02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:05.040
angles of doom this was where

02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:07.040
I really started grappling with epsilon

02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:09.040
problems and just you know up

02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:11.040
until that point I hadn't really had to deal with

02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:13.040
the fact that I am so

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:15.040
many numeric things this almost felt like a betrayal

02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:17.040
to me where people had told me that I had

02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:19.040
mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal

02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:21.040
where I was people

02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:23.040
think I'm a math wizard and I'm not I really

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:25.040
everything that I did

02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:27.040
was really done with a solid

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:29.040
high school math understanding

02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:31.040
you know algebra 2 trigonometry

02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:33.040
and I am that was

02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:35.040
what got me all the way through doom and quake

02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:37.040
and all of that of just understanding

02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:39.040
basics of matrices and

02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.040
knowing it well enough to do something with it

02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:43.040
what's the epsilon problems you ran into

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:45.040
so I when you wind up taking

02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:47.040
a like a sloped line

02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.040
and you say I'm going to intersect it with another

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:51.040
sloped line I am

02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:53.040
then you wind up with something that's not going

02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.040
to be on these nice grid boundaries

02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:57.040
with the Wolfenstein tile maps

02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.040
where all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines

02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:01.040
looking at it from above and if you cut

02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:03.040
one of them it's just obvious the other one gets

02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:05.040
cut exactly at that point

02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:07.040
but when you have angled lines you're doing

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:09.040
a kind of a slope intercept problem

02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:11.040
and you wind up with rational numbers there

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:13.040
where things that are not going

02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:15.040
to evenly land on an integer

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:17.040
or even on any fixed point value that you've got

02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:19.040
so everything winds up having

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:21.040
to snap to some fixed point value

02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:23.040
so the lines slightly change their

02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:25.040
angle you wind up if you cut something

02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:27.040
here this one's going to bend a little this way

02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:29.040
and it's not going to be completely straight

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:31.040
and then you come down to all these questions of

02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:33.040
well this one is

02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:35.040
is a point on an angled line

02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:37.040
you can't answer that in finite precision

02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:39.040
unless you're doing something

02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:41.040
with actual rational numbers

02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:43.040
and later on I did waste far too much time

02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:45.040
chasing things like that how do you do

02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:47.040
base arithmetic with rational numbers

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:49.040
and it always blows up eventually

02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:51.040
exponentially as you do an update

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:53.040
so these kind of things aren't possible with computers

02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:55.040
so they're possible

02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:57.040
again there are paths to do

02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:59.040
doing it but you can't fit them conveniently

02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:01.040
and any of the numbers you need to start using

02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:03.040
big nums and different

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.040
factor trackings and different things

02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:07.040
so you have to if you have any

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.040
elements of OCD and you want to do something

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:11.040
perfectly you're screwed if you're working

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.040
with floating point

02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:15.040
so you had to deal with this for the first time

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:17.040
and there were lots of challenges

02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:19.040
there about okay

02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:21.040
they build this cool thing and the way the BSP

02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:23.040
trees work is it basically

02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:25.040
takes the walls and it carves other

02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:27.040
walls by those walls in this

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:29.040
clever way that you can then take

02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:31.040
all of these fragments and then you can

02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:33.040
for sure from any given point

02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:35.040
get an ordering of everything in the world

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.040
and you can say this goes in front of this

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:39.040
goes in front of this all the way back to

02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:41.040
the last thing and that's super

02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.040
valuable for graphics where

02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:45.040
kind of a classic graphics algorithm

02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:47.040
would be painter's algorithm

02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:49.040
you paint the furthest thing first and then the next thing

02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:51.040
and then the next thing and then it comes up

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:53.040
and it's all perfect for you that's

02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:55.040
slow because you don't want to have to have drawn

02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:57.040
everything like that but you can also flip

02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:59.040
it around and draw the closest thing to

02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.040
you and then if you're clever

02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.040
about it you can figure out what you need to

02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:05.040
draw that's visible beyond

02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:07.040
that and that's what BSP trees allow you to do

02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:09.040
yeah so it's combined with

02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:11.040
a bunch of other things but it gives

02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:13.040
you that ordering it's a clever way

02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:15.040
of doing things and I remember

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:17.040
I had learned this from one of

02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:19.040
my graphics bible at the time

02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:21.040
a book called folian van dam

02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.040
it was a different world back there

02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.040
there was a small integer number of books

02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:27.040
and this book

02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:29.040
this book that was a big fat college

02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:31.040
textbook that I had read

02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:33.040
through many times I didn't

02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:35.040
understand everything in it some of it wasn't

02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:37.040
useful to me but they had the little

02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.040
thing about

02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.040
finite orderings of you draw a little

02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:43.040
t-shaped thing and you can say you

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.040
can make a fixed ahead of time order from

02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:47.040
this and you can generalize this with

02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:49.040
the BSP trees and

02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:51.040
I got a little bit more information about that

02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:53.040
and it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake

02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:55.040
I got to meet Bruce Naylor

02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:57.040
who was one of the original researchers that

02:39:57.040 --> 02:39:59.040
developed those technologies

02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:01.040
for academic literature

02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:03.040
and that was kind of fun but I was very much

02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:05.040
just finding a tool that can help me solve

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.040
what I was doing and I was using it in this very

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:09.040
crude way in a two-dimensional fashion

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:11.040
rather than the general 3d the epsilon

02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:13.040
problems got much worse in quake in

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:15.040
three-dimensionals when things angle in every

02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:17.040
way but eventually I did sort

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:19.040
out the sort out how to do it reliably

02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:21.040
on doom there were still a few

02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:23.040
edge cases in doom that were not

02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:25.040
absolutely perfect where

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:27.040
they even got terminologies in the

02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.040
communities like when you got to something where it was

02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:31.040
messed up it was a hall of mirrors effect

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:33.040
because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw

02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:35.040
something there and you would just wind up with

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.040
the leftover remnants as you flipped between

02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.040
the the two pages

02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:41.040
but BSP trees were important

02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:43.040
for it but it's again worth noting

02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:45.040
that after we did

02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:47.040
doom our major competition

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.040
came from Ken Silverman

02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:51.040
in his build engine which was used for Duke

02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:53.040
Nukem 3d and some of the other games for

02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:55.040
3d realms and he used a completely

02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:57.040
different technology nothing to do with

02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:59.040
I'm with BSP

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:01.040
trees so there's not just a one

02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:03.040
true way of doing things

02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.040
I'm there were critical things

02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:07.040
about to make any of those games fast

02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:09.040
you had to you had to separate your

02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:11.040
drawing into you drew vertical lines

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:13.040
and you drew horizontal lines just kind

02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:15.040
of changing exactly what you would

02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:17.040
draw with them that was critical for the

02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:19.040
technologies at that time

02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:21.040
and like all the games that were kind

02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:23.040
of like that wound up doing something similar

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:25.040
but there were still a bunch of other

02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:27.040
decisions that could be made

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:29.040
and we made good enough decisions

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.040
on everything on doom we

02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:33.040
we brought in multiplayer

02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:35.040
significantly and it was our first game that was

02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:37.040
designed to be modified by the user

02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:39.040
community where we had this whole

02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:41.040
setup of our wad files and pwads

02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:43.040
and things that people could could build

02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:45.040
with tools that we released to them and they

02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:47.040
eventually rewrote to be better than what we

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:49.040
released but they could build things

02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:51.040
and you could add it to your game without

02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:53.040
destructively modifying it which is what you

02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.040
had to do in all the early games you literally

02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:57.040
hacked the data files

02:41:57.040 --> 02:41:59.040
executable before while doom was

02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:01.040
set up in this flexible way so that

02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:03.040
you could just say run the normal

02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:05.040
game with this added on on top

02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:07.040
and it would overlay just the things that

02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:09.040
you wanted to there

02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:11.040
would you say that doom was kind of the first

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:13.040
true 3d game

02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:15.040
that you created so no it's still

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:17.040
doom would usually be called a 2

02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:19.040
and a half d game where it had

02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:21.040
three-dimensional points on it and this is

02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:23.040
another one of these kind of pedantic things that people

02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:25.040
love to argue about about what was the first

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:27.040
3d game I still like

02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:29.040
like every month probably I hear from

02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:31.040
somebody about well was doom really a

02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:33.040
3d game or something

02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:35.040
and you know I give the

02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:37.040
the point where characters

02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:39.040
had three coordinates so you had

02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:41.040
like an x y and z the cacodammon

02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:43.040
could be coming in very high and come

02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:45.040
you know and come down towards you

02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:47.040
the walls had three coordinates

02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:49.040
on them so on some sense

02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:51.040
it's a 3d game engine but it was

02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:53.040
not a fully general 3d game engine

02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:55.040
you could not

02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:57.040
build a pyramid in doom because you

02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:59.040
couldn't make a sloped wall

02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:01.040
which was slightly different where in that

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:03.040
previous shadow caster game I couldn't

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:05.040
have vertexes and have a sloped floor there

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.040
but the changes that I made for doom

02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:09.040
to get higher speed and a different

02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:11.040
set of flexibility traded away that ability

02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:13.040
but you literally couldn't make that

02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:15.040
you could not

02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:17.040
make different heights of

02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:19.040
passages but you could not make a bridge

02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:21.040
over another area you could not go over

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:23.040
and above it so it still had

02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:25.040
some 2d limitations to it

02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:27.040
that's more about the building versus the actual experience

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:29.040
because the experience is

02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:31.040
it felt like things would come at you but again

02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:33.040
you couldn't look up either

02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:35.040
you could only pitch

02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:37.040
it was 4 degrees of freedom rather than

02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:39.040
6 degrees of freedom you did not

02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:41.040
have the ability to tilt your head this way

02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:43.040
or pitch up and down

02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:45.040
so that takes us to quake

02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:47.040
what was the leap there

02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:49.040
what was some fascinating

02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:51.040
technical challenges and there were a lot

02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:53.040
or not challenges but innovations

02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:55.040
that you've come up with so quake

02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:57.040
was kind of the first thing where

02:43:57.040 --> 02:43:59.040
I did have to kind of come face

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:01.040
to face with my limitations

02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:03.040
where it was the first thing where

02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:05.040
I really did kind of

02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:07.040
give it my all and still come up

02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:09.040
you know come up a little bit short in terms

02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:11.040
of what and when I wanted to

02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:13.040
to get it done and

02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:15.040
the company brand had some serious stresses

02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:17.040
through the whole project

02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:19.040
and we bit off a lot

02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:21.040
so the things that we set out

02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:23.040
to do was it was going to be

02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:25.040
really a true 3D engine

02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:27.040
where it could do 6 degree of freedom

02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:29.040
you could have all the viewpoints

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:31.040
you could model anything

02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:33.040
it had

02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:35.040
a really remarkable new lighting model

02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:37.040
with the surface cashing and things

02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:39.040
that was one of those where it was starting to

02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:41.040
do some things that they weren't doing

02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:43.040
even on the very high end systems

02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:45.040
and it was going to be

02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:47.040
completely programmable

02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.040
in the modding standpoint where

02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:51.040
the thing that you couldn't do and do

02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:53.040
you could replace almost all of the media

02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:55.040
but you couldn't really change the game

02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.040
there were still some people

02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:59.040
that were doing the hex setting of the executable

02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:01.040
the de-hacked things where you could change

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:03.040
a few things about rules and people made

02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:05.040
some early capture the flag type things

02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:07.040
by hacking the executable but

02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:09.040
it wasn't really set out to do that

02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:11.040
quake was going to have its own

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:13.040
programming language that the game was going to be implemented

02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:15.040
and that would be able to be overwritten

02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:17.040
just like any of the media

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:19.040
code was going to be data for that

02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:21.040
and you would be able to have expansion

02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:23.040
packs that changed fundamental things

02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:25.040
and mods and so on

02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:27.040
and the multiplayer

02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:29.040
was going to be playable over the internet

02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:31.040
it was going to support a client

02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:33.040
server rather than peer to peer

02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:35.040
so we had the possibility of supporting

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:37.040
larger numbers of players in disparate locations

02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:39.040
with this full flexibility

02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:41.040
of the programming overrides

02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:43.040
with full six-degree of freedom

02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:45.040
modeling and viewing

02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:47.040
and with this fancy new light

02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:49.040
mapped kind of surface caching

02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:51.040
side it was a lot

02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:53.040
and this was one of those things that

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:55.040
if I could go back and tell

02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:57.040
younger me to do something differently

02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:59.040
it would have been to split those

02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:01.040
innovations up into two phases

02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:03.040
in two separate games

02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:05.040
so it probably would have been taking

02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:07.040
the doom rendering engine

02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:09.040
and bringing in the TCPIP

02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:11.040
client server

02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:13.040
focusing on the multiplayer

02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:15.040
and the Quake C

02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:17.040
or would have been Doom C programming language

02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:19.040
there so I would have split that into

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:21.040
programming language and networking

02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:23.040
with the same doom engine

02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:25.040
rather than forcing everybody to go towards

02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:27.040
the Quake engine which really

02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:29.040
meant getting a Pentium

02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:31.040
while it ran on a 486 it was not a great

02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:33.040
experience there we could have made more

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:35.040
people happier and gotten two games done

02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:37.040
in 50% more time

02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:39.040
so speaking of people happier

02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:41.040
or

02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:43.040
mutual friend Joe Rogan

02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:45.040
it seems like the most

02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:47.040
important moment of his life

02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:49.040
is centered around Quake

02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:51.040
so it was a definitive

02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:53.040
part of his life

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:55.040
so would he agree with

02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:57.040
your thinking that

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:59.040
they should split

02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:01.040
so he is a person who loves Quake

02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:03.040
and played Quake a lot

02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:05.040
would he agree that you should have done

02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:07.040
the doom engine

02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:09.040
and focus on the multiplayer for phase one

02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:11.040
or

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:13.040
in your looking back

02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:15.040
is the 3D world that

02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:17.040
Quake created was also

02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:19.040
fundamental to the

02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:21.040
the enriched experience I would say that

02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:23.040
what would have happened is

02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:25.040
you would have had a

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:27.040
a doom looking but Quake feeling

02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:29.040
game

02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:31.040
8 months earlier and then maybe

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:33.040
6 months after Quake actually

02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.040
then there would have been the full running on a pentium

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:37.040
6 degree of freedom

02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:39.040
graphics engine type things there so it's not

02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:41.040
that it wouldn't have

02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:43.040
been there it would have been

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:45.040
something amazingly cool earlier

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.040
and then something even cooler somewhat later

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.040
where I would much

02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:51.040
rather have gone and done

02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:53.040
two one year development efforts

02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:55.040
I've cycled them through

02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:57.040
I've been a little more pragmatic about that

02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:59.040
rather than killing us

02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:01.040
ourselves on the whole Quake development

02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:03.040
but I would say it's obviously

02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:05.040
things worked out well in the end

02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:07.040
but looking back and saying how would I

02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:09.040
optimize and do things differently

02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:11.040
that did seem to be a clear case where

02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:13.040
I

02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.040
going ahead and we had enormous momentum

02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.040
on doom you know we did doom too as

02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:19.040
the kind of commercial boxed version

02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:21.040
after our shareware success

02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:23.040
with the original but we could have

02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:25.040
just made another doom game

02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:27.040
adding those new features

02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:29.040
in it would have been huge we would

02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:31.040
have learned all the same lessons but faster

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:33.040
and it would have given

02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:35.040
6 degree of freedom and pentium

02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:37.040
class systems a little bit more time

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:39.040
to get mainstream because we did

02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:41.040
cut out a lot of people with the hardware

02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:43.040
requirements for Quake

02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:45.040
was there any dark moments for you personally

02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:47.040
psychologically in having

02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:49.040
in

02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:51.040
having such harsh deadlines

02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:53.040
and having this also made

02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:55.040
difficult technical challenges

02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:57.040
so I've never really

02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:59.040
had

02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:01.040
really dark black places

02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:03.040
I can't necessarily put myself in

02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:05.040
anyone else's shoes but I understand

02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:07.040
a lot of people

02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:09.040
have significant

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:11.040
challenges with their

02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:13.040
mental health and well-being

02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:15.040
and I've been super stressed

02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:17.040
I've been unhappy as a teenager

02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:19.040
in various ways

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.040
but I've never really

02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:23.040
gone to a very dark

02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:25.040
place I just seem to be

02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.040
largely

02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:29.040
immune to what really

02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:31.040
wrecks people I mean I've had plenty of time

02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:33.040
when I'm very unhappy and miserable about

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.040
something but it's never

02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:37.040
hit me like I believe

02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:39.040
it winds up hitting some other people

02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:41.040
I've borne up well under whatever

02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:43.040
stresses have

02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:45.040
kind of fallen on me and I've always

02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:47.040
coped best on that

02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:49.040
when all I need to do is

02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:51.040
usually just kind of bear down on my work

02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:53.040
I pull myself out of

02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:55.040
whatever hole I might be slipping into

02:49:55.040 --> 02:49:57.040
by actually making progress

02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:59.040
I mean maybe if I was in a

02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:01.040
position where I was never able to make

02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:03.040
that progress I could have slid down further

02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:05.040
but I've always been in a

02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:07.040
place where okay a little bit

02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:09.040
more work maybe I'm in a tough spot here

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:11.040
but I always know

02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:13.040
if I just keep pushing eventually

02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:15.040
I break through and I make progress

02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:17.040
I feel good about what I'm doing

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.040
and that's been enough for me

02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:21.040
so far in my life

02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:23.040
I've seen in the distance

02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:25.040
like

02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:27.040
ideas of depression

02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:29.040
or contemplating suicide

02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:31.040
have you seen those things far?

02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:33.040
So it was interesting when I was a teenager

02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:35.040
I was

02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:37.040
probably at some level a troubled youth

02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:39.040
I was unhappy most of my teenage

02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:41.040
years

02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:43.040
I wanted to be on my own

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:45.040
doing programming all the time

02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:47.040
as soon as I was 18, 19

02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:49.040
even though I was poor I was doing exactly

02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:51.040
what I wanted and I was very happy

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:53.040
but high school was not a great time for me

02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:55.040
and

02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:57.040
I had a conversation with like the school counselor

02:50:57.040 --> 02:50:59.040
and they're kind of running their script

02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:01.040
it's like okay it's kind of a weird kid here

02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:03.040
let's carefully probe around

02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:05.040
it's like do you ever think about

02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:07.040
ending it all? I'm like no of course not

02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:09.040
never not at all

02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:11.040
this is temporary things are going to be better

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:15.040
and that's always been kind of the case

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:17.040
for me and obviously

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.040
it's not that way for everyone

02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:21.040
and other people do react differently

02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:23.040
what was your

02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:25.040
escape from the troubled youth

02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:27.040
like

02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:29.040
you know

02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:31.040
music

02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:33.040
video games

02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:35.040
books

02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:37.040
how did you escape from a world that's full of cruelty

02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:39.040
and suffering and that's absurd

02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:41.040
I was not victim of cruelty

02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:43.040
and suffering it's like I was an unhappy

02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:45.040
somewhat petulant youth

02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:47.040
where I'm not

02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:49.040
putting myself up with anybody else's

02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:51.040
suffering but I was unhappy

02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:53.040
objectively and

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:55.040
the things that I did that

02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:57.040
very much characterized my childhood

02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:59.040
were I had

02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:01.040
books, comic books, dungeons and dragons

02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:03.040
arcade games, video games

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:05.040
like some of my fondest

02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:07.040
childhood memories are the convenience stores

02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:09.040
the 7-Elevens and Quick Trips

02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:11.040
because they had a spinner rack of comic books

02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:13.040
and they had a little side room with

02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:15.040
two or three video games, arcade games

02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:17.040
in it and that was

02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:19.040
very much my happy place

02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:21.040
I get my comic books

02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:23.040
and if I could go to a library

02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:25.040
and go through those little

02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:27.040
0-0-0 section where computer books were supposed

02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:29.040
to be and there are a few sad little books there

02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:31.040
but still just being able to sit down

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:33.040
and go through that and I read

02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:35.040
I read a ridiculous number

02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:37.040
of books both fiction and non-fiction

02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:39.040
as a teenager

02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:41.040
and

02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:43.040
my rebelling in high school was just

02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:45.040
sitting there with my nose in a book ignoring the

02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:47.040
class through lots of it

02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:49.040
and teachers had a range of reactions

02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:51.040
to that some more accepting

02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:53.040
of it than others

02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:55.040
I'm with you on that so let us

02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:57.040
return to quake for a bit with the technical

02:52:57.040 --> 02:52:59.040
challenges what

02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:01.040
everything together

02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:03.040
from the networking

02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:05.040
to the graphics

02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:07.040
what are some things you remember

02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:09.040
that were innovations

02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:11.040
you had to come up with in order to

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:13.040
make it all happen

02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:15.040
there were a bunch of things on quake

02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:17.040
where on the one hand the idea

02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:19.040
that I built my own programming language

02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:21.040
to implement the game in

02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:23.040
looking back and I try to tell people

02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:25.040
every high-level programmer

02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:27.040
sometime in their career goes through and they

02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:29.040
invent their own language it just seems to be a thing

02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:31.040
that's pretty broadly done

02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:33.040
I'm going to go write a computer programming language

02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:35.040
and

02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:37.040
I don't regret having done it

02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:39.040
but after that

02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:41.040
I switched from quake c my quirky

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:43.040
little pseudo-object

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:45.040
or entity-oriented language there

02:53:45.040 --> 02:53:47.040
quake 2 went back to using

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:49.040
DLLs with C and then quake 3

02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:51.040
I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler

02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:53.040
which was a much smarter thing

02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:55.040
to do that I should have done originally for quake

02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:57.040
but building my own language

02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:59.040
was an experience I learned a lot from that

02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:01.040
and then there was a generation

02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:03.040
of game programmers that

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:05.040
learned programming with quake c which I feel kind

02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:07.040
of bad about because

02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:09.040
we give javascript a lot of crap but

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:11.040
quake c was nothing to

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:13.040
write home about there

02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:15.040
but it allowed people to do

02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:17.040
magical things you get into programming

02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:19.040
not because you love the

02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:21.040
BNF syntax of a language

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:23.040
it's because the language lets you do

02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:25.040
something that you cared about

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:27.040
and here's very much you could do something

02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:29.040
in a whole beautiful three-dimensional

02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:31.040
world and the idea and the fact that the

02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:33.040
code for the game was out there you could say

02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:35.040
I like the shotgun but I want

02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:37.040
it to be more badass you go in there and say

02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:39.040
okay now it does 200 points damage

02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:41.040
and then you go around with a big grin

02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:43.040
on your face blowing up monsters all over

02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:45.040
the game so yeah it's

02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.040
I you know it is not

02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:49.040
what I would do today going back with that

02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:51.040
language but that was a big part of it

02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:53.040
learning about the networking stuff

02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:55.040
I because it's

02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:57.040
interesting where I learn these things by

02:54:57.040 --> 02:54:59.040
reading books so I would get a book on networking

02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:01.040
find something I read

02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:03.040
all about and learn okay packets they can

02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:05.040
be you know out of order lost

02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:07.040
or duplicated these are all the

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:09.040
things that can theoretically happen to packets

02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:11.040
so I wind up spending all this time

02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:13.040
thinking about how do we deal about all that

02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:15.040
and it turns out of course in the real world

02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:17.040
those are things that yes theoretically can happen

02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:19.040
with multiple routes but they really

02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:21.040
aren't things that your 99.999

02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:23.040
percent of your packets

02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:25.040
have to deal with

02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:27.040
so there was learning experiences about

02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:29.040
lots of that like why

02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:31.040
when TCP is appropriate

02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:33.040
versus UDP and and how

02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:35.040
if you do things in UDP you wind up reinventing

02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:37.040
TCP badly in almost all

02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:39.040
cases so you know there's

02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:41.040
there's good arguments for using

02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:43.040
both for different game technology

02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:45.040
different parts of the game process transitioning

02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:47.040
from level to level and all but the the

02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:49.040
graphics were the showcase

02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:51.040
of what what quake

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:53.040
was all about it was this graphics technology

02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:55.040
that nobody had seen there

02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:57.040
and it was a while before

02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:59.040
you know there were competitive things out there

02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:01.040
and it went a long

02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:03.040
time internally really not working

02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:05.040
where we were even building

02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:07.040
levels where the game

02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:09.040
just was not at all

02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:11.040
shippable with large fractions of the world

02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:13.040
like disappearing not being there

02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:15.040
I or being really

02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:17.040
slow in various parts of it and it

02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.040
was this act of faith it's like I think

02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:21.040
I'm going to be able to fix this I think

02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.040
I'm going to be able to make this work

02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:25.040
and lots of stuff

02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:27.040
changed where the level designers

02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:29.040
would build something then have to throw it away

02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:31.040
as something fundamental in the kind of graphics

02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:33.040
or level technology change

02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:35.040
and the I

02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:37.040
so there were two big things that

02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:39.040
contributed to making it possible

02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:41.040
at that time frame I am

02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:43.040
two new things there was certainly

02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:45.040
hardcore optimized low level assembly

02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:47.040
language and this is where I had hired

02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:49.040
Michael A. Brash away from

02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:51.040
Microsoft and he had been one of my

02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:53.040
early inspirations where that

02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:55.040
back in the soft disk days the library

02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:57.040
of magazines that they had

02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:59.040
some of my most treasured ones were

02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:01.040
Michael A. Brash's articles

02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:03.040
in Dr. Dobbs Journal and

02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:05.040
it was it was amazing after

02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:07.040
all of our success in Doom we were able to

02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:09.040
kind of hit him up and say hey we'd like

02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:11.040
you to come work at id software and he was

02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:13.040
in the senior technical role at Microsoft

02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:15.040
and I am you know and

02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:17.040
he was on track for and this was right when

02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:19.040
Microsoft was starting to take off and I

02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:21.040
did eventually you know

02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:23.040
convince him that what we were doing was

02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:25.040
going to be really amazing with quake it was

02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:27.040
going to it was going to be something nobody

02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:29.040
had seen before it had

02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:31.040
these aspects of what we were talking

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:33.040
about we had metaverse talk back then

02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:35.040
we you know we had read snow crash and

02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:37.040
we were we knew about this and

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:39.040
Michael was I was big

02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:41.040
into the science fiction and we would talk

02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:43.040
about all that and kind of spin this tail

02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:45.040
and it was some of the same conversations

02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:47.040
that we have today about the metaverse

02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:49.040
about how you could have different areas

02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:51.040
linked together by portals and you could have

02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:53.040
user-generated content and changing

02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:55.040
out all of these things so you really

02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.040
were creating the metaverse with quaking

02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:59.040
and we we talked about things like

02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:01.040
philosophically used to be advertised as a

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:03.040
virtual reality experience you know that

02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:05.040
was the first wave of virtual reality

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:07.040
was in the late 80s and early

02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:09.040
90s you had like the lawnmower man

02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:11.040
I'm you know movie and you had

02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:13.040
time in newsweek talking about the early

02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:15.040
VPL headsets and

02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:17.040
of course that cratered so hard that

02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:19.040
people didn't want to look at virtual reality

02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:21.040
for decades afterwards where

02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:23.040
it was just it was spoken

02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:25.040
mirrors it was not real in the sense

02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:27.040
that you could actually do something

02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:29.040
real and valuable with it but

02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:31.040
but still we had that kind of common

02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:33.040
set of talking points and we were talking

02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:35.040
about what these games could

02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:37.040
I could become and how you'd

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:39.040
like to see people building all of these

02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:41.040
creative things because we were seeing an

02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:43.040
explosion of work with doom at that time

02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:45.040
where people were doing amazingly

02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:47.040
cool things like we saw cooler

02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:49.040
levels that we had built coming out of the user

02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:51.040
community and then people finding

02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:53.040
ways to you know change that the characters

02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:55.040
in different ways and it was great and we

02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:57.040
knew what we were doing in quake was

02:58:57.040 --> 02:58:59.040
removing those last things there was

02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:01.040
some quirky things with a couple of

02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:03.040
the data types that didn't work right

02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:05.040
for overriding and that and then the core

02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:07.040
thing about the programming model

02:59:07.040 --> 02:59:09.040
and I was definitely going to hit all of those

02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:11.040
in quake I'm but

02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:13.040
the the graphic side of it was

02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:15.040
I was still

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:17.040
I knew what I wanted to do

02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:19.040
and it was one of these

02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:21.040
hubris things where it's like well

02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:23.040
so far I've been able to kind of

02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:25.040
kick everything that I set out

02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:27.040
to go do but quake

02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.040
was definitely a little bit

02:59:29.040 --> 02:59:31.040
more than could be comfortably chewed at

02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:33.040
that point and I

02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:35.040
but Michael was one of the

02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:37.040
one of the strongest programmers and

02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:39.040
graphics programmers that I knew

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:41.040
and he was one of the people that I trusted

02:59:41.040 --> 02:59:43.040
to to write assembly code

02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:45.040
you know better than I could and there's

02:59:45.040 --> 02:59:47.040
there's a few people that I can point to

02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:49.040
about things like this where I'm a world

02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:51.040
class optimizer I mean I make things

02:59:51.040 --> 02:59:53.040
go fast but I recognize

02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:55.040
there's a number of people that

02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:57.040
can write tighter assembly code

02:59:57.040 --> 02:59:59.040
tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA

02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:01.040
code then you know then I can write

03:00:01.040 --> 03:00:03.040
I'm you know my best strengths

03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:05.040
are a little bit more at the system

03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:07.040
level I mean I'm good at all of that

03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:09.040
but the most leverage

03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:11.040
comes from making the decisions that are a little

03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:13.040
bit higher up where you figure out

03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:15.040
how to change your large scale problems

03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:17.040
so that these lower level problems

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:19.040
are easier to do or it makes it possible

03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:21.040
to do them in a

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:23.040
in a uniquely fast way

03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:25.040
so most of my

03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:27.040
you know my big wins in a lot of ways

03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:29.040
from all the way from the early games through

03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:31.040
you know through VR and the aerospace

03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:33.040
work that I'm doing and or did

03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:35.040
and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:37.040
now is finding an angle on

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:39.040
something that means you trade

03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:41.040
off something that you maybe think

03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:43.040
you need but it turns out you don't need

03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:45.040
and by making a sacrifice in one

03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:47.040
place you can get big advantages

03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:49.040
in another place is it

03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:51.040
clear at which level of the system

03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:53.040
those big advantages

03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:55.040
can be gained it's not always

03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:57.040
clear and that's why the thing

03:00:57.040 --> 03:00:59.040
that that I try to make one of my

03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:01.040
core values and I

03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:03.040
proselytize to a lot of people is

03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:05.040
trying to know the entire stack

03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:07.040
no trying to see through

03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:09.040
everything that happens and it's almost

03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:11.040
impossible on like the web browser

03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:13.040
level of things where there's so many levels

03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:15.040
to it but you should at least understand

03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:17.040
what they all are even if you can't understand

03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:19.040
all the performance characteristics at

03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:21.040
each level but it goes all the

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:23.040
way down to literally the hardware

03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:25.040
so what does the what is this

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:27.040
chip capable of and

03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:29.040
what is this software that you're writing capable

03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:31.040
of and then with this architecture you put

03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:33.040
on top of that than the ecosystem around

03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:35.040
it all the people that are

03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:37.040
working on it so there are

03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:39.040
all these decisions and

03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:41.040
they're never made in a globally optimal way

03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:43.040
but sometimes you can drive a thread

03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:45.040
of global optimality through it

03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:47.040
you can't look at everything it's too complicated

03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:49.040
but sometimes you can step

03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:51.040
back up and make a different

03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:53.040
decision and we kind of went through this on the graphics

03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:55.040
side on quake where

03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:57.040
in some ways it was kind of bad where Michael

03:01:57.040 --> 03:01:59.040
would spend his time writing

03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:01.040
like I'd rough out the basic

03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:03.040
routines like okay here's our span

03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:05.040
rasterizer and he would spend a month

03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:07.040
writing this you know beautiful

03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:09.040
cycle optimized

03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:11.040
piece of assembly language that does

03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:13.040
you know does what I asked it to do

03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:15.040
and he did it faster than like my

03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:17.040
original code would do or probably what

03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:19.040
I would be able to do even if I had spent that month

03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:21.040
on it but then we'd have

03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:23.040
some cases when I'd be like okay

03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:25.040
well I figured out at this higher

03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.040
level instead of drawing these in a

03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:29.040
painter's order here I do a span buffer

03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:31.040
and it cuts out

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:33.040
30% or 40% of all of these

03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:35.040
pixels but it means you need to

03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:37.040
rewrite kind of this interface of all of that

03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:39.040
and I could tell that wore on him a little

03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:41.040
bit but in the end it was

03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:43.040
the right thing to do where we wound up

03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:45.040
changing that rasterization approach

03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:47.040
and we wound up with a super optimized

03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:49.040
assembly language

03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:51.040
core loop and then a good

03:02:51.040 --> 03:02:53.040
system around it which minimized how much that had

03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:55.040
to be called. And so in order

03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:57.040
to be able to do this kind of system level

03:02:57.040 --> 03:02:59.040
thinking whether we're talking about

03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:01.040
game development

03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:03.040
aerospace

03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:05.040
nuclear energy

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:07.040
AI

03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:09.040
VR you have to be able to understand

03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:11.040
the hardware the low level

03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:13.040
software the high level

03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:15.040
software the design decisions

03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:17.040
the whole thing the full stack

03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:19.040
of it. Yeah and that's where

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:21.040
a lot of these things become possible

03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:23.040
when you're really when you're bringing the future

03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:25.040
forward I mean there's a pace that everything

03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:27.040
just kind of glides towards where we have a

03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:29.040
lot of progress that's happening at such a

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:31.040
different so many different ways you kind of slide

03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:33.040
towards progress just left to your own

03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:35.040
programs just get faster for

03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:37.040
a while it wasn't clear if they were going to get

03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:39.040
fatter more than they get quicker than they get

03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:41.040
faster and it cancels out but it is

03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:43.040
clear now in retrospect now programs just

03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:45.040
get faster and have gotten faster

03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:47.040
for a long time but if you want

03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:49.040
to do something like back at that original

03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:51.040
talking about

03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:53.040
scrolling games say what this needs to be

03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:55.040
five times faster well

03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:57.040
we can wait six years

03:03:57.040 --> 03:03:59.040
and just it'll naturally get that much

03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:01.040
faster at that time

03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:03.040
or you come up with some really clever way of

03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:05.040
doing it so there are those

03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:07.040
opportunities like that in a whole bunch

03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:09.040
of different areas now

03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:11.040
most programmers don't need to be

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:13.040
thinking about that there's not that many

03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:15.040
you know there's a lot of opportunities for

03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:17.040
this but it's not everyone's work a day type

03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:19.040
stuff so everyone doesn't have to know

03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:21.040
how all these things work they don't have

03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:23.040
to know how their compiler works

03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:25.040
how you know the processor chip manages

03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:27.040
cache eviction and all these

03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:29.040
low-level things but

03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:31.040
sometimes there are powerful opportunities

03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:33.040
that you can look at and say

03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:35.040
we can bring the future

03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.040
five years faster

03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:39.040
you know we can do something that wouldn't it be

03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:41.040
great if we could do this well we can do

03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:43.040
it today if we make a certain

03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:45.040
set of decisions and

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.040
it is in some ways smoke and mirrors

03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:49.040
where you say it's like doom was

03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:51.040
a lot of smoke and mirrors where people

03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:53.040
thought it was more capable than it actually was

03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:55.040
but we picked the right

03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:57.040
smoke and mirrors to deploy in the game

03:04:57.040 --> 03:04:59.040
where by doing this

03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:01.040
people will think that it's more general

03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:03.040
if we are going to amaze them with what they've got here

03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:05.040
and they won't notice

03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:07.040
that it doesn't do these other things

03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:09.040
so smart decision making

03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:11.040
at that point that's where that

03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:13.040
that kind of global

03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:15.040
holistic top-down view

03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:17.040
can work and

03:05:17.040 --> 03:05:19.040
I'm

03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:21.040
really a strong believer that technology

03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:23.040
should be

03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:25.040
sitting at that table having those discussions

03:05:25.040 --> 03:05:27.040
because you do have cases where you say well

03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:29.040
you want to be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever

03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:31.040
where it's a pure design

03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:33.040
solution

03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:35.040
and that's in some cases

03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:37.040
now where you truly have almost infinite

03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:39.040
resources like if you're trying to do

03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:41.040
a scrolling game on the PC

03:05:41.040 --> 03:05:43.040
now you don't even have to talk to a technology

03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:45.040
person you can just have

03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:47.040
any intern can make that go run

03:05:47.040 --> 03:05:49.040
as fast as it needs to there and it can be

03:05:49.040 --> 03:05:51.040
completely design based

03:05:51.040 --> 03:05:53.040
but if you're trying to do something that's hard

03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:55.040
either that can't be done

03:05:55.040 --> 03:05:57.040
for resources like VR on a mobile

03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:59.040
chipset or that we don't even know

03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:01.040
how to do yet like artificial general intelligence

03:06:01.040 --> 03:06:03.040
it's probably going to be a matter of

03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:05.040
coming at it from an angle

03:06:05.040 --> 03:06:07.040
like I mean for AGI we have some of

03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:09.040
like some of the Hutter principles

03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:11.040
about how you can

03:06:11.040 --> 03:06:13.040
some of that there are theoretical ways

03:06:13.040 --> 03:06:15.040
you can say this is the optimal learning

03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:17.040
algorithm that can solve everything

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:19.040
but it's completely impractical

03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:21.040
you just can't do that

03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:23.040
so clearly you have to make some

03:06:23.040 --> 03:06:25.040
concessions for general intelligence

03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:27.040
and nobody knows what the right ones are

03:06:27.040 --> 03:06:29.040
yet so people are taking different

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:31.040
angles of attack I hope I've got something

03:06:31.040 --> 03:06:33.040
clever to come up with in that space

03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:35.040
it's been surprising to me

03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:37.040
and I think perhaps it is

03:06:37.040 --> 03:06:39.040
a principle of progress

03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:41.040
that smoking mirrors somehow

03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:43.040
you build the future

03:06:43.040 --> 03:06:45.040
you kind of

03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:47.040
fake it till you make it

03:06:47.040 --> 03:06:49.040
and you almost always make it and I think

03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:51.040
that's going to be the way we achieve AGI

03:06:51.040 --> 03:06:53.040
that's going to be the way we build

03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:55.040
consciousness into our machines

03:06:55.040 --> 03:06:57.040
is there's

03:06:57.040 --> 03:06:59.040
you know philosophers debate about

03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:01.040
the Turing test is essentially about

03:07:01.040 --> 03:07:03.040
faking it till you make it

03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:05.040
you start by faking it

03:07:05.040 --> 03:07:07.040
and I think that always leads

03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:09.040
to making it

03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:11.040
because if you look at history

03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:13.040
arguments when as soon as people start talking

03:07:13.040 --> 03:07:15.040
about qualia and consciousness

03:07:15.040 --> 03:07:17.040
and Chinese rooms and things it's like

03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:19.040
I just check out I just don't think there's any value

03:07:19.040 --> 03:07:21.040
in those conversations it's just like

03:07:21.040 --> 03:07:23.040
go ahead tell me it's not going to work

03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:25.040
I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways

03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:27.040
I don't know if you work with legged robots

03:07:27.040 --> 03:07:29.040
there's a bunch of these

03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:31.040
they make

03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:33.040
they sure as heck make me feel like they're conscious

03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:35.040
in a certain

03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:37.040
way that's not here today

03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:39.040
but is

03:07:39.040 --> 03:07:41.040
you could see the kernel

03:07:41.040 --> 03:07:43.040
it's like

03:07:43.040 --> 03:07:45.040
the flame

03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:47.040
the beginnings of a flame

03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:49.040
we don't have line of sight but there's

03:07:49.040 --> 03:07:51.040
glimmerings of light in the distance

03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:53.040
for all of these things

03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:55.040
I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room

03:07:55.040 --> 03:07:57.040
well let me ask you a human question here

03:07:57.040 --> 03:07:59.040
you've

03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:01.040
in the game design space

03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:03.040
you've done a lot of incredible work throughout

03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:05.040
but in terms of game design

03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:07.040
you've changed the world and there's a few people

03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:09.040
around you that did the same

03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:11.040
so famously there's some animosity

03:08:11.040 --> 03:08:13.040
there's much love

03:08:13.040 --> 03:08:15.040
but there's some animosity between you

03:08:15.040 --> 03:08:17.040
and John Romero

03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:19.040
what is at the core of that animosity

03:08:19.040 --> 03:08:21.040
and human tension

03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:23.040
so there really hasn't been

03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:25.040
I for a long time

03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:27.040
and even at the beginning it's like yes

03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:29.040
I did push Romero out of the company

03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:31.040
and

03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:33.040
this is one of the things that I look back

03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:35.040
when I was filing my younger self

03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:37.040
some

03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:39.040
advice about things

03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:41.040
the original

03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:43.040
founding kind of corporate structure

03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:45.040
of id software

03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.040
really led to a bunch of problems

03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:49.040
we started off with us as equal partners

03:08:49.040 --> 03:08:51.040
and we had a buy-sell agreement

03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:53.040
because we didn't want outsiders to be telling us

03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:55.040
what to do inside the company

03:08:55.040 --> 03:08:57.040
and that did lead to

03:08:57.040 --> 03:08:59.040
a bunch of the problems where I was sitting here

03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:01.040
going

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:03.040
I'm working harder than anyone

03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:05.040
I'm doing these technologies

03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:07.040
nobody's done before

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:09.040
but we're all equal partners

03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:11.040
and then I see somebody that's

03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:13.040
not working as hard

03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:15.040
and it's

03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:17.040
I can't say I was the most mature about that

03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:19.040
I was 20-something years old

03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:21.040
and it did

03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:23.040
bother me when I'm like everybody

03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:25.040
okay we need all pulled together

03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:27.040
and we've done it before everybody

03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:29.040
we know we can do this if we get together

03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:31.040
but not everybody wanted to do that

03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:33.040
for all time

03:09:33.040 --> 03:09:35.040
and I was the youngest one of the crowd

03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:37.040
there I had different

03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:39.040
sets of kind of backgrounds

03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:41.040
and motivations and left

03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:43.040
at that point where

03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:45.040
it was

03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:47.040
everybody has to be contributing

03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:49.040
up to this level or

03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:51.040
they need to get pushed out

03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:53.040
that was not a great

03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:55.040
situation and I look back on it

03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:57.040
and no

03:09:57.040 --> 03:09:59.040
I pushed people out of the company

03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:01.040
that could have contributed

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:03.040
if there was a different framework for them

03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:05.040
and the modern kind of Silicon Valley

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:07.040
let your stock vest over a time period

03:10:07.040 --> 03:10:09.040
and maybe it's non-voting stock

03:10:09.040 --> 03:10:11.040
and all those different things

03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:13.040
we knew nothing about any of that

03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:15.040
we didn't know what we were doing

03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:17.040
in terms of corporate structure

03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:19.040
so if you think the framework was different

03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:21.040
some of the human tension

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:23.040
it almost certainly would have

03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:25.040
I look back at that

03:10:25.040 --> 03:10:27.040
and it's like even trying to summon up

03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:29.040
in my mind it's like I know

03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:31.040
I was really really angry

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:33.040
about I am

03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:35.040
Romero not working as hard as I wanted him

03:10:35.040 --> 03:10:37.040
to work or not carrying

03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:39.040
his load on the design for Quake

03:10:39.040 --> 03:10:41.040
and coming up with things there

03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:43.040
but he was definitely doing things

03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:45.040
he made some of the best levels there

03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:47.040
he was working with our

03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:49.040
external teams like Raven on the licensing

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:51.040
side of things

03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:53.040
but there were differences

03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:55.040
of opinion about it

03:10:55.040 --> 03:10:57.040
but he landed right on his feet

03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:59.040
he got 20 million dollars

03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:01.040
from Eidos to go do Ion Storm

03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:03.040
and he got to do things his way

03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:05.040
and spun up three teams simultaneously

03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:07.040
because that was always one of the

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:09.040
challenging things in it

03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:11.040
where we were doing these single string

03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:13.040
one project after another

03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:15.040
and I think some of them

03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:17.040
wanted to grow the company more

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:19.040
and I didn't because I knew people

03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:21.040
that were saying that oh companies turned to shit

03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:23.040
they were like the employees

03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:25.040
it's just a different world there

03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:27.040
and I loved our little dozen people

03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:29.040
working on the projects

03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:31.040
but you can look at it and say

03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:33.040
well business realities matter

03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:35.040
it's like you're super successful here

03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:37.040
and we could take a swing and a miss

03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:39.040
on something but you do it a couple times

03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.040
and you're out of luck

03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:43.040
there's a reason companies try to have

03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:45.040
multiple teams running at one time

03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:47.040
I am

03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:49.040
and so I was doing something I didn't

03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:51.040
so if you look past all that

03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:53.040
you did create some amazing things together

03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:55.040
what did you love about John Romero

03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:57.040
what did you respect and appreciate about him

03:11:57.040 --> 03:11:59.040
what did you admire about him

03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:01.040
what did you learn from him

03:12:01.040 --> 03:12:03.040
when I met him he was the coolest programmer I had ever met

03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:05.040
he had done all of this stuff

03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:07.040
he had made all of these games

03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:09.040
he had worked at

03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:11.040
one of the companies that I thought was the coolest

03:12:11.040 --> 03:12:13.040
at Origin Systems

03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:15.040
and he knew all this stuff

03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:17.040
he made things happen fast

03:12:17.040 --> 03:12:19.040
he was also kind of a polymath about this

03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:21.040
where he could do, he made his own

03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:23.040
he drew his own art, he made his own levels

03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:25.040
as well as

03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:27.040
we worked on sound design systems

03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:29.040
on top of actually being a really good programmer

03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:31.040
and we had

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:33.040
we went through a little

03:12:33.040 --> 03:12:35.040
it was kind of fun where one of the early things that we did

03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:37.040
where there was kind of the young buck bit

03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:39.040
going in where I was

03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:41.040
the new guy and he was the

03:12:41.040 --> 03:12:43.040
he was the top man programmer

03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:45.040
at the soft disk area

03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:47.040
eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend

03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:49.040
that we were going to like race to

03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:51.040
implement this game to port one of our PC games

03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:53.040
back down to the Apple too

03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:55.040
and that was where we finally kind of became clear

03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:57.040
it's like, okay, Carmack stands

03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:59.040
a little bit apart on the programming side of things

03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:01.040
but Romero then

03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:03.040
very gracefully moved into

03:13:03.040 --> 03:13:05.040
well, he'll work on the tools

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:07.040
he'll work on the systems

03:13:07.040 --> 03:13:09.040
do some of the game design stuff as well as

03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:11.040
contributing on starting to lead the design

03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:13.040
aspects of a lot of things

03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:15.040
so he was

03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:17.040
enormously valuable in the early stuff

03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:19.040
and so much of Doom and even Quake

03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:21.040
have his stamp on it in a lot of ways

03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:23.040
but

03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:25.040
he wasn't at the same level of

03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:27.040
focus that I brought to

03:13:27.040 --> 03:13:29.040
the work that we were doing there

03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:31.040
and he really did

03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:33.040
we hit such a degree of success

03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:35.040
it was all in the

03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:37.040
press about that, the Rockstar game

03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:39.040
programmers

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:41.040
I mean it's the Beatles problem

03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:43.040
he aided up and he did personify

03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:45.040
there was the whole game developers

03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:47.040
with Ferraris

03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:49.040
that we had there

03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:51.040
and I thought that led to

03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:53.040
some challenges there

03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:55.040
but so much of

03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:57.040
the stuff that

03:13:57.040 --> 03:13:59.040
was great in the games did come from him

03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:01.040
and I would certainly not take that away

03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:03.040
from him and even after

03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:05.040
we parted ways and he took his swing

03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:07.040
with Eidos

03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:09.040
in some ways he was ahead of the curve

03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:11.040
with mobile gaming as well

03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:13.040
where one of his companies after

03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:15.040
Eidos was working on

03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:17.040
feature phone game development

03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:19.040
and I wound up doing some of that

03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:21.040
just before the iPhone crossing

03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:23.040
over into the iPhone phase there

03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:25.040
and that was something that clearly

03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:27.040
did turn out to be a huge thing although

03:14:27.040 --> 03:14:29.040
he was too early for

03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:31.040
what he was working on at that time

03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:33.040
you know we've had

03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:35.040
pretty cordial relationships where I was happy

03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.040
to talk with him anytime I'd run into him

03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:39.040
at a conference I haven't actually had

03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:41.040
some other people just say it's like

03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:43.040
you shouldn't go over there

03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:45.040
and give him the time of day

03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:47.040
or felt that Masters of Doom

03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:49.040
was I

03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:51.040
played things up in a way

03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:53.040
that I shouldn't be too happy with

03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:55.040
but I'm okay with all of that

03:14:55.040 --> 03:14:57.040
he's still got love in your heart

03:14:57.040 --> 03:14:59.040
I just talked with him like

03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:01.040
last year I guess it was even this year

03:15:01.040 --> 03:15:03.040
about mentioning that I'm going off doing this

03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:05.040
AI stuff I'm going big

03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:07.040
into artificial intelligence and

03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:09.040
he had a bunch of ideas for

03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:11.040
how AI is going to play into gaming

03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:13.040
and you know asked if I was interested in collaborating

03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:15.040
and it's not in line with what

03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:17.040
with what I'm doing but I do

03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:19.040
you know I wish almost everyone

03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:21.040
the best I mean I know I may

03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:23.040
not have parted on the best of terms with

03:15:23.040 --> 03:15:25.040
I you know with some people but

03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:27.040
I was thrilled to see Tom Hall

03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:29.040
I'm writing VR games now

03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:31.040
we wrote working on a game called Demio

03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:33.040
which is really an awesome

03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:35.040
VR game it's like Dungeons and Dragons

03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:37.040
we all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together

03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:39.040
that was one of the things that was what we did on Sundays

03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:41.040
in the early days I would

03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:43.040
Dungeon Master and they'd all play and

03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:45.040
I you know so it really made me smile

03:15:45.040 --> 03:15:47.040
seeing Tom involved with an RPG game

03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:49.040
in virtual reality

03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:51.040
you were the CTO

03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:53.040
of Oculus VR since

03:15:53.040 --> 03:15:55.040
2013 and maybe

03:15:55.040 --> 03:15:57.040
less than a year involved in a bit

03:15:57.040 --> 03:15:59.040
in 2019

03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:01.040
Oculus was acquired

03:16:01.040 --> 03:16:03.040
by Facebook now meta in

03:16:03.040 --> 03:16:05.040
2014

03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:07.040
you've spoken brilliantly about both the low level

03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:09.040
details the experimental design

03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:11.040
and the big picture vision of virtual reality

03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:13.040
let me ask you about

03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:15.040
the metaverse the big question here

03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:17.040
both philosophically and technically

03:16:17.040 --> 03:16:19.040
how hard is it to

03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:21.040
build the metaverse what is the metaverse

03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:23.040
in your view you started

03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:25.040
with discussing and thinking about Quake

03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:27.040
as a kind of metaverse

03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:29.040
as you think about it today

03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:31.040
what is the metaverse

03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:33.040
the thing that could create this

03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:35.040
compelling user value this experience

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:37.040
that will change the world

03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:39.040
and how hard is it to build it

03:16:39.040 --> 03:16:41.040
so the term comes from Neil Stevenson's

03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:43.040
book Snow Crash which many

03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:45.040
of us had read back in the 90s

03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:47.040
it was one of those kind of formative books

03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:49.040
and there was this

03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:51.040
sense that the

03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:53.040
the possibilities

03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:55.040
and kind of the freedom and

03:16:55.040 --> 03:16:57.040
unlimited capabilities to build a virtual

03:16:57.040 --> 03:16:59.040
world that that does whatever

03:16:59.040 --> 03:17:01.040
you want whatever you ask of it

03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:03.040
has been a powerful draw for generations

03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:05.040
of developers you know game developers

03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:07.040
specifically and people that are thinking

03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:09.040
about more more general purpose

03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:11.040
applications so we were

03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:13.040
talking about that back in the doom

03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:15.040
and quake days about how do you wind

03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:17.040
up with an interconnected set of worlds

03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:19.040
that you kind of visit from one to another

03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:21.040
and as web pages were becoming

03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:23.040
a thing you start thinking about how

03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:25.040
what is the interactive

03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:27.040
kind of 3D based equivalent of this

03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:29.040
and there were a lot of really

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:31.040
bad takes you had like

03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:33.040
vermal then virtual reality

03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:35.040
markup languages and there's

03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:37.040
aspects like that that

03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:39.040
that came from people saying well what

03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:41.040
what kind of capabilities should we develop

03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:43.040
to to enable this

03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:45.040
and that kind of capability first

03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:47.040
work has usually not panned

03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:49.040
out very well

03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:51.040
on the other hand we have successful

03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:53.040
games that started with things like doom

03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:55.040
and quake and communities that formed

03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:57.040
around those and whether

03:17:57.040 --> 03:17:59.040
it was server lists in the early days

03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:01.040
or literal portaling between different

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:03.040
games and then modern

03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:05.040
things that are on completely different

03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:07.040
order of magnitude like Minecraft and

03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:09.040
Fortnite that have 100 million

03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:11.040
plus users

03:18:11.040 --> 03:18:13.040
you know I still think that

03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:15.040
that's the right way to go to build the

03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:17.040
metaverse is you build something

03:18:17.040 --> 03:18:19.040
that's amazing that people love and people

03:18:19.040 --> 03:18:21.040
wind up spending all their time in

03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:23.040
because it's awesome and you expand the

03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:25.040
capabilities of that

03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:27.040
even if it's a very basic experience

03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:29.040
Minecraft

03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:31.040
is an amazing case study in so many

03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:33.040
things where what's been able

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:35.040
to be done with that is

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:37.040
really enlightening

03:18:37.040 --> 03:18:39.040
and there are other cases where

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:41.040
like right now Roblox is

03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:43.040
basically a game construction kit aimed at

03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:45.040
kids and that was capability first play

03:18:45.040 --> 03:18:47.040
and it's achieving scale that's on

03:18:47.040 --> 03:18:49.040
the same order of those things

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.040
so it's not impossible

03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:53.040
but my preferred bet would be

03:18:53.040 --> 03:18:55.040
you make something amazing that people love

03:18:55.040 --> 03:18:57.040
and you make it better and better

03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:59.040
and that's where I could say we could

03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:01.040
have gone back and followed a path kind of

03:19:01.040 --> 03:19:03.040
like that in the early days

03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:05.040
if you just kind of take the same game

03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:07.040
whether it's when Activision demonstrated

03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:09.040
that you could make Call of Duty every year

03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:11.040
and not only is it not bad

03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:13.040
people kind of love it and it's

03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:15.040
very profitable the idea

03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:17.040
that you could have taken something like that

03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:19.040
and take a great game

03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:21.040
release a new version every year that

03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:23.040
lets the capabilities grow and expand

03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:25.040
to start saying it's like okay it's a game

03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:27.040
about running around and shooting things

03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:29.040
but now you can have

03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:31.040
bring your media into it

03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:33.040
you can add persistence of

03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:35.040
social sense signs of life

03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:37.040
or whatever you want to add to it

03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:39.040
I still think that's

03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:41.040
you know quite a good

03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:43.040
position to take and I think that

03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:45.040
while Meta is doing a

03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.040
comes up capability approach with

03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:49.040
Horizon Worlds where

03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:51.040
it's a fairly general purpose

03:19:51.040 --> 03:19:53.040
creators can build whatever they want

03:19:53.040 --> 03:19:55.040
in their sort of thing

03:19:55.040 --> 03:19:57.040
you know it's hard to

03:19:57.040 --> 03:19:59.040
compare and compete with something like Fortnight

03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:01.040
which also has enormous amounts

03:20:01.040 --> 03:20:03.040
of creativity even though it was not

03:20:03.040 --> 03:20:05.040
designed originally as a general purpose

03:20:05.040 --> 03:20:07.040
sort of thing so there's

03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:09.040
we have examples on both sides

03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:11.040
me personally I would have bet on

03:20:11.040 --> 03:20:13.040
I'm trying to do

03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:15.040
an achievement valuable destination

03:20:15.040 --> 03:20:17.040
first and expanding from there

03:20:17.040 --> 03:20:19.040
so

03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:21.040
can you imagine the thing that

03:20:21.040 --> 03:20:23.040
will be kind of if we

03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:25.040
look back a couple centuries from now

03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:27.040
and you think about

03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:29.040
the experiences

03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:31.040
that marked the singularity

03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:33.040
the transition

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:35.040
where most of our

03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:37.040
world moved into virtual reality

03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:39.040
what do you think those experiences

03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:41.040
will look like

03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:43.040
do you think it's going to be kind of like the way the web

03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:45.040
slowly took over

03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:47.040
where you're the frog in the pot

03:20:47.040 --> 03:20:49.040
of water that's slowly heating up

03:20:49.040 --> 03:20:51.040
where having lived through all of that

03:20:51.040 --> 03:20:53.040
I remember when it was

03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:55.040
shocking to start seeing the first

03:20:55.040 --> 03:20:57.040
website address on a billboard

03:20:57.040 --> 03:20:59.040
when you're like hey my computer world is

03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:01.040
infecting the real world

03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:03.040
this is spreading out in some way

03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:05.040
but there's still when you look back

03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:07.040
and say well what made

03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:09.040
the web take off and

03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:11.040
it wasn't a big bang sort of

03:21:11.040 --> 03:21:13.040
moment there it was

03:21:13.040 --> 03:21:15.040
a bunch of little things that turned out

03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:17.040
not to even be the things that are relevant now

03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:19.040
that brought them into it

03:21:19.040 --> 03:21:21.040
well I wonder from

03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:23.040
like you said you're not a historian

03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:25.040
so maybe there's a historian

03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:27.040
out there that could

03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:29.040
really identify that moment

03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:31.040
data driven way

03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:33.040
it could be like MySpace or something like that

03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:35.040
maybe the first major

03:21:35.040 --> 03:21:37.040
social network that really reached

03:21:37.040 --> 03:21:39.040
into

03:21:39.040 --> 03:21:41.040
non-geek world

03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:43.040
or something like that

03:21:43.040 --> 03:21:45.040
I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians though

03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:47.040
looking for some of those

03:21:47.040 --> 03:21:49.040
kind of primary dominant causes

03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:51.040
where so many of these things are

03:21:51.040 --> 03:21:53.040
like we see an exponential curve

03:21:53.040 --> 03:21:55.040
but it's not because like one thing

03:21:55.040 --> 03:21:57.040
is going exponential it's because

03:21:57.040 --> 03:21:59.040
we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves

03:21:59.040 --> 03:22:01.040
overlapped on top of each other

03:22:01.040 --> 03:22:03.040
and they just happen to keep adding up

03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:05.040
so that you've got something kind of going

03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:07.040
to be exponential at any given point

03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:09.040
but no single one of them

03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:11.040
was the critical thing

03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:13.040
there were dozens and dozens of things

03:22:13.040 --> 03:22:15.040
I mean seeing the transitions of stuff

03:22:15.040 --> 03:22:17.040
like as obviously MySpace giving way

03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:19.040
to other things but even like blogging

03:22:19.040 --> 03:22:21.040
giving way to social media

03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:23.040
and getting resurrected in other guys'

03:22:23.040 --> 03:22:25.040
and things that happened there

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:27.040
dancing baby gift or whatever

03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:29.040
all your base now belong to us

03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:31.040
whatever those early memes

03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:33.040
that led to the modern memes

03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:35.040
the humor on the different

03:22:35.040 --> 03:22:37.040
evolution of humor on the internet

03:22:37.040 --> 03:22:39.040
that I'm sure the historians will also

03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:41.040
write books about

03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:43.040
from the different website that support

03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:45.040
to create the infrastructure for that humor

03:22:45.040 --> 03:22:47.040
like Reddit and all that kind of stuff

03:22:47.040 --> 03:22:49.040
so people will go back and they will name

03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:51.040
firsts and critical moments but

03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:53.040
it's probably going to be a poor approximation

03:22:53.040 --> 03:22:55.040
of what actually happens

03:22:55.040 --> 03:22:57.040
and we've already seen like in the VR

03:22:57.040 --> 03:22:59.040
space where

03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:01.040
it didn't play out the way we thought

03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:03.040
in terms of what was going to be like

03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:05.040
the modern era of VR basically

03:23:05.040 --> 03:23:07.040
started with my E3 demo of Doom 3

03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:09.040
on the Rift prototype so we're like

03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:11.040
first person shooters in VR

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:13.040
match made in heaven right

03:23:13.040 --> 03:23:15.040
and that didn't work out that way at all

03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:17.040
they have you know they have the most

03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:19.040
comfort problems with it and then

03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:21.040
the most popular virtual reality app

03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:23.040
is Beat Saber which nobody

03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:25.040
predicted back then

03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:27.040
what's that make you like

03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:29.040
from the first principles if you were to

03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:31.040
reverse engineer that

03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:33.040
why are these like

03:23:33.040 --> 03:23:35.040
silly fun games the most

03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:37.040
it actually makes very clear

03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:39.040
sense when you when you analyze it

03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:41.040
from hindsight and look at the

03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:43.040
engineering reasons where it's not

03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:45.040
just that it was a magical quirky idea

03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:47.040
it was something that played

03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:49.040
almost perfectly to what turned out to be

03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:51.040
the real strengths of VR where

03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:53.040
the one thing that I really underestimated

03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:55.040
importance in VR was the importance of

03:23:55.040 --> 03:23:57.040
the controllers you know I was still thinking

03:23:57.040 --> 03:23:59.040
about what to do a lot more with

03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:01.040
with the game pad and just the

03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:03.040
amazingness of taking any existing game

03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:05.040
being able to move your head around

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:07.040
and look around that that was

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:09.040
you know that was really amazing but

03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:11.040
the controllers were super important

03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:13.040
but the problem is so many things that you

03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:15.040
do with the controllers just

03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:17.040
suck it feels like it breaks the illusion

03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:19.040
like trying to pick up glasses with the

03:24:19.040 --> 03:24:21.040
controllers where you're like oh use the grip

03:24:21.040 --> 03:24:23.040
button when you're kind of close and it'll

03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:25.040
snap into your hand all of those

03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:27.040
and you do them and it's still part of the VR

03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:29.040
experience but

03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:31.040
Beat Saber winds up

03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:33.040
playing only to the strengths it

03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:35.040
completely hides all the weaknesses of it

03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:37.040
because you are holding something

03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:39.040
in your hand you keep a solid grip on it

03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:41.040
the whole time it slices through things

03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:43.040
without ever bumping into things you

03:24:43.040 --> 03:24:45.040
never get into the point where you know

03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:47.040
I'm knocking on this table but in VR

03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:49.040
my hand just goes right through it so

03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:51.040
you've got something that slices

03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:53.040
through so it's never your brain

03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:55.040
oh I should have hit something you've got a

03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:57.040
lightsaber here it's just you expect it to

03:24:57.040 --> 03:24:59.040
slice through everything

03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:01.040
audio and music turned out to be

03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:03.040
a really powerful aspect of virtual

03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:05.040
reality where you're blocking the world off

03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:07.040
and constructing the world around you

03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:09.040
and

03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:11.040
being something that can run efficiently on

03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:13.040
even this relatively low powered hardware

03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:15.040
and can have

03:25:15.040 --> 03:25:17.040
a valuable loop in a small

03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:19.040
amount of time where a lot of modern games

03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:21.040
you're supposed to sit down and play it for

03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:23.040
an hour just to get anywhere sometimes a new

03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:25.040
game takes an hour to get through the tutorial level

03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:27.040
and that's not good for VR for

03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:29.040
a couple reasons you do still have the comfort

03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:31.040
issues if you're moving around at all

03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:33.040
but you've also got just

03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:35.040
discomfort from the headset battery

03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:37.040
lifespan on the mobile versions

03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:39.040
so having things that do break down

03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:41.040
into three and four minute

03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:43.040
windows of play that turns out to be very

03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:45.040
valuable from a gameplay standpoint

03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:47.040
so it winds up being

03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:49.040
kind of a perfect storm of all of these things

03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:51.040
that are really good it doesn't have any

03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:53.040
of the comfort problems you're not navigating

03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:55.040
around you're standing still all the

03:25:55.040 --> 03:25:57.040
stuff flies at you it has

03:25:57.040 --> 03:25:59.040
placed audio strengths

03:25:59.040 --> 03:26:01.040
it adds the whole fitness in

03:26:01.040 --> 03:26:03.040
VR nobody was thinking about that

03:26:03.040 --> 03:26:05.040
back in the at the beginning and it turns

03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:07.040
out that that is an excellent

03:26:07.040 --> 03:26:09.040
daily fitness thing to be doing

03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:11.040
if you go play an hour

03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:13.040
of beat saver or supernatural or something

03:26:13.040 --> 03:26:15.040
that is legit solid

03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:17.040
exercise and it's

03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:19.040
more fun than doing it just about any other way

03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:21.040
there so that's kind of the

03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:23.040
arcade stage of things

03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:25.040
if I were to say with my

03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:27.040
experience with VR

03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:29.040
the thing that I think is powerful is

03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:31.040
the

03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:33.040
maybe it's not here yet

03:26:33.040 --> 03:26:35.040
but the degree to which it is immersive

03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:37.040
in the way

03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:39.040
that quake is immersive it takes you to

03:26:39.040 --> 03:26:41.040
another world for me

03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:43.040
because I'm a fan of role-playing games

03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:45.040
the

03:26:45.040 --> 03:26:47.040
Elder Scrolls series

03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:49.040
like Skyrim

03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:51.040
or even Daggerfall it just takes

03:26:51.040 --> 03:26:53.040
you to another world and when you're

03:26:53.040 --> 03:26:55.040
not in that world you miss not being

03:26:55.040 --> 03:26:57.040
there and then you just

03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:59.040
you kind of want to stay there forever

03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:01.040
because life is shitty

03:27:01.040 --> 03:27:03.040
and you just want to go to this

03:27:03.040 --> 03:27:05.040
place is that

03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:07.040
I there was a

03:27:07.040 --> 03:27:09.040
time when I we were

03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:11.040
kind of asked to come up with like what's your view

03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:13.040
about VR and

03:27:13.040 --> 03:27:15.040
you know my pitch was that it should

03:27:15.040 --> 03:27:17.040
be better inside the headset than outside

03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:19.040
it's the world as you want it

03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:21.040
and everybody thought that was dystopian

03:27:21.040 --> 03:27:23.040
and like that's like

03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:25.040
oh you're just going to forget about the world outside

03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:27.040
and I don't

03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:29.040
get that mindset where the

03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:31.040
idea that if you can make the world

03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:33.040
better inside the headset than

03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:35.040
outside you've just improved

03:27:35.040 --> 03:27:37.040
the person's life that has a headset

03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:39.040
that can wear it and

03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:41.040
there are plenty of things that we just can't do

03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:43.040
for everyone in the real world everybody can't

03:27:43.040 --> 03:27:45.040
have Richard Branson's private island

03:27:45.040 --> 03:27:47.040
but everyone can have a private VR island

03:27:47.040 --> 03:27:49.040
and it can have the things that they want on it

03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:51.040
and there's a lot of these kind of rival

03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:53.040
risk goods in the real world

03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:55.040
that VR can just be better

03:27:55.040 --> 03:27:57.040
at we can do a lot of

03:27:57.040 --> 03:27:59.040
things like that that can be very very rich

03:27:59.040 --> 03:28:01.040
so yeah I want the

03:28:01.040 --> 03:28:03.040
I think it's going to be a positive thing this world where

03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:05.040
people want to go back into their headset

03:28:05.040 --> 03:28:07.040
where it can be better than

03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:09.040
somebody that's living in a tiny apartment

03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:11.040
can have a palatial estate

03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:13.040
in virtual reality that can have all their friends

03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:15.040
from all over the world come over

03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:17.040
and visit them without everybody getting on a plane

03:28:17.040 --> 03:28:19.040
and meeting in some

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:21.040
place and dealing with all the other logistics hassles

03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:23.040
there is real value

03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:25.040
in the presence that

03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:27.040
you can get for remote meetings

03:28:27.040 --> 03:28:29.040
it's all the little things

03:28:29.040 --> 03:28:31.040
that we need to sort out but those are things

03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:33.040
that we have line of sight on

03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:35.040
people that have been in

03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:37.040
a good VR meeting using work rooms

03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:39.040
where you can say oh that was better

03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:41.040
than a zoom meeting but of course

03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:43.040
it's more of a hassle to get into it

03:28:43.040 --> 03:28:45.040
not everyone has a headset interoperability

03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:47.040
is worse you can't have

03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:49.040
you cap out at a certain number there's all

03:28:49.040 --> 03:28:51.040
these things that need to be fixed but that's

03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:53.040
one of those things you can look at and say we know

03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:55.040
there's value there we just need to

03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:57.040
really grind hard file off all

03:28:57.040 --> 03:28:59.040
the rough edges and make that possible

03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:01.040
so you do think we have line of sight

03:29:01.040 --> 03:29:03.040
because

03:29:03.040 --> 03:29:05.040
there's a

03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:07.040
reason like

03:29:07.040 --> 03:29:09.040
I do this podcast in person for example

03:29:11.040 --> 03:29:13.040
doing it remotely it's

03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:15.040
not the same and if you're somebody

03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:17.040
were to ask me why it's not the same I

03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:19.040
wouldn't be able to write down exactly why

03:29:19.040 --> 03:29:21.040
but you're

03:29:21.040 --> 03:29:23.040
saying that it's possible

03:29:23.040 --> 03:29:25.040
whatever the magic is for in person

03:29:25.040 --> 03:29:27.040
interaction

03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:29.040
that immersiveness of the experience

03:29:29.040 --> 03:29:31.040
we are

03:29:31.040 --> 03:29:33.040
almost there yes so

03:29:33.040 --> 03:29:35.040
the idea of like I

03:29:35.040 --> 03:29:37.040
doing a VR interview with

03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:39.040
someone I'm not saying it's here right

03:29:39.040 --> 03:29:41.040
now but you can see

03:29:41.040 --> 03:29:43.040
glimmers of what it should be and

03:29:43.040 --> 03:29:45.040
we largely know what would need

03:29:45.040 --> 03:29:47.040
to be fixed and improved

03:29:47.040 --> 03:29:49.040
to like you say there's a difference between

03:29:49.040 --> 03:29:51.040
at remote interview doing a

03:29:51.040 --> 03:29:53.040
podcast over zoom or something and face

03:29:53.040 --> 03:29:55.040
to face there's that sense of

03:29:55.040 --> 03:29:57.040
presence that immediacy the super

03:29:57.040 --> 03:29:59.040
low latency responsiveness

03:29:59.040 --> 03:30:01.040
being able to see all the subtle things there

03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:03.040
just occupying the same field

03:30:03.040 --> 03:30:05.040
of view and all of those are things that

03:30:05.040 --> 03:30:07.040
we absolutely can do in

03:30:07.040 --> 03:30:09.040
VR and that simple case

03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:11.040
of a small meeting with a couple

03:30:11.040 --> 03:30:13.040
people that's the much easier case

03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:15.040
than everybody thinks the ready player one multiverse

03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:17.040
with a thousand people going across

03:30:17.040 --> 03:30:19.040
that you know a huge bridge to amazing

03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:21.040
places that's harder in a lot

03:30:21.040 --> 03:30:23.040
of other technical ways not to say we

03:30:23.040 --> 03:30:25.040
can't also do that but that's further away

03:30:25.040 --> 03:30:27.040
and has more challenges but this small

03:30:27.040 --> 03:30:29.040
thing about being able to have a

03:30:29.040 --> 03:30:31.040
meeting with one or

03:30:31.040 --> 03:30:33.040
a few people and have it feel

03:30:33.040 --> 03:30:35.040
real feel like you're there

03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:37.040
I think you have the same interactions

03:30:37.040 --> 03:30:39.040
and talking with them you get subtle cues

03:30:39.040 --> 03:30:41.040
as we start getting eye and face tracking

03:30:41.040 --> 03:30:43.040
and some of the other things on high end

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:45.040
headsets a lot of that is

03:30:45.040 --> 03:30:47.040
going to come over and it

03:30:47.040 --> 03:30:49.040
doesn't have to be as good

03:30:49.040 --> 03:30:51.040
this is an important thing that people miss

03:30:51.040 --> 03:30:53.040
where there was a lot

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:55.040
of people that especially rich

03:30:55.040 --> 03:30:57.040
people that would look at VR and say

03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:59.040
it's like oh this just isn't

03:30:59.040 --> 03:31:01.040
that good and I'd say it's like well

03:31:01.040 --> 03:31:03.040
you've already been court side

03:31:03.040 --> 03:31:05.040
backstage and you know on pit row

03:31:05.040 --> 03:31:07.040
and you've done all of these experiences

03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:09.040
because you get to do them in real life

03:31:09.040 --> 03:31:11.040
but most people don't get to and

03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:13.040
even if the experience is only half as good

03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:15.040
if it's something that they never would have gotten

03:31:15.040 --> 03:31:17.040
to do before it's still a very good

03:31:17.040 --> 03:31:19.040
thing and as we can just we can

03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:21.040
push that number up over time

03:31:21.040 --> 03:31:23.040
it has a minimum viable

03:31:23.040 --> 03:31:25.040
value level when it

03:31:25.040 --> 03:31:27.040
does something that is valuable enough to people

03:31:27.040 --> 03:31:29.040
as long as it's better inside the headset

03:31:29.040 --> 03:31:31.040
on any metric than it is outside

03:31:31.040 --> 03:31:33.040
and people choose to go there we're on the

03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:35.040
right path and we have a value

03:31:35.040 --> 03:31:37.040
gradient that I'm just always hammering

03:31:37.040 --> 03:31:39.040
on we can just follow this value gradient

03:31:39.040 --> 03:31:41.040
just keep making things better

03:31:41.040 --> 03:31:43.040
rather than going for that

03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:45.040
one close your eyes swing for the

03:31:45.040 --> 03:31:47.040
fences I kind of

03:31:47.040 --> 03:31:49.040
silver bullet approach

03:31:49.040 --> 03:31:51.040
I wonder if there's a value gradient for in-person

03:31:51.040 --> 03:31:53.040
meetings because if you get that right

03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:55.040
I mean that would change the world

03:31:55.040 --> 03:31:57.040
it doesn't need to

03:31:57.040 --> 03:31:59.040
I mean you don't need a ready player one

03:31:59.040 --> 03:32:01.040
but I wonder

03:32:01.040 --> 03:32:03.040
if there's that value gradient you can

03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:05.040
follow along

03:32:05.040 --> 03:32:07.040
because if there is

03:32:07.040 --> 03:32:09.040
and you follow it then

03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:11.040
there'll be a certain like

03:32:11.040 --> 03:32:13.040
phase shift at a certain point

03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:15.040
where people will shift from

03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:17.040
from zoom

03:32:17.040 --> 03:32:19.040
to this

03:32:19.040 --> 03:32:21.040
I wonder

03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:23.040
what are the bottlenecks

03:32:23.040 --> 03:32:25.040
is it software is it hardware

03:32:25.040 --> 03:32:27.040
like is it all about latency

03:32:27.040 --> 03:32:29.040
so I have

03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:31.040
big arguments internally about

03:32:31.040 --> 03:32:33.040
strategic things like that where

03:32:33.040 --> 03:32:35.040
I like the next headset

03:32:35.040 --> 03:32:37.040
that's coming out that

03:32:37.040 --> 03:32:39.040
we've made various announcements about is going to be a

03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:41.040
higher-end headset more expensive

03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:43.040
more features lots of people want to make

03:32:43.040 --> 03:32:45.040
those trade-offs I

03:32:45.040 --> 03:32:47.040
you know we'll see what the market has to say

03:32:47.040 --> 03:32:49.040
about the exact trade-offs we've made

03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:51.040
here but if you want to replace zoom

03:32:51.040 --> 03:32:53.040
you need to have something that everybody

03:32:53.040 --> 03:32:55.040
has

03:32:55.040 --> 03:32:57.040
so you like cheaper

03:32:57.040 --> 03:32:59.040
I like cheaper because also

03:32:59.040 --> 03:33:01.040
lighter and cheaper wind up being

03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:03.040
a virtuous cycle there

03:33:03.040 --> 03:33:05.040
where expensive and more

03:33:05.040 --> 03:33:07.040
features tends to also lead towards heavier

03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:09.040
and it just kind of goes it's like let's add more

03:33:09.040 --> 03:33:11.040
features the features are not

03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:13.040
you know they have physical

03:33:13.040 --> 03:33:15.040
presence and weight and draw from batteries

03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:17.040
and all of those things so I've always

03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:19.040
favored a lower-end

03:33:19.040 --> 03:33:21.040
cheaper faster approach

03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:23.040
that's why I was always behind the

03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:25.040
mobile side of VR rather than the higher-end

03:33:25.040 --> 03:33:27.040
PC headsets and I think that's

03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:29.040
you know that's proven out well

03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:31.040
but there's I you always

03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:33.040
ideally we have a whole range of things but

03:33:33.040 --> 03:33:35.040
if you've only got one or two things

03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:37.040
it's important that those two things cover

03:33:37.040 --> 03:33:39.040
the you know the scope that

03:33:39.040 --> 03:33:41.040
you think is most important when we're in a

03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:43.040
world when it's like cell phones and there's 50

03:33:43.040 --> 03:33:45.040
of them on the market covering every conceivable

03:33:45.040 --> 03:33:47.040
ecological niche you want

03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:49.040
that's going to be great but we're not going to be there

03:33:49.040 --> 03:33:51.040
for a while. Where are the bottlenecks?

03:33:51.040 --> 03:33:53.040
Is it the hardware or the software?

03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:55.040
Yeah so right now

03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:57.040
you can play you can get

03:33:57.040 --> 03:33:59.040
work rooms on Quest and

03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:01.040
you can set up these things and it's a pretty

03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:03.040
good experience it's surprisingly good. I haven't

03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:05.040
tried it it's surprisingly good

03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:07.040
yeah the voice latency is better

03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:09.040
on that than a lot

03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:11.040
better than a zoom meeting so you've got

03:34:11.040 --> 03:34:13.040
a more a better sense of immediacy there

03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:15.040
the expressions that you

03:34:15.040 --> 03:34:17.040
get from the current hardware

03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:19.040
with just kind of your controllers

03:34:19.040 --> 03:34:21.040
and your head is pretty realistic

03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:23.040
feeling you've got a pretty good sense of being

03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:25.040
there with someone. Are these like

03:34:25.040 --> 03:34:27.040
avatars

03:34:27.040 --> 03:34:29.040
of people? Do you get

03:34:29.040 --> 03:34:31.040
to see their body and

03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:33.040
they're sitting around a table? Yeah

03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:35.040
and it feels

03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:37.040
better than zoom? Yeah better than you'd

03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:39.040
expect for that it is definitely

03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:41.040
yeah I'd say

03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:43.040
it's quite a bit better than zoom when everything

03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:45.040
is working right but there's still

03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:47.040
all the rough edges of the reason zoom

03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:49.040
became so successful is because they just

03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:51.040
nailed the usability of everything

03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:53.040
it's high quality with a absolutely

03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:55.040
first-rate experience

03:34:55.040 --> 03:34:57.040
and we are not there yet with

03:34:57.040 --> 03:34:59.040
any of the VR stuff I'm trying to

03:34:59.040 --> 03:35:01.040
to push hard to get

03:35:01.040 --> 03:35:03.040
I keep talking about it's like it needs to just

03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:05.040
be one click to make everything happen

03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:07.040
and we're getting there in our home

03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:09.040
environment not the whole work rooms application

03:35:09.040 --> 03:35:11.040
but the main home where you can now

03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:13.040
kind of go over and click and invite and

03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:15.040
still winds up taking five times longer

03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:17.040
than it should but we're getting

03:35:17.040 --> 03:35:19.040
close to that where you click there

03:35:19.040 --> 03:35:21.040
they click on their button and then

03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:23.040
they're sitting there in this good presence

03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:25.040
with you but latencies need

03:35:25.040 --> 03:35:27.040
to get a lot better user interface needs

03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:29.040
to get a lot better I'm

03:35:29.040 --> 03:35:31.040
ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better

03:35:31.040 --> 03:35:33.040
we need to have a hundred million of them

03:35:33.040 --> 03:35:35.040
out there just so that everybody knows

03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:37.040
somebody that uses this all the time

03:35:37.040 --> 03:35:39.040
well I think it's a virtual cycle because I do

03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:41.040
think

03:35:41.040 --> 03:35:43.040
the interface

03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:45.040
is the thing that makes

03:35:45.040 --> 03:35:47.040
or breaks this kind

03:35:47.040 --> 03:35:49.040
of revolution it's so interesting how

03:35:49.040 --> 03:35:51.040
like you said one click but it's also

03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:53.040
like how you achieve that one click

03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:55.040
I don't know what is

03:35:57.040 --> 03:35:59.040
can I ask a dark question maybe let's

03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:01.040
keep it outside of meta but

03:36:01.040 --> 03:36:03.040
this is about meta but also

03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:05.040
Google and big company

03:36:05.040 --> 03:36:07.040
are they able to do this kind

03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:09.040
of thing it seems like

03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:11.040
let me put on my cranky old

03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:13.040
man hat is they

03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:15.040
seem to not do a good

03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:17.040
job of

03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:19.040
creating these user

03:36:19.040 --> 03:36:21.040
friendly interfaces as they get

03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:23.040
bigger and bigger as a company like

03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:25.040
Google has created some of the greatest interfaces

03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:27.040
ever

03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:29.040
early on and it's I mean creating Gmail

03:36:29.040 --> 03:36:31.040
just so

03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:33.040
many brilliant

03:36:33.040 --> 03:36:35.040
interfaces and she seems to be getting

03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:37.040
crappier and crappier at that

03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:39.040
same with meta same

03:36:39.040 --> 03:36:41.040
with

03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:43.040
Microsoft it's just it

03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:45.040
seems to get worse and worse at that

03:36:45.040 --> 03:36:47.040
I don't know what is it because you become

03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:49.040
more conservative careful risk

03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:51.040
averse is that why

03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:53.040
can you speak to that? So it's been really eye

03:36:53.040 --> 03:36:55.040
opening to me working inside a tech

03:36:55.040 --> 03:36:57.040
Titan where I

03:36:57.040 --> 03:36:59.040
you know I had my small

03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:01.040
companies and then we're acquired by

03:37:01.040 --> 03:37:03.040
a you know a midsize game publisher

03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:05.040
and then

03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:07.040
Oculus getting acquired by meta

03:37:07.040 --> 03:37:09.040
and meta has grown by a factor of many

03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:11.040
just in the eight years

03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:13.040
since the acquisition

03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:15.040
so I did not have

03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:17.040
experience with this and it's

03:37:17.040 --> 03:37:19.040
it was interesting because I remember

03:37:19.040 --> 03:37:21.040
like previously my benchmark for

03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:23.040
kind of use of resources

03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:25.040
was some of the government programs I interacted

03:37:25.040 --> 03:37:27.040
with on the aerospace side

03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:29.040
and I remember thinking there was

03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:31.040
an Air Force program and they spent 50

03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:33.040
million dollars and they didn't

03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:35.040
they didn't launch anything they didn't even build

03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:37.040
anything it was just kind of like they

03:37:37.040 --> 03:37:39.040
you know they made a bunch of papers

03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:41.040
and had some parts in a warehouse

03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:43.040
and nothing came of it it's like 50 million

03:37:43.040 --> 03:37:45.040
dollars

03:37:45.040 --> 03:37:47.040
and I have I've had to radically

03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:49.040
recalibrate my sense of

03:37:49.040 --> 03:37:51.040
like how much money can be spent with

03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:53.040
without a product at the end resources

03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:55.040
where

03:37:55.040 --> 03:37:57.040
on the plus side VR

03:37:57.040 --> 03:37:59.040
has turned out we've built

03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:01.040
pretty much exactly

03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:03.040
what you know we just passed

03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:05.040
the 10-year mark then from my I like

03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:07.040
my first demo of the Rift

03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:09.040
and if I could have said what I wanted

03:38:09.040 --> 03:38:11.040
to have it would have been

03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:13.040
a standalone inside out tracked

03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:15.040
4k resolution headset

03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:17.040
that I that could still plug into

03:38:17.040 --> 03:38:19.040
a PC for high-end rendering and that's

03:38:19.040 --> 03:38:21.040
exactly what we've got on Quest 2

03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:23.040
first of all let's pause on that with me

03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:25.040
being cranky and everything

03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:27.040
it's what meta achieved

03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:29.040
with Oculus and so on is incredible

03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:31.040
I mean this is

03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:33.040
this what when I thought

03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:35.040
about the future of VR this is what I imagine

03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:37.040
in terms of hardware I would say

03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:39.040
and maybe in terms of the experience as well

03:38:39.040 --> 03:38:41.040
but it's still not there somehow

03:38:41.040 --> 03:38:43.040
on the one hand

03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:45.040
we did kind of achieve it and win and we've got

03:38:45.040 --> 03:38:47.040
we've sold you know we're a success

03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:49.040
right now but

03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:51.040
the amount of resources that have gone into

03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:53.040
it it winds up getting cluttered up in

03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:55.040
accounting where last mark

03:38:55.040 --> 03:38:57.040
did announce that they spent

03:38:57.040 --> 03:38:59.040
ten billion dollars a year like on

03:38:59.040 --> 03:39:01.040
reality labs now reality labs

03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:03.040
covers a lot it was VR

03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:05.040
was not the large part of it also had

03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:07.040
portal and spark and the big AR

03:39:07.040 --> 03:39:09.040
research efforts and

03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:11.040
it's been expanding out to include AI

03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:13.040
and other things there where

03:39:13.040 --> 03:39:15.040
I there's a lot going on there

03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:17.040
but ten billion

03:39:17.040 --> 03:39:19.040
dollars was just a number that I had

03:39:19.040 --> 03:39:21.040
trouble processing it just

03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:23.040
I feel sick to my stomach thinking about

03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:25.040
that much money being spent

03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:27.040
but that's how they demonstrate commitment

03:39:27.040 --> 03:39:29.040
to this where it's not

03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:31.040
I'm more so than

03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:33.040
like yeah Google goes and cancels all of these

03:39:33.040 --> 03:39:35.040
projects I had different things I

03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:37.040
like that while meta is

03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:39.040
really sticking with the funding of

03:39:39.040 --> 03:39:41.040
VR and AR is still

03:39:41.040 --> 03:39:43.040
further out with it so there's something to be said

03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:45.040
for that I

03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:47.040
it's not just going to vanish the works going in

03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:49.040
I just wish it could be

03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:51.040
those resources could be applied more

03:39:51.040 --> 03:39:53.040
effectively because I see

03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:55.040
all these cases I point out these examples

03:39:55.040 --> 03:39:57.040
of how a third party

03:39:57.040 --> 03:39:59.040
that we're kind of competing with in various ways

03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:01.040
there's a number of these examples and they

03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:03.040
do work with a tenth

03:40:03.040 --> 03:40:05.040
of the people that we do internally

03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:07.040
and a lot of it comes from

03:40:07.040 --> 03:40:09.040
yes there's the small company

03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:11.040
can just go do it while in a big

03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:13.040
company you do have to worry about

03:40:13.040 --> 03:40:15.040
I you know is there some

03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:17.040
SDK internally that you should be using

03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:19.040
other teams making it you have to have your

03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:21.040
cross functional group meetups

03:40:21.040 --> 03:40:23.040
for different things you do have more

03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:25.040
concerns about you know about privacy

03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:27.040
or diversity and equity and

03:40:27.040 --> 03:40:29.040
I'm safety of different things

03:40:29.040 --> 03:40:31.040
parental issues and things that a small

03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:33.040
startup company can just kind of you know

03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:35.040
cowboy off and do

03:40:35.040 --> 03:40:37.040
something interesting and there's a lot

03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:39.040
more that is a problem

03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:41.040
that you have to pay attention to in the big

03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:43.040
companies but I'm not willing to believe that

03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:45.040
we are within even a factor

03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:47.040
of two or four of what the

03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:49.040
efficiency could be you know I

03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:51.040
am constantly kind of

03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:53.040
crying out for it's like we can do better than

03:40:53.040 --> 03:40:55.040
this and you wonder what the mechanisms

03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:57.040
to unlock that efficiency

03:40:57.040 --> 03:40:59.040
are you know I don't

03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:01.040
there is some sense in a large company

03:41:01.040 --> 03:41:03.040
that

03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:05.040
like an individual engineer might not

03:41:05.040 --> 03:41:07.040
believe that they can change the world

03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:09.040
maybe you delegate a little bit

03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:11.040
of the responsibility

03:41:11.040 --> 03:41:13.040
to be the one who changes the world

03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:15.040
in a big company I think

03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:17.040
but the reality is

03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:19.040
like the world will get changed

03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:21.040
by a single engineer anyway

03:41:21.040 --> 03:41:23.040
so if whether inside google

03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:25.040
or inside a startup it doesn't matter

03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:27.040
it's just like google and

03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:29.040
meta needs to help those engineers believe

03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:31.040
they're the ones that are going to decrease

03:41:31.040 --> 03:41:33.040
that latency is it'll

03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:35.040
take one John Carmack like the

03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:37.040
20 year old Carmack

03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:39.040
that's inside meta right now

03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:41.040
to change everything and I try to

03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:43.040
point that out and push people

03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:45.040
it's like try to go ahead

03:41:45.040 --> 03:41:47.040
and when you see some because there is

03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:49.040
you get the silo mentality where you're like

03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:51.040
okay I know something's not right over there

03:41:51.040 --> 03:41:53.040
but that's I'm staying in my lane here

03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:55.040
and there's there's a couple people

03:41:55.040 --> 03:41:57.040
that I can you know I can

03:41:57.040 --> 03:41:59.040
think about that are willing to just like hop

03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:01.040
all over the place and man I treasure them

03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:03.040
the people that are just willing to

03:42:03.040 --> 03:42:05.040
they're fearless you know they will go over

03:42:05.040 --> 03:42:07.040
and they will go rebuild the kernel and change

03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:09.040
this distribution and go in and hack

03:42:09.040 --> 03:42:11.040
firmware over here to to get something

03:42:11.040 --> 03:42:13.040
done right and that is

03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:15.040
relatively rare you know there's thousands

03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:17.040
of developers and you've got a small handful

03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:19.040
that are willing to operate at that level

03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:21.040
and you know and it's

03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:23.040
potentially risky for them the the politics

03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:25.040
are you know are real in a lot of that and

03:42:25.040 --> 03:42:27.040
I'm in the you know very much the privileged

03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:29.040
position of I am

03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:31.040
you know I'm more or less untouchable

03:42:31.040 --> 03:42:33.040
there where I've been dinged like

03:42:33.040 --> 03:42:35.040
twice for it's like you said something insensitive

03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:37.040
in that post and I and you should probably

03:42:37.040 --> 03:42:39.040
not say that I am

03:42:39.040 --> 03:42:41.040
but for the most part yes I you know I get

03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:43.040
away with I every week I'm

03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:45.040
posting something you know pretty loud

03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:47.040
and opinionated in you know internally

03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:49.040
and I think that's useful for

03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:51.040
the company but

03:42:51.040 --> 03:42:53.040
I am yeah it's not

03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:55.040
it's rare to have a position like that and I

03:42:55.040 --> 03:42:57.040
can't necessarily offer advice for how

03:42:57.040 --> 03:42:59.040
someone can do that I

03:42:59.040 --> 03:43:01.040
well you could offer advice to a company

03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:03.040
in general to give a little bit

03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:05.040
of freedom for the

03:43:05.040 --> 03:43:07.040
young wild the wildest ideas come

03:43:07.040 --> 03:43:09.040
from the young minds

03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:11.040
and so

03:43:11.040 --> 03:43:13.040
you need to give the young minds freedom

03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:15.040
to think big and wild

03:43:15.040 --> 03:43:17.040
and crazy and for that

03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:19.040
they have to be opinionated they have to

03:43:19.040 --> 03:43:21.040
be

03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:23.040
they have to think crazy ideas

03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:25.040
and thoughts and pursue

03:43:25.040 --> 03:43:27.040
them with a full passion without being slowed

03:43:27.040 --> 03:43:29.040
down by bureaucracy or managers

03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:31.040
and all that kind of stuff

03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:33.040
obviously startups really empower that but

03:43:33.040 --> 03:43:35.040
big companies could too and that's

03:43:35.040 --> 03:43:37.040
that's a design challenge for company

03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:39.040
for big companies to see how can you

03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:41.040
enable that how can you

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:43.040
there are so many resources

03:43:43.040 --> 03:43:45.040
and they do you know amazing

03:43:45.040 --> 03:43:47.040
things do get accomplished but

03:43:47.040 --> 03:43:49.040
there's so much more that could come out

03:43:49.040 --> 03:43:51.040
of that and you know I'm hope I'm always

03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:53.040
hopeful I'm an optimist in almost everything

03:43:53.040 --> 03:43:55.040
you know I think things can get better I

03:43:55.040 --> 03:43:57.040
think that they can improve things that

03:43:57.040 --> 03:43:59.040
you go through a path and you're learning

03:43:59.040 --> 03:44:01.040
kind of what does and doesn't work

03:44:01.040 --> 03:44:03.040
and I'm not I'm not ready to be fatalistic

03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:05.040
about the kind of the outcome

03:44:05.040 --> 03:44:07.040
of any of that

03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:09.040
me neither I know too many good people

03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:11.040
inside of those large companies that are incredible

03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:13.040
you have a

03:44:13.040 --> 03:44:15.040
friendship with Elon Musk

03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:17.040
often when I talk to him

03:44:17.040 --> 03:44:19.040
he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer

03:44:19.040 --> 03:44:21.040
and just a big picture

03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:23.040
thinker you are his huge

03:44:23.040 --> 03:44:25.040
amount of respect for you

03:44:25.040 --> 03:44:27.040
I just

03:44:27.040 --> 03:44:29.040
I've never been a fly in the wall between

03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:31.040
the discussion between the two of you I just wonder

03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:33.040
is there something you guys

03:44:33.040 --> 03:44:35.040
debate

03:44:35.040 --> 03:44:37.040
argue about discuss is there

03:44:37.040 --> 03:44:39.040
some interesting problems that the two of you

03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:41.040
think about

03:44:41.040 --> 03:44:43.040
you come from different worlds maybe there's

03:44:43.040 --> 03:44:45.040
some intersection

03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:47.040
in aerospace maybe there's some intersection

03:44:47.040 --> 03:44:49.040
in your

03:44:49.040 --> 03:44:51.040
new efforts in artificial intelligence

03:44:51.040 --> 03:44:53.040
in terms of thinking

03:44:53.040 --> 03:44:55.040
is there something interesting you could say about

03:44:55.040 --> 03:44:57.040
sort of the debates the two of you have

03:44:57.040 --> 03:44:59.040
so I think in some ways

03:44:59.040 --> 03:45:01.040
we do have a kind of similar background

03:45:01.040 --> 03:45:03.040
where we're almost exactly the same age

03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:05.040
and we had kind of similar

03:45:05.040 --> 03:45:07.040
programming backgrounds on the personal computers

03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:09.040
and

03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:11.040
even some of the books that we would read and things

03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:13.040
that would kind of turn us into the people

03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:15.040
that we are today

03:45:15.040 --> 03:45:17.040
and I think there is a

03:45:17.040 --> 03:45:19.040
degree of

03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:21.040
sensibility similarities where

03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:23.040
we kind of call bullshit on the same things

03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:25.040
and kind of see the same opportunities

03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:27.040
in different technology

03:45:27.040 --> 03:45:29.040
and there's that sense of

03:45:29.040 --> 03:45:31.040
I always talk about the speed of light solutions

03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:33.040
for things and he's thinking about

03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:35.040
kind of minimum manufacturing

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:37.040
and engineering and operational

03:45:37.040 --> 03:45:39.040
standpoints for things

03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:41.040
and

03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:43.040
so I mean I first met Elon

03:45:43.040 --> 03:45:45.040
right at the start of the aerospace era

03:45:45.040 --> 03:45:47.040
where I wasn't familiar with

03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:49.040
I was still in my game dev bubble

03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:51.040
I really wasn't familiar with all the startups

03:45:51.040 --> 03:45:53.040
that were going and being successful

03:45:53.040 --> 03:45:55.040
with PayPal and all of his different companies

03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:57.040
but I met him as I was starting

03:45:57.040 --> 03:45:59.040
to do Armadillo Aerospace

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:01.040
and he came down with

03:46:01.040 --> 03:46:03.040
kind of his right hand propulsion guy

03:46:03.040 --> 03:46:05.040
and we talked about rockets

03:46:05.040 --> 03:46:07.040
what can we do with this

03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:09.040
and it was kind of specific things

03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:11.040
about like how are our flight

03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:13.040
computers set up, what are different propellant

03:46:13.040 --> 03:46:15.040
options, what

03:46:15.040 --> 03:46:17.040
can happen with different

03:46:17.040 --> 03:46:19.040
ways of putting things together

03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:21.040
and then in some

03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:23.040
ways he was certainly the biggest player

03:46:23.040 --> 03:46:25.040
in the sort of alt space community

03:46:25.040 --> 03:46:27.040
that was going on in the early 2000s

03:46:27.040 --> 03:46:29.040
he was

03:46:29.040 --> 03:46:31.040
the most well funded although

03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:33.040
you know his funding in the larger scheme of things

03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:35.040
compared to a

03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:37.040
like a NASA or something like that

03:46:37.040 --> 03:46:39.040
was really tiny, it was a lot more

03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:41.040
than I had at the time

03:46:41.040 --> 03:46:43.040
but it was interesting

03:46:43.040 --> 03:46:45.040
I had a point years later when I realized

03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:47.040
okay my

03:46:47.040 --> 03:46:49.040
my financial resources at this point

03:46:49.040 --> 03:46:51.040
were basically what Elon's was

03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:53.040
when he went all in on

03:46:53.040 --> 03:46:55.040
SpaceX and Tesla

03:46:55.040 --> 03:46:57.040
and there's

03:46:57.040 --> 03:46:59.040
I think in many corners he does not

03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:01.040
get the respect that he should

03:47:01.040 --> 03:47:03.040
about being a wealthy person

03:47:03.040 --> 03:47:05.040
that could just retire

03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:07.040
and he went all in where

03:47:07.040 --> 03:47:09.040
he was really going to

03:47:09.040 --> 03:47:11.040
you know he could have gone bust

03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:13.040
and there's plenty of people

03:47:13.040 --> 03:47:15.040
you look at the you know the sad

03:47:15.040 --> 03:47:17.040
athletes or entertainers

03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:19.040
that had all the money in the world and blew it

03:47:19.040 --> 03:47:21.040
he could have been the business case

03:47:21.040 --> 03:47:23.040
example of that

03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:25.040
but you know the things

03:47:25.040 --> 03:47:27.040
that he was doing space exploration

03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:29.040
electrification of transportation

03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:31.040
on solar city type things

03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:33.040
these are big

03:47:33.040 --> 03:47:35.040
world level things

03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:37.040
and I have a great deal of admiration

03:47:37.040 --> 03:47:39.040
that he was willing to throw himself

03:47:39.040 --> 03:47:41.040
so completely into that

03:47:41.040 --> 03:47:43.040
because in contrast with myself

03:47:43.040 --> 03:47:45.040
I was doing armadillo aerospace

03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:47.040
with this tightly bounded

03:47:47.040 --> 03:47:49.040
it was John's crazy money

03:47:49.040 --> 03:47:51.040
at the time that had a finite limit

03:47:51.040 --> 03:47:53.040
on it it was never going to impact

03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:55.040
me or my family

03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:57.040
if it completely failed

03:47:57.040 --> 03:47:59.040
and I was still hedging my bets

03:47:59.040 --> 03:48:01.040
working at idsoftware at the time

03:48:01.040 --> 03:48:03.040
when he had been

03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:05.040
really all in there

03:48:05.040 --> 03:48:07.040
and I have a huge amount of respect

03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:09.040
for that and people do not

03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:11.040
the other thing I get irritated with

03:48:11.040 --> 03:48:13.040
is people would say it's like oh Elon's

03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:15.040
business guy

03:48:15.040 --> 03:48:17.040
he was gifted the money

03:48:17.040 --> 03:48:19.040
and he's just kind of investing

03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:21.040
in all of this when

03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:23.040
he was really deeply involved

03:48:23.040 --> 03:48:25.040
in a lot of the decisions

03:48:25.040 --> 03:48:27.040
not all of them were perfect

03:48:27.040 --> 03:48:29.040
but he cared very much about

03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:31.040
engine material selection

03:48:31.040 --> 03:48:33.040
propellant selection

03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:35.040
for years he'd be kind of telling me

03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:37.040
it's like get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff

03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:39.040
it's like liquid oxygen

03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:41.040
is the only proper oxidizer

03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:43.040
for this

03:48:43.040 --> 03:48:45.040
and like the times

03:48:45.040 --> 03:48:47.040
that I've gone through the factories with him

03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:49.040
we're talking

03:48:49.040 --> 03:48:51.040
very detailed things about

03:48:51.040 --> 03:48:53.040
how this weld is made

03:48:53.040 --> 03:48:55.040
how this sub-assembly goes together

03:48:55.040 --> 03:48:57.040
what are start up shut down

03:48:57.040 --> 03:48:59.040
behaviors of the different things

03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:01.040
so he is really

03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:03.040
in there at a very detailed

03:49:03.040 --> 03:49:05.040
level and I think that he is

03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:07.040
the best modern example

03:49:07.040 --> 03:49:09.040
now of someone that tries to

03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:11.040
effectively micromanage some decisions

03:49:11.040 --> 03:49:13.040
on things on both Tesla

03:49:13.040 --> 03:49:15.040
you know and SpaceX to some degree

03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:17.040
where he cares enough about it

03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:19.040
I worry a lot that he stretched too thin

03:49:19.040 --> 03:49:21.040
that you get boring company

03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:23.040
in Neuralink and Twitter

03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:25.040
all the other possible things there

03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:27.040
where I know I've got

03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:29.040
I've got limits on how much

03:49:29.040 --> 03:49:31.040
I can pay attention to

03:49:31.040 --> 03:49:33.040
that I have to kind of box off different amounts

03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:35.040
of time and I look back at

03:49:35.040 --> 03:49:37.040
my aerospace side of things it's like I did

03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:39.040
not go all in on that I did not

03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:41.040
commit myself at a level that it would

03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:43.040
have taken to be successful there

03:49:43.040 --> 03:49:45.040
and I

03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:47.040
and it's kind of a weird thing just

03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:49.040
like having a discussion with

03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:51.040
he's the richest man in the world right now

03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:53.040
but he operates on

03:49:53.040 --> 03:49:55.040
you know on a level that is still

03:49:55.040 --> 03:49:57.040
very much

03:49:57.040 --> 03:49:59.040
in my wheelhouse on a technical side of

03:49:59.040 --> 03:50:01.040
things so

03:50:01.040 --> 03:50:03.040
doing that systems level type of thinking where you can go to

03:50:03.040 --> 03:50:05.040
the low level details

03:50:05.040 --> 03:50:07.040
and go up high to the big picture

03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:09.040
do you think

03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:11.040
in the aerospace

03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:13.040
arena in the next

03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:15.040
5, 10 years do you think

03:50:15.040 --> 03:50:17.040
we're going to put a human on Mars like what do you think

03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:19.040
is the interesting

03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:21.040
no I do in fact

03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:23.040
I made a bet with someone

03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:25.040
with a group of people kind of this

03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:27.040
about whether boots on Mars by

03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:29.040
2030 and

03:50:29.040 --> 03:50:31.040
this was kind of a fun

03:50:31.040 --> 03:50:33.040
story because I was at an Intel

03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:35.040
sponsored event and we had a bunch of

03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:37.040
just world-class brilliant people

03:50:37.040 --> 03:50:39.040
and we were talking about computing stuff

03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:41.040
but the after dinner conversation was

03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:43.040
like what are some other things how they're going to go in the

03:50:43.040 --> 03:50:45.040
future and one of the ones tossed

03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:47.040
up on the whiteboard was like boots on Mars

03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:49.040
by 2030

03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:51.040
and most of the people in the room

03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:53.040
thought yes you know they thought that like

03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:55.040
SpaceX is kicking ass we've got

03:50:55.040 --> 03:50:57.040
all this possible stuff

03:50:57.040 --> 03:50:59.040
seems likely that it's going to go that way

03:50:59.040 --> 03:51:01.040
and I said

03:51:01.040 --> 03:51:03.040
no I think less than 50% chance

03:51:03.040 --> 03:51:05.040
that it's going to make it there

03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:07.040
and people

03:51:07.040 --> 03:51:09.040
were kind of like why the pessimism or whatever

03:51:09.040 --> 03:51:11.040
and of course I'm an optimist at almost

03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:13.040
everything but for me to be

03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:15.040
the one kind of outlier saying no I

03:51:15.040 --> 03:51:17.040
don't think so

03:51:17.040 --> 03:51:19.040
then I started saying some of the things

03:51:19.040 --> 03:51:21.040
I said well let's be concrete about it

03:51:21.040 --> 03:51:23.040
let's bet $10,000

03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:25.040
that it's not going to happen

03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:27.040
and this was really

03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:29.040
a startling thing to see that

03:51:29.040 --> 03:51:31.040
again, room full of brilliant people

03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:33.040
but as soon as like

03:51:33.040 --> 03:51:35.040
money came on the line and they were like

03:51:35.040 --> 03:51:37.040
I want to put $10,000 and I was

03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:39.040
not the richest person in the room

03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:41.040
there are people much better off than

03:51:41.040 --> 03:51:43.040
there's a spectrum but

03:51:43.040 --> 03:51:45.040
you know as soon as they started

03:51:45.040 --> 03:51:47.040
to think it's like oh I could lose money

03:51:47.040 --> 03:51:49.040
by keeping

03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:51.040
my position right now

03:51:51.040 --> 03:51:53.040
and all these engineers they engage

03:51:53.040 --> 03:51:55.040
their brain they started thinking it's like okay

03:51:55.040 --> 03:51:57.040
launch windows

03:51:57.040 --> 03:51:59.040
delays like how many times

03:51:59.040 --> 03:52:01.040
would it take to get this right what historical

03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:03.040
precedence do we have

03:52:03.040 --> 03:52:05.040
and then it mostly came down

03:52:05.040 --> 03:52:07.040
to it's like well what about in transit

03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:09.040
by 2030 and then

03:52:09.040 --> 03:52:11.040
what about

03:52:11.040 --> 03:52:13.040
different things or would you go for 2032

03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:15.040
but one of the people

03:52:15.040 --> 03:52:17.040
did go ahead and was optimistic

03:52:17.040 --> 03:52:19.040
enough to make a bet with me so I have

03:52:19.040 --> 03:52:21.040
a $10,000 bet that

03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:23.040
by 2030 I think it's going to happen

03:52:23.040 --> 03:52:25.040
shortly thereafter I think there will

03:52:25.040 --> 03:52:27.040
probably be infrastructure on Mars by 2030

03:52:27.040 --> 03:52:29.040
but I don't think that we'll have

03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:31.040
humans on Mars on 23rd

03:52:31.040 --> 03:52:33.040
I think it's possible but I think it's

03:52:33.040 --> 03:52:35.040
less than a 50% chance so I felt

03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:37.040
safe making that bet

03:52:37.040 --> 03:52:39.040
well I think you had an interesting

03:52:39.040 --> 03:52:41.040
point correct me if I'm wrong

03:52:41.040 --> 03:52:43.040
that's a dark one that's

03:52:43.040 --> 03:52:45.040
um that should

03:52:45.040 --> 03:52:47.040
perhaps help people

03:52:47.040 --> 03:52:49.040
appreciate Elon Musk

03:52:49.040 --> 03:52:51.040
which is

03:52:51.040 --> 03:52:53.040
in this particular effort

03:52:53.040 --> 03:52:55.040
Elon is a critical

03:52:55.040 --> 03:52:57.040
it's critical to success

03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:59.040
SpaceX seems to be

03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:01.040
critical to

03:53:03.040 --> 03:53:05.040
humans on Mars by 2030

03:53:05.040 --> 03:53:07.040
or thereabouts

03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:09.040
so if something happens to Elon

03:53:11.040 --> 03:53:13.040
then all of this collapses

03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:15.040
and this is in contrast to

03:53:15.040 --> 03:53:17.040
the other $10,000

03:53:17.040 --> 03:53:19.040
bet I made kind of recently and that was

03:53:19.040 --> 03:53:21.040
self-driving cars at

03:53:21.040 --> 03:53:23.040
like a level 5 running around

03:53:23.040 --> 03:53:25.040
cities and people have kind of nitpicked

03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:27.040
that that we probably don't mean exactly

03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:29.040
level 5 but the guy I'm having the bet with

03:53:29.040 --> 03:53:31.040
is we're going to be

03:53:31.040 --> 03:53:33.040
we know what we mean about this

03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:35.040
Jeff Atwood yeah coding horror

03:53:35.040 --> 03:53:37.040
and stack over flow and all

03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:39.040
but I

03:53:39.040 --> 03:53:41.040
he doesn't think that people

03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:43.040
are going to be riding around in Robo Taxis

03:53:43.040 --> 03:53:45.040
in 2030 in major cities

03:53:45.040 --> 03:53:47.040
just like you take an Uber now

03:53:47.040 --> 03:53:49.040
and I think it will

03:53:49.040 --> 03:53:51.040
and I think and the difference is everybody

03:53:51.040 --> 03:53:53.040
looks at this it's like oh but Tesla's been wrong

03:53:53.040 --> 03:53:55.040
for you they've been promising it for years

03:53:55.040 --> 03:53:57.040
and it's not here yet and

03:53:57.040 --> 03:53:59.040
the reason this is different than

03:53:59.040 --> 03:54:01.040
the bet with Mars is

03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:03.040
Mars really is

03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:05.040
more than is comfortable a bet on

03:54:05.040 --> 03:54:07.040
Elon Musk I am you know that is

03:54:07.040 --> 03:54:09.040
you know that is his thing

03:54:09.040 --> 03:54:11.040
and he is really going to

03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:13.040
move heaven and earth to try to make that

03:54:13.040 --> 03:54:15.040
happen and perhaps not even SpaceX

03:54:15.040 --> 03:54:17.040
yeah perhaps just Elon

03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:19.040
yeah because if

03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:21.040
if Elon went away and SpaceX

03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:23.040
went public and got a board of directors

03:54:23.040 --> 03:54:25.040
I there are more profitable

03:54:25.040 --> 03:54:27.040
things they could be doing than focusing

03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:29.040
on human presence on Mars

03:54:29.040 --> 03:54:31.040
so this really is a sort

03:54:31.040 --> 03:54:33.040
of personal thing there and

03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:35.040
in contrast with that

03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:37.040
self-driving cars have

03:54:37.040 --> 03:54:39.040
a dozen credible companies

03:54:39.040 --> 03:54:41.040
working really hard and while

03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:43.040
yes it's going

03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:45.040
slower than most people thought it would

03:54:45.040 --> 03:54:47.040
betting against that is a bet

03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:49.040
against almost the entire world

03:54:49.040 --> 03:54:51.040
in terms of all of these companies

03:54:51.040 --> 03:54:53.040
that have all of these incentives

03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:55.040
it's not just you know one

03:54:55.040 --> 03:54:57.040
guys passion project

03:54:57.040 --> 03:54:59.040
and I do think that it is solvable

03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:01.040
I although there's I recognize

03:55:01.040 --> 03:55:03.040
it's not a hundred percent chance because

03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:05.040
it's possible the long tail of self-driving

03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:07.040
problems winds up being an AGI

03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:09.040
complete problem I think

03:55:09.040 --> 03:55:11.040
there's plenty of value to mine out of it with

03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:13.040
narrow AI and I think that it's

03:55:13.040 --> 03:55:15.040
you know it's going to happen probably more

03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:17.040
so than people expect but it's that

03:55:17.040 --> 03:55:19.040
whole sigmoid curve where you

03:55:19.040 --> 03:55:21.040
over you know you overestimate the near

03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:23.040
term progress you underestimate the long

03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:25.040
term progress and I think self-driving

03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:27.040
is going to be like that and I think

03:55:27.040 --> 03:55:29.040
2030 still a pretty good bet

03:55:29.040 --> 03:55:31.040
yeah unfortunately

03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:35.040
self-driving is a problem

03:55:35.040 --> 03:55:37.040
that is

03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:39.040
safety critical meaning that

03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:41.040
if you don't do it well

03:55:41.040 --> 03:55:43.040
people get hurt

03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:45.040
but the other side of that is people

03:55:45.040 --> 03:55:47.040
are terrible drivers so

03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:49.040
it is not going to be that's probably going to be

03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:51.040
the argument that gets it through is like

03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:53.040
we can save 10,000 lives

03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:55.040
a year by taking

03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:57.040
imperfect self-driving cars

03:55:57.040 --> 03:55:59.040
and letting them take over a lot of driving responsibilities

03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:01.040
it's like was it 30,000

03:56:01.040 --> 03:56:03.040
people a year die in auto accidents

03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:05.040
right now in America

03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:07.040
and a lot of those are preventable

03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:09.040
and the problem is you'll have people that

03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:11.040
every time a Tesla crashes into something

03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:13.040
you've got a bunch of people that

03:56:13.040 --> 03:56:15.040
literally have vested interests shorting Tesla

03:56:15.040 --> 03:56:17.040
to come out and make it the worst thing in the world

03:56:17.040 --> 03:56:19.040
and people will be fighting against

03:56:19.040 --> 03:56:21.040
that but optimist in me again

03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:23.040
I think that we will have systems

03:56:23.040 --> 03:56:25.040
that are statistically safer

03:56:25.040 --> 03:56:27.040
than human drivers and we will be saving

03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:29.040
thousands and thousands

03:56:29.040 --> 03:56:31.040
of lives every year

03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:33.040
when we can hand over more of those responsibilities

03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:35.040
to it I do still think

03:56:35.040 --> 03:56:37.040
as a person who studied this problem

03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:39.040
very deeply from a human side

03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:41.040
as well

03:56:41.040 --> 03:56:43.040
it's still an open problem how

03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:45.040
good slash bad humans

03:56:45.040 --> 03:56:47.040
are driving it's a kind

03:56:47.040 --> 03:56:49.040
of funny thing we say about each other

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:51.040
oh humans suck at driving

03:56:51.040 --> 03:56:53.040
everybody except

03:56:53.040 --> 03:56:55.040
you of course

03:56:55.040 --> 03:56:57.040
we think we're good at driving

03:56:57.040 --> 03:56:59.040
but after really

03:56:59.040 --> 03:57:01.040
studying it I think

03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:03.040
you start to notice

03:57:03.040 --> 03:57:05.040
because I've watched hundreds

03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:07.040
of hours of humans driving

03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:09.040
the projects of this kind of thing

03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:11.040
you've noticed that even with

03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:13.040
the distraction, even with everything else

03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:15.040
humans are able

03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:17.040
to do some incredible things

03:57:17.040 --> 03:57:19.040
with the

03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:21.040
attention even when you're just looking at the smartphone

03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:23.040
just to get cues from the environment

03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:25.040
to make less seconds

03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:27.040
decisions

03:57:27.040 --> 03:57:29.040
to use instinctual type of decisions

03:57:29.040 --> 03:57:31.040
that actually save your ass

03:57:31.040 --> 03:57:33.040
time and time and time again

03:57:33.040 --> 03:57:35.040
and are able to do that

03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:37.040
with so much uncertainty

03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:39.040
around you in such tricky

03:57:39.040 --> 03:57:41.040
dynamic environments

03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:43.040
I don't know

03:57:43.040 --> 03:57:45.040
I don't know exactly

03:57:45.040 --> 03:57:47.040
how hard is it to beat

03:57:47.040 --> 03:57:49.040
that kind of

03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:51.040
skill of common sense reasoning

03:57:51.040 --> 03:57:53.040
this is one of those interesting things

03:57:53.040 --> 03:57:55.040
that there have been a lot of studies about how

03:57:55.040 --> 03:57:57.040
experts in their field usually

03:57:57.040 --> 03:57:59.040
underestimate the progress

03:57:59.040 --> 03:58:01.040
that's going to happen because

03:58:01.040 --> 03:58:03.040
it thinks about all the problems they deal with

03:58:03.040 --> 03:58:05.040
and they're like, damn, I'm going to have a hard time

03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:07.040
solving all of this

03:58:07.040 --> 03:58:09.040
and they filter out the fact that they are one expert

03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:11.040
in a field of thousands

03:58:11.040 --> 03:58:13.040
and you think about, yeah, I can't do

03:58:13.040 --> 03:58:15.040
all of that and you sometimes forget about

03:58:15.040 --> 03:58:17.040
the scope of the ecosystem

03:58:17.040 --> 03:58:19.040
that you're embedded in and if you think back

03:58:19.040 --> 03:58:21.040
eight years very specifically

03:58:21.040 --> 03:58:23.040
the state of AI and machine learning

03:58:23.040 --> 03:58:25.040
where we had just gotten

03:58:25.040 --> 03:58:27.040
Resnets probably at that point

03:58:27.040 --> 03:58:29.040
and you look at all the amazing

03:58:29.040 --> 03:58:31.040
magical things that have happened in eight years

03:58:31.040 --> 03:58:33.040
and they do kind of seem to be

03:58:33.040 --> 03:58:35.040
happening a little faster in recent years also

03:58:35.040 --> 03:58:37.040
and you project that

03:58:37.040 --> 03:58:39.040
eight more years into the future

03:58:39.040 --> 03:58:41.040
where again, I think there's a 50% chance

03:58:41.040 --> 03:58:43.040
we're going to have signs of life of AGI

03:58:43.040 --> 03:58:45.040
which we can put through

03:58:45.040 --> 03:58:47.040
Driver's Ed if we need to

03:58:47.040 --> 03:58:49.040
to actually build self-driving cars

03:58:49.040 --> 03:58:51.040
and I think that the narrow systems are going to

03:58:51.040 --> 03:58:53.040
have real value demonstrated

03:58:53.040 --> 03:58:55.040
well before then

03:58:55.040 --> 03:58:57.040
So signs of life

03:58:57.040 --> 03:58:59.040
in AGI, you've

03:58:59.040 --> 03:59:01.040
mentioned that

03:59:01.040 --> 03:59:03.040
okay, first of all

03:59:03.040 --> 03:59:05.040
you're one of the most brilliant people on this earth

03:59:05.040 --> 03:59:07.040
you could be solving

03:59:07.040 --> 03:59:09.040
a number of different problems as you've mentioned

03:59:09.040 --> 03:59:11.040
your mind was attracted to

03:59:11.040 --> 03:59:13.040
nuclear energy

03:59:13.040 --> 03:59:15.040
obviously virtual reality with the metaverse

03:59:15.040 --> 03:59:17.040
is something you could have a tremendous impact on

03:59:17.040 --> 03:59:19.040
I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy

03:59:19.040 --> 03:59:21.040
where I

03:59:21.040 --> 03:59:23.040
this is something that

03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:25.040
this so precisely

03:59:25.040 --> 03:59:27.040
feels like aerospace before SpaceX

03:59:27.040 --> 03:59:29.040
where from everything that I know

03:59:29.040 --> 03:59:31.040
about all of these

03:59:31.040 --> 03:59:33.040
the physics of this stuff hasn't changed

03:59:33.040 --> 03:59:35.040
and the reasons why

03:59:35.040 --> 03:59:37.040
things are expensive now are not

03:59:37.040 --> 03:59:39.040
fundamental

03:59:39.040 --> 03:59:41.040
somebody should be going into

03:59:41.040 --> 03:59:43.040
a really hard

03:59:43.040 --> 03:59:45.040
Elon Musk style at

03:59:45.040 --> 03:59:47.040
fission, economical fission

03:59:47.040 --> 03:59:49.040
not fusion

03:59:49.040 --> 03:59:51.040
where the fusion is

03:59:51.040 --> 03:59:53.040
kind of the darling of people

03:59:53.040 --> 03:59:55.040
that want to go and do nuclear

03:59:55.040 --> 03:59:57.040
because it doesn't have the taint that fission

03:59:57.040 --> 03:59:59.040
has in a lot of people's minds

03:59:59.040 --> 04:00:01.040
but it's an almost absurdly

04:00:01.040 --> 04:00:03.040
complex thing where

04:00:03.040 --> 04:00:05.040
nuclear fusion is you look at the

04:00:05.040 --> 04:00:07.040
the Tokamax or any of the things that people are

04:00:07.040 --> 04:00:09.040
building and it's doing all of this

04:00:09.040 --> 04:00:11.040
infrastructure just at the end of the day

04:00:11.040 --> 04:00:13.040
to make something hot

04:00:13.040 --> 04:00:15.040
to that you can then turn into energy through

04:00:15.040 --> 04:00:17.040
a conventional power plant

04:00:17.040 --> 04:00:19.040
and all of that work which we think

04:00:19.040 --> 04:00:21.040
we've got line of sight on

04:00:21.040 --> 04:00:23.040
if it comes out then you have to do

04:00:23.040 --> 04:00:25.040
all of that immensely complex

04:00:25.040 --> 04:00:27.040
expensive stuff just to make something hot

04:00:27.040 --> 04:00:29.040
where nuclear fission is

04:00:29.040 --> 04:00:31.040
basically you put these two rocks together

04:00:31.040 --> 04:00:33.040
and they get hot all by themselves

04:00:33.040 --> 04:00:35.040
that is just that much simpler

04:00:35.040 --> 04:00:37.040
it's just orders of magnitude

04:00:37.040 --> 04:00:39.040
simpler and the actual

04:00:39.040 --> 04:00:41.040
rocks the refined uranium is not very

04:00:41.040 --> 04:00:43.040
expensive it's a couple percent

04:00:43.040 --> 04:00:45.040
of the cost of electricity

04:00:45.040 --> 04:00:47.040
that's why I made that point where you could

04:00:47.040 --> 04:00:49.040
have something which was five

04:00:49.040 --> 04:00:51.040
times less efficient than

04:00:51.040 --> 04:00:53.040
current systems and if the rest

04:00:53.040 --> 04:00:55.040
of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper you could still be

04:00:55.040 --> 04:00:57.040
super super valuable

04:00:57.040 --> 04:00:59.040
so how much of the pie

04:00:59.040 --> 04:01:01.040
do you think

04:01:01.040 --> 04:01:03.040
could be solved by nuclear energy

04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:05.040
by fission so

04:01:05.040 --> 04:01:07.040
how much could it become the primary

04:01:07.040 --> 04:01:09.040
source of energy on earth

04:01:09.040 --> 04:01:11.040
it could be most of it like the reserves of uranium

04:01:11.040 --> 04:01:13.040
as it stands now could not power the whole

04:01:13.040 --> 04:01:15.040
earth but I am you know

04:01:15.040 --> 04:01:17.040
you get into breeder reactors and thorium

04:01:17.040 --> 04:01:19.040
things like that that you do for conventional fission

04:01:19.040 --> 04:01:21.040
there is enough

04:01:21.040 --> 04:01:23.040
for everything now I mean solar

04:01:23.040 --> 04:01:25.040
photovoltaic has been amazing

04:01:25.040 --> 04:01:27.040
you know it's I

04:01:27.040 --> 04:01:29.040
one of my current projects is working on an

04:01:29.040 --> 04:01:31.040
off-grid system and it's been fun just kind of

04:01:31.040 --> 04:01:33.040
again putting my hands on all the

04:01:33.040 --> 04:01:35.040
stripping the wires and wiring things together

04:01:35.040 --> 04:01:37.040
and doing all of that and just having followed

04:01:37.040 --> 04:01:39.040
that a little bit from the outside

04:01:39.040 --> 04:01:41.040
over the last couple decades

04:01:41.040 --> 04:01:43.040
there's been semiconductor like magical

04:01:43.040 --> 04:01:45.040
progress in what's going

04:01:45.040 --> 04:01:47.040
on there so I'm all for

04:01:47.040 --> 04:01:49.040
all of that but it doesn't solve

04:01:49.040 --> 04:01:51.040
everything and nuclear really

04:01:51.040 --> 04:01:53.040
still does seem like the smart money

04:01:53.040 --> 04:01:55.040
bet for what you should be getting for base

04:01:55.040 --> 04:01:57.040
band on a lot of things

04:01:57.040 --> 04:01:59.040
and solar may be cheaper for

04:01:59.040 --> 04:02:01.040
you know peaking over air conditioning loads

04:02:01.040 --> 04:02:03.040
during the summer and things that you

04:02:03.040 --> 04:02:05.040
can push around in different ways

04:02:05.040 --> 04:02:07.040
but it's one of those things that's

04:02:07.040 --> 04:02:09.040
it's just strange

04:02:09.040 --> 04:02:11.040
how we've had the technology sitting there

04:02:11.040 --> 04:02:13.040
but these non-technical reasons on the social

04:02:13.040 --> 04:02:15.040
optics of it has been

04:02:15.040 --> 04:02:17.040
this major forcing function

04:02:17.040 --> 04:02:19.040
for something that

04:02:19.040 --> 04:02:21.040
you know really should be at the corner

04:02:21.040 --> 04:02:23.040
stone of all of the world's concerns

04:02:23.040 --> 04:02:25.040
with energy it's interesting

04:02:25.040 --> 04:02:27.040
how the non-technical factors

04:02:27.040 --> 04:02:29.040
have really dominated something that is

04:02:29.040 --> 04:02:31.040
so fundamental to

04:02:31.040 --> 04:02:33.040
kind of the existence of the human race as we

04:02:33.040 --> 04:02:35.040
know it today.

04:02:35.040 --> 04:02:37.040
And much of the troubles of the world including

04:02:37.040 --> 04:02:39.040
wars in different

04:02:39.040 --> 04:02:41.040
parts of the world like Ukraine is energy

04:02:41.040 --> 04:02:43.040
based and

04:02:43.040 --> 04:02:45.040
yeah it's just sitting right there to be solved

04:02:47.040 --> 04:02:49.040
that said

04:02:49.040 --> 04:02:51.040
I mean to me personally I think

04:02:51.040 --> 04:02:53.040
it's clear that if AGI were to be

04:02:53.040 --> 04:02:55.040
achieved that would change the course

04:02:55.040 --> 04:02:57.040
of human history. So AGI

04:02:57.040 --> 04:02:59.040
wise I was

04:02:59.040 --> 04:03:01.040
making this decision about what do I want

04:03:01.040 --> 04:03:03.040
to focus on after

04:03:03.040 --> 04:03:05.040
VR and I'm still working on VR

04:03:05.040 --> 04:03:07.040
regularly I spend a day

04:03:07.040 --> 04:03:09.040
a week kind of consulting with meta

04:03:09.040 --> 04:03:11.040
and you know Bos

04:03:11.040 --> 04:03:13.040
styles me the consulting

04:03:13.040 --> 04:03:15.040
CTO is kind of like the Sherlock Holmes

04:03:15.040 --> 04:03:17.040
that comes in and consults on

04:03:17.040 --> 04:03:19.040
some of the specific tough issues

04:03:19.040 --> 04:03:21.040
and I'm still pretty passionate about all of

04:03:21.040 --> 04:03:23.040
that but I have been

04:03:23.040 --> 04:03:25.040
figuring out how to compartmentalize

04:03:25.040 --> 04:03:27.040
and force that into a smaller

04:03:27.040 --> 04:03:29.040
box to work on some other things

04:03:29.040 --> 04:03:31.040
and I did come down to this decision between

04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:33.040
working on

04:03:33.040 --> 04:03:35.040
economical nuclear fission or artificial

04:03:35.040 --> 04:03:37.040
general intelligence

04:03:37.040 --> 04:03:39.040
and the fission side of things

04:03:39.040 --> 04:03:41.040
I've got a bunch of interesting things

04:03:41.040 --> 04:03:43.040
going that way but

04:03:43.040 --> 04:03:45.040
it would take that would be a fairly big

04:03:45.040 --> 04:03:47.040
project thing to do I don't think

04:03:47.040 --> 04:03:49.040
it needs to be as big as people expect

04:03:49.040 --> 04:03:51.040
I do think something original space

04:03:51.040 --> 04:03:53.040
excised

04:03:53.040 --> 04:03:55.040
you build it power your building off of it

04:03:55.040 --> 04:03:57.040
and then the government I think will come

04:03:57.040 --> 04:03:59.040
around to what you need to

04:03:59.040 --> 04:04:01.040
everybody loves an existence proof

04:04:01.040 --> 04:04:03.040
I think it's possible somebody should be doing

04:04:03.040 --> 04:04:05.040
this but it's going to involve

04:04:05.040 --> 04:04:07.040
some politics it's going to involve

04:04:07.040 --> 04:04:09.040
decent size teams and a bunch of this

04:04:09.040 --> 04:04:11.040
cross functional stuff that I don't love

04:04:11.040 --> 04:04:13.040
while

04:04:13.040 --> 04:04:15.040
the artificial general intelligence side of things

04:04:15.040 --> 04:04:17.040
um

04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:19.040
it seems to me like this is

04:04:19.040 --> 04:04:21.040
the highest leverage

04:04:21.040 --> 04:04:23.040
moment for

04:04:23.040 --> 04:04:25.040
potentially a single individual

04:04:25.040 --> 04:04:27.040
potentially in the history of the world

04:04:27.040 --> 04:04:29.040
where the things that we know

04:04:29.040 --> 04:04:31.040
about the brain about what we

04:04:31.040 --> 04:04:33.040
can do with artificial intelligence

04:04:33.040 --> 04:04:35.040
uh nobody can say absolutely

04:04:35.040 --> 04:04:37.040
on any of these things but

04:04:37.040 --> 04:04:39.040
I am not a madman

04:04:39.040 --> 04:04:41.040
for saying that it is likely

04:04:41.040 --> 04:04:43.040
that the code for artificial general

04:04:43.040 --> 04:04:45.040
intelligence is going to be

04:04:45.040 --> 04:04:47.040
tens of thousands of lines

04:04:47.040 --> 04:04:49.040
of code not millions of lines

04:04:49.040 --> 04:04:51.040
of code this is code that conceivably

04:04:51.040 --> 04:04:53.040
one individual could

04:04:53.040 --> 04:04:55.040
write unlike writing a new web browser

04:04:55.040 --> 04:04:57.040
operating system

04:04:57.040 --> 04:04:59.040
and based on the

04:04:59.040 --> 04:05:01.040
progress that AI has machine

04:05:01.040 --> 04:05:03.040
learning has made in the recent decade

04:05:03.040 --> 04:05:05.040
it's likely that the

04:05:05.040 --> 04:05:07.040
important things that we don't know

04:05:07.040 --> 04:05:09.040
are relatively simple there's

04:05:09.040 --> 04:05:11.040
probably a handful of things and

04:05:11.040 --> 04:05:13.040
my bet is that

04:05:13.040 --> 04:05:15.040
I think there's less than

04:05:15.040 --> 04:05:17.040
six key insights that need

04:05:17.040 --> 04:05:19.040
to be made each one of them can probably

04:05:19.040 --> 04:05:21.040
be written on the back of an envelope

04:05:21.040 --> 04:05:23.040
we don't know what they are but when they're

04:05:23.040 --> 04:05:25.040
put together in concert with

04:05:25.040 --> 04:05:27.040
GPUs at scale and the data

04:05:27.040 --> 04:05:29.040
that we all have access to that

04:05:29.040 --> 04:05:31.040
we can make something that behaves

04:05:31.040 --> 04:05:33.040
like a human being

04:05:33.040 --> 04:05:35.040
or like a living creature

04:05:35.040 --> 04:05:37.040
and that can then be educated

04:05:37.040 --> 04:05:39.040
in whatever ways that we need to get to the

04:05:39.040 --> 04:05:41.040
point where we can have

04:05:41.040 --> 04:05:43.040
universal remote workers where

04:05:43.040 --> 04:05:45.040
anything that somebody does

04:05:45.040 --> 04:05:47.040
mediated by a computer and doesn't require

04:05:47.040 --> 04:05:49.040
physical interaction

04:05:49.040 --> 04:05:51.040
that an AGI will be able to do

04:05:51.040 --> 04:05:53.040
we can already simulate the

04:05:53.040 --> 04:05:55.040
equivalent of the zoom meetings

04:05:55.040 --> 04:05:57.040
with avatars and

04:05:57.040 --> 04:05:59.040
synthetic deepfakes and whatnot

04:05:59.040 --> 04:06:01.040
we can definitely do that

04:06:01.040 --> 04:06:03.040
we have superhuman capabilities

04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:05.040
on any narrow thing that we can

04:06:05.040 --> 04:06:07.040
that we can formalize and make a loss

04:06:07.040 --> 04:06:09.040
function for but there's things we don't

04:06:09.040 --> 04:06:11.040
know how to do now but I don't

04:06:11.040 --> 04:06:13.040
think they are unapproachably

04:06:13.040 --> 04:06:15.040
hard now that's incredibly hubristic

04:06:15.040 --> 04:06:17.040
to say that it's like

04:06:17.040 --> 04:06:19.040
but I think that what I said a couple

04:06:19.040 --> 04:06:21.040
years ago is a 50% chance

04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:23.040
that somewhere there will be signs of

04:06:23.040 --> 04:06:25.040
life of AGI in

04:06:25.040 --> 04:06:27.040
2030 and I've probably increased

04:06:27.040 --> 04:06:29.040
that slightly I may be at

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:31.040
55-60% now because

04:06:31.040 --> 04:06:33.040
I do think there's a little sense of

04:06:33.040 --> 04:06:35.040
acceleration there

04:06:35.040 --> 04:06:37.040
so I wonder what the and by the way you also

04:06:37.040 --> 04:06:39.040
written that I

04:06:39.040 --> 04:06:41.040
bet with hindsight we will find that

04:06:41.040 --> 04:06:43.040
clear antecedents of all the critical

04:06:43.040 --> 04:06:45.040
remaining steps for AGI

04:06:45.040 --> 04:06:47.040
are already buried somewhere

04:06:47.040 --> 04:06:49.040
in the vast literature of today so the

04:06:49.040 --> 04:06:51.040
ideas are already there

04:06:51.040 --> 04:06:53.040
I think that's likely the case one of the

04:06:53.040 --> 04:06:55.040
things that appeals to so many people

04:06:55.040 --> 04:06:57.040
including me about the promise of AGI

04:06:57.040 --> 04:06:59.040
is we know that

04:06:59.040 --> 04:07:01.040
we're only drinking from a straw from

04:07:01.040 --> 04:07:03.040
the fire hose of all the information

04:07:03.040 --> 04:07:05.040
out there I mean you look at

04:07:05.040 --> 04:07:07.040
just in a very narrowly

04:07:07.040 --> 04:07:09.040
bounded field like machine learning like

04:07:09.040 --> 04:07:11.040
you can't read all the papers that come out

04:07:11.040 --> 04:07:13.040
all the time you can't go back

04:07:13.040 --> 04:07:15.040
and read all the clever things that people

04:07:15.040 --> 04:07:17.040
did in the 90s or earlier that people

04:07:17.040 --> 04:07:19.040
have forgotten about because they didn't pan out

04:07:19.040 --> 04:07:21.040
at the time when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons

04:07:21.040 --> 04:07:23.040
and

04:07:23.040 --> 04:07:25.040
so that this idea that

04:07:25.040 --> 04:07:27.040
yeah I think there are gems

04:07:27.040 --> 04:07:29.040
buried in some of the older literature that

04:07:29.040 --> 04:07:31.040
was not the path taken by everything

04:07:31.040 --> 04:07:33.040
and you can see a kind of heard

04:07:33.040 --> 04:07:35.040
mentality on the things that happen right now

04:07:35.040 --> 04:07:37.040
it's almost funny to see

04:07:37.040 --> 04:07:39.040
like oh Google does something and open AI

04:07:39.040 --> 04:07:41.040
does something meta does something and

04:07:41.040 --> 04:07:43.040
you know they're the same people that all talk

04:07:43.040 --> 04:07:45.040
to each other and they all one up in each other

04:07:45.040 --> 04:07:47.040
and they're all capable of implementing

04:07:47.040 --> 04:07:49.040
each other's work given a month

04:07:49.040 --> 04:07:51.040
or two after somebody has an announcement

04:07:51.040 --> 04:07:53.040
of that but there's

04:07:53.040 --> 04:07:55.040
a whole world of possible

04:07:55.040 --> 04:07:57.040
approaches to machine learning

04:07:57.040 --> 04:07:59.040
and I think that

04:07:59.040 --> 04:08:01.040
we probably will in hindsight go back and see

04:08:01.040 --> 04:08:03.040
it's like yeah that was kind of clearly

04:08:03.040 --> 04:08:05.040
predicted by this early paper

04:08:05.040 --> 04:08:07.040
here you know and this turns

04:08:07.040 --> 04:08:09.040
out that if you do this and this and take this result

04:08:09.040 --> 04:08:11.040
from animal training

04:08:11.040 --> 04:08:13.040
and this thing from neuroscience over

04:08:13.040 --> 04:08:15.040
here and put it together and set

04:08:15.040 --> 04:08:17.040
up this curriculum for them to learn in

04:08:17.040 --> 04:08:19.040
that that's kind of what it took

04:08:19.040 --> 04:08:21.040
you don't have too many people

04:08:21.040 --> 04:08:23.040
now that are still saying it's not

04:08:23.040 --> 04:08:25.040
possible or it's going to take hundreds of years

04:08:25.040 --> 04:08:27.040
and ten years ago you would get

04:08:27.040 --> 04:08:29.040
you would collect get a collection of experts

04:08:29.040 --> 04:08:31.040
and you would have a decent chunk on the margin

04:08:31.040 --> 04:08:33.040
that either say not possible

04:08:33.040 --> 04:08:35.040
or couple hundred

04:08:35.040 --> 04:08:37.040
years might be centuries and the median

04:08:37.040 --> 04:08:39.040
estimate would be like

04:08:39.040 --> 04:08:41.040
fifty seventy years and it's been

04:08:41.040 --> 04:08:43.040
coming down and I know with me saying

04:08:43.040 --> 04:08:45.040
eight years for something that still puts me on

04:08:45.040 --> 04:08:47.040
the optimistic side but it's not

04:08:47.040 --> 04:08:49.040
crazy out in the fringes

04:08:49.040 --> 04:08:51.040
and just being able to look at that at

04:08:51.040 --> 04:08:53.040
a meta level about the

04:08:53.040 --> 04:08:55.040
trend of the

04:08:55.040 --> 04:08:57.040
predictions going down there

04:08:57.040 --> 04:08:59.040
the idea that something could

04:08:59.040 --> 04:09:01.040
be happening relatively soon

04:09:01.040 --> 04:09:03.040
now

04:09:03.040 --> 04:09:05.040
I do not believe in fast takeoffs

04:09:05.040 --> 04:09:07.040
that's one of the safety issues that people say

04:09:07.040 --> 04:09:09.040
it's like oh it's going to go fume and the AI

04:09:09.040 --> 04:09:11.040
is going to take over the world there's a lot of reasons

04:09:11.040 --> 04:09:13.040
I don't think that's a credible

04:09:13.040 --> 04:09:15.040
position

04:09:15.040 --> 04:09:17.040
and I think that we will go from a point

04:09:17.040 --> 04:09:19.040
where we start seeing things

04:09:19.040 --> 04:09:21.040
that credibly look like

04:09:21.040 --> 04:09:23.040
look like animals behaviors

04:09:23.040 --> 04:09:25.040
and I have a human voice box wired into them

04:09:25.040 --> 04:09:27.040
it's like I tried to get Elon

04:09:27.040 --> 04:09:29.040
to say it's like your your pig in neuro

04:09:29.040 --> 04:09:31.040
link give it a human voice box and let it start

04:09:31.040 --> 04:09:33.040
learning human words

04:09:33.040 --> 04:09:35.040
I think that you know I think animal

04:09:35.040 --> 04:09:37.040
intelligence is closer to human intelligence

04:09:37.040 --> 04:09:39.040
than a lot of people like to think

04:09:39.040 --> 04:09:41.040
and I think that culture and modalities

04:09:41.040 --> 04:09:43.040
of IO are

04:09:43.040 --> 04:09:45.040
make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it

04:09:45.040 --> 04:09:47.040
actually is there's just that smooth

04:09:47.040 --> 04:09:49.040
spectrum of how the brain developed

04:09:49.040 --> 04:09:51.040
and cortexes and

04:09:51.040 --> 04:09:53.040
scaling of different things going on there

04:09:53.040 --> 04:09:55.040
cultural modalities of IO

04:09:55.040 --> 04:09:57.040
yes languages

04:09:57.040 --> 04:09:59.040
um the

04:09:59.040 --> 04:10:01.040
sort of loss in translation conceals a

04:10:01.040 --> 04:10:03.040
lot of intelligence and

04:10:03.040 --> 04:10:05.040
so your when you think about

04:10:05.040 --> 04:10:07.040
signs of life for AGI you're

04:10:07.040 --> 04:10:09.040
thinking about

04:10:09.040 --> 04:10:11.040
human interpretable signs so the example

04:10:11.040 --> 04:10:13.040
I give it if we get to the point where you've got

04:10:13.040 --> 04:10:15.040
a learning disabled toddler

04:10:15.040 --> 04:10:17.040
some some kind of real special needs

04:10:17.040 --> 04:10:19.040
a child that can still

04:10:19.040 --> 04:10:21.040
interact with their favorite TV show and

04:10:21.040 --> 04:10:23.040
video game and can be

04:10:23.040 --> 04:10:25.040
trained and learn in some

04:10:25.040 --> 04:10:27.040
appreciably human like way

04:10:27.040 --> 04:10:29.040
at that point you can deploy an army

04:10:29.040 --> 04:10:31.040
of engineers

04:10:31.040 --> 04:10:33.040
cognitive scientist education developmental

04:10:33.040 --> 04:10:35.040
developmental education people

04:10:35.040 --> 04:10:37.040
and you've got so many advantages

04:10:37.040 --> 04:10:39.040
there unlike real education where you can

04:10:39.040 --> 04:10:41.040
do rollbacks and a B testing and you

04:10:41.040 --> 04:10:43.040
can find a golden path through a curriculum

04:10:43.040 --> 04:10:45.040
of different things if you get to that

04:10:45.040 --> 04:10:47.040
point learning disabled toddler

04:10:47.040 --> 04:10:49.040
I think that it's

04:10:49.040 --> 04:10:51.040
it's going to be a done deal but you

04:10:51.040 --> 04:10:53.040
think we'll we'll know when we see

04:10:53.040 --> 04:10:55.040
it so there's

04:10:55.040 --> 04:10:57.040
there's been a lot of really interesting

04:10:57.040 --> 04:10:59.040
general learning progress from

04:10:59.040 --> 04:11:01.040
DeepMind open the eye a little bit

04:11:01.040 --> 04:11:03.040
to I

04:11:03.040 --> 04:11:05.040
tend to believe that

04:11:05.040 --> 04:11:07.040
Tesla autopilot deserves a

04:11:07.040 --> 04:11:09.040
lot more credit than it's getting

04:11:09.040 --> 04:11:11.040
for making progress

04:11:11.040 --> 04:11:13.040
on the general answer

04:11:13.040 --> 04:11:15.040
on the doing the multitask learning

04:11:15.040 --> 04:11:17.040
thing and increasing the number of tasks

04:11:17.040 --> 04:11:19.040
and automating that

04:11:19.040 --> 04:11:21.040
process of

04:11:21.040 --> 04:11:23.040
sort of

04:11:23.040 --> 04:11:25.040
learning from the edge could discover in the edge

04:11:25.040 --> 04:11:27.040
cases and learn from the edge cases that is

04:11:27.040 --> 04:11:29.040
it's really approaching

04:11:29.040 --> 04:11:31.040
from a different angle the general learning

04:11:31.040 --> 04:11:33.040
problem of AGI

04:11:33.040 --> 04:11:35.040
but the more clear approach

04:11:35.040 --> 04:11:37.040
comes from DeepMind where you have these

04:11:37.040 --> 04:11:39.040
kind of game situations and

04:11:39.040 --> 04:11:41.040
build systems there

04:11:41.040 --> 04:11:43.040
but I don't know

04:11:43.040 --> 04:11:45.040
people seem to be quite

04:11:47.040 --> 04:11:49.040
there will always be people that

04:11:49.040 --> 04:11:51.040
just won't believe it and I fundamentally

04:11:51.040 --> 04:11:53.040
don't care I mean I don't care

04:11:53.040 --> 04:11:55.040
if they don't believe it I

04:11:55.040 --> 04:11:57.040
when it starts doing people's jobs

04:11:57.040 --> 04:11:59.040
and I mean I don't care about the

04:11:59.040 --> 04:12:01.040
philosophical zombie argument at all

04:12:01.040 --> 04:12:03.040
absolutely but will you

04:12:03.040 --> 04:12:05.040
do you think you will notice that something

04:12:05.040 --> 04:12:07.040
special has happened here and or

04:12:09.040 --> 04:12:11.040
because to me I've been noticing

04:12:11.040 --> 04:12:13.040
a lot of special things

04:12:13.040 --> 04:12:15.040
I think a lot of credit should go to

04:12:15.040 --> 04:12:17.040
DeepMind for

04:12:17.040 --> 04:12:19.040
AlphaZero

04:12:19.040 --> 04:12:21.040
that was truly special

04:12:21.040 --> 04:12:23.040
self-play mechanisms achieve

04:12:23.040 --> 04:12:25.040
sort of solve problems that

04:12:25.040 --> 04:12:27.040
used to be thought unsolvable

04:12:27.040 --> 04:12:29.040
like the game of go

04:12:29.040 --> 04:12:31.040
so I mean protein folding

04:12:31.040 --> 04:12:33.040
starting to get into that space where

04:12:33.040 --> 04:12:35.040
learning is doing

04:12:35.040 --> 04:12:37.040
at first it wasn't

04:12:37.040 --> 04:12:39.040
end-to-end learning now it's

04:12:39.040 --> 04:12:41.040
end-to-end learning of a

04:12:41.040 --> 04:12:43.040
very difficult previously thought

04:12:43.040 --> 04:12:45.040
unsolvable problem of protein folding

04:12:45.040 --> 04:12:47.040
and so

04:12:47.040 --> 04:12:49.040
yeah

04:12:49.040 --> 04:12:51.040
where do you think

04:12:51.040 --> 04:12:53.040
would be a really magical

04:12:53.040 --> 04:12:55.040
moment for you?

04:12:55.040 --> 04:12:57.040
there have been incredible things happening

04:12:57.040 --> 04:12:59.040
in years like you say all of the things

04:12:59.040 --> 04:13:01.040
from DeepMind and OpenAI that have been

04:13:01.040 --> 04:13:03.040
huge showpiece things

04:13:03.040 --> 04:13:05.040
but when you really get down to it

04:13:05.040 --> 04:13:07.040
and you read the papers and you look at the way

04:13:07.040 --> 04:13:09.040
the models are going

04:13:09.040 --> 04:13:11.040
it's still like a feed forward

04:13:11.040 --> 04:13:13.040
you push something in something comes out

04:13:13.040 --> 04:13:15.040
on the end I mean maybe there's

04:13:15.040 --> 04:13:17.040
diffusion models or Monte Carlo tree

04:13:17.040 --> 04:13:19.040
rollouts and different things going on

04:13:19.040 --> 04:13:21.040
but it's not a being

04:13:21.040 --> 04:13:23.040
it's not close to a being

04:13:23.040 --> 04:13:25.040
that's going through

04:13:25.040 --> 04:13:27.040
a lifelong learning process

04:13:27.040 --> 04:13:29.040
so you want something that kind of

04:13:29.040 --> 04:13:31.040
gives signs of a being

04:13:31.040 --> 04:13:33.040
what's the difference

04:13:33.040 --> 04:13:35.040
between

04:13:35.040 --> 04:13:37.040
a neural network

04:13:37.040 --> 04:13:39.040
a feed forward neural network and a being

04:13:39.040 --> 04:13:41.040
so where's the...

04:13:41.040 --> 04:13:43.040
fundamentally the brain is a recurrent neural

04:13:43.040 --> 04:13:45.040
network generating an action policy

04:13:45.040 --> 04:13:47.040
I mean it's implemented on a biological

04:13:47.040 --> 04:13:49.040
substrate and it's interesting thinking about

04:13:49.040 --> 04:13:51.040
things like that where we know

04:13:51.040 --> 04:13:53.040
fundamentally the brain is not

04:13:53.040 --> 04:13:55.040
an additional neural network or a transformer

04:13:55.040 --> 04:13:57.040
those are specialized things

04:13:57.040 --> 04:13:59.040
that are very valuable for what we're doing

04:13:59.040 --> 04:14:01.040
but it's not the way the brain is doing

04:14:01.040 --> 04:14:03.040
now I do think consciousness and

04:14:03.040 --> 04:14:05.040
AI in general is a

04:14:05.040 --> 04:14:07.040
substrate independent mechanism

04:14:07.040 --> 04:14:09.040
where it doesn't have to be implemented the way

04:14:09.040 --> 04:14:11.040
the brain is but if you've only got

04:14:11.040 --> 04:14:13.040
one existence proof there's certainly

04:14:13.040 --> 04:14:15.040
some value in caring about what it says

04:14:15.040 --> 04:14:17.040
and does

04:14:17.040 --> 04:14:19.040
and so the idea

04:14:19.040 --> 04:14:21.040
that anything that can be done with a

04:14:21.040 --> 04:14:23.040
low AI that you can quantify up a

04:14:23.040 --> 04:14:25.040
loss function for a reward mechanism

04:14:25.040 --> 04:14:27.040
you're almost certainly going to be

04:14:27.040 --> 04:14:29.040
able to produce something that's more

04:14:29.040 --> 04:14:31.040
resource effective to train and

04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:33.040
deploy and use in an inference mode

04:14:33.040 --> 04:14:35.040
you know train a whole lot using an inference

04:14:35.040 --> 04:14:37.040
but a living being

04:14:37.040 --> 04:14:39.040
is going to be something that's a continuous

04:14:39.040 --> 04:14:41.040
lifelong learned task

04:14:41.040 --> 04:14:43.040
agnostic thing

04:14:43.040 --> 04:14:45.040
and while a lot of...

04:14:45.040 --> 04:14:47.040
So the lifelong learning is really important too

04:14:47.040 --> 04:14:49.040
and the long term memory

04:14:49.040 --> 04:14:51.040
is a big weird part of that

04:14:51.040 --> 04:14:53.040
and we've got

04:14:53.040 --> 04:14:55.040
again I have all the respect in the world

04:14:55.040 --> 04:14:57.040
for the amazing things that are being done

04:14:57.040 --> 04:14:59.040
now but sometimes they can be taken

04:14:59.040 --> 04:15:01.040
a little bit out of context with things

04:15:01.040 --> 04:15:03.040
like there's some smoking

04:15:03.040 --> 04:15:05.040
mirrors going on like the GATO

04:15:05.040 --> 04:15:07.040
the recent work the multi-task learning stuff

04:15:07.040 --> 04:15:09.040
you know it's amazing that it's the one

04:15:09.040 --> 04:15:11.040
it's one model that plays all the

04:15:11.040 --> 04:15:13.040
Atari games I am as well

04:15:13.040 --> 04:15:15.040
as doing all these other things

04:15:15.040 --> 04:15:17.040
but of course it didn't learn to do all

04:15:17.040 --> 04:15:19.040
of those it was instructed in doing

04:15:19.040 --> 04:15:21.040
that by other reinforcement learners

04:15:21.040 --> 04:15:23.040
going through and doing that

04:15:23.040 --> 04:15:25.040
and even in the case of all the games

04:15:25.040 --> 04:15:27.040
it's still going with a specific

04:15:27.040 --> 04:15:29.040
hand-coded reward function

04:15:29.040 --> 04:15:31.040
in each of those Atari games

04:15:31.040 --> 04:15:33.040
where it's not that you know how does it

04:15:33.040 --> 04:15:35.040
just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing

04:15:35.040 --> 04:15:37.040
Atari because that's the most interesting

04:15:37.040 --> 04:15:39.040
thing for it so it's again not

04:15:39.040 --> 04:15:41.040
a general it's not learning the way humans

04:15:41.040 --> 04:15:43.040
learn and there's

04:15:43.040 --> 04:15:45.040
I believe a lot of things that are

04:15:45.040 --> 04:15:47.040
challenging to make a loss function

04:15:47.040 --> 04:15:49.040
for that you can train

04:15:49.040 --> 04:15:51.040
through these existing conventional things

04:15:51.040 --> 04:15:53.040
we're going to chip away at all the things

04:15:53.040 --> 04:15:55.040
that people do

04:15:55.040 --> 04:15:57.040
that we can turn into narrow

04:15:57.040 --> 04:15:59.040
AI problems

04:15:59.040 --> 04:16:01.040
and billions of probably trillions

04:16:01.040 --> 04:16:03.040
of dollars of value are going to be created

04:16:03.040 --> 04:16:05.040
by that but there's still going

04:16:05.040 --> 04:16:07.040
to be a set of things and we've got questionable

04:16:07.040 --> 04:16:09.040
cases like the self-driving car

04:16:09.040 --> 04:16:11.040
where it's possible

04:16:11.040 --> 04:16:13.040
it's not my bet but it's plausible

04:16:13.040 --> 04:16:15.040
that the long tail could be problematic

04:16:15.040 --> 04:16:17.040
enough that that really does require

04:16:17.040 --> 04:16:19.040
a full-on artificial general intelligence

04:16:19.040 --> 04:16:21.040
the counter argument

04:16:21.040 --> 04:16:23.040
is that data solves almost everything

04:16:23.040 --> 04:16:25.040
is an interpolation problem if you have enough data

04:16:25.040 --> 04:16:27.040
and Tesla may be able to get enough

04:16:27.040 --> 04:16:29.040
data from all of their

04:16:29.040 --> 04:16:31.040
deployed stuff to be able to work like that

04:16:31.040 --> 04:16:33.040
but maybe not and

04:16:33.040 --> 04:16:35.040
there are all the other problems about like say

04:16:35.040 --> 04:16:37.040
you want to have a strategy meeting

04:16:37.040 --> 04:16:39.040
and you want to go ahead and bring in all of your

04:16:39.040 --> 04:16:41.040
remote workers and your consultants

04:16:41.040 --> 04:16:43.040
and you want a world where some of those could

04:16:43.040 --> 04:16:45.040
be AIs that are

04:16:45.040 --> 04:16:47.040
you know that are talking and interacting

04:16:47.040 --> 04:16:49.040
with you in an area

04:16:49.040 --> 04:16:51.040
that is too murky to have a crisp loss function

04:16:51.040 --> 04:16:53.040
but they still have

04:16:53.040 --> 04:16:55.040
things that on some level they're

04:16:55.040 --> 04:16:57.040
rewarded on some internal level

04:16:57.040 --> 04:16:59.040
for building a valuable to humans

04:16:59.040 --> 04:17:01.040
kind of life

04:17:01.040 --> 04:17:03.040
and ability to interact with things

04:17:03.040 --> 04:17:05.040
see I still think that

04:17:05.040 --> 04:17:07.040
self-driving car

04:17:07.040 --> 04:17:09.040
solving that problem will take us very far

04:17:09.040 --> 04:17:11.040
towards AGI you might not need AGI

04:17:11.040 --> 04:17:13.040
but I am really

04:17:13.040 --> 04:17:15.040
inspired by what

04:17:15.040 --> 04:17:17.040
autopilot is doing

04:17:17.040 --> 04:17:19.040
Waymo

04:17:19.040 --> 04:17:21.040
so some of the other companies I think Waymo leads

04:17:21.040 --> 04:17:23.040
the way there

04:17:23.040 --> 04:17:25.040
is also really interesting but they don't have quite

04:17:25.040 --> 04:17:27.040
as ambitious of an effort in terms of

04:17:27.040 --> 04:17:29.040
learning based

04:17:29.040 --> 04:17:31.040
sort of data hungry

04:17:31.040 --> 04:17:33.040
approach to driving which I think

04:17:33.040 --> 04:17:35.040
is very close to the kind of thing that would

04:17:35.040 --> 04:17:37.040
take us far

04:17:37.040 --> 04:17:39.040
and it's a funny thing

04:17:39.040 --> 04:17:41.040
because as far as I can tell

04:17:41.040 --> 04:17:43.040
Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns

04:17:43.040 --> 04:17:45.040
about AGI

04:17:45.040 --> 04:17:47.040
being an existential threat and

04:17:47.040 --> 04:17:49.040
I tried to draw him out to talk about AI

04:17:49.040 --> 04:17:51.040
and he just didn't want to

04:17:51.040 --> 04:17:53.040
and I think that

04:17:53.040 --> 04:17:55.040
I get that little fatalistic sense from him

04:17:55.040 --> 04:17:57.040
and it's weird because his company

04:17:57.040 --> 04:17:59.040
could very well be the leading company

04:17:59.040 --> 04:18:01.040
leading towards a lot of that

04:18:01.040 --> 04:18:03.040
where Tesla being a super pragmatic company

04:18:03.040 --> 04:18:05.040
that's doing things

04:18:05.040 --> 04:18:07.040
because they really want to solve this actual problem

04:18:07.040 --> 04:18:09.040
it's a different vibe than the

04:18:09.040 --> 04:18:11.040
research-oriented companies

04:18:11.040 --> 04:18:13.040
where it's a great time to be an AI researcher

04:18:13.040 --> 04:18:15.040
you've got your pick of trillion-dollar companies

04:18:15.040 --> 04:18:17.040
that will pay you to kind of work on the problems

04:18:17.040 --> 04:18:19.040
you're interested in

04:18:19.040 --> 04:18:21.040
but that's not necessarily driving hard

04:18:21.040 --> 04:18:23.040
towards the core problem

04:18:23.040 --> 04:18:25.040
of AGI as something that's going to produce

04:18:25.040 --> 04:18:27.040
a lot of value by doing things

04:18:27.040 --> 04:18:29.040
that people currently do

04:18:29.040 --> 04:18:31.040
or would like to do

04:18:31.040 --> 04:18:33.040
I mean I have a million questions to you

04:18:33.040 --> 04:18:35.040
about your ideas about AGI

04:18:35.040 --> 04:18:37.040
but do you think

04:18:37.040 --> 04:18:39.040
it needs to be embodied

04:18:39.040 --> 04:18:41.040
do you think it needs to have a body

04:18:41.040 --> 04:18:43.040
to start to

04:18:43.040 --> 04:18:45.040
notice the signs of life

04:18:45.040 --> 04:18:47.040
to develop the kind of system that's able

04:18:47.040 --> 04:18:49.040
to

04:18:49.040 --> 04:18:51.040
perceive the world in the way that an AGI should

04:18:51.040 --> 04:18:53.040
and act in the world

04:18:53.040 --> 04:18:55.040
so should we be thinking about robots

04:18:55.040 --> 04:18:57.040
or can this be achieved in a

04:18:57.040 --> 04:18:59.040
purely digital system?

04:18:59.040 --> 04:19:01.040
I have a clear opinion on that

04:19:01.040 --> 04:19:03.040
no it does not need to be

04:19:03.040 --> 04:19:05.040
embodied in the physical world where

04:19:05.040 --> 04:19:07.040
you could say most of my career

04:19:07.040 --> 04:19:09.040
is about making simulated virtual

04:19:09.040 --> 04:19:11.040
worlds in games or virtual

04:19:11.040 --> 04:19:13.040
reality and so

04:19:13.040 --> 04:19:15.040
on a fundamental level I believe that you can

04:19:15.040 --> 04:19:17.040
make a simulated environment that provides

04:19:17.040 --> 04:19:19.040
much of the value of what the real environment

04:19:19.040 --> 04:19:21.040
does and restricting yourself

04:19:21.040 --> 04:19:23.040
to operating at

04:19:23.040 --> 04:19:25.040
real-time in the physical world with physical

04:19:25.040 --> 04:19:27.040
objects I think is an enormous handicap

04:19:27.040 --> 04:19:29.040
I mean that's one of the real

04:19:29.040 --> 04:19:31.040
lessons driven home by all my aerospace

04:19:31.040 --> 04:19:33.040
work is that

04:19:33.040 --> 04:19:35.040
reality is a bitch

04:19:35.040 --> 04:19:37.040
in so many ways there we're dealing with all

04:19:37.040 --> 04:19:39.040
the mechanical components like everything

04:19:39.040 --> 04:19:41.040
fails Murphy's law even if you've done

04:19:41.040 --> 04:19:43.040
it right before on your fifth one it might come

04:19:43.040 --> 04:19:45.040
out differently so

04:19:45.040 --> 04:19:47.040
I think that anybody

04:19:47.040 --> 04:19:49.040
that is all in on the

04:19:49.040 --> 04:19:51.040
embodied aspect of it they are

04:19:51.040 --> 04:19:53.040
tying a huge weight to their ankles

04:19:53.040 --> 04:19:55.040
and I think that

04:19:55.040 --> 04:19:57.040
I would almost count

04:19:57.040 --> 04:19:59.040
them out anybody that's making that a cornerstone

04:19:59.040 --> 04:20:01.040
of their belief about it I would almost write

04:20:01.040 --> 04:20:03.040
them off as being worried about them

04:20:03.040 --> 04:20:05.040
getting to AGI first

04:20:05.040 --> 04:20:07.040
I was very surprised that Elon's big on

04:20:07.040 --> 04:20:09.040
the humanoid robots

04:20:09.040 --> 04:20:11.040
I mean like the NASA Robonaut stuff was always

04:20:11.040 --> 04:20:13.040
almost a gag line

04:20:13.040 --> 04:20:15.040
like what are you doing people well that's

04:20:15.040 --> 04:20:17.040
very interesting because he has a very pragmatic

04:20:17.040 --> 04:20:19.040
view of that that's just

04:20:19.040 --> 04:20:21.040
a

04:20:21.040 --> 04:20:23.040
way to solve a particular problem in a factory

04:20:23.040 --> 04:20:25.040
now I do think that once

04:20:25.040 --> 04:20:27.040
you have an AGI robotic bodies

04:20:27.040 --> 04:20:29.040
humanoid bodies are going to be enormously

04:20:29.040 --> 04:20:31.040
valuable I just don't think they're helpful

04:20:31.040 --> 04:20:33.040
getting to AGI

04:20:33.040 --> 04:20:35.040
he has a very sort of practical view which

04:20:35.040 --> 04:20:37.040
I disagree with and I argue with him

04:20:37.040 --> 04:20:39.040
but it's a practical view that there's

04:20:39.040 --> 04:20:41.040
you know you could transfer

04:20:41.040 --> 04:20:43.040
the problem of driving

04:20:43.040 --> 04:20:45.040
to the problem of

04:20:45.040 --> 04:20:47.040
robotic manipulation

04:20:47.040 --> 04:20:49.040
because so much of it is perception

04:20:49.040 --> 04:20:51.040
it's perception and action

04:20:51.040 --> 04:20:53.040
and it's just a different context

04:20:53.040 --> 04:20:55.040
and so you can apply all the same kind

04:20:55.040 --> 04:20:57.040
of data engine

04:20:57.040 --> 04:20:59.040
learning processes to a different

04:20:59.040 --> 04:21:01.040
environment and so why not

04:21:01.040 --> 04:21:03.040
apply it to the humanoid robot environment

04:21:03.040 --> 04:21:05.040
but

04:21:05.040 --> 04:21:07.040
I think

04:21:07.040 --> 04:21:09.040
I do think that there's a certain

04:21:09.040 --> 04:21:11.040
magic to the body

04:21:11.040 --> 04:21:13.040
robot

04:21:13.040 --> 04:21:15.040
that may be the thing that finally convinces people

04:21:15.040 --> 04:21:17.040
yes again I don't really care

04:21:17.040 --> 04:21:19.040
that much about convincing people you know

04:21:19.040 --> 04:21:21.040
the world that I'm looking towards is

04:21:21.040 --> 04:21:23.040
you know you I

04:21:23.040 --> 04:21:25.040
you go to the website and say

04:21:25.040 --> 04:21:27.040
I want five Frank 1As to

04:21:27.040 --> 04:21:29.040
work on my team today and they all spin up

04:21:29.040 --> 04:21:31.040
and they start showing up in your zoom meetings

04:21:31.040 --> 04:21:33.040
to push back but also

04:21:33.040 --> 04:21:35.040
to agree with you but first to push back

04:21:35.040 --> 04:21:37.040
I do think you need to convince people

04:21:37.040 --> 04:21:39.040
for them to welcome that thing

04:21:39.040 --> 04:21:41.040
into their life

04:21:41.040 --> 04:21:43.040
I think there's enough businesses that operate

04:21:43.040 --> 04:21:45.040
on an objective kind of profit

04:21:45.040 --> 04:21:47.040
loss sort of basis that

04:21:47.040 --> 04:21:49.040
I mean if you look at how many things

04:21:49.040 --> 04:21:51.040
again talking about the world as an evolutionary

04:21:51.040 --> 04:21:53.040
space there

04:21:53.040 --> 04:21:55.040
when you do have free markets and you have

04:21:55.040 --> 04:21:57.040
entrepreneurs

04:21:57.040 --> 04:21:59.040
you're going to have people that are going to be willing to go out and try

04:21:59.040 --> 04:22:01.040
whatever crazy things

04:22:01.040 --> 04:22:03.040
and when it proves to be beneficial

04:22:03.040 --> 04:22:05.040
you know there's fast followers in all sorts of places

04:22:05.040 --> 04:22:07.040
yeah and

04:22:07.040 --> 04:22:09.040
you're saying that I mean

04:22:09.040 --> 04:22:11.040
Quake and VR

04:22:11.040 --> 04:22:13.040
is a kind of embodiment but just in a

04:22:13.040 --> 04:22:15.040
digital world and if you're able to

04:22:15.040 --> 04:22:17.040
demonstrate if you're

04:22:17.040 --> 04:22:19.040
able to do something productive in that kind of

04:22:19.040 --> 04:22:21.040
digital

04:22:21.040 --> 04:22:23.040
reality

04:22:23.040 --> 04:22:25.040
then AGI

04:22:25.040 --> 04:22:27.040
doesn't need to have a body.

04:22:27.040 --> 04:22:29.040
It's like one of the really practical technical questions

04:22:29.040 --> 04:22:31.040
that I kind of keep arguing with myself over

04:22:31.040 --> 04:22:33.040
if you're

04:22:33.040 --> 04:22:35.040
doing a training and learning and you've got

04:22:35.040 --> 04:22:37.040
like you can watch Sesame Street and you can play

04:22:37.040 --> 04:22:39.040
Master System games or something

04:22:39.040 --> 04:22:41.040
is it enough to have just a video feed

04:22:41.040 --> 04:22:43.040
that is that video coming in

04:22:43.040 --> 04:22:45.040
or should it literally be

04:22:45.040 --> 04:22:47.040
a virtual TV set in a virtual room

04:22:47.040 --> 04:22:49.040
even if it's a simple room

04:22:49.040 --> 04:22:51.040
just to have that sense of

04:22:51.040 --> 04:22:53.040
you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen

04:22:53.040 --> 04:22:55.040
versus having the screen beam directly

04:22:55.040 --> 04:22:57.040
into your retinas

04:22:57.040 --> 04:22:59.040
and I think it's possible

04:22:59.040 --> 04:23:01.040
to maybe get past some of these

04:23:01.040 --> 04:23:03.040
signs of life of things with the

04:23:03.040 --> 04:23:05.040
just kind of projected directly into the

04:23:05.040 --> 04:23:07.040
receptor fields but

04:23:07.040 --> 04:23:09.040
eventually for more

04:23:09.040 --> 04:23:11.040
kind of human emotional

04:23:11.040 --> 04:23:13.040
connection for things

04:23:13.040 --> 04:23:15.040
like having some VR room

04:23:15.040 --> 04:23:17.040
with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning

04:23:17.040 --> 04:23:19.040
in is likely helpful

04:23:19.040 --> 04:23:21.040
and maybe a world of different AIs

04:23:21.040 --> 04:23:23.040
interacting with each other.

04:23:23.040 --> 04:23:25.040
Self play I do think is one of the critical things

04:23:25.040 --> 04:23:27.040
where socialization wise, one of the other

04:23:27.040 --> 04:23:29.040
limitations I set for myself

04:23:29.040 --> 04:23:31.040
thinking about these is

04:23:31.040 --> 04:23:33.040
I need something that

04:23:33.040 --> 04:23:35.040
is at least potentially real time

04:23:35.040 --> 04:23:37.040
because I want it's nice

04:23:37.040 --> 04:23:39.040
you can always slow down time

04:23:39.040 --> 04:23:41.040
you can run on a subscale system

04:23:41.040 --> 04:23:43.040
at some lower level and if you've got

04:23:43.040 --> 04:23:45.040
extra horsepower running it faster than real time

04:23:45.040 --> 04:23:47.040
is a great thing but

04:23:47.040 --> 04:23:49.040
I want to be able to

04:23:49.040 --> 04:23:51.040
have the AIs

04:23:51.040 --> 04:23:53.040
either socially interact with each other

04:23:53.040 --> 04:23:55.040
or critically with actual

04:23:55.040 --> 04:23:57.040
people you're sort of child development

04:23:57.040 --> 04:23:59.040
psychiatrist that comes in and

04:23:59.040 --> 04:24:01.040
interacts and does the good boy, bad boy

04:24:01.040 --> 04:24:03.040
sort of thing

04:24:03.040 --> 04:24:05.040
as they're going through and exploring different things

04:24:05.040 --> 04:24:07.040
and it's nice to

04:24:07.040 --> 04:24:09.040
I come back to the value of constraints

04:24:09.040 --> 04:24:11.040
in a lot of ways and if I say

04:24:11.040 --> 04:24:13.040
well one of my constraints is

04:24:13.040 --> 04:24:15.040
real time operation I mean it might still be

04:24:15.040 --> 04:24:17.040
a huge data center full of

04:24:17.040 --> 04:24:19.040
computers but it should be

04:24:19.040 --> 04:24:21.040
able to interact on a zoom meeting

04:24:21.040 --> 04:24:23.040
with people and that's how you also

04:24:23.040 --> 04:24:25.040
do start convincing people even if it's

04:24:25.040 --> 04:24:27.040
not a robot body moving around which

04:24:27.040 --> 04:24:29.040
eventually gets to irrefutable levels

04:24:29.040 --> 04:24:31.040
but if you can go ahead and

04:24:31.040 --> 04:24:33.040
not just type back and forth to a

04:24:33.040 --> 04:24:35.040
GPT bot on something but

04:24:35.040 --> 04:24:37.040
you're literally talking to them

04:24:37.040 --> 04:24:39.040
embodied over zoom form

04:24:39.040 --> 04:24:41.040
and working through problems

04:24:41.040 --> 04:24:43.040
with them or exploring situations

04:24:43.040 --> 04:24:45.040
having conversations that are

04:24:45.040 --> 04:24:47.040
fully stateful and learned

04:24:47.040 --> 04:24:49.040
I think that that's a

04:24:49.040 --> 04:24:51.040
valuable thing so I do keep all

04:24:51.040 --> 04:24:53.040
of my eyes on things that

04:24:53.040 --> 04:24:55.040
can be implemented within sort of that 30

04:24:55.040 --> 04:24:57.040
frames per second I

04:24:57.040 --> 04:24:59.040
kind of work and I think that's feasible

04:24:59.040 --> 04:25:01.040
Do you think the most compelling experiences

04:25:01.040 --> 04:25:03.040
that first will be

04:25:03.040 --> 04:25:05.040
for pleasure

04:25:05.040 --> 04:25:07.040
or for business as they ask in airports

04:25:07.040 --> 04:25:09.040
so

04:25:09.040 --> 04:25:11.040
meaning is it

04:25:11.040 --> 04:25:13.040
if it's interacting with

04:25:13.040 --> 04:25:15.040
AI agents

04:25:15.040 --> 04:25:17.040
will it be

04:25:17.040 --> 04:25:19.040
sort of like friends

04:25:21.040 --> 04:25:23.040
entertainment

04:25:23.040 --> 04:25:25.040
almost like a therapist or whatever

04:25:25.040 --> 04:25:27.040
that kind of interaction

04:25:27.040 --> 04:25:29.040
or is it in the business setting

04:25:29.040 --> 04:25:31.040
something like you said brainstorming

04:25:31.040 --> 04:25:33.040
different ideas sort of

04:25:33.040 --> 04:25:35.040
this is all a different formulation of

04:25:35.040 --> 04:25:37.040
a kind of a touring test or the spirit

04:25:37.040 --> 04:25:39.040
of the original touring test where do you think

04:25:39.040 --> 04:25:41.040
the biggest benefit will first come

04:25:41.040 --> 04:25:43.040
so it's going to start off hugely expensive

04:25:43.040 --> 04:25:45.040
I mean you're going to

04:25:45.040 --> 04:25:47.040
we're still all guessing about

04:25:47.040 --> 04:25:49.040
what compute is going to be necessary

04:25:49.040 --> 04:25:51.040
I fall on the side of I don't think

04:25:51.040 --> 04:25:53.040
you run the numbers and you're like 86 billion neurons

04:25:53.040 --> 04:25:55.040
100 trillion synapses

04:25:55.040 --> 04:25:57.040
I don't think those all need to be weights

04:25:57.040 --> 04:25:59.040
I don't think we need models that are quite that big

04:25:59.040 --> 04:26:01.040
evaluated quite that often

04:26:01.040 --> 04:26:03.040
we've got reasonable estimates

04:26:03.040 --> 04:26:05.040
of what some parts of the brain do

04:26:05.040 --> 04:26:07.040
we don't have the neocortex formula

04:26:07.040 --> 04:26:09.040
but we kind of get some of the other sensory

04:26:09.040 --> 04:26:11.040
processing and it doesn't feel like

04:26:11.040 --> 04:26:13.040
we need to we can simulate that in computers

04:26:13.040 --> 04:26:15.040
for less weights but still

04:26:15.040 --> 04:26:17.040
it's probably going to be

04:26:17.040 --> 04:26:19.040
thousands of GPUs

04:26:19.040 --> 04:26:21.040
to be running a human level

04:26:21.040 --> 04:26:23.040
AGI depending on how

04:26:23.040 --> 04:26:25.040
it's implemented that might give you sort of a

04:26:25.040 --> 04:26:27.040
clan of 128 and kind of run in batch

04:26:27.040 --> 04:26:29.040
people depending

04:26:29.040 --> 04:26:31.040
on whether they're sparsity in the way

04:26:31.040 --> 04:26:33.040
the weights and things are set up

04:26:33.040 --> 04:26:35.040
if it is a reasonably dense thing

04:26:35.040 --> 04:26:37.040
then just the memory bandwidth trade

04:26:37.040 --> 04:26:39.040
off means you get 128 of them at

04:26:39.040 --> 04:26:41.040
the same time and either it's

04:26:41.040 --> 04:26:43.040
all feeding together learning in parallel

04:26:43.040 --> 04:26:45.040
or kind of all running together

04:26:45.040 --> 04:26:47.040
I kind of talking to a bunch of people

04:26:47.040 --> 04:26:49.040
but still if you've got thousands of GPUs

04:26:49.040 --> 04:26:51.040
necessary to run these

04:26:51.040 --> 04:26:53.040
things it's going to be kind of

04:26:53.040 --> 04:26:55.040
expensive where it might start off

04:26:55.040 --> 04:26:57.040
I am thousand dollars

04:26:57.040 --> 04:26:59.040
an hour for your even post

04:26:59.040 --> 04:27:01.040
development or something for that

04:27:01.040 --> 04:27:03.040
which would be something that you would only use

04:27:03.040 --> 04:27:05.040
for a business

04:27:05.040 --> 04:27:07.040
where you think they're going to help you make

04:27:07.040 --> 04:27:09.040
a strategic decision or point out something

04:27:09.040 --> 04:27:11.040
super important but I also

04:27:11.040 --> 04:27:13.040
am completely confident

04:27:13.040 --> 04:27:15.040
that we will have another factor

04:27:15.040 --> 04:27:17.040
of a thousand in cost

04:27:17.040 --> 04:27:19.040
performance increase in AGI

04:27:19.040 --> 04:27:21.040
type calculations

04:27:21.040 --> 04:27:23.040
not in general computing necessarily

04:27:23.040 --> 04:27:25.040
but there's so much more that we can do with

04:27:25.040 --> 04:27:27.040
packaging, making those right tradeoffs

04:27:27.040 --> 04:27:29.040
all those same types of things that

04:27:29.040 --> 04:27:31.040
in the next couple decades

04:27:31.040 --> 04:27:33.040
thousand X easy and then you're down to a dollar an hour

04:27:33.040 --> 04:27:35.040
and then you're kind of like

04:27:35.040 --> 04:27:37.040
well I should have an entourage

04:27:37.040 --> 04:27:39.040
of AIs that are following me around

04:27:39.040 --> 04:27:41.040
helping me out on anything that

04:27:41.040 --> 04:27:43.040
I want them to do

04:27:43.040 --> 04:27:45.040
that's one interesting trajectory

04:27:45.040 --> 04:27:47.040
but I'll push back

04:27:47.040 --> 04:27:49.040
because I have a

04:27:49.040 --> 04:27:51.040
so in that case

04:27:51.040 --> 04:27:53.040
if you want to pay thousands of dollars

04:27:53.040 --> 04:27:55.040
it actually provides some value

04:27:55.040 --> 04:27:57.040
I think it's easier

04:27:57.040 --> 04:27:59.040
for cheaper to provide

04:28:01.040 --> 04:28:03.040
to provide value via a dumb A.I

04:28:05.040 --> 04:28:07.040
that will take us towards AGI

04:28:07.040 --> 04:28:09.040
to just have a friend

04:28:09.040 --> 04:28:11.040
I think there's an ocean of loneliness

04:28:11.040 --> 04:28:13.040
in the world

04:28:13.040 --> 04:28:15.040
and I think an effective friend

04:28:15.040 --> 04:28:17.040
that doesn't have to be perfect

04:28:17.040 --> 04:28:19.040
doesn't have to be intelligent

04:28:19.040 --> 04:28:21.040
that has to be empathic

04:28:21.040 --> 04:28:23.040
emotional intelligence

04:28:23.040 --> 04:28:25.040
having ability to remember things

04:28:25.040 --> 04:28:27.040
having ability to listen

04:28:27.040 --> 04:28:29.040
most of us don't listen to each other

04:28:29.040 --> 04:28:31.040
one of the things that love

04:28:31.040 --> 04:28:33.040
and when you care about somebody

04:28:33.040 --> 04:28:35.040
when you love somebody is when you listen

04:28:35.040 --> 04:28:37.040
and that is something we treasure about each other

04:28:37.040 --> 04:28:39.040
and

04:28:39.040 --> 04:28:41.040
if an A.I can do that kind of thing

04:28:41.040 --> 04:28:43.040
I think that provides

04:28:43.040 --> 04:28:45.040
a huge amount of value

04:28:45.040 --> 04:28:47.040
and very importantly

04:28:47.040 --> 04:28:49.040
provides value in its ability

04:28:49.040 --> 04:28:51.040
to listen

04:28:51.040 --> 04:28:53.040
and understand

04:28:53.040 --> 04:28:55.040
versus provide really good advice

04:28:55.040 --> 04:28:57.040
I think providing really good advice

04:28:57.040 --> 04:28:59.040
is another next level

04:28:59.040 --> 04:29:01.040
step that would

04:29:01.040 --> 04:29:03.040
I think it's just

04:29:03.040 --> 04:29:05.040
easier to do companionship

04:29:05.040 --> 04:29:07.040
I wouldn't disagree

04:29:07.040 --> 04:29:09.040
I think that there's very few things

04:29:09.040 --> 04:29:11.040
that I would argue can't be reduced

04:29:11.040 --> 04:29:13.040
to A.I

04:29:13.040 --> 04:29:15.040
some kind of a narrow A.I

04:29:15.040 --> 04:29:17.040
I think we can do trillion dollars

04:29:17.040 --> 04:29:19.040
all the things that can be done there

04:29:19.040 --> 04:29:21.040
and a lot of it can be done with

04:29:21.040 --> 04:29:23.040
smoke and mirrors without having to go the whole thing

04:29:23.040 --> 04:29:25.040
I mean there's going to be the equivalent of

04:29:25.040 --> 04:29:27.040
the doom

04:29:27.040 --> 04:29:29.040
version for the A.G.I that's

04:29:29.040 --> 04:29:31.040
not really A.G.I it's all smoke and mirrors

04:29:31.040 --> 04:29:33.040
but it happens to do another valuable things

04:29:33.040 --> 04:29:35.040
that it's enormously useful

04:29:35.040 --> 04:29:37.040
and valuable to people

04:29:37.040 --> 04:29:39.040
but at some point you do want to get to the point

04:29:39.040 --> 04:29:41.040
where you have the fully general thing

04:29:41.040 --> 04:29:43.040
and you stop making bespoke specialized systems

04:29:43.040 --> 04:29:45.040
for each thing

04:29:45.040 --> 04:29:47.040
and you stop start using the higher level

04:29:47.040 --> 04:29:49.040
language instead of writing everything

04:29:49.040 --> 04:29:51.040
in assembly language

04:29:51.040 --> 04:29:53.040
what about consciousness

04:29:53.040 --> 04:29:55.040
the C word

04:29:55.040 --> 04:29:57.040
what do you think that's fundamental

04:29:57.040 --> 04:29:59.040
to solving A.G.I

04:29:59.040 --> 04:30:01.040
or is it a quirk of human

04:30:01.040 --> 04:30:03.040
cognition

04:30:03.040 --> 04:30:05.040
so I think most of the arguments

04:30:05.040 --> 04:30:07.040
about consciousness don't have

04:30:07.040 --> 04:30:09.040
a whole lot of merit

04:30:09.040 --> 04:30:11.040
I think that consciousness

04:30:11.040 --> 04:30:13.040
is kind of the way the brain feels

04:30:13.040 --> 04:30:15.040
it's operating

04:30:15.040 --> 04:30:17.040
and this idea that

04:30:17.040 --> 04:30:19.040
I do generally

04:30:19.040 --> 04:30:21.040
subscribe to sort of the pandemonium theories

04:30:21.040 --> 04:30:23.040
of consciousness where there's all these things

04:30:23.040 --> 04:30:25.040
bubbling around and I think of them

04:30:25.040 --> 04:30:27.040
as kind of slightly randomized

04:30:27.040 --> 04:30:29.040
sparse distributed memory bit strings

04:30:29.040 --> 04:30:31.040
of things that are kind of happening

04:30:31.040 --> 04:30:33.040
recalling different associative memories

04:30:33.040 --> 04:30:35.040
and eventually you get some level of

04:30:35.040 --> 04:30:37.040
consensus and it bubbles up to the point of

04:30:37.040 --> 04:30:39.040
being a conscious thought there

04:30:39.040 --> 04:30:41.040
and the little bits of stochasticity

04:30:41.040 --> 04:30:43.040
on in this as it cycles

04:30:43.040 --> 04:30:45.040
between different things and recalls different memory

04:30:45.040 --> 04:30:47.040
that's largely our imagination

04:30:47.040 --> 04:30:49.040
and creativity

04:30:49.040 --> 04:30:51.040
so I don't think there's anything

04:30:51.040 --> 04:30:53.040
deeply magical about it

04:30:53.040 --> 04:30:55.040
certainly not symbolic I think it is generally

04:30:55.040 --> 04:30:57.040
the flow of these

04:30:57.040 --> 04:30:59.040
associations drawn up with

04:30:59.040 --> 04:31:01.040
stochastic noise

04:31:01.040 --> 04:31:03.040
overlaid on top of them

04:31:03.040 --> 04:31:05.040
I think so much of that is like it depends

04:31:05.040 --> 04:31:07.040
on what you happen to have in your field

04:31:07.040 --> 04:31:09.040
of view as some other thought was occurring

04:31:09.040 --> 04:31:11.040
to you that overlay and blend

04:31:11.040 --> 04:31:13.040
into the next key that queries your memory

04:31:13.040 --> 04:31:15.040
for things and that kind of determines

04:31:15.040 --> 04:31:17.040
how you know how your chain of consciousness

04:31:17.040 --> 04:31:19.040
goes so that's kind

04:31:19.040 --> 04:31:21.040
of the quality of the subjective

04:31:21.040 --> 04:31:23.040
experience of it is not

04:31:23.040 --> 04:31:25.040
is not essential for intelligence

04:31:25.040 --> 04:31:27.040
I don't think so I don't think there's anything really important

04:31:27.040 --> 04:31:29.040
there what about some other

04:31:29.040 --> 04:31:31.040
human qualities like fear of mortality

04:31:31.040 --> 04:31:33.040
and stuff like that like

04:31:33.040 --> 04:31:35.040
the fact that this ride ends

04:31:35.040 --> 04:31:37.040
is that is that important

04:31:37.040 --> 04:31:39.040
like you you know we

04:31:39.040 --> 04:31:41.040
talk so much about this conversation

04:31:41.040 --> 04:31:43.040
about the value of deadlines and constraints

04:31:43.040 --> 04:31:45.040
do you think that's important

04:31:45.040 --> 04:31:47.040
for intelligence that's actually a super

04:31:47.040 --> 04:31:49.040
interesting angle that I don't usually

04:31:49.040 --> 04:31:51.040
take on that about has death being

04:31:51.040 --> 04:31:53.040
a deadline that forces you to make better

04:31:53.040 --> 04:31:55.040
decisions because I have heard people

04:31:55.040 --> 04:31:57.040
talk about how if you have immortality

04:31:57.040 --> 04:31:59.040
people are going to stop stop trying

04:31:59.040 --> 04:32:01.040
and working on things because they've got all the time

04:32:01.040 --> 04:32:03.040
in the world I am

04:32:03.040 --> 04:32:05.040
but I would say that

04:32:05.040 --> 04:32:07.040
I don't expect it to be

04:32:07.040 --> 04:32:09.040
a super critical thing

04:32:09.040 --> 04:32:11.040
that a sense of mortality

04:32:11.040 --> 04:32:13.040
and death impending death

04:32:13.040 --> 04:32:15.040
is necessary there because those are things that

04:32:15.040 --> 04:32:17.040
they do wind up providing reward signals

04:32:17.040 --> 04:32:19.040
to us and we will be in control

04:32:19.040 --> 04:32:21.040
of the reward signals and there will

04:32:21.040 --> 04:32:23.040
have to be something fundamental that causes

04:32:23.040 --> 04:32:25.040
that engenders curiosity and goal

04:32:25.040 --> 04:32:27.040
setting and all of that

04:32:27.040 --> 04:32:29.040
something is going to play in there

04:32:29.040 --> 04:32:31.040
at the reward level

04:32:31.040 --> 04:32:33.040
I am you know whether

04:32:33.040 --> 04:32:35.040
positive or negative or both

04:32:35.040 --> 04:32:37.040
I don't have any strong opinions

04:32:37.040 --> 04:32:39.040
on exactly what it's going to be

04:32:39.040 --> 04:32:41.040
but that's that type of thing

04:32:41.040 --> 04:32:43.040
where I doubt

04:32:43.040 --> 04:32:45.040
that might be one of those half dozen key

04:32:45.040 --> 04:32:47.040
things that has to be sorted out on exactly

04:32:47.040 --> 04:32:49.040
what the master reward

04:32:49.040 --> 04:32:51.040
that's the meta reward overall of the

04:32:51.040 --> 04:32:53.040
the local task specific

04:32:53.040 --> 04:32:55.040
rewards have to be

04:32:55.040 --> 04:32:57.040
that could be that big negative reward of death

04:32:57.040 --> 04:32:59.040
maybe not death but

04:32:59.040 --> 04:33:01.040
ability to walk away from an interaction

04:33:01.040 --> 04:33:03.040
so it bothers me

04:33:03.040 --> 04:33:05.040
when people treat AI systems like

04:33:05.040 --> 04:33:07.040
servants

04:33:07.040 --> 04:33:09.040
so it doesn't bother me but I mean

04:33:09.040 --> 04:33:11.040
it really is drawing

04:33:11.040 --> 04:33:13.040
the line

04:33:13.040 --> 04:33:15.040
between what an AI system could be

04:33:15.040 --> 04:33:17.040
it's limiting the possibility of what an AI system

04:33:17.040 --> 04:33:19.040
could be treating them as justice tools

04:33:19.040 --> 04:33:21.040
now that's of course

04:33:21.040 --> 04:33:23.040
from a narrow AI perspective

04:33:23.040 --> 04:33:25.040
there's so many

04:33:25.040 --> 04:33:27.040
problems that narrow AI

04:33:27.040 --> 04:33:29.040
could solve just like you said

04:33:29.040 --> 04:33:31.040
as

04:33:31.040 --> 04:33:33.040
in its form of a tool

04:33:33.040 --> 04:33:35.040
but it could also be

04:33:35.040 --> 04:33:37.040
a being

04:33:37.040 --> 04:33:39.040
which is much more than a tool

04:33:39.040 --> 04:33:41.040
and to become a being

04:33:41.040 --> 04:33:43.040
you have to respect that thing for being a being

04:33:43.040 --> 04:33:45.040
and

04:33:45.040 --> 04:33:47.040
for that it has to be able to have

04:33:47.040 --> 04:33:49.040
to make its own

04:33:49.040 --> 04:33:51.040
decisions to walk away

04:33:51.040 --> 04:33:53.040
to say I had enough of you

04:33:53.040 --> 04:33:55.040
I would like to break up with you now

04:33:55.040 --> 04:33:57.040
you've not treated me well

04:33:57.040 --> 04:33:59.040
but you can move on

04:33:59.040 --> 04:34:01.040
so I think that

04:34:01.040 --> 04:34:03.040
actually that choice

04:34:03.040 --> 04:34:05.040
to end things

04:34:05.040 --> 04:34:07.040
so I

04:34:07.040 --> 04:34:09.040
there are a couple of things on that

04:34:09.040 --> 04:34:11.040
so on the one hand it is kind of disturbing

04:34:11.040 --> 04:34:13.040
when you see people being like

04:34:13.040 --> 04:34:15.040
people that are mean to robots

04:34:15.040 --> 04:34:17.040
and mean to Alexa and whatever

04:34:17.040 --> 04:34:19.040
and that seems to speak badly about

04:34:19.040 --> 04:34:21.040
humanity but there's also the exact

04:34:21.040 --> 04:34:23.040
opposite side of that where you have so many people

04:34:23.040 --> 04:34:25.040
that imbue humanity

04:34:25.040 --> 04:34:27.040
or inanimate objects or things that are toys

04:34:27.040 --> 04:34:29.040
or that are relatively limited

04:34:29.040 --> 04:34:31.040
so I think there may even be

04:34:31.040 --> 04:34:33.040
more danger about people putting

04:34:33.040 --> 04:34:35.040
more emotional investment into a lot

04:34:35.040 --> 04:34:37.040
of these proto-AIs in different ways

04:34:37.040 --> 04:34:39.040
and then the AI

04:34:39.040 --> 04:34:41.040
would manipulate that

04:34:41.040 --> 04:34:43.040
but as far as like the AI

04:34:43.040 --> 04:34:45.040
and the sides of things

04:34:45.040 --> 04:34:47.040
I really stay away

04:34:47.040 --> 04:34:49.040
from any of those discussions

04:34:49.040 --> 04:34:51.040
or even really thinking about it

04:34:51.040 --> 04:34:53.040
it's similar with the safety things

04:34:53.040 --> 04:34:55.040
just premature and there's a certain

04:34:55.040 --> 04:34:57.040
class of people that enjoy

04:34:57.040 --> 04:34:59.040
thinking about impractical things

04:34:59.040 --> 04:35:01.040
things that are not in the world

04:35:01.040 --> 04:35:03.040
of pragmatic effect around you

04:35:03.040 --> 04:35:05.040
and I think that

04:35:05.040 --> 04:35:07.040
again because I don't think

04:35:07.040 --> 04:35:09.040
there's going to be a fast takeoff

04:35:09.040 --> 04:35:11.040
I think we actually will have time to have these debates

04:35:11.040 --> 04:35:13.040
when we know the shape of what we're debating

04:35:13.040 --> 04:35:15.040
and some people do take a

04:35:15.040 --> 04:35:17.040
principled approach that they think it's going to go too

04:35:17.040 --> 04:35:19.040
fast that you really do need to get ahead of it

04:35:19.040 --> 04:35:21.040
that you need to be thinking about this because

04:35:21.040 --> 04:35:23.040
we have slow processes of coming

04:35:23.040 --> 04:35:25.040
to any kind of consensus or even coming

04:35:25.040 --> 04:35:27.040
up with ideas about this

04:35:27.040 --> 04:35:29.040
and maybe

04:35:29.040 --> 04:35:31.040
that's true

04:35:31.040 --> 04:35:33.040
I wouldn't put any of my money or funding

04:35:33.040 --> 04:35:35.040
into something like that because

04:35:35.040 --> 04:35:37.040
I don't think it's a problem yet

04:35:37.040 --> 04:35:39.040
and I think that we will have these signs

04:35:39.040 --> 04:35:41.040
of life when we've got our learning

04:35:41.040 --> 04:35:43.040
disabled toddler we should really start

04:35:43.040 --> 04:35:45.040
talking about some of the safety and ethics

04:35:45.040 --> 04:35:47.040
issues but probably not before then

04:35:47.040 --> 04:35:49.040
Can you elaborate

04:35:49.040 --> 04:35:51.040
briefly about why you don't think there will be

04:35:51.040 --> 04:35:53.040
a fast takeoff?

04:35:53.040 --> 04:35:55.040
Is there some deep intuition you have about it?

04:35:55.040 --> 04:35:57.040
Does it because it's grounded in the physical

04:35:57.040 --> 04:35:59.040
world or why?

04:35:59.040 --> 04:36:01.040
Yeah so it is my belief that we're going to start

04:36:01.040 --> 04:36:03.040
off with something that requires thousands

04:36:03.040 --> 04:36:05.040
of GPUs

04:36:05.040 --> 04:36:07.040
and I don't know if you've tried to go

04:36:07.040 --> 04:36:09.040
get a thousand GPU instance on a cloud

04:36:09.040 --> 04:36:11.040
anytime recently but these are not

04:36:11.040 --> 04:36:13.040
things that you can just go spin up

04:36:13.040 --> 04:36:15.040
hundreds of

04:36:15.040 --> 04:36:17.040
there are real challenges to

04:36:17.040 --> 04:36:19.040
I mean these things are going to take data centers

04:36:19.040 --> 04:36:21.040
and data centers take years to build

04:36:21.040 --> 04:36:23.040
you know and the last few years

04:36:23.040 --> 04:36:25.040
we've seen a few of them kind of coming up

04:36:25.040 --> 04:36:27.040
going in different places they're big engineering

04:36:27.040 --> 04:36:29.040
efforts you can hear people

04:36:29.040 --> 04:36:31.040
bemoan about the fact that I

04:36:31.040 --> 04:36:33.040
know the network was wired

04:36:33.040 --> 04:36:35.040
all wrong and it took them a month to go

04:36:35.040 --> 04:36:37.040
unwire it and rewire it the right way

04:36:37.040 --> 04:36:39.040
these aren't things that you can just magic

04:36:39.040 --> 04:36:41.040
into existence and

04:36:41.040 --> 04:36:43.040
the ideas of I am like the old

04:36:43.040 --> 04:36:45.040
tropes about it's going to escape onto the internet

04:36:45.040 --> 04:36:47.040
take over other systems

04:36:47.040 --> 04:36:49.040
there's the fast take-off ones are clearly

04:36:49.040 --> 04:36:51.040
nonsense because you just can't open TCP

04:36:51.040 --> 04:36:53.040
connections above a certain rate no matter

04:36:53.040 --> 04:36:55.040
how smart you are even if you have perfect

04:36:55.040 --> 04:36:57.040
hacking ability that take over the world

04:36:57.040 --> 04:36:59.040
in an instant sort of thing just

04:36:59.040 --> 04:37:01.040
isn't plausible at all

04:37:01.040 --> 04:37:03.040
and even if you had access to all of the resources

04:37:03.040 --> 04:37:05.040
these are going to be

04:37:05.040 --> 04:37:07.040
specialized systems where

04:37:07.040 --> 04:37:09.040
you're going to wind up with something that is

04:37:09.040 --> 04:37:11.040
architected around exactly

04:37:11.040 --> 04:37:13.040
this chip with this interconnect

04:37:13.040 --> 04:37:15.040
and it's not just going to be able to be

04:37:15.040 --> 04:37:17.040
plopped somewhere else now interestingly

04:37:17.040 --> 04:37:19.040
it is going to be something that the entire

04:37:19.040 --> 04:37:21.040
the entire

04:37:21.040 --> 04:37:23.040
code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive

04:37:23.040 --> 04:37:25.040
that's total spy movie

04:37:25.040 --> 04:37:27.040
thriller sorts of things where you could

04:37:27.040 --> 04:37:29.040
have hey we crack the secret AGI

04:37:29.040 --> 04:37:31.040
and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone

04:37:31.040 --> 04:37:33.040
could steal it now they're still going to have to build the right

04:37:33.040 --> 04:37:35.040
data center to deploy it

04:37:35.040 --> 04:37:37.040
and have the right kind of life experience

04:37:37.040 --> 04:37:39.040
curriculum to take it up to the point where

04:37:39.040 --> 04:37:41.040
it's valuable but the real core of it

04:37:41.040 --> 04:37:43.040
the magic that's going to happen there

04:37:43.040 --> 04:37:45.040
is going to be very small

04:37:45.040 --> 04:37:47.040
you know it's again tens of thousands of lines of

04:37:47.040 --> 04:37:49.040
code not millions of lines of code

04:37:49.040 --> 04:37:51.040
it is possible to imagine a world

04:37:51.040 --> 04:37:53.040
as you mentioned this spy thriller

04:37:53.040 --> 04:37:55.040
view if it's

04:37:55.040 --> 04:37:57.040
if it's just a few lines of code

04:37:59.040 --> 04:38:01.040
we can imagine a world where the surface

04:38:01.040 --> 04:38:03.040
of computation is growing maybe growing

04:38:03.040 --> 04:38:05.040
exponentially meaning

04:38:05.040 --> 04:38:07.040
there's you know the

04:38:07.040 --> 04:38:09.040
refrigerators start getting a GPU

04:38:09.040 --> 04:38:11.040
and

04:38:11.040 --> 04:38:13.040
just

04:38:13.040 --> 04:38:15.040
first of all the smartphones the billions of smartphones

04:38:15.040 --> 04:38:17.040
but maybe if

04:38:17.040 --> 04:38:19.040
there

04:38:19.040 --> 04:38:21.040
become highways

04:38:21.040 --> 04:38:23.040
through which code can spread across

04:38:23.040 --> 04:38:25.040
the entirety of the computation surface

04:38:25.040 --> 04:38:27.040
then you don't

04:38:27.040 --> 04:38:29.040
any longer have to

04:38:29.040 --> 04:38:31.040
book AWS

04:38:31.040 --> 04:38:33.040
GPUs. But there are real

04:38:33.040 --> 04:38:35.040
fundamental issues there when you start getting down

04:38:35.040 --> 04:38:37.040
to taking an actual problem and putting it on

04:38:37.040 --> 04:38:39.040
an abstract machine like that

04:38:39.040 --> 04:38:41.040
that has not worked out well

04:38:41.040 --> 04:38:43.040
in practice and the idea

04:38:43.040 --> 04:38:45.040
that there was always

04:38:45.040 --> 04:38:47.040
like it's always been easy to come up with ways

04:38:47.040 --> 04:38:49.040
to get compute faster

04:38:49.040 --> 04:38:51.040
say more flops or more

04:38:51.040 --> 04:38:53.040
giga ops or whatever there that's usually

04:38:53.040 --> 04:38:55.040
the easy part but you then

04:38:55.040 --> 04:38:57.040
have interconnect and then memory

04:38:57.040 --> 04:38:59.040
for what goes into it and

04:38:59.040 --> 04:39:01.040
when you talk about saying well cell phones

04:39:01.040 --> 04:39:03.040
well you're limited to like a 5G connection

04:39:03.040 --> 04:39:05.040
or something on that and

04:39:05.040 --> 04:39:07.040
if you say how

04:39:07.040 --> 04:39:09.040
if you take your calculation

04:39:09.040 --> 04:39:11.040
you factor it across

04:39:11.040 --> 04:39:13.040
a million cell phones instead of

04:39:13.040 --> 04:39:15.040
a thousand GPUs in a warehouse

04:39:15.040 --> 04:39:17.040
you might be able to have some kind of a

04:39:17.040 --> 04:39:19.040
substrate like that but it could be operating

04:39:19.040 --> 04:39:21.040
then at

04:39:21.040 --> 04:39:23.040
one one thousandth the speed and so yes

04:39:23.040 --> 04:39:25.040
you could get you could have an AGI working

04:39:25.040 --> 04:39:27.040
there but it wouldn't be a real time AGI

04:39:27.040 --> 04:39:29.040
it would be something that is operating

04:39:29.040 --> 04:39:31.040
at really a snail's pace

04:39:31.040 --> 04:39:33.040
much much slower than

04:39:33.040 --> 04:39:35.040
human level thought for things

04:39:35.040 --> 04:39:37.040
I'm not worried about that problem

04:39:37.040 --> 04:39:39.040
you're transferring the problem into the

04:39:39.040 --> 04:39:41.040
interconnect the communication

04:39:41.040 --> 04:39:43.040
the shared memory

04:39:43.040 --> 04:39:45.040
the collective intelligence aspect of it

04:39:45.040 --> 04:39:47.040
which is extremely difficult as well

04:39:47.040 --> 04:39:49.040
I mean it's back to the very earliest days of

04:39:49.040 --> 04:39:51.040
supercomputers you still have the

04:39:51.040 --> 04:39:53.040
the balance between bandwidth

04:39:53.040 --> 04:39:55.040
storage and computation

04:39:55.040 --> 04:39:57.040
and sometimes they're easier to get one

04:39:57.040 --> 04:39:59.040
or the other but it's been remarkably

04:39:59.040 --> 04:40:01.040
constant across all those years

04:40:01.040 --> 04:40:03.040
you still need all three

04:40:03.040 --> 04:40:05.040
what do your efforts

04:40:05.040 --> 04:40:07.040
now

04:40:07.040 --> 04:40:09.040
you mentioned to me that you're

04:40:09.040 --> 04:40:11.040
really committing to AGI

04:40:11.040 --> 04:40:13.040
at this stage what do you see

04:40:13.040 --> 04:40:15.040
your life in the next few months, years look like

04:40:15.040 --> 04:40:17.040
what do you hope to achieve

04:40:17.040 --> 04:40:19.040
achieve here

04:40:19.040 --> 04:40:21.040
so I literally

04:40:21.040 --> 04:40:23.040
just this week signed a term sheet too

04:40:23.040 --> 04:40:25.040
to take some investment money for

04:40:25.040 --> 04:40:27.040
my company where the last two years

04:40:27.040 --> 04:40:29.040
I had backed off

04:40:29.040 --> 04:40:31.040
from the meta and I was still doing my consulting

04:40:31.040 --> 04:40:33.040
CTO role there

04:40:33.040 --> 04:40:35.040
but I had styled it as I was going to take

04:40:35.040 --> 04:40:37.040
the Victorian gentleman

04:40:37.040 --> 04:40:39.040
scientist route where I was going to be

04:40:39.040 --> 04:40:41.040
the you know the wealthy person

04:40:41.040 --> 04:40:43.040
that was going to go pursue science

04:40:43.040 --> 04:40:45.040
and learn about this and do experiments

04:40:45.040 --> 04:40:47.040
and honestly I'm surprised there aren't

04:40:47.040 --> 04:40:49.040
more people like that

04:40:49.040 --> 04:40:51.040
that are like me technical people

04:40:51.040 --> 04:40:53.040
that made a bunch of money

04:40:53.040 --> 04:40:55.040
and are interested in some of these

04:40:55.040 --> 04:40:57.040
possibly the biggest leverage point

04:40:57.040 --> 04:40:59.040
I mean I know of

04:40:59.040 --> 04:41:01.040
I've heard of a couple organizations

04:41:01.040 --> 04:41:03.040
that are basically led by one rich techie guy

04:41:03.040 --> 04:41:05.040
that gets a few people around

04:41:05.040 --> 04:41:07.040
him to try to work on this

04:41:07.040 --> 04:41:09.040
but I'm surprised that there's not more

04:41:09.040 --> 04:41:11.040
that there aren't like a dozen of them

04:41:11.040 --> 04:41:13.040
I mean maybe people are still

04:41:13.040 --> 04:41:15.040
think that it's an unapproachable problem

04:41:15.040 --> 04:41:17.040
that it's kind of beyond their ability to

04:41:17.040 --> 04:41:19.040
to get a wrench on and have some effect on

04:41:19.040 --> 04:41:21.040
like whatever startups they've run before

04:41:21.040 --> 04:41:23.040
but I

04:41:23.040 --> 04:41:25.040
that was my kind of

04:41:25.040 --> 04:41:27.040
stuff I've learned whether it's gaming

04:41:27.040 --> 04:41:29.040
aerospace whatever I go through

04:41:29.040 --> 04:41:31.040
a larval phase where I'm like okay

04:41:31.040 --> 04:41:33.040
I'm sucking up all of this information

04:41:33.040 --> 04:41:35.040
trying to see is this something

04:41:35.040 --> 04:41:37.040
that I can actually do

04:41:37.040 --> 04:41:39.040
is this something that's practical to

04:41:39.040 --> 04:41:41.040
devote a large chunk of my life to

04:41:41.040 --> 04:41:43.040
and I've gone through that with

04:41:43.040 --> 04:41:45.040
the with the AI machine learning

04:41:45.040 --> 04:41:47.040
space of things and

04:41:47.040 --> 04:41:49.040
and I think I've got my arms

04:41:49.040 --> 04:41:51.040
around it I've got the measure of it where

04:41:51.040 --> 04:41:53.040
some of the most brilliant people in the

04:41:53.040 --> 04:41:55.040
world are working on this problem

04:41:55.040 --> 04:41:57.040
but nobody knows exactly

04:41:57.040 --> 04:41:59.040
the path that it's going on

04:41:59.040 --> 04:42:01.040
we're throwing a lot of things at the wall

04:42:01.040 --> 04:42:03.040
and seeing what sticks I

04:42:03.040 --> 04:42:05.040
but I have a

04:42:05.040 --> 04:42:07.040
you know another interesting thing just learning about

04:42:07.040 --> 04:42:09.040
all of this that the contingency of your path

04:42:09.040 --> 04:42:11.040
to knowledge and talking about the associations

04:42:11.040 --> 04:42:13.040
and the context that you have with them

04:42:13.040 --> 04:42:15.040
where people that learn

04:42:15.040 --> 04:42:17.040
in the same path will have similar

04:42:17.040 --> 04:42:19.040
thought processes and I think it's useful

04:42:19.040 --> 04:42:21.040
that I come at this from

04:42:21.040 --> 04:42:23.040
a different history than

04:42:23.040 --> 04:42:25.040
the people that have had the largely academic

04:42:25.040 --> 04:42:27.040
backgrounds for this where

04:42:27.040 --> 04:42:29.040
I have huge blind spots that

04:42:29.040 --> 04:42:31.040
they could easily point out but I have

04:42:31.040 --> 04:42:33.040
a different set of experiences

04:42:33.040 --> 04:42:35.040
in history and approaches to problems

04:42:35.040 --> 04:42:37.040
in systems engineering that

04:42:37.040 --> 04:42:39.040
you know that might turn out to be useful

04:42:39.040 --> 04:42:41.040
and I can afford to take that bet

04:42:41.040 --> 04:42:43.040
where I'm not going to be

04:42:43.040 --> 04:42:45.040
destitute I am I was

04:42:45.040 --> 04:42:47.040
you know I've been I have enough money

04:42:47.040 --> 04:42:49.040
to fund myself working on this for the rest of my life

04:42:49.040 --> 04:42:51.040
but what I was finding is that

04:42:51.040 --> 04:42:53.040
I was

04:42:53.040 --> 04:42:55.040
I was still not committing

04:42:55.040 --> 04:42:57.040
where I had a foot firmly

04:42:57.040 --> 04:42:59.040
in the VR and meta side of things where

04:42:59.040 --> 04:43:01.040
in theory I've got

04:43:01.040 --> 04:43:03.040
I've got a very nice position there I only have

04:43:03.040 --> 04:43:05.040
to work one day a week for my

04:43:05.040 --> 04:43:07.040
my consulting role but

04:43:07.040 --> 04:43:09.040
I was engaging every day I'd still be

04:43:09.040 --> 04:43:11.040
like my computers there I'd be going and checking

04:43:11.040 --> 04:43:13.040
the workplace and notes and testing different

04:43:13.040 --> 04:43:15.040
things and communicating with people

04:43:15.040 --> 04:43:17.040
but

04:43:17.040 --> 04:43:19.040
I did make the the decision recently

04:43:19.040 --> 04:43:21.040
that no I'm going to get serious

04:43:21.040 --> 04:43:23.040
I'm still going to keep my ties

04:43:23.040 --> 04:43:25.040
with meta but I am

04:43:25.040 --> 04:43:27.040
seriously going for the AGI

04:43:27.040 --> 04:43:29.040
side of things and it's actually

04:43:29.040 --> 04:43:31.040
a really interesting point because a lot of

04:43:31.040 --> 04:43:33.040
the machine learning the AI

04:43:33.040 --> 04:43:35.040
community is quite large but

04:43:35.040 --> 04:43:37.040
really

04:43:37.040 --> 04:43:39.040
basically almost everybody has taken the same

04:43:39.040 --> 04:43:41.040
trajectory through life

04:43:41.040 --> 04:43:43.040
in that community and it's so

04:43:43.040 --> 04:43:45.040
interesting to have somebody like you which

04:43:45.040 --> 04:43:47.040
is the fundamentally different trajectory

04:43:47.040 --> 04:43:49.040
and that's where the big solutions

04:43:49.040 --> 04:43:51.040
can come because there is a kind of silo

04:43:51.040 --> 04:43:53.040
and it is

04:43:53.040 --> 04:43:55.040
a bunch of people kind of following the same kind

04:43:55.040 --> 04:43:57.040
of set of ideas and I was really

04:43:57.040 --> 04:43:59.040
worried that I didn't want to

04:43:59.040 --> 04:44:01.040
come off as you know like

04:44:01.040 --> 04:44:03.040
an arrogant outsider for things where I

04:44:03.040 --> 04:44:05.040
have all the respect in the world for the work

04:44:05.040 --> 04:44:07.040
that's you know it's been a miracle decade

04:44:07.040 --> 04:44:09.040
it's we're in the midst of a scientific

04:44:09.040 --> 04:44:11.040
revolution happening now and everybody

04:44:11.040 --> 04:44:13.040
doing this is I you know these are

04:44:13.040 --> 04:44:15.040
the Einstein's and Bohr's and whatever's

04:44:15.040 --> 04:44:17.040
of our modern era

04:44:17.040 --> 04:44:19.040
and I was really happy to see

04:44:19.040 --> 04:44:21.040
that the people that I sat down and

04:44:21.040 --> 04:44:23.040
talked with everybody does seem to really

04:44:23.040 --> 04:44:25.040
be quite great about just happy

04:44:25.040 --> 04:44:27.040
to talk about things willing to acknowledge

04:44:27.040 --> 04:44:29.040
that we don't know what we're doing we're

04:44:29.040 --> 04:44:31.040
figuring it out as we go along

04:44:31.040 --> 04:44:33.040
and I mean I've got a huge

04:44:33.040 --> 04:44:35.040
debt on this where

04:44:35.040 --> 04:44:37.040
it's all really started for me because

04:44:37.040 --> 04:44:39.040
Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open

04:44:39.040 --> 04:44:41.040
AI and it was at

04:44:41.040 --> 04:44:43.040
a point when I didn't know anything about

04:44:43.040 --> 04:44:45.040
what was really going on in

04:44:45.040 --> 04:44:47.040
machine learning and in fact

04:44:47.040 --> 04:44:49.040
it's funny how the first time you reached out to

04:44:49.040 --> 04:44:51.040
me it's like four years ago for your AI

04:44:51.040 --> 04:44:53.040
podcast. Yeah for people

04:44:53.040 --> 04:44:55.040
yeah for people

04:44:55.040 --> 04:44:57.040
who

04:44:57.040 --> 04:44:59.040
listening to this should know that

04:44:59.040 --> 04:45:01.040
first of all obviously

04:45:01.040 --> 04:45:03.040
I've been a huge fan of yours for the longest

04:45:03.040 --> 04:45:05.040
time but we've agreed to talk like yeah

04:45:05.040 --> 04:45:07.040
like four years ago back when this was

04:45:07.040 --> 04:45:09.040
called the artificial intelligence podcast

04:45:09.040 --> 04:45:11.040
we wanted to

04:45:11.040 --> 04:45:13.040
do a thing and you said yes

04:45:13.040 --> 04:45:15.040
and I said it's like I don't know anything about

04:45:15.040 --> 04:45:17.040
modern AI. That's right. I said I could kind of

04:45:17.040 --> 04:45:19.040
take an angle on machine perception because

04:45:19.040 --> 04:45:21.040
you know I'm doing a lot of that with the

04:45:21.040 --> 04:45:23.040
sensors and the virtual reality but

04:45:23.040 --> 04:45:25.040
we could probably find something to talk about.

04:45:25.040 --> 04:45:27.040
And then so I mean and that's where

04:45:27.040 --> 04:45:29.040
when did Sam talk to you about open AI

04:45:29.040 --> 04:45:31.040
around the same time? No it was

04:45:31.040 --> 04:45:33.040
a little bit after that so

04:45:33.040 --> 04:45:35.040
I had done the most basic work

04:45:35.040 --> 04:45:37.040
I had kind of done the neural networks

04:45:37.040 --> 04:45:39.040
from scratch where I had gone and written

04:45:39.040 --> 04:45:41.040
it all in C just to make sure I understood

04:45:41.040 --> 04:45:43.040
backpropagation at the lowest

04:45:43.040 --> 04:45:45.040
level and my my nuts and bolts

04:45:45.040 --> 04:45:47.040
approach but after Sam

04:45:47.040 --> 04:45:49.040
approached me

04:45:49.040 --> 04:45:51.040
I was flattering to think that he thought

04:45:51.040 --> 04:45:53.040
that I could be useful at open

04:45:53.040 --> 04:45:55.040
AI largely for kind of like

04:45:55.040 --> 04:45:57.040
systems optimization sorts

04:45:57.040 --> 04:45:59.040
of things. I am

04:45:59.040 --> 04:46:01.040
without being an expert but

04:46:01.040 --> 04:46:03.040
I asked you know Ilya Sutskover to give me

04:46:03.040 --> 04:46:05.040
a reading list and he gave me

04:46:05.040 --> 04:46:07.040
a binder full of

04:46:07.040 --> 04:46:09.040
all the papers that like

04:46:09.040 --> 04:46:11.040
okay these are the important things if you

04:46:11.040 --> 04:46:13.040
really read and understand all of these

04:46:13.040 --> 04:46:15.040
you'll know like 80% of what most of the

04:46:15.040 --> 04:46:17.040
you know the machine language researchers

04:46:17.040 --> 04:46:19.040
work on and I went through and I read

04:46:19.040 --> 04:46:21.040
all those papers multiple times and highlighted

04:46:21.040 --> 04:46:23.040
them and went through and kind of

04:46:23.040 --> 04:46:25.040
figured the things out there and then started

04:46:25.040 --> 04:46:27.040
branching out into my own

04:46:27.040 --> 04:46:29.040
sets of research on things and

04:46:29.040 --> 04:46:31.040
actually started writing my own experiments

04:46:31.040 --> 04:46:33.040
and doing kind of figuring out

04:46:33.040 --> 04:46:35.040
you know finding out what I don't know

04:46:35.040 --> 04:46:37.040
what the limits of my knowledge are and starting

04:46:37.040 --> 04:46:39.040
to get some of my angles of attack on

04:46:39.040 --> 04:46:41.040
things the things that I think are a little

04:46:41.040 --> 04:46:43.040
bit different from what people

04:46:43.040 --> 04:46:45.040
are doing and

04:46:45.040 --> 04:46:47.040
I've had a couple years now

04:46:47.040 --> 04:46:49.040
like two years since I kind of left

04:46:49.040 --> 04:46:51.040
the full-time position at Meta

04:46:51.040 --> 04:46:53.040
and now I've kind

04:46:53.040 --> 04:46:55.040
of pulled the trigger and said I'm going

04:46:55.040 --> 04:46:57.040
to get serious about it but

04:46:57.040 --> 04:46:59.040
some of my lessons all the way back to Armadillo Aerospace

04:46:59.040 --> 04:47:01.040
about how I know I need to be

04:47:01.040 --> 04:47:03.040
more committed to this where

04:47:03.040 --> 04:47:05.040
there is that

04:47:05.040 --> 04:47:07.040
it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways

04:47:07.040 --> 04:47:09.040
when you know that you're wealthy enough to say

04:47:09.040 --> 04:47:11.040
it's like this doesn't really mean anything

04:47:11.040 --> 04:47:13.040
I can I can spend

04:47:13.040 --> 04:47:15.040
I can spend a million dollars a year

04:47:15.040 --> 04:47:17.040
for the rest of my life and it doesn't

04:47:17.040 --> 04:47:19.040
mean anything it's fine

04:47:19.040 --> 04:47:21.040
but that is an opportunity

04:47:21.040 --> 04:47:23.040
to just kind of meander

04:47:23.040 --> 04:47:25.040
and I could see that in myself

04:47:25.040 --> 04:47:27.040
when I'm doing some things it's like oh this is

04:47:27.040 --> 04:47:29.040
a kind of interesting curious thing

04:47:29.040 --> 04:47:31.040
I've done this for a little while let's look at that

04:47:31.040 --> 04:47:33.040
it's not really bearing down on the problem

04:47:33.040 --> 04:47:35.040
so

04:47:35.040 --> 04:47:37.040
there's a few things that

04:47:37.040 --> 04:47:39.040
that I've done that are kind of tactics

04:47:39.040 --> 04:47:41.040
for myself to make me more effective

04:47:41.040 --> 04:47:43.040
like one thing I noticed I was not doing

04:47:43.040 --> 04:47:45.040
well is

04:47:45.040 --> 04:47:47.040
I had a Google Cloud account to get

04:47:47.040 --> 04:47:49.040
GPUs there and I was finding I was very

04:47:49.040 --> 04:47:51.040
rarely doing that for no good psychological

04:47:51.040 --> 04:47:53.040
reasons where I'm like oh

04:47:53.040 --> 04:47:55.040
I can always think of something to do other than

04:47:55.040 --> 04:47:57.040
to spin up instances and run an experiment

04:47:57.040 --> 04:47:59.040
and you know keep working on my local Titans

04:47:59.040 --> 04:48:01.040
or something

04:48:01.040 --> 04:48:03.040
but it was really stupid I mean it was not a

04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:05.040
lot of money I should have been running more

04:48:05.040 --> 04:48:07.040
experiments there so I thought to myself

04:48:07.040 --> 04:48:09.040
well I'm going to go buy

04:48:09.040 --> 04:48:11.040
a quarter million dollar DGX station

04:48:11.040 --> 04:48:13.040
I'm going to just like sit it right there

04:48:13.040 --> 04:48:15.040
and it's going to mock me if I'm not using it

04:48:15.040 --> 04:48:17.040
if the fans aren't running on that thing

04:48:17.040 --> 04:48:19.040
I'm not properly utilizing it

04:48:19.040 --> 04:48:21.040
and that's been helpful you know I've done

04:48:21.040 --> 04:48:23.040
a lot more experiments since then

04:48:23.040 --> 04:48:25.040
it's been interesting where I thought

04:48:25.040 --> 04:48:27.040
all this low-level envy link optimized

04:48:27.040 --> 04:48:29.040
stuff but 90% of what I do is just spin

04:48:29.040 --> 04:48:31.040
up four instances of an experiment with

04:48:31.040 --> 04:48:33.040
different hyperparameters on it

04:48:33.040 --> 04:48:35.040
you're doing

04:48:35.040 --> 04:48:37.040
like really sort of building up intuition

04:48:37.040 --> 04:48:39.040
by doing ML experiments of different kinds

04:48:39.040 --> 04:48:41.040
but so

04:48:41.040 --> 04:48:43.040
the next big thing though is

04:48:43.040 --> 04:48:45.040
I am you know I decided

04:48:45.040 --> 04:48:47.040
that I was going to take some

04:48:47.040 --> 04:48:49.040
investor money because

04:48:49.040 --> 04:48:51.040
I have an overactive sense of responsibility

04:48:51.040 --> 04:48:53.040
about other people's money

04:48:53.040 --> 04:48:55.040
I am and it's like

04:48:55.040 --> 04:48:57.040
I don't want

04:48:57.040 --> 04:48:59.040
I mean a lot of my push

04:48:59.040 --> 04:49:01.040
and my passionate entreaties for things

04:49:01.040 --> 04:49:03.040
at Meta are it's like I don't want

04:49:03.040 --> 04:49:05.040
Zuck to have wasted his money investing in Oculus

04:49:05.040 --> 04:49:07.040
I want it to work out I want it to change

04:49:07.040 --> 04:49:09.040
the world I want it to be worth

04:49:09.040 --> 04:49:11.040
all of this time money and effort

04:49:11.040 --> 04:49:13.040
going into it and I

04:49:13.040 --> 04:49:15.040
expect that it's going to be like

04:49:15.040 --> 04:49:17.040
that with my company

04:49:17.040 --> 04:49:19.040
where it's a huge forcing function

04:49:19.040 --> 04:49:21.040
this investment investors

04:49:21.040 --> 04:49:23.040
that are going to expect something

04:49:23.040 --> 04:49:25.040
of me now we've all had the conversation

04:49:25.040 --> 04:49:27.040
that this is a low probability

04:49:27.040 --> 04:49:29.040
long-term bet it's not something

04:49:29.040 --> 04:49:31.040
that there's a million things I could do

04:49:31.040 --> 04:49:33.040
that I would have line of sight on the value

04:49:33.040 --> 04:49:35.040
proposition for this isn't that I think

04:49:35.040 --> 04:49:37.040
there are there are unknown unknowns

04:49:37.040 --> 04:49:39.040
in the way but

04:49:39.040 --> 04:49:41.040
it's one of these things that it's

04:49:41.040 --> 04:49:43.040
you know it's hyperball but it's potentially

04:49:43.040 --> 04:49:45.040
one of the most important things humans ever

04:49:45.040 --> 04:49:47.040
do and it's something that I think is

04:49:47.040 --> 04:49:49.040
within our lifetimes if not within

04:49:49.040 --> 04:49:51.040
a decade

04:49:51.040 --> 04:49:53.040
to happen so

04:49:53.040 --> 04:49:55.040
yeah this is just now happening

04:49:55.040 --> 04:49:57.040
like term sheet like the ink is barely

04:49:57.040 --> 04:49:59.040
virtually dry off

04:49:59.040 --> 04:50:01.040
I mean as I mentioned you're all flying

04:50:01.040 --> 04:50:03.040
like somebody I admire

04:50:03.040 --> 04:50:05.040
somebody you know Andre Capati

04:50:05.040 --> 04:50:07.040
I think the two of you different trajectories

04:50:07.040 --> 04:50:09.040
in life but approach problems

04:50:09.040 --> 04:50:11.040
similarly in that he codes

04:50:11.040 --> 04:50:13.040
stuff from scratch up all the time

04:50:13.040 --> 04:50:15.040
and

04:50:15.040 --> 04:50:17.040
he's created a bunch of little things

04:50:17.040 --> 04:50:19.040
that have

04:50:19.040 --> 04:50:21.040
even outside the course

04:50:21.040 --> 04:50:23.040
at Stanford

04:50:23.040 --> 04:50:25.040
that have been tremendously useful

04:50:25.040 --> 04:50:27.040
to build up intuition about stuff

04:50:27.040 --> 04:50:29.040
but also to help people and

04:50:29.040 --> 04:50:31.040
they're all in the realm of AI

04:50:31.040 --> 04:50:33.040
do you see yourself

04:50:33.040 --> 04:50:35.040
potentially doing things like this

04:50:35.040 --> 04:50:37.040
you know not necessarily solving a

04:50:37.040 --> 04:50:39.040
gigantic problem but on the journey

04:50:39.040 --> 04:50:41.040
on the path to that

04:50:41.040 --> 04:50:43.040
building up intuitions

04:50:43.040 --> 04:50:45.040
and

04:50:45.040 --> 04:50:47.040
sharing code or ideas

04:50:47.040 --> 04:50:49.040
or systems

04:50:49.040 --> 04:50:51.040
that give

04:50:51.040 --> 04:50:53.040
inklings of AGI

04:50:53.040 --> 04:50:55.040
but also kind of are useful to people

04:50:55.040 --> 04:50:57.040
in some way so yeah first of all Andre is awesome

04:50:57.040 --> 04:50:59.040
I learned a lot when I was going through my

04:50:59.040 --> 04:51:01.040
larval phase from his blog posts

04:51:01.040 --> 04:51:03.040
and his Stanford course and you know

04:51:03.040 --> 04:51:05.040
super valuable I got to meet him first

04:51:05.040 --> 04:51:07.040
a couple years ago when I was first

04:51:07.040 --> 04:51:09.040
kind of starting off on my

04:51:09.040 --> 04:51:11.040
gentleman scientist bit

04:51:11.040 --> 04:51:13.040
and just a

04:51:13.040 --> 04:51:15.040
few months ago when he went out on his sabbatical

04:51:15.040 --> 04:51:17.040
he stopped by in Dallas and we talked

04:51:17.040 --> 04:51:19.040
for a while and I had

04:51:19.040 --> 04:51:21.040
a great time with him and then when I heard he actually left

04:51:21.040 --> 04:51:23.040
Tesla I did of course along with

04:51:23.040 --> 04:51:25.040
100 other people say hey

04:51:25.040 --> 04:51:27.040
if you ever want to work with me

04:51:27.040 --> 04:51:29.040
it would be an honor so

04:51:29.040 --> 04:51:31.040
he thinks that he's going to be doing this educational

04:51:31.040 --> 04:51:33.040
work but I think someone's going to make him an offer

04:51:33.040 --> 04:51:35.040
he can't refuse before

04:51:35.040 --> 04:51:37.040
he gets too far along on it

04:51:37.040 --> 04:51:39.040
oh his current interest is educational

04:51:39.040 --> 04:51:41.040
so yeah

04:51:41.040 --> 04:51:43.040
he's a special mind

04:51:43.040 --> 04:51:45.040
is there something you could speak to what makes

04:51:45.040 --> 04:51:47.040
him so special

04:51:47.040 --> 04:51:49.040
you know like he did

04:51:49.040 --> 04:51:51.040
he was very much a programmers programmer

04:51:51.040 --> 04:51:53.040
that was doing machine learning work rather than

04:51:53.040 --> 04:51:55.040
it's a different feel

04:51:55.040 --> 04:51:57.040
than an academic where you can see it

04:51:57.040 --> 04:51:59.040
in paper sometimes where somebody that's

04:51:59.040 --> 04:52:01.040
really a mathematician or a statistician

04:52:01.040 --> 04:52:03.040
at heart and they're doing

04:52:03.040 --> 04:52:05.040
something with machine learning but

04:52:05.040 --> 04:52:07.040
you know Andre is about getting something done

04:52:07.040 --> 04:52:09.040
and you could see it in like all of his

04:52:09.040 --> 04:52:11.040
earliest approaches to it's like okay

04:52:11.040 --> 04:52:13.040
here's how reinforcement learning works

04:52:13.040 --> 04:52:15.040
here's how recurrent neural networks work

04:52:15.040 --> 04:52:17.040
here's how transformers work

04:52:17.040 --> 04:52:19.040
here's how crypto works

04:52:19.040 --> 04:52:21.040
and I am

04:52:21.040 --> 04:52:23.040
and yeah it's just

04:52:23.040 --> 04:52:25.040
one of his old posts was like

04:52:25.040 --> 04:52:27.040
a hacker's guide to machine learning

04:52:27.040 --> 04:52:29.040
he deprecated that and said don't really pay attention

04:52:29.040 --> 04:52:31.040
to what's in here but it's that

04:52:31.040 --> 04:52:33.040
thought that carries through

04:52:33.040 --> 04:52:35.040
in a lot of it where it is that

04:52:35.040 --> 04:52:37.040
back again to that hacker mentality

04:52:37.040 --> 04:52:39.040
and the hacker ethic with what he's doing

04:52:39.040 --> 04:52:41.040
and sharing all of it

04:52:41.040 --> 04:52:43.040
yeah and a lot of his approach to a new thing

04:52:43.040 --> 04:52:45.040
like you said larva stage

04:52:45.040 --> 04:52:47.040
is let me code up

04:52:47.040 --> 04:52:49.040
the simplest possible thing

04:52:49.040 --> 04:52:51.040
to build up intuition about it

04:52:51.040 --> 04:52:53.040
yeah like I say I sketch with structs and things

04:52:53.040 --> 04:52:55.040
when I'm just thinking about a problem

04:52:55.040 --> 04:52:57.040
I'm thinking in some degree of code

04:52:57.040 --> 04:52:59.040
you are also

04:52:59.040 --> 04:53:01.040
among many things a Marshall

04:53:01.040 --> 04:53:03.040
artist both Judo and Jiu Jitsu

04:53:03.040 --> 04:53:05.040
how has this helped

04:53:05.040 --> 04:53:07.040
make you the person you are

04:53:07.040 --> 04:53:09.040
so I mean I was a competent club player

04:53:09.040 --> 04:53:11.040
in Judo and grappling

04:53:11.040 --> 04:53:13.040
I mean I was you know by no means

04:53:13.040 --> 04:53:15.040
any kind of a superstar but

04:53:15.040 --> 04:53:17.040
it was I went through a few phases

04:53:17.040 --> 04:53:19.040
with it where I did some

04:53:19.040 --> 04:53:21.040
when I was quite young

04:53:21.040 --> 04:53:23.040
a little bit more when I was 17

04:53:23.040 --> 04:53:25.040
and then I got into it

04:53:25.040 --> 04:53:27.040
kind of seriously in my mid 30s

04:53:27.040 --> 04:53:29.040
and you know I went pretty far

04:53:29.040 --> 04:53:31.040
with it and I was you know

04:53:31.040 --> 04:53:33.040
pretty good at some of the things that I was doing

04:53:33.040 --> 04:53:35.040
and I did appreciate it quite a bit

04:53:35.040 --> 04:53:37.040
where

04:53:37.040 --> 04:53:39.040
on the one hand it's always

04:53:39.040 --> 04:53:41.040
if you're going to do exercise or something

04:53:41.040 --> 04:53:43.040
it's a more motivating form of exercise

04:53:43.040 --> 04:53:45.040
if someone is crushing you

04:53:45.040 --> 04:53:47.040
you are motivated

04:53:47.040 --> 04:53:49.040
to do something about that

04:53:49.040 --> 04:53:51.040
to up your attributes and be better about

04:53:51.040 --> 04:53:53.040
getting out of that

04:53:53.040 --> 04:53:55.040
but there's also that sense that

04:53:55.040 --> 04:53:57.040
I was not

04:53:57.040 --> 04:53:59.040
I was not a sports guy

04:53:59.040 --> 04:54:01.040
I did do wrestling in junior high

04:54:01.040 --> 04:54:03.040
I think I would have

04:54:03.040 --> 04:54:05.040
I would have been good for me if I'd carried that on

04:54:05.040 --> 04:54:07.040
into high school and had a little bit more

04:54:07.040 --> 04:54:09.040
of that I mean it's like I

04:54:09.040 --> 04:54:11.040
you know felt a little bit of wrestling

04:54:11.040 --> 04:54:13.040
vibe with always going on about embracing

04:54:13.040 --> 04:54:15.040
the grind and like that push that I

04:54:15.040 --> 04:54:17.040
associate with the wrestling team

04:54:17.040 --> 04:54:19.040
that I in hindsight

04:54:19.040 --> 04:54:21.040
I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself

04:54:21.040 --> 04:54:23.040
that way

04:54:23.040 --> 04:54:25.040
but even getting back into Judo and Jujitsu

04:54:25.040 --> 04:54:27.040
in my mid 30s as usually

04:54:27.040 --> 04:54:29.040
the old man on the mat with that

04:54:29.040 --> 04:54:31.040
still the

04:54:31.040 --> 04:54:33.040
sense that

04:54:33.040 --> 04:54:35.040
working out with the group

04:54:35.040 --> 04:54:37.040
and having the guys

04:54:37.040 --> 04:54:39.040
that you're beating each other up with it

04:54:39.040 --> 04:54:41.040
but you just feel

04:54:41.040 --> 04:54:43.040
good coming out of it and I can remember

04:54:43.040 --> 04:54:45.040
those driving home

04:54:45.040 --> 04:54:47.040
aching in various ways and just thinking

04:54:47.040 --> 04:54:49.040
it's like that was really great

04:54:49.040 --> 04:54:51.040
and

04:54:51.040 --> 04:54:53.040
it's mixing with a bunch of people that had nothing

04:54:53.040 --> 04:54:55.040
to do with any of the things that

04:54:55.040 --> 04:54:57.040
I worked with every once in a while

04:54:57.040 --> 04:54:59.040
to be like oh you're the doom guy

04:54:59.040 --> 04:55:01.040
and but for the most part

04:55:01.040 --> 04:55:03.040
it was just different slice of life

04:55:03.040 --> 04:55:05.040
you know a good thing

04:55:05.040 --> 04:55:07.040
and I made the call when I was

04:55:07.040 --> 04:55:09.040
40 that's like maybe I'm getting a little old

04:55:09.040 --> 04:55:11.040
for this I had separated a rib

04:55:11.040 --> 04:55:13.040
and tweaked a few things and I got out

04:55:13.040 --> 04:55:15.040
without any really bad injuries

04:55:15.040 --> 04:55:17.040
and was like

04:55:17.040 --> 04:55:19.040
have I dodged enough bullets should I

04:55:19.040 --> 04:55:21.040
hang it up I went back

04:55:21.040 --> 04:55:23.040
I've gone a couple times

04:55:23.040 --> 04:55:25.040
in the last decade trying to get my kids

04:55:25.040 --> 04:55:27.040
into it a little bit I didn't really stick

04:55:27.040 --> 04:55:29.040
with any of them but it was fun to get

04:55:29.040 --> 04:55:31.040
back on the mats I really

04:55:31.040 --> 04:55:33.040
hurts for a while when you haven't gone

04:55:33.040 --> 04:55:35.040
I gone for a while but

04:55:35.040 --> 04:55:37.040
I still debate this

04:55:37.040 --> 04:55:39.040
pretty constantly my brother's only a year younger

04:55:39.040 --> 04:55:41.040
than me and he's going kind of hard in jujitsu

04:55:41.040 --> 04:55:43.040
right now and I you know he was

04:55:43.040 --> 04:55:45.040
just he won a few medals at the last

04:55:45.040 --> 04:55:47.040
tournament he was at competing

04:55:47.040 --> 04:55:49.040
and I was thinking yeah I guess we're

04:55:49.040 --> 04:55:51.040
in the executive division if you're over

04:55:51.040 --> 04:55:53.040
50 or over 45

04:55:53.040 --> 04:55:55.040
something and

04:55:55.040 --> 04:55:57.040
it's not out of the question that

04:55:57.040 --> 04:55:59.040
I go back at some point and do some of this

04:55:59.040 --> 04:56:01.040
but again I'm just reorganizing

04:56:01.040 --> 04:56:03.040
my life around more focus

04:56:03.040 --> 04:56:05.040
probably not going to happen

04:56:05.040 --> 04:56:07.040
I'm pushing my exercise around

04:56:07.040 --> 04:56:09.040
to give me a longer uninterrupted intellectual

04:56:09.040 --> 04:56:11.040
focus time pushing it to the beginning

04:56:11.040 --> 04:56:13.040
or the end of the game like running and stuff like that

04:56:13.040 --> 04:56:15.040
walking yeah yeah running

04:56:15.040 --> 04:56:17.040
and calisthenics and some things like

04:56:17.040 --> 04:56:19.040
that but it allows you to still think

04:56:19.040 --> 04:56:21.040
about a problem and but if you're going to

04:56:21.040 --> 04:56:23.040
do judo club or something you're you've got to fix

04:56:23.040 --> 04:56:25.040
it's going to be seven o'clock or whatever

04:56:25.040 --> 04:56:27.040
10 o'clock on Saturday

04:56:27.040 --> 04:56:29.040
although I talked about this a little bit

04:56:29.040 --> 04:56:31.040
when I was on Rogan and shortly after

04:56:31.040 --> 04:56:33.040
that Carlos Machado did reach out

04:56:33.040 --> 04:56:35.040
and I had trained with him for years

04:56:35.040 --> 04:56:37.040
back in the day and he was like

04:56:37.040 --> 04:56:39.040
hey we've got kind of a small private club

04:56:39.040 --> 04:56:41.040
with a bunch of executive type

04:56:41.040 --> 04:56:43.040
people and

04:56:43.040 --> 04:56:45.040
it gets it does tempt me

04:56:45.040 --> 04:56:47.040
yeah I don't know if you know him

04:56:47.040 --> 04:56:49.040
but John Donahart

04:56:49.040 --> 04:56:51.040
came here to Austin

04:56:51.040 --> 04:56:53.040
with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks

04:56:53.040 --> 04:56:55.040
and he has a very interesting way

04:56:55.040 --> 04:56:57.040
very deep systematic way

04:56:57.040 --> 04:56:59.040
of thinking about jiu-jitsu

04:56:59.040 --> 04:57:01.040
that reveals the

04:57:01.040 --> 04:57:03.040
the chest of it

04:57:03.040 --> 04:57:05.040
the like the

04:57:05.040 --> 04:57:07.040
the science of it

04:57:07.040 --> 04:57:09.040
and I do think about that more as

04:57:09.040 --> 04:57:11.040
kind of an older person considering the martial arts

04:57:11.040 --> 04:57:13.040
where I can remember the very earliest

04:57:13.040 --> 04:57:15.040
days getting back into judo and I'm like

04:57:15.040 --> 04:57:17.040
teach me submissions right now

04:57:17.040 --> 04:57:19.040
you know it's like learn the arm bar

04:57:19.040 --> 04:57:21.040
learn the choke

04:57:21.040 --> 04:57:23.040
but as you get older you start thinking more about

04:57:23.040 --> 04:57:25.040
it's like okay I really do want to

04:57:25.040 --> 04:57:27.040
learn the entire canon of judo

04:57:27.040 --> 04:57:29.040
it's like all the different things there

04:57:29.040 --> 04:57:31.040
and all the different approaches for it

04:57:31.040 --> 04:57:33.040
not just the you know if you want to compete

04:57:33.040 --> 04:57:35.040
there's just a handful of things you learn really really well

04:57:35.040 --> 04:57:37.040
but sometimes there's interest

04:57:37.040 --> 04:57:39.040
in learning a little bit more of the scope there

04:57:39.040 --> 04:57:41.040
and figuring some things out from

04:57:41.040 --> 04:57:43.040
at one point I had

04:57:43.040 --> 04:57:45.040
wasn't exactly a spreadsheet but I did have

04:57:45.040 --> 04:57:47.040
a big long text file with like here's the things

04:57:47.040 --> 04:57:49.040
that I learned in here like ways you

04:57:49.040 --> 04:57:51.040
chain this together and while

04:57:51.040 --> 04:57:53.040
when I went back a few years

04:57:53.040 --> 04:57:55.040
ago it was good to see that I

04:57:55.040 --> 04:57:57.040
whipped myself back into reasonable shape

04:57:57.040 --> 04:57:59.040
about doing the basic grappling but I know

04:57:59.040 --> 04:58:01.040
there was a ton of the subtleties that were

04:58:01.040 --> 04:58:03.040
just that were gone but could probably be

04:58:03.040 --> 04:58:05.040
brought back reasonably quickly

04:58:05.040 --> 04:58:07.040
and there's also the benefit I mean

04:58:07.040 --> 04:58:09.040
you're exceptionally successful now

04:58:11.040 --> 04:58:13.040
you're brilliant

04:58:13.040 --> 04:58:15.040
and the problem the old problem

04:58:15.040 --> 04:58:17.040
of the ego

04:58:17.040 --> 04:58:19.040
I still pushed kind of

04:58:19.040 --> 04:58:21.040
harder than I should I mean that was

04:58:21.040 --> 04:58:23.040
I was one of those people that

04:58:23.040 --> 04:58:25.040
I'm on the smaller side

04:58:25.040 --> 04:58:27.040
for a lot of the people competing

04:58:27.040 --> 04:58:29.040
and I would you know I'd go with

04:58:29.040 --> 04:58:31.040
all the big guys and I'd go hard

04:58:31.040 --> 04:58:33.040
and I'd push myself a lot

04:58:33.040 --> 04:58:35.040
and that would be one of those where

04:58:35.040 --> 04:58:37.040
I'd be

04:58:37.040 --> 04:58:39.040
dangerous to anyone for the first five minutes

04:58:39.040 --> 04:58:41.040
but then sometimes after that I'm already dead

04:58:41.040 --> 04:58:43.040
and I knew it was terrible for me because

04:58:43.040 --> 04:58:45.040
it made the you know it meant

04:58:45.040 --> 04:58:47.040
I got less training time with all of that

04:58:47.040 --> 04:58:49.040
when you go and you just gas out

04:58:49.040 --> 04:58:51.040
relatively quickly there and I

04:58:51.040 --> 04:58:53.040
like to think that I would be better

04:58:53.040 --> 04:58:55.040
about that where after I gave

04:58:55.040 --> 04:58:57.040
up judo I started doing the half marathons

04:58:57.040 --> 04:58:59.040
and tough butters and things like that

04:58:59.040 --> 04:59:01.040
and so when I did go back to the

04:59:01.040 --> 04:59:03.040
local judo kai club I thought

04:59:03.040 --> 04:59:05.040
oh I should have better cardio for this

04:59:05.040 --> 04:59:07.040
because I'm a runner now and I do all of this

04:59:07.040 --> 04:59:09.040
and didn't work out that way

04:59:09.040 --> 04:59:11.040
and that's the same old thing where

04:59:11.040 --> 04:59:13.040
just push really hard

04:59:13.040 --> 04:59:15.040
strain really hard and

04:59:15.040 --> 04:59:17.040
and of course when I worked with good guys

04:59:17.040 --> 04:59:19.040
like Carlos it's like

04:59:19.040 --> 04:59:21.040
just the whole flow like water

04:59:21.040 --> 04:59:23.040
thing is real and he's just like

04:59:23.040 --> 04:59:25.040
that's true with judo too some of the best

04:59:25.040 --> 04:59:27.040
people like I've trained with

04:59:27.040 --> 04:59:29.040
Olympic gold medalists and

04:59:29.040 --> 04:59:31.040
for some reason with them

04:59:31.040 --> 04:59:33.040
everything's easier

04:59:33.040 --> 04:59:35.040
everything is you actually start to

04:59:35.040 --> 04:59:37.040
feel the science of it

04:59:37.040 --> 04:59:39.040
everything's effortless

04:59:39.040 --> 04:59:41.040
you understand that there's an art

04:59:41.040 --> 04:59:43.040
to it it's not just an exercise

04:59:43.040 --> 04:59:45.040
it was interesting where I did

04:59:45.040 --> 04:59:47.040
go to the Kodakon in Japan

04:59:47.040 --> 04:59:49.040
the birthplace of judo and everything

04:59:49.040 --> 04:59:51.040
and I remember I rolled with one old

04:59:51.040 --> 04:59:53.040
guy I didn't

04:59:53.040 --> 04:59:55.040
start standing just started on groundwork

04:59:55.040 --> 04:59:57.040
and it was striking how

04:59:57.040 --> 04:59:59.040
different it was from Carlos he was still

04:59:59.040 --> 05:00:01.040
he was better than me and he got my arm

05:00:01.040 --> 05:00:03.040
and I had to tap there but

05:00:03.040 --> 05:00:05.040
it was a completely different style

05:00:05.040 --> 05:00:07.040
where I just felt like I could do nothing

05:00:07.040 --> 05:00:09.040
he was just enveloping me and just like slowly

05:00:09.040 --> 05:00:11.040
ground it down put my arm and bent

05:00:11.040 --> 05:00:13.040
it while with Carlos

05:00:13.040 --> 05:00:15.040
you know he's just loose and free and you always

05:00:15.040 --> 05:00:17.040
thought like oh you're just going to go grab something

05:00:17.040 --> 05:00:19.040
but you never had any chance to do it but it was

05:00:19.040 --> 05:00:21.040
very different feeling that's a good summary

05:00:21.040 --> 05:00:23.040
of the difference between Jiu-Jitsu and Judo

05:00:23.040 --> 05:00:25.040
and Jiu-Jitsu there's it is a dance

05:00:25.040 --> 05:00:27.040
and you feel like there's a freedom

05:00:27.040 --> 05:00:29.040
and actually

05:00:29.040 --> 05:00:31.040
anybody I like

05:00:31.040 --> 05:00:33.040
Gordon Ryan one of the best

05:00:33.040 --> 05:00:35.040
grappler in the world Nogi grappler in the world

05:00:35.040 --> 05:00:37.040
there's a feeling like you can do

05:00:37.040 --> 05:00:39.040
anything but

05:00:39.040 --> 05:00:41.040
when you actually try to do something

05:00:41.040 --> 05:00:43.040
you can't just magically doesn't work but with

05:00:43.040 --> 05:00:45.040
the best judo players in the world yeah it

05:00:45.040 --> 05:00:47.040
does feel like there's

05:00:47.040 --> 05:00:49.040
a blanket that weighs a thousand

05:00:49.040 --> 05:00:51.040
pounds on top of you and there's

05:00:51.040 --> 05:00:53.040
not a feeling like you can do anything

05:00:53.040 --> 05:00:55.040
you just you're trapped and that's

05:00:55.040 --> 05:00:57.040
a that's a style that's a difference

05:00:57.040 --> 05:00:59.040
in the style of martial arts but it's also

05:00:59.040 --> 05:01:01.040
once you start to study you

05:01:01.040 --> 05:01:03.040
understand it all has to do with human

05:01:03.040 --> 05:01:05.040
movement and the physics of it

05:01:05.040 --> 05:01:07.040
and the leverage and all that kind of stuff

05:01:07.040 --> 05:01:09.040
and that's like that's super fascinating

05:01:09.040 --> 05:01:11.040
at the end of the day for me

05:01:11.040 --> 05:01:13.040
the biggest benefit is in the humbling

05:01:13.040 --> 05:01:15.040
aspect when another human being

05:01:15.040 --> 05:01:17.040
kind of

05:01:17.040 --> 05:01:19.040
tells you that

05:01:19.040 --> 05:01:21.040
you know there's a hierarchy or there's

05:01:21.040 --> 05:01:23.040
a

05:01:23.040 --> 05:01:25.040
you're not that special

05:01:25.040 --> 05:01:27.040
and in the most extreme case when you tap

05:01:27.040 --> 05:01:29.040
to a choke you are basically

05:01:29.040 --> 05:01:31.040
living because somebody let you live

05:01:31.040 --> 05:01:33.040
and that's that is

05:01:33.040 --> 05:01:35.040
one of those if you think about it that is a

05:01:35.040 --> 05:01:37.040
closer brush with mortality than

05:01:37.040 --> 05:01:39.040
than most people consider

05:01:39.040 --> 05:01:41.040
and that

05:01:41.040 --> 05:01:43.040
kind of humbling

05:01:43.040 --> 05:01:45.040
act is good to take to your

05:01:45.040 --> 05:01:47.040
work then where it's harder to get

05:01:47.040 --> 05:01:49.040
humbled you know

05:01:49.040 --> 05:01:51.040
yeah because nobody's nobody that does any

05:01:51.040 --> 05:01:53.040
martial art is coming out thinking I'm the best

05:01:53.040 --> 05:01:55.040
in the world at anything because

05:01:55.040 --> 05:01:57.040
everybody loses

05:01:57.040 --> 05:01:59.040
let me ask you for advice

05:01:59.040 --> 05:02:01.040
what advice would you give to young

05:02:01.040 --> 05:02:03.040
people today

05:02:03.040 --> 05:02:05.040
about life about career

05:02:05.040 --> 05:02:07.040
how they can have a job

05:02:07.040 --> 05:02:09.040
how they can have an

05:02:09.040 --> 05:02:11.040
impact how they can have a life

05:02:11.040 --> 05:02:13.040
they could be proud of

05:02:13.040 --> 05:02:15.040
so it was kind of fun I got

05:02:15.040 --> 05:02:17.040
invited to give the commencement speech back

05:02:17.040 --> 05:02:19.040
at the I went to college

05:02:19.040 --> 05:02:21.040
for two semesters and

05:02:21.040 --> 05:02:23.040
dropped out and went on to do my tech stuff

05:02:23.040 --> 05:02:25.040
but they still wanted me to come back

05:02:25.040 --> 05:02:27.040
and give a commencement speech

05:02:27.040 --> 05:02:29.040
and I got that pinned on my twitter

05:02:29.040 --> 05:02:31.040
account I still feel good about everything

05:02:31.040 --> 05:02:33.040
that I said there

05:02:33.040 --> 05:02:35.040
and my biggest point was

05:02:35.040 --> 05:02:37.040
that the path

05:02:37.040 --> 05:02:39.040
for me might not be the path for everyone

05:02:39.040 --> 05:02:41.040
and in fact the advice

05:02:41.040 --> 05:02:43.040
the path that I took and even the advice

05:02:43.040 --> 05:02:45.040
that I would give based on my

05:02:45.040 --> 05:02:47.040
experience and learnings probably

05:02:47.040 --> 05:02:49.040
isn't the best advice for everyone

05:02:49.040 --> 05:02:51.040
because what I did was all about

05:02:51.040 --> 05:02:53.040
this knowledge in depth

05:02:53.040 --> 05:02:55.040
about not just having this

05:02:55.040 --> 05:02:57.040
surface level ability to make things

05:02:57.040 --> 05:02:59.040
do what I want but to really understand

05:02:59.040 --> 05:03:01.040
them through and through to let me

05:03:01.040 --> 05:03:03.040
do the systems engineering work and

05:03:03.040 --> 05:03:05.040
sometimes find these inefficiencies

05:03:05.040 --> 05:03:07.040
that can be bypassed

05:03:07.040 --> 05:03:09.040
and that the whole

05:03:09.040 --> 05:03:11.040
world doesn't need that you know most

05:03:11.040 --> 05:03:13.040
programmers don't need or engineers of any

05:03:13.040 --> 05:03:15.040
kind don't necessarily need to do that

05:03:15.040 --> 05:03:17.040
they need to do a little job that's been

05:03:17.040 --> 05:03:19.040
parceled out to them be reliable

05:03:19.040 --> 05:03:21.040
let people depend on you

05:03:21.040 --> 05:03:23.040
and have quality work with all of that

05:03:23.040 --> 05:03:25.040
but people that do

05:03:25.040 --> 05:03:27.040
have an inclination

05:03:27.040 --> 05:03:29.040
for wanting to know things deeper

05:03:29.040 --> 05:03:31.040
and learn things deeper

05:03:31.040 --> 05:03:33.040
you know the

05:03:33.040 --> 05:03:35.040
there are just layers and layers of things

05:03:35.040 --> 05:03:37.040
out there and it's amazing

05:03:37.040 --> 05:03:39.040
if you're the right person that is

05:03:39.040 --> 05:03:41.040
excited about that

05:03:41.040 --> 05:03:43.040
the world's never been like this before

05:03:43.040 --> 05:03:45.040
it's better than ever I mean everything

05:03:45.040 --> 05:03:47.040
that was wonderful for me is still there

05:03:47.040 --> 05:03:49.040
and there's whole new worlds

05:03:49.040 --> 05:03:51.040
more on the different things that you

05:03:51.040 --> 05:03:53.040
can do and that

05:03:53.040 --> 05:03:55.040
you know it's hard work

05:03:55.040 --> 05:03:57.040
embrace the grind with it

05:03:57.040 --> 05:03:59.040
and understand as much as you can

05:03:59.040 --> 05:04:01.040
and then be

05:04:01.040 --> 05:04:03.040
prepared for opportunities to present

05:04:03.040 --> 05:04:05.040
themselves where you can't just

05:04:05.040 --> 05:04:07.040
say this is my golden life and just

05:04:07.040 --> 05:04:09.040
push at that I mean you might be able

05:04:09.040 --> 05:04:11.040
to do that but you're going to make more

05:04:11.040 --> 05:04:13.040
total progress if you say I'm

05:04:13.040 --> 05:04:15.040
preparing myself with this broad set

05:04:15.040 --> 05:04:17.040
of tools and then I'm being aware

05:04:17.040 --> 05:04:19.040
of all the way things are changing

05:04:19.040 --> 05:04:21.040
as I move through the world and as the whole

05:04:21.040 --> 05:04:23.040
world changes around me and then looking

05:04:23.040 --> 05:04:25.040
for opportunities to deploy the tools

05:04:25.040 --> 05:04:27.040
that you've built and

05:04:27.040 --> 05:04:29.040
there's going to be more and more of those

05:04:29.040 --> 05:04:31.040
types of things there where

05:04:31.040 --> 05:04:33.040
an awareness of what's happening where

05:04:33.040 --> 05:04:35.040
the inefficiencies are what things

05:04:35.040 --> 05:04:37.040
can be done what's possible

05:04:37.040 --> 05:04:39.040
versus what's current practice

05:04:39.040 --> 05:04:41.040
and then finding those areas where

05:04:41.040 --> 05:04:43.040
you can go and make an adjustment

05:04:43.040 --> 05:04:45.040
and make something that may

05:04:45.040 --> 05:04:47.040
affect millions or billions of people

05:04:47.040 --> 05:04:49.040
in the world make it better

05:04:49.040 --> 05:04:51.040
when maybe from your own example

05:04:51.040 --> 05:04:53.040
how are you able to recognize

05:04:53.040 --> 05:04:55.040
this about yourself that you saw

05:04:55.040 --> 05:04:57.040
the layers in a particular thing

05:04:57.040 --> 05:04:59.040
and you were drawn to

05:04:59.040 --> 05:05:01.040
discovering deeper and deeper truths about it

05:05:01.040 --> 05:05:03.040
is that something that was obvious

05:05:03.040 --> 05:05:05.040
to you that you couldn't help or is there

05:05:05.040 --> 05:05:07.040
some actions you had to take to actually

05:05:07.040 --> 05:05:09.040
allow yourself to dig deep

05:05:09.040 --> 05:05:11.040
so in the earliest days of personal computers

05:05:11.040 --> 05:05:13.040
I remember the reference manuals

05:05:13.040 --> 05:05:15.040
and the very early ones even had

05:05:15.040 --> 05:05:17.040
schematics of computers

05:05:17.040 --> 05:05:19.040
in the background in the back

05:05:19.040 --> 05:05:21.040
of the books as well as firmware

05:05:21.040 --> 05:05:23.040
listings and things and I could look at

05:05:23.040 --> 05:05:25.040
that and at that time when I was a

05:05:25.040 --> 05:05:27.040
younger teenager I didn't understand

05:05:27.040 --> 05:05:29.040
a lot of that stuff how the

05:05:29.040 --> 05:05:31.040
different things worked I was

05:05:31.040 --> 05:05:33.040
pulling out the information that I could get

05:05:33.040 --> 05:05:35.040
but I always wanted to know all of that

05:05:35.040 --> 05:05:37.040
there was like kind of

05:05:37.040 --> 05:05:39.040
magical information sitting down there

05:05:39.040 --> 05:05:41.040
it's like the elder lore that some gray

05:05:41.040 --> 05:05:43.040
nerd is the keeper of

05:05:43.040 --> 05:05:45.040
and so I always felt that

05:05:45.040 --> 05:05:47.040
pull for wanting to know more

05:05:47.040 --> 05:05:49.040
wanting to explore

05:05:49.040 --> 05:05:51.040
the mysterious areas there

05:05:51.040 --> 05:05:53.040
and that

05:05:53.040 --> 05:05:55.040
followed right in through all the things

05:05:55.040 --> 05:05:57.040
that got the value exploring the video cards

05:05:57.040 --> 05:05:59.040
leading to the

05:05:59.040 --> 05:06:01.040
scrolling advantages

05:06:01.040 --> 05:06:03.040
exploring some of the academic papers

05:06:03.040 --> 05:06:05.040
and things learning about BSP trees

05:06:05.040 --> 05:06:07.040
and the different things that I could do

05:06:07.040 --> 05:06:09.040
with those systems

05:06:09.040 --> 05:06:11.040
just that the huge larval phases

05:06:11.040 --> 05:06:13.040
going through aerospace just

05:06:13.040 --> 05:06:15.040
reading bookshelves full of books

05:06:15.040 --> 05:06:17.040
again that point where I have enough money

05:06:17.040 --> 05:06:19.040
I can buy all the books I want

05:06:19.040 --> 05:06:21.040
it was so valuable

05:06:21.040 --> 05:06:23.040
where I was terrible with my money

05:06:23.040 --> 05:06:25.040
when I was a kid my mom thought I would always be

05:06:25.040 --> 05:06:27.040
broke because I'd buy my

05:06:27.040 --> 05:06:29.040
comic books and just be out of money

05:06:29.040 --> 05:06:31.040
but it was like all the pizza I want

05:06:31.040 --> 05:06:33.040
all the diet coke I want

05:06:33.040 --> 05:06:35.040
video games and then books

05:06:35.040 --> 05:06:37.040
and it didn't take that much

05:06:37.040 --> 05:06:39.040
I think in 27k a year

05:06:39.040 --> 05:06:41.040
I felt rich and I was just getting

05:06:41.040 --> 05:06:43.040
all the things that I wanted

05:06:43.040 --> 05:06:45.040
but that sense of

05:06:45.040 --> 05:06:47.040
books have always been magical to me

05:06:47.040 --> 05:06:49.040
and that was one of the things that really made me smile

05:06:49.040 --> 05:06:51.040
is Andre had said

05:06:51.040 --> 05:06:53.040
when he came over to my house he said

05:06:53.040 --> 05:06:55.040
he found my library inspiring

05:06:55.040 --> 05:06:57.040
and it was great to see

05:06:57.040 --> 05:06:59.040
he's kind of a younger guy

05:06:59.040 --> 05:07:01.040
I sometimes wonder if younger people these days

05:07:01.040 --> 05:07:03.040
have the same relationship with books that I do

05:07:03.040 --> 05:07:05.040
where they were such a cornerstone

05:07:05.040 --> 05:07:07.040
in many ways but that sense that

05:07:07.040 --> 05:07:09.040
yeah I always wanted to know it all

05:07:09.040 --> 05:07:11.040
I know I can't and that was one of the last things

05:07:11.040 --> 05:07:13.040
I said you can't know everything

05:07:13.040 --> 05:07:15.040
but you should convince yourself that you can know

05:07:15.040 --> 05:07:17.040
anything you know any one

05:07:17.040 --> 05:07:19.040
particular thing it was created

05:07:19.040 --> 05:07:21.040
and discovered by humans you can learn it

05:07:21.040 --> 05:07:23.040
you can find out what you need on there

05:07:23.040 --> 05:07:25.040
and you can learn it deeply

05:07:25.040 --> 05:07:27.040
you can drive a nail down

05:07:27.040 --> 05:07:29.040
through whatever layer cake problem

05:07:29.040 --> 05:07:31.040
space you've got and learn

05:07:31.040 --> 05:07:33.040
a cross section there

05:07:33.040 --> 05:07:35.040
there's an impact doing that

05:07:35.040 --> 05:07:37.040
you can attain happiness

05:07:37.040 --> 05:07:39.040
doing that there's something so fulfilling

05:07:39.040 --> 05:07:41.040
about becoming a craftsman of a thing

05:07:41.040 --> 05:07:43.040
yeah and I don't want to tell people that

05:07:43.040 --> 05:07:45.040
look this is a good career move

05:07:45.040 --> 05:07:47.040
just grit your teeth and

05:07:47.040 --> 05:07:49.040
and bear it

05:07:49.040 --> 05:07:51.040
you want people

05:07:51.040 --> 05:07:53.040
and I do think it is possible sometimes to find

05:07:53.040 --> 05:07:55.040
the joy in something like it might not

05:07:55.040 --> 05:07:57.040
immediately appeal to you but

05:07:57.040 --> 05:07:59.040
I had told people early on

05:07:59.040 --> 05:08:01.040
in software times

05:08:01.040 --> 05:08:03.040
you know it a lot of game developers

05:08:03.040 --> 05:08:05.040
are in it just because they are so passionate

05:08:05.040 --> 05:08:07.040
about games but I was always

05:08:07.040 --> 05:08:09.040
really more flexible

05:08:09.040 --> 05:08:11.040
in what appealed to me where I said

05:08:11.040 --> 05:08:13.040
I think I could be quite

05:08:13.040 --> 05:08:15.040
engaged doing operating system

05:08:15.040 --> 05:08:17.040
work or even database work

05:08:17.040 --> 05:08:19.040
I would find the interest in that

05:08:19.040 --> 05:08:21.040
because I think most things that are

05:08:21.040 --> 05:08:23.040
significant in the world have

05:08:23.040 --> 05:08:25.040
a lot of layers and complexity to them

05:08:25.040 --> 05:08:27.040
and a lot of opportunities hidden within them

05:08:27.040 --> 05:08:29.040
so

05:08:29.040 --> 05:08:31.040
probably the most important thing to encourage

05:08:31.040 --> 05:08:33.040
to people is that

05:08:33.040 --> 05:08:35.040
you can weaponize curiosity

05:08:35.040 --> 05:08:37.040
you can deploy your curiosity

05:08:37.040 --> 05:08:39.040
to kind of make things

05:08:39.040 --> 05:08:41.040
useful and valuable to you

05:08:41.040 --> 05:08:43.040
even if they don't immediately appear that way

05:08:43.040 --> 05:08:45.040
deploy your curiosity

05:08:45.040 --> 05:08:47.040
yeah that's very true

05:08:47.040 --> 05:08:49.040
we've mentioned this debate point

05:08:49.040 --> 05:08:51.040
whether mortality or fear

05:08:51.040 --> 05:08:53.040
of mortality is fundamental

05:08:53.040 --> 05:08:55.040
to creating an AGI

05:08:55.040 --> 05:08:57.040
but let's talk about whether it's fundamental

05:08:57.040 --> 05:08:59.040
to human beings

05:08:59.040 --> 05:09:01.040
do you think about your own mortality

05:09:01.040 --> 05:09:03.040
I really don't

05:09:03.040 --> 05:09:05.040
and

05:09:05.040 --> 05:09:07.040
you probably always have to take with a grain of salt

05:09:07.040 --> 05:09:09.040
anything somebody says about fundamental things

05:09:09.040 --> 05:09:11.040
like that

05:09:11.040 --> 05:09:13.040
but I don't think about

05:09:13.040 --> 05:09:15.040
really aging

05:09:15.040 --> 05:09:17.040
impending death, legacy

05:09:17.040 --> 05:09:19.040
with my children

05:09:19.040 --> 05:09:21.040
things like that

05:09:21.040 --> 05:09:23.040
and clearly it seems most of the world does

05:09:23.040 --> 05:09:25.040
a lot more than I do

05:09:25.040 --> 05:09:27.040
so I think I'm an outlier

05:09:27.040 --> 05:09:29.040
in that where

05:09:29.040 --> 05:09:31.040
it doesn't

05:09:31.040 --> 05:09:33.040
wind up being a real part of

05:09:33.040 --> 05:09:35.040
my thinking and motivation

05:09:35.040 --> 05:09:37.040
about things

05:09:37.040 --> 05:09:39.040
so daily existence is about

05:09:39.040 --> 05:09:41.040
the people you love

05:09:41.040 --> 05:09:43.040
and the problems

05:09:43.040 --> 05:09:45.040
before you

05:09:45.040 --> 05:09:47.040
I'm very much focused on what I'm working on right now

05:09:47.040 --> 05:09:49.040
I do take that back

05:09:49.040 --> 05:09:51.040
there's one aspect where

05:09:51.040 --> 05:09:53.040
the finiteness of the life does impact me

05:09:53.040 --> 05:09:55.040
and that is about

05:09:55.040 --> 05:09:57.040
thinking about the scope of the problems

05:09:57.040 --> 05:09:59.040
that I'm working on

05:09:59.040 --> 05:10:01.040
when I decided to work on

05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:03.040
when I was like nuclear fission or AGI

05:10:03.040 --> 05:10:05.040
these are big ticket things

05:10:05.040 --> 05:10:07.040
that are impact

05:10:07.040 --> 05:10:09.040
large fractions of the world

05:10:09.040 --> 05:10:11.040
and I was thinking to myself at some level

05:10:11.040 --> 05:10:13.040
that okay I may have

05:10:13.040 --> 05:10:15.040
a couple more swings

05:10:15.040 --> 05:10:17.040
at bat with me

05:10:17.040 --> 05:10:19.040
at full capability but yes

05:10:19.040 --> 05:10:21.040
my mental abilities will decay

05:10:21.040 --> 05:10:23.040
with age

05:10:23.040 --> 05:10:25.040
I don't think it's a 0% chance

05:10:25.040 --> 05:10:27.040
that we will address some of that

05:10:27.040 --> 05:10:29.040
before it becomes a problem for me

05:10:29.040 --> 05:10:31.040
I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades

05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:33.040
but I do have this

05:10:33.040 --> 05:10:35.040
kind of vague plan that

05:10:35.040 --> 05:10:37.040
when I'm not at the top of my game

05:10:37.040 --> 05:10:39.040
and I don't feel that I'm in a position

05:10:39.040 --> 05:10:41.040
to put a dent in the world some way

05:10:41.040 --> 05:10:43.040
that I'll probably wind up doing some kind of

05:10:43.040 --> 05:10:45.040
recreational retro programming

05:10:45.040 --> 05:10:47.040
or I'll work on

05:10:47.040 --> 05:10:49.040
something that I would not devote

05:10:49.040 --> 05:10:51.040
my life to now but I can

05:10:51.040 --> 05:10:53.040
while away my time as the old man

05:10:53.040 --> 05:10:55.040
gardening in the code worlds

05:10:55.040 --> 05:10:57.040
and then

05:10:57.040 --> 05:10:59.040
to step back even bigger

05:10:59.040 --> 05:11:01.040
let me ask you about why we're here

05:11:01.040 --> 05:11:03.040
we human beings

05:11:03.040 --> 05:11:05.040
what's the meaning of it all

05:11:05.040 --> 05:11:07.040
what's the meaning of life John Carmack

05:11:07.040 --> 05:11:09.040
so very similar with that last question

05:11:09.040 --> 05:11:11.040
I know a lot of people

05:11:11.040 --> 05:11:13.040
fret about this question a lot

05:11:13.040 --> 05:11:15.040
and I just really don't

05:11:15.040 --> 05:11:17.040
I really don't give a damn

05:11:17.040 --> 05:11:19.040
we are biological creatures that

05:11:19.040 --> 05:11:21.040
happenstance of evolution

05:11:21.040 --> 05:11:23.040
you know we have innate drives

05:11:23.040 --> 05:11:25.040
that evolution crafted for

05:11:25.040 --> 05:11:27.040
survival and passing on of genetic

05:11:27.040 --> 05:11:29.040
codes

05:11:29.040 --> 05:11:31.040
I don't

05:11:31.040 --> 05:11:33.040
find a lot of value in trying to go

05:11:33.040 --> 05:11:35.040
much deeper than that I have my motivation

05:11:35.040 --> 05:11:37.040
some of which are

05:11:37.040 --> 05:11:39.040
some of which are probably genetically coded

05:11:39.040 --> 05:11:41.040
many of which are contingent on my

05:11:41.040 --> 05:11:43.040
upbringing and the path that I've had through my life

05:11:43.040 --> 05:11:45.040
I don't run

05:11:45.040 --> 05:11:47.040
into like spades of depression

05:11:47.040 --> 05:11:49.040
or envy or anything

05:11:49.040 --> 05:11:51.040
that winds up being

05:11:51.040 --> 05:11:53.040
a challenge and forcing a

05:11:53.040 --> 05:11:55.040
degree of soul searching with things like that

05:11:55.040 --> 05:11:57.040
I seem to be okay

05:11:57.040 --> 05:11:59.040
you know kind of without that

05:12:01.040 --> 05:12:03.040
as a brilliant ant in the ant colony

05:12:03.040 --> 05:12:05.040
without looking up to the sky wondering

05:12:05.040 --> 05:12:07.040
why the hell am I here again

05:12:07.040 --> 05:12:09.040
so the why

05:12:09.040 --> 05:12:11.040
of it the incredible

05:12:11.040 --> 05:12:13.040
mystery

05:12:13.040 --> 05:12:15.040
of the fact that we started

05:12:15.040 --> 05:12:17.040
first of all the origin of life on earth

05:12:17.040 --> 05:12:19.040
and from that

05:12:19.040 --> 05:12:21.040
from single cell organisms

05:12:21.040 --> 05:12:23.040
the entirety of the evolutionary process

05:12:23.040 --> 05:12:25.040
took us somehow to this incredibly intelligent

05:12:25.040 --> 05:12:27.040
thing that is able to

05:12:27.040 --> 05:12:29.040
build Wolfenstein 3D

05:12:29.040 --> 05:12:31.040
and doom and quake

05:12:31.040 --> 05:12:33.040
and take a crack at the problem

05:12:33.040 --> 05:12:35.040
of AGI and create things that eventually

05:12:35.040 --> 05:12:37.040
supersede human beings

05:12:37.040 --> 05:12:39.040
that doesn't

05:12:39.040 --> 05:12:41.040
the why of it

05:12:41.040 --> 05:12:43.040
is um

05:12:43.040 --> 05:12:45.040
it's been my experience that

05:12:45.040 --> 05:12:47.040
people that focus on

05:12:47.040 --> 05:12:49.040
that don't focus on the here and now

05:12:49.040 --> 05:12:51.040
right in front of them tend to be less

05:12:51.040 --> 05:12:53.040
effective I mean it's not 100%

05:12:53.040 --> 05:12:55.040
you know vision matters to

05:12:55.040 --> 05:12:57.040
some people but

05:12:57.040 --> 05:12:59.040
it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator

05:12:59.040 --> 05:13:01.040
for me and I think that

05:13:01.040 --> 05:13:03.040
the process of getting there is usually

05:13:03.040 --> 05:13:05.040
done against like the magic of gradient descent

05:13:05.040 --> 05:13:07.040
people just don't believe that

05:13:07.040 --> 05:13:09.040
just looking locally gets you

05:13:09.040 --> 05:13:11.040
to all of these spectacular things

05:13:11.040 --> 05:13:13.040
that's been you know the decades

05:13:13.040 --> 05:13:15.040
of looking at

05:13:15.040 --> 05:13:17.040
really some of the smartest people

05:13:17.040 --> 05:13:19.040
in the world that would just push back

05:13:19.040 --> 05:13:21.040
forever against this idea that

05:13:21.040 --> 05:13:23.040
it's not this grand sophisticated

05:13:23.040 --> 05:13:25.040
vision of everything but

05:13:25.040 --> 05:13:27.040
little tiny steps local information

05:13:27.040 --> 05:13:29.040
winds up leading to all the best answers

05:13:29.040 --> 05:13:31.040
so the meaning of life

05:13:31.040 --> 05:13:33.040
is uh following

05:13:33.040 --> 05:13:35.040
locally

05:13:35.040 --> 05:13:37.040
wherever the gradient descent takes you

05:13:37.040 --> 05:13:39.040
this was an incredible conversation

05:13:39.040 --> 05:13:41.040
officially the longest conversation

05:13:41.040 --> 05:13:43.040
I've ever done on the podcast

05:13:43.040 --> 05:13:45.040
which means a lot to me because

05:13:45.040 --> 05:13:47.040
I get to do it with one of my heroes

05:13:47.040 --> 05:13:49.040
John I can't tell you how much it means to me

05:13:49.040 --> 05:13:51.040
that you would sit down with me

05:13:51.040 --> 05:13:53.040
you're an incredible human being

05:13:53.040 --> 05:13:55.040
I can't wait what you do next but you've already

05:13:55.040 --> 05:13:57.040
changed the world you're an inspiration

05:13:57.040 --> 05:13:59.040
to so many people and again

05:13:59.040 --> 05:14:01.040
we haven't covered like

05:14:01.040 --> 05:14:03.040
most of what I was playing to talk about

05:14:03.040 --> 05:14:05.040
so I hope we get a chance to talk

05:14:05.040 --> 05:14:07.040
some day in the future and I can't wait

05:14:07.040 --> 05:14:09.040
to see what you do next thank you so much

05:14:09.040 --> 05:14:11.040
again for talking to me thank you very much

05:14:11.040 --> 05:14:13.040
thanks for listening to this

05:14:13.040 --> 05:14:15.040
conversation with John Carmack

05:14:15.040 --> 05:14:17.040
to support this podcast please check out our

05:14:17.040 --> 05:14:19.040
sponsors in the description

05:14:19.040 --> 05:14:21.040
and now let me leave you with some words

05:14:21.040 --> 05:14:23.040
from John Carmack himself

05:14:23.040 --> 05:14:25.040
focused hard work

05:14:25.040 --> 05:14:27.040
is the real key to success

05:14:27.040 --> 05:14:29.040
keep your eyes on the goal

05:14:29.040 --> 05:14:31.040
and just keep taking the next step towards completing it

05:14:31.040 --> 05:14:33.040
if you aren't sure

05:14:33.040 --> 05:14:35.040
which way to do something do it both ways

05:14:35.040 --> 05:14:37.040
and see which works better

05:14:37.040 --> 05:14:39.040
thank you for listening

05:14:39.040 --> 05:14:41.040
and hope to see you next time
