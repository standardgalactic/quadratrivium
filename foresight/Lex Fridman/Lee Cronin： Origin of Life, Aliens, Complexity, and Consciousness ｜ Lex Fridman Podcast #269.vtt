00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
The following is a conversation with Lee Cronin, a chemist from the University of Glasgow,

00:05.120 --> 00:09.840
who is one of the most fascinating, brilliant, out-of-the-box thinking scientists I have ever

00:09.840 --> 00:16.480
spoken to. This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago, so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.360
I have been spending a lot of time each day talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.320
I have family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones in both countries.

00:27.200 --> 00:32.000
I will try to release a solo episode on this war, but I have been failing to find the words that

00:32.000 --> 00:39.360
make sense of it, for myself and others, so I may not. I ask for your understanding no matter

00:39.360 --> 00:46.000
which path I take. Most of my time is spent trying to help as much as I can privately.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.120
I am talking to people who are suffering, who are angry, afraid.

00:51.520 --> 00:58.000
When I returned to this conversation with Lee, I couldn't help but smile. He is a beautiful,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.760
brilliant, and hilarious human being. He is basically a human manifestation of the mad scientist

01:03.760 --> 01:09.440
Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. I thought about quitting this podcast for a time,

01:10.080 --> 01:16.400
but for now at least, I will keep going. I love people too much. You, the listener.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.840
I meet folks on the street or when I run. You say a few kind words about the podcast,

01:23.840 --> 01:29.200
and we talk about life, the small things, and the big things. All of it gives me hope.

01:30.320 --> 01:37.120
People are just amazing. You are amazing. I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience

01:37.120 --> 01:43.600
as I keep going with this silly little podcast, including through some difficult conversations.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.200
And hopefully, many fascinating and fun ones too.

01:52.080 --> 01:57.040
This is Alex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.200
And now, dear friends, here's Lee Cronin.

02:02.400 --> 02:08.480
How do you think life originated on Earth, and what insights does that give us about life?

02:09.280 --> 02:16.320
If we go back to the origin of Earth, and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago,

02:16.320 --> 02:20.560
planet was quite hot. There was a limited number of minerals. There was some carbon,

02:20.560 --> 02:26.960
some water. And I think that maybe it's a really simple set of chemistry that we really don't

02:26.960 --> 02:31.920
understand. So that means you've got a finite number of elements that are going to react

02:31.920 --> 02:38.320
very simply with one another. And out of that mess comes a cell. So literally sand turns into cells.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.520
And it seems to happen quick. So what I think I can say with some degree of,

02:44.320 --> 02:50.160
I think, not certainty, but curiosity, genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.

02:50.160 --> 02:56.880
Yeah. So when we say fast, this is a pretty surprising fact, and maybe you can actually

02:56.880 --> 03:03.120
correct me and elaborate, but it seems like most, like 70 or 80% of the time that Earth has been

03:03.120 --> 03:07.840
around has been life on it, like some very significant percentage. So when you say fast,

03:07.840 --> 03:13.680
like the slow part is from single cell or from bacteria to something more complicated

03:13.680 --> 03:18.640
organism. It seems like most of the time that Earth has been around, it's been single cell

03:19.360 --> 03:24.640
or like very basic organisms, like a couple of billion years. But yeah, you're right. That's

03:24.640 --> 03:32.720
really, I recently kind of revisited our history and saw this. And I was just looking at the timeline,

03:32.720 --> 03:38.800
wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly? Like really quickly? That makes me

03:38.800 --> 03:44.880
think that it really wanted to, like put another way, it's very easy for life to spring.

03:45.920 --> 03:53.120
Yeah, I agree. I think it's much more inevitable. And I think I try to kind of not provoke, but try

03:53.120 --> 03:56.960
and push chemists to think about this, because chemists are essential to this problem, right?

03:58.000 --> 04:02.240
Understanding the origin of life on Earth, at least, because we're made of chemistry.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.520
But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet also, the emergence of life on the planet is as

04:09.680 --> 04:16.240
common as the formation of a star. And if you start framing it in that way, it allows you to then

04:16.240 --> 04:20.480
look at the universe slightly differently, because, and we can get into this, I think,

04:20.480 --> 04:26.720
in quite some detail. But I think to come back to your question, I have little idea of how life

04:26.720 --> 04:33.840
got started. But I know it was simple. And I know that the process of selection had to occur before

04:34.560 --> 04:42.480
the biology was established, so that selection built the framework from which life kind of grew

04:42.480 --> 04:47.440
in complexity and capability and functionality and autonomy. And I think these are all really

04:47.440 --> 04:53.280
important words that we can unpack over the next while. Can you say all the words again? So you

04:54.000 --> 04:59.760
say selection, so natural selection, the original A-B testing.

04:59.760 --> 05:06.400
And then complexity, and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication. Because I think

05:06.400 --> 05:12.480
that people misunderstand what life is. Some people say that life is a cell, and some people

05:12.480 --> 05:21.040
that say that life is a virus, or life is an on-off switch. I don't think it's that.

05:21.040 --> 05:27.520
Life is the universe developing a memory. And the laws of physics, and the way, well,

05:27.520 --> 05:33.280
there are no laws of physics. Physics is just memory-free stuff, right? So there's only a

05:33.280 --> 05:38.640
finite number of ways you can arrange the fundamental particles to do the things.

05:38.640 --> 05:48.240
Life is the universe developing a memory. So it's like sewing a piece of art slowly,

05:49.200 --> 05:56.960
and then you can look back at it. So there's a stickiness to life. It's like

05:56.960 --> 06:02.560
universe doing stuff. And when you say memory, there's a stickiness to a bunch of the stuff

06:02.560 --> 06:11.680
it's building together. So you can, in a stable way, trace back the complexity that tells a

06:11.680 --> 06:17.040
coherent story. Yeah. And I think, yeah. Okay. That's, by the way, very poetic.

06:18.320 --> 06:25.840
Beautiful. Life is the universe developing a memory. Okay. And then there's autonomy,

06:25.840 --> 06:30.960
you said, complexity we'll talk about. But it's a really interesting idea, the selection

06:30.960 --> 06:38.720
preceded biology. Yeah, I think. So what, first of all, what is chemistry? Like,

06:38.800 --> 06:43.520
the sand still count as chemistry? Sure. I mean, as a chemist, a card carrying

06:43.520 --> 06:46.880
chemist, if I'm allowed a card, I don't know. I don't know what I am most days.

06:46.880 --> 06:51.360
What is the card made of? What's the chemical composition of the card?

06:52.320 --> 06:56.400
So what is chemistry? Well, chemistry is the thing that happens when you bring electrons

06:56.400 --> 07:01.760
together and you form bonds. So bonds, or I say to people when they talk about life elsewhere,

07:02.480 --> 07:06.960
and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope. Because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity,

07:06.960 --> 07:12.080
they allow you to record those memories. Or at least on Earth, you could imagine,

07:13.280 --> 07:17.920
you know, a Stanislaw Lemtripe world where you might have life emerging or intelligence

07:17.920 --> 07:24.080
emerging before life. That may be something like Solaris or something. But, you know, to get to

07:24.080 --> 07:31.360
selection, if atoms can combine and form bonds, those bonds, those atoms can bond to different

07:31.360 --> 07:36.560
elements and those molecules will have different identities and interact with each other

07:36.640 --> 07:41.200
differently. And then you can start to have some degree of causation or interaction,

07:41.200 --> 07:49.760
and then selection, and then existence. And then you go up the kind of the path of complexity.

07:49.760 --> 07:56.480
And so at least on Earth, as we know it, there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals to

07:56.480 --> 08:03.120
start searching that combinatorial space or bonds. So, okay, this is a really interesting

08:03.120 --> 08:09.200
question. Let's let's lay it out. So, bonds, almost like cards, we say there's bonds,

08:10.080 --> 08:16.080
there's life, there's intelligence, there's consciousness. And what you just made me realize

08:17.680 --> 08:26.080
is those can emerge, or let's put bonds aside, those can emerge in any order.

08:27.040 --> 08:34.640
That's really brilliant. So, intelligence can come before life. It's like panpsychists believe

08:34.640 --> 08:43.280
that consciousness, I guess, comes before life and before intelligence. So, consciousness permeates

08:43.280 --> 08:48.720
all matter, it's some kind of fabric of reality. Okay, so within this framework, you can kind of

08:48.720 --> 08:55.280
arrange everything. But you need to have the bonds that precedes everything else.

08:55.280 --> 09:00.320
Oh, and the other thing is selection. So, like the mechanism of selection, that could

09:01.520 --> 09:06.160
precede, he couldn't that precede bonds to whatever the hell selection is?

09:06.160 --> 09:12.560
I would say that there is an elegant order to it that bonds allow selection, allows the emergence

09:12.560 --> 09:18.480
of life, allows the emergence of multicellularity, and then more information processing, building

09:18.480 --> 09:23.840
state machines all the way up. However, you could imagine a situation if you had, I don't know,

09:23.840 --> 09:29.280
a neutron star or a sun or what a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another, and these

09:29.280 --> 09:33.280
oscillators building state machines, and these state machines reading something out in the environment.

09:34.240 --> 09:39.360
Over time, these state machines would be able to literally record what happened in the past and

09:39.360 --> 09:45.440
sense what's going on in the present and imagine the future. However, I don't think it's ever going

09:45.440 --> 09:51.200
to be within a human comprehension, that type of life. I wouldn't count it out because,

09:52.160 --> 09:55.760
you know, whenever you, I know in science, whenever I say something's impossible,

09:55.760 --> 09:59.120
I then wake up the next day and say, no, that's actually wrong. I mean, there are some limits,

09:59.120 --> 10:03.360
of course. I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.640
Eric Weinstein says that's possible, so he will say you're up.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.800
Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well. So, one of my, I have two superpowers.

10:11.600 --> 10:16.160
My stupidity, and I don't mean that as a, you know, I'm like absolutely completely

10:16.160 --> 10:20.240
witless, but I mean my ability to kind of just start again and ask the question,

10:20.240 --> 10:24.960
and then do it with an experiment. I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up, but I just didn't

10:24.960 --> 10:30.080
have the, just didn't have the intellectual capability, but I was able to think of experiments

10:30.080 --> 10:35.680
in my head. I could then do in my lab or in the, you know, when I was a child outside,

10:35.680 --> 10:39.920
and then those experiments in my head and then outside reinforced one another.

10:39.920 --> 10:44.240
So, I think that's a very good way of kind of grounding the science, right?

10:44.240 --> 10:48.480
Well, that's the nice way to think about theoreticians is they're just people who run

10:48.480 --> 10:52.240
experiments in their head. I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right? And but you're also

10:52.240 --> 10:57.040
capable of doing that in the head, in your head, inside your head, and in the real world, and

10:57.040 --> 11:03.120
the connection between the two is when you first discovered your superpower stupidity. I like it.

11:03.120 --> 11:08.320
Yes, there you go. Okay, what's the second superpower, your accent, or is that?

11:08.320 --> 11:13.680
Well, I don't know. I am genuinely curious. So, my curiosity, so I have a, you know,

11:13.680 --> 11:18.080
like everybody, ego problems, but my curiosity is bigger than my ego. So, as long as that happens,

11:18.720 --> 11:24.160
I can, I can. That's awesome. That is so powerful. You're just dropping some powerful lines. So,

11:24.160 --> 11:29.280
curiosity is bigger than ego. That's something I have to think about, because you always struggle

11:29.280 --> 11:36.880
about the role of ego in life. And that's, that's so nice to think about. Don't think about the

11:36.880 --> 11:41.360
size of ego, the absolute size of ego, think about the relative size of ego to the other,

11:42.160 --> 11:46.480
the other horse is pulling at you. And if the curiosity one is bigger,

11:46.480 --> 11:52.800
then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to. Anyway, so those are the two

11:52.800 --> 11:57.920
superpowers. How do those connect to natural selection or selection and bonds? And I forgot

11:57.920 --> 12:02.400
already, life and consciousness. So, we're going back to selection in the universe and origin of

12:02.400 --> 12:08.560
life on earth. I mean, selection is a, I'm convinced that selection is a force in the

12:08.560 --> 12:14.400
universe. So, not me, not a fundamental force, but a, but a directing, but it is a directing force,

12:14.400 --> 12:21.360
because existence, although existence appears to be the default, the existence of what? Why does,

12:22.880 --> 12:28.320
we can get to this later, I think, but it's amazing that, that discrete things exist.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.600
And, you know, you see this cup, it's not the, you know, sexiest cup in the world,

12:33.680 --> 12:39.760
but it's pretty functional. This cup, the complexity of this cup isn't just in the object,

12:39.760 --> 12:44.320
it is literally the lineage of people making cups and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,

12:44.320 --> 12:49.280
making an abstraction of a cup and then making a different one. So, I wonder how many billions of

12:49.280 --> 12:55.040
cups have, you know, come before this one. And that's a process of selection and existence. And

12:55.040 --> 12:59.040
the only reason the cup is still used is quite useful, like the handle, you know, it's convenient,

12:59.040 --> 13:05.600
so I don't die, I keep hydration. And so, I think we are missing something fundamental in the universe

13:05.600 --> 13:13.120
about selection. And I think what biology is, is a, is a selection amplifier. And that the,

13:13.120 --> 13:18.000
this is where autonomy comes in. And actually, I think that how humanity is going to humans and,

13:19.040 --> 13:23.680
autonomous robots or whatever we're going to call them in the future, we'll supercharge that even

13:23.680 --> 13:28.080
further. So, selection is happening in the universe. But if you look in the asteroid belt,

13:28.800 --> 13:34.480
selection, if objects are being kicked in and out the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite

13:34.480 --> 13:38.640
complex, you don't really look at that as productive selection, because it's not doing anything to

13:38.640 --> 13:44.480
improve its function. But is it? The asteroid belt has existed for some time. So, there is some

13:44.480 --> 13:52.160
selection going on, but the functionality is somewhat limited. On Earth, at the formation of

13:52.240 --> 13:58.720
Earth, interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment gave selection, and then things

13:58.720 --> 14:02.800
could happen. Because you could think about, in chemistry, we can have an infinite number of

14:02.800 --> 14:06.960
reactions happen, but they don't all, all the reactions are allowed to happen don't happen,

14:06.960 --> 14:12.160
why? Because they're energy barriers. So, there must be some things called catalysts out there, or

14:12.800 --> 14:16.960
there are bits of minerals, that when two molecules get together on that mineral,

14:16.960 --> 14:21.600
it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction. And so, the reaction is, is promoted. So,

14:21.600 --> 14:27.040
suddenly you get one reaction over another series of possibilities occurring that makes a particular

14:27.040 --> 14:32.560
molecule, and this keeps happening in steps. And before you know it, these, almost these waves

14:32.560 --> 14:40.480
as discrete reactions work together, and you start to build a machinery that, that is run by

14:40.480 --> 14:47.920
existence. So, as you, you go forward in time, the fact of the molecules, the bonds are getting,

14:47.920 --> 14:52.320
there are more bonds in a molecule, there's more function, there's more capability for this molecule

14:52.320 --> 14:57.600
to interact with other molecules, to redirect them, it's like a series of little, and I don't want

14:57.600 --> 15:03.840
to use this term too much, but it's almost thinking about the simplest von Neumann constructor,

15:04.560 --> 15:08.320
that's the simplest molecule that could build a more complicated molecule, build a more complicated

15:08.320 --> 15:12.720
molecule. And before you know it, when that more complicated molecule can act on the causal chain

15:12.720 --> 15:18.400
that's produced itself, and change it, suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy,

15:18.400 --> 15:24.640
and that's where life I think emerges in earnest. Every single word in the past few paragraphs,

15:24.640 --> 15:32.160
let's break those apart. But who's von Neumann, what's the constructor, the closing of the loop

15:32.160 --> 15:38.960
that you're talking about, the molecule that starts becoming the, I think you said like the

15:39.040 --> 15:45.360
smallest von Neumann constructor, the smallest, the minimal, so what do all those things mean,

15:45.360 --> 15:51.200
and what is, what are we supposed to imagine when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?

15:51.200 --> 15:56.400
So, John von Neumann is a real hero, actually, not just me, but many people, I think, computer

15:56.400 --> 16:03.040
science and physics. He was an incredible intellect, who probably solved a lot of the problems that

16:03.120 --> 16:08.960
we're working on today, I just forgot to write them down. And I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann

16:08.960 --> 16:14.800
or Johnny, as I think his friends called him, but I think he was Hungarian, mathematician,

16:14.800 --> 16:20.800
came to the US, and basically was involved in the Manhattan Project and developing computation,

16:21.440 --> 16:26.400
and came up with all sorts of ideas, and I think it was one of the first people to come up with

16:26.400 --> 16:31.760
cellular automata. And but he- Really? I didn't know this little fact. I think so, I think so,

16:32.240 --> 16:36.720
Well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it, he probably did come up with it and didn't write

16:36.720 --> 16:40.000
it down. There was a couple of people did at the same time, and then Conway obviously took it on,

16:40.000 --> 16:46.240
and then Wolfram loves CAs, there is his fabric of the universe. And what I think he imagined was

16:46.240 --> 16:53.120
that he wasn't satisfied, and this may be incorrect recollection, but so a lot of what I say is going

16:53.120 --> 16:58.640
to be kind of, you know, just way out of my- You're just part of the universe,

16:59.600 --> 17:04.080
creating its memory, designing- Exactly, yeah, rewriting history.

17:04.080 --> 17:08.080
Rewriting history. Exactly, imperfectly. So, but what I mean is, I think he would,

17:08.080 --> 17:14.880
he liked this idea of thinking about how could a Turing machine literally build

17:14.880 --> 17:19.520
itself without a Turing machine, right? It's like, literally, how did state machines emerge?

17:19.520 --> 17:24.080
And I think that von Neumann constructors, he was, wanted to conceive of a minimal thing,

17:24.640 --> 17:30.560
autonomous, that could build itself. And what would those rules look like in the world?

17:30.560 --> 17:34.880
And that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor looked like, like it's a minimal hypothetical

17:34.880 --> 17:41.840
object that could build itself, self-replicate. And I'm really fascinated by that, because I think

17:41.840 --> 17:48.640
that, although it's probably not exactly what happened, it's a nice model, because as chemists,

17:48.640 --> 17:53.120
if we could go back to the origin of life and think about, what is a minimal machine

17:54.080 --> 18:00.320
that can get structured randomly, so like with no prime mover, with no, with no architect,

18:01.120 --> 18:06.880
and it symbols through just existence. So random stuff bumping in together, and you make this

18:06.880 --> 18:12.720
first molecule. So you have molecule A. And molecule A interacts with another random molecule B,

18:12.720 --> 18:16.800
and they get together, and they realize by working together, they can make more of themselves.

18:17.520 --> 18:23.520
But then they realize they can mutate, so they can make AB prime. So AB prime is different to AB,

18:24.160 --> 18:30.880
and then AB prime can then act back where A and B are being created, and slightly nudge

18:30.880 --> 18:40.480
that causal chain, and make AB prime more evolvable, or learn more. So that's the closing the loop part.

18:40.480 --> 18:47.120
Closing the loop part, got it. It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult. It feels

18:47.120 --> 18:54.560
like the difficult part is just creating a copy of yourself at step one. That seems like

18:54.560 --> 19:00.960
one of the greatest inventions in the history of the universe is the first molecule that figured

19:00.960 --> 19:08.720
out, holy shit, I can create a copy of myself. How hard is that? I think it's really, really easy.

19:09.600 --> 19:15.600
Okay, I did not expect that. I think it's really, really easy. Well, let's take a step back. I think

19:15.600 --> 19:22.800
replicating molecules are rare. But if you say, you know, I think I was saying on, I probably got

19:22.800 --> 19:28.160
into trouble on Twitter, there's about more than 18 mils of water in there. So one mole of water,

19:28.160 --> 19:33.520
6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules, that's about the number of stars in the universe,

19:33.520 --> 19:37.040
I think, of the order. So there's three universe worth, but between one and...

19:37.040 --> 19:38.400
So many corrected John Twitter.

19:38.400 --> 19:43.680
Yeah, I'm always being corrected. It's a great fact. But there's a lot of molecules in the water.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.440
And so there's a lot of... So although it's for you and me really hard to conceive of,

19:49.440 --> 19:56.480
if existence is not the default for a long period of time, because what happens is the molecules

19:56.480 --> 20:01.760
get degraded. So much of the possibilities in the universe are just broken back into atoms.

20:01.760 --> 20:07.040
So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules for our chemical reactions.

20:07.680 --> 20:12.160
So you only need one or two molecules to become good at copying themselves,

20:12.160 --> 20:17.600
for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool and start to grow. And so then replication

20:17.600 --> 20:23.760
actually over time, when you have bonds, I think is much simpler and much easier. And I even found

20:23.760 --> 20:29.360
this in my lab years ago, I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry

20:29.360 --> 20:34.960
and making rust, making a bit of rust based on a thing called molybdenum. Molybdenum oxide

20:34.960 --> 20:40.800
is this molybdenum oxide, very simple. But when you add acid to it and some electrons,

20:40.800 --> 20:45.760
they make these molecules, you just cannot possibly imagine would be constructed big,

20:45.760 --> 20:53.680
gigantic wheels of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel or an icosidodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms,

20:54.240 --> 20:58.640
all in the same pot. And I realized when I just finished experiments two years ago,

20:58.640 --> 21:01.840
I've just published a couple of papers on this, that there are actually...

21:02.560 --> 21:07.680
There is a random small molecule with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly,

21:07.680 --> 21:13.040
but it happens to template its own production. And then by chance, it templates the ring,

21:13.920 --> 21:20.240
just an accident, just like just an absolute accident. And that ring also helps make the small

21:20.960 --> 21:28.320
12 mer. And so you have what's called an autocatalytic set, where A makes B,

21:29.040 --> 21:35.280
and B helps make A and vice versa, and you then make this loop. So it's a bit like

21:36.240 --> 21:44.560
these, they all work in synergy to make this chain of events that grow. And it doesn't take

21:45.200 --> 21:51.680
a very sophisticated model to show that if you have these objects are competing and then collaborating

21:51.680 --> 21:56.880
to help one another build, they just grow out of the mess. And although they seem improbable,

21:56.880 --> 22:03.280
they are improbable, in fact, impossible in one step. There's multiple steps. This is when the

22:03.760 --> 22:10.480
people look at the blind watchmaker argument, and you talk about how could a watch spontaneously

22:10.480 --> 22:17.120
emerge? Well, it doesn't. It's a lineage of watches and cruder devices that are bootstrapped onto

22:17.120 --> 22:25.920
one another. Right. So it's very improbable, but once you get that little discovery, like with the

22:25.920 --> 22:35.760
wheel and fire, it just explodes in because it's so successful, it explodes. It's basically

22:37.120 --> 22:43.360
selection. So this templating mechanism that allows you to have a little blueprint for yourself,

22:43.360 --> 22:46.320
how you go through different procedures is to build copies of yourself.

22:47.040 --> 22:53.760
I don't know. So in chemistry, somehow it's possible to imagine that that kind of thing

22:54.720 --> 23:00.160
is easy to spring up. In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing and much more

23:00.160 --> 23:06.160
complicated. Like we're having like multiple abstractions of the birds and the bees conversation

23:06.160 --> 23:11.280
here. But with humans, sorry, with complex organisms, it feels like difficult to have

23:11.280 --> 23:22.320
reproduction. That's going to get clipped out. I'm going to make fun of that. It's difficult

23:22.320 --> 23:28.560
to develop this idea of making copies of yourself or no. Because that seems like a magical idea for

23:28.560 --> 23:37.600
life. Wow. That feels like very necessary for what selection is, for what evolution is,

23:37.600 --> 23:44.240
but then if selection precedes all of this, then maybe these are just like echoes of the

23:45.120 --> 23:49.680
selecting mechanism at different scales. Yeah, that's exactly it. So selection is the default

23:49.680 --> 23:57.280
in the universe, if you want to. And what happens is that life, the solution that life has got on

23:57.280 --> 24:04.000
earth, life on earth, biology on earth is unique to earth. We can talk about that. And that was

24:04.000 --> 24:09.440
really hard fought for. But that was that is a solution that works on earth, the ribosome,

24:09.440 --> 24:15.040
the fundamental machine that is responsible for every life for, you know, every cell on earth

24:15.040 --> 24:20.080
of whatever wherever it is in the in the thick kingdom of life. That is an incredibly complex

24:20.080 --> 24:25.520
object. But it was evolved over time. And it wasn't involved in a vacuum. And I think that

24:25.520 --> 24:33.920
once we understand that selection can occur without the ribosome, but what the ribosome does

24:34.160 --> 24:39.920
is it's a phase transition in replication. And I think that that and also technology that is

24:41.680 --> 24:48.880
probably much easier to get to than we think. Why do you put the ribosome as a central

24:50.480 --> 24:55.120
part of living organisms on earth? It basically is a combination of two different polymer

24:55.120 --> 25:02.320
systems. So RNA and peptides. So the RNA world, if you like, gets transmitted and builds proteins,

25:02.320 --> 25:06.480
and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis, the majority of the catalysis goes on

25:06.480 --> 25:14.240
the cell. No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution. So ribosome is looking at the action.

25:14.240 --> 25:20.000
You don't put like the RNA itself as the critical thing, like information, you put action as the

25:20.000 --> 25:24.080
most important thing. I think the actual molecules that we have in biology right now, entirely

25:24.080 --> 25:29.040
contingent on the history of life on earth, they could, there are so many possible solutions.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.720
And this is where chemistry got itself into origin of life chemistry, gets itself into

25:32.720 --> 25:36.560
a bit of a trap. Yeah, let me interrupt you there. You've tweeted, you're going to get,

25:36.560 --> 25:41.360
I'm going to set your tweets like it's Shakespeare. Okay. It's surprising you haven't

25:41.360 --> 25:47.120
gotten canceled on Twitter yet. It's your brilliance once again saves you. I'm just kidding.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.720
You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter. You've tweeted that quote,

25:52.800 --> 26:00.400
origin of life research is a scam. So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word? Why is

26:00.400 --> 26:04.880
the origin of life research a scam? Aren't you kind of doing origin of life research?

26:06.640 --> 26:11.680
Okay, it was tongue-in-cheek, but yeah, I think, and I meant it as tongue-in-cheek. I am, I'm not

26:11.680 --> 26:17.440
doing, I'm not doing the origin of life research, I'm trying to make artificial life. And I also

26:17.440 --> 26:22.320
want to bound the likelihood of the origin of life on earth, but more importantly, to find

26:22.320 --> 26:27.120
origin of life elsewhere. But let me directly address the tweet. There are many, many good

26:27.120 --> 26:31.920
chemists out there doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them. And I think they're

26:31.920 --> 26:36.480
brilliant. Like, there's no, there's, there's no question. The chemistry they are doing,

26:36.480 --> 26:41.760
their motivation is great. So what I meant by that tweet is saying that maybe they're making

26:41.760 --> 26:48.160
assumptions about saying, if only I could make this particular type of molecule, say this RNA

26:48.240 --> 26:56.480
molecule, or this phosphodiester, or this other molecule, it's going to somehow unlock the origin

26:56.480 --> 27:02.960
of life. And I think that origin of life has been looking at this for a very long time. And whilst I,

27:02.960 --> 27:09.760
I think it's brilliant to work out how you can get to those molecules, I think that chemistry

27:09.760 --> 27:16.400
and chemists doing origin of life could be nudged into doing something even more profound. And,

27:16.480 --> 27:22.800
and so the argument I'm making, it's a bit like right now, let's say, I don't know, the first Tesla

27:22.800 --> 27:27.600
that makes its way to, I don't know, into a new country in the world, let's say I,

27:28.240 --> 27:32.000
let's say there's a country X that has never had a Tesla before and they get the Tesla.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.680
Russia. And they take the Tesla, and what they do is they take the Tesla apart and say,

27:35.680 --> 27:39.920
we want to find the origin of cars in the universe and say, okay, how did this form and

27:39.920 --> 27:44.000
how did this form? And they just randomly keep making till they make the door, they make the

27:44.000 --> 27:47.760
wheel, they make the steering column and all this stuff. And, and they say, well, that's the

27:47.760 --> 27:52.160
route. That's the way, that's the way cars emerge on earth. But actually, we know that there's a

27:52.160 --> 27:56.720
causal chain of cars going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage. And before that,

27:56.720 --> 28:04.240
maybe, you know, where people were using wheels. And, and I think that obsession with the identities

28:04.240 --> 28:10.240
that we see in biology right now are giving us a false sense of security about what we're looking for.

28:10.880 --> 28:20.080
And I think the origin of life chemistry is in danger of, of not making the progress that it

28:20.080 --> 28:24.160
deserves. Because the chemists are doing this as there's the field is exploding right now,

28:24.160 --> 28:29.600
there's amazing people out there, young and old doing this. And there's deservedly so more money

28:29.600 --> 28:33.600
going in. You know, I used to complain, there's more money being spent searching for the Higgs

28:33.600 --> 28:38.560
boson that we know exists in the origin of life. You know, why is that the origin, we understand

28:38.560 --> 28:43.040
the origin of life, we're going to actually work out what life is. We're going to be at a bound,

28:43.040 --> 28:47.520
the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe. And most important for us, we are going

28:47.520 --> 28:53.280
to know, or have a good idea of what the future of humanity looks like. You know, we need to understand

28:53.280 --> 28:57.840
that although we're precious, we're not the only life forms in the universe. Or that's my very

28:57.840 --> 29:02.960
strong impression. I have no data for that. It's just right now a belief. And I want to turn that

29:02.960 --> 29:10.480
belief into a more than a belief by experimentation. But I coming back to the scam, the scam is if we

29:10.480 --> 29:16.560
just make this RNA, we've we've got this, you know, this, this fluke event, we know how that's

29:16.560 --> 29:22.320
simple. Let's make this phosphodiester, or let's make ATP or ATP, we've got that part nailed,

29:22.320 --> 29:25.280
let's now make this other molecule, another molecule, and how many molecules are going

29:25.280 --> 29:32.160
to be enough. And then the reason I say this is when you go back to Craig Venter, when he invented

29:32.800 --> 29:42.320
his life form, Cyndia, this micro, this, this minimal plasmid is a myoplasma, something I don't

29:42.320 --> 29:49.360
know the name of it, but he made this wonderful cell and said, I've invented life. Not quite. He

29:49.360 --> 29:56.320
facsimilead the genome from this entity and made it in the lab, or the DNA, but he didn't make the

29:56.320 --> 30:02.560
cell. He had to take an existing cell that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca.

30:02.560 --> 30:08.720
And he showed when he took out the gene, the genes and put in his genes, synthesized, the cell could

30:08.720 --> 30:14.160
boot up. But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell from scratch. And even now today,

30:14.160 --> 30:20.240
synthetic biologists cannot make a cell from scratch, because there's some contingent information

30:20.320 --> 30:27.360
embodied outside the genome in the cell. And that is just incredible. So there's lots of layers to

30:27.360 --> 30:36.560
the scam. Well, let me then ask the question, how can we create life in a lab from scratch?

30:37.120 --> 30:42.640
What have been the most promising attempts at creating life in a lab from scratch? Has anyone

30:42.640 --> 30:47.360
actually been able to do it? Do you think anyone will be able to do it in the near future if they

30:47.360 --> 30:55.280
haven't already? Yeah, I think that nobody has made life in the lab from scratch. Lots of people

30:55.280 --> 30:59.840
would argue that they have made progress at Craig Venture. I think the synthesis of a synthetic

30:59.840 --> 31:08.320
genome milestone in human achievement, brilliant. Yeah, can we just walk back and say, what would

31:08.320 --> 31:13.600
you say from your perspective, one of the world experts in exactly this area, what does it mean

31:13.680 --> 31:18.640
to create life from scratch? Where if you sit back, whether you do it or somebody else does it,

31:18.640 --> 31:27.440
it's like, damn, this is, we just created life. Well, what I can tell you, what I would expect,

31:27.440 --> 31:38.960
I would like to be able to do, is to go from sand to cells in my lab. Can you explain what sand is?

31:39.920 --> 31:46.400
Just inorganic stuff, like basically just so sand, it's just silicon oxide with some other

31:46.400 --> 31:52.880
ions in it, maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates, just basically clearly dead stuff

31:52.880 --> 31:57.840
that you could just grind rocks into sand. And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum,

31:57.840 --> 32:05.760
so they could remove anything else that could possibly be a shadow of life that can assist

32:05.840 --> 32:08.880
in the chemical. You could do that. You could insist and say, look, I'm going to take,

32:08.880 --> 32:12.480
and not just inorganic, I want some more, I want to cheat and have some organic,

32:12.480 --> 32:16.000
but I want inorganic organic, and I'll explain the play on words in a moment.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.720
So I would like to basically put into a world, say a completely, you know, a synthetic world,

32:22.720 --> 32:29.200
if you like a closed world, put some inorganic materials, and just literally add some energy

32:29.280 --> 32:37.040
in some form, be it lightning or heat, UV light, and run this thing in cycles over time,

32:37.040 --> 32:41.520
and let it solve the search problem. So I see the origin of life as a search problem in chemical

32:41.520 --> 32:46.640
space. And then I would literally wait for a life form to crawl out of the test tube. That's

32:46.640 --> 32:52.400
a joke I tell my group. Literally wait for a very, and don't worry, it's going to be very feeble,

32:52.400 --> 32:55.920
it's not going to take over the world. You know, there's ways of ethically containing it.

32:56.240 --> 33:05.040
Last words. Indeed, indeed, indeed. You know, this is being recorded, right? It will not make

33:05.040 --> 33:10.400
you look good once it crawls out of the lab and destroys all human civilization. But there is

33:10.400 --> 33:15.440
very good things you can do to prevent that. For instance, if you put stuff in your world,

33:15.440 --> 33:21.040
which isn't abundant, so let's say we make life based on molybdenum and it escapes,

33:21.040 --> 33:25.680
it would die immediately because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment. So we can do

33:25.680 --> 33:30.400
responsible life. Or as I fantasize with my research group on our away day that would go in,

33:31.440 --> 33:37.920
I think it's actually morally, if we don't find, until humanity finds life in the universe,

33:37.920 --> 33:41.920
this is going on the tangent, it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs,

33:41.920 --> 33:46.480
identify dead planets and bomb them with our origin of life machines and make them alive.

33:46.480 --> 33:51.680
I think it is our moral obligation to do that. Some people might argue with me about that,

33:51.680 --> 33:54.320
but I think that we need more life in the universe.

33:54.320 --> 33:58.720
And then we kind of forget we did it and then come back.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.920
Where did you come from? But coming back to what I'd expect.

34:03.920 --> 34:09.040
Father, are you back? I think this is once again a Rick and Morty episode.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.600
Definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down. So I imagine we have this pristine

34:14.720 --> 34:21.120
experiment and everything is sanitized and we put in inorganic materials and we have

34:21.120 --> 34:27.200
cycles with them, day night cycles, up, down, whatever. And we look for evidence of replication

34:27.200 --> 34:31.280
and evolution over time. And that's what the experiment should be. Now, are there people

34:31.280 --> 34:35.440
doing this in the world right now? There are a couple of, there's some really good groups doing

34:35.440 --> 34:39.360
this. There's some really interesting scientists doing this around the world. They're kind of,

34:40.560 --> 34:49.280
perhaps, too much associated with the scam. And so they're using molecules that are already,

34:49.280 --> 34:52.960
were already invented by biology. So there's a bit of replication built in.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.560
But I still think the work they're doing, they're doing is amazing. But I would like

34:58.560 --> 35:03.440
people to be a bit freer and say, let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box

35:03.440 --> 35:07.360
and wait for life to come out, because that's what happened on earth. And so that we have to

35:07.360 --> 35:12.640
understand that. Now, how would I know I've been successful? Well, because I'm not obsessing with

35:12.640 --> 35:21.040
what molecules are in life now, I would wager a vast quantity of money. I'm not very rich. So

35:21.040 --> 35:29.440
just be a few dollars. But for me, the solution space will be different. So the genetic material

35:29.440 --> 35:35.440
will be not RNA. The proteins will not be what we think. The solutions will be just completely

35:35.440 --> 35:38.880
different. And it might be, and it will be very feeble, because that's the other thing we should

35:38.880 --> 35:45.440
be able to show fairly robustly that even if I did make, or someone did make a new life form in

35:45.440 --> 35:54.880
the lab, it would be so poor that it's not going to leap out. It is the fear about making a lethal

35:54.880 --> 36:01.280
life form in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining that we're going to make the

36:01.280 --> 36:08.080
terminator at Boston Dynamics tomorrow. And the problem is, we don't communicate that

36:08.080 --> 36:13.760
properly. I know you yourself very, you explain this very well, you know, there is not the AI

36:13.760 --> 36:18.320
Catastrophe coming. We're very far away from that. That doesn't mean we should ignore it.

36:18.320 --> 36:22.960
Same with the origin of life Catastrophe, it's not coming anytime soon. We should ignore it.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.480
But we shouldn't let that fear stop us from doing those experiments.

36:26.480 --> 36:30.320
But this is a much, much longer discussion, because there's a lot of details there. I would say

36:30.320 --> 36:37.840
there's potentials for catastrophic events to happen in much dumber ways. In AI space,

36:38.480 --> 36:44.560
there's a lot of ways to create, like social networks are creating a kind of accelerated

36:45.520 --> 36:51.680
set of events that we might not be able to control. The social network, virality in the

36:51.680 --> 36:59.680
digital space can create mass movements of ideas that can then, if times are tough,

37:00.320 --> 37:04.960
create military conflicts and all those kinds of things. But that's not super intelligent AI.

37:05.600 --> 37:11.840
That's an interesting at scale application of AI. And if you look at viruses, viruses are pretty

37:11.840 --> 37:19.360
dumb. But at scale, their application is pretty detrimental. And so origin of life, much like

37:20.240 --> 37:29.200
all of the kind of virology, the very contentious word of gain of function research and virology,

37:29.200 --> 37:37.600
sort of like research on viruses, messing with them genetically, that can create a lot of

37:37.600 --> 37:44.000
problems if not done well. So we have to be very cautious. So there's a kind of whenever you're

37:44.000 --> 37:53.280
ultra cautious about stuff in AI or in virology and biology, it borders on cynicism, I would say,

37:53.280 --> 37:59.040
where it's like everything we do is going to turn out to be destructive and terrible. So I'm just

37:59.040 --> 38:04.880
going to sit here and do nothing. Okay, that's a possible solution, except for the fact that

38:04.880 --> 38:12.960
somebody's going to do it. It's science and technology progresses. So we have to do it in an

38:12.960 --> 38:19.760
ethical way, in a good way, considering in a transparent way in an open way, considering

38:21.680 --> 38:26.400
all the possible positive trajectories that could be taken and making sure as much as possible that

38:26.400 --> 38:33.600
we walk those trajectories. So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming, but a totally unexpected

38:33.600 --> 38:38.560
version of Terminator maybe around the corner. Yeah, it might be here already. Yeah. So I agree

38:38.560 --> 38:43.040
with that. And so going back to the origin of life discussion, I think that in synthetic biology

38:43.040 --> 38:50.880
right now, we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes and edit synthetic biology to do

38:50.880 --> 38:55.040
things. So that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong in the same way as, you know,

38:55.040 --> 39:01.680
Twitter turning ourselves into kind of strange scale effects. I would love origin of life research

39:01.680 --> 39:07.280
or artificial life research to get to the point where we have those worries. Because that's why

39:07.280 --> 39:11.360
I think we're just so far away from that. We are just, you know, right now, I think there are two

39:11.360 --> 39:17.120
really important angles. There is the origin of life, people, researchers who are faithfully

39:17.120 --> 39:22.080
working on this, and trying to make those molecules, the scam molecules I talked about.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.400
And then there are people on the creationist side is saying, look, the fact you can't make these

39:26.400 --> 39:30.640
molecules and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true and all this other stuff.

39:30.640 --> 39:35.440
Gotcha. Yeah. And so, and I find that really frustrating because actually the origin of life

39:35.440 --> 39:40.960
researchers are all working in good faith, right? Yes. And so what I'm trying to do is give origin

39:40.960 --> 39:47.760
of life research a little bit more of a, of a, of an open, an open context. And one of the things I

39:47.760 --> 39:53.040
think is important, I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime. I really want to prove

39:53.040 --> 39:58.800
that life is a general phenomena, a bit like gravity in the universe. Because I think that's

39:58.800 --> 40:06.160
going to be really important for humanities, global psychological state, meaning going forward.

40:06.160 --> 40:12.480
That's beautifully, that's beautifully put. So one, it will help us understand ourselves. So

40:12.480 --> 40:22.800
that's useful for science. But two, it gives us a kind of hope, if not an awe at all the huge

40:22.800 --> 40:29.520
amounts of alien civilizations that are out there, if you can build life and understand just how

40:29.520 --> 40:36.800
easy it is to build life, then that's just as good, if not much better than discovering life

40:36.800 --> 40:44.640
on another planet. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's cheaper. It's much cheaper and much easier. And

40:45.920 --> 40:50.480
probably much more conclusive because once you're able to create life, like you said,

40:50.560 --> 40:56.720
it's a search problem that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it. Once you create the,

40:56.720 --> 41:01.280
once you find the first solution, you probably have all the right methodology for finding all

41:01.280 --> 41:05.520
kinds of other solutions. Yeah. And wouldn't it be great if we could find a solution? I mean,

41:05.520 --> 41:09.680
it's probably a bit late for, I mean, I worry about climate change, but I'm not that worried

41:09.680 --> 41:14.400
about climate change. And I think one day you could think about, could we engineer a new type

41:14.400 --> 41:18.560
of life form that could basically, and I don't want to do this. And I don't think we should do

41:18.640 --> 41:23.040
this necessarily, but it's a good thought experiment that would perhaps take CO2 out of the

41:23.040 --> 41:28.080
atmosphere or an intermediate life forms. It's not quite alive. It's almost like an add-on

41:28.080 --> 41:35.040
that we can, with a time dependent add-on, you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean,

41:35.040 --> 41:39.520
or to maybe to wheat and say, right, we're just going to, we're going to fix a bit more CO2.

41:40.160 --> 41:46.240
And we're going to work out how much we need to fix to basically save the climate. And we're going

41:46.240 --> 41:51.040
to use evolutionary principles to basically get there. What worries me is that biology has had

41:51.040 --> 41:57.040
a few billion years to find a solution for CO2 fixation. It hasn't really done. It's not,

41:57.040 --> 42:01.040
the solution isn't brilliant for our needs, but biology wasn't thinking about our needs. Biology

42:01.040 --> 42:06.000
was thinking about biology's needs. But I think if we can do, as you say, make life in the lab,

42:06.560 --> 42:11.600
then suddenly we don't need to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it. I think we make life

42:11.600 --> 42:16.400
in the lab. We look at the extent of life in the solar system. How far did Earth life get?

42:16.400 --> 42:20.400
Probably we're all Martians. Probably life got going on Mars, the chemistry on Mars,

42:20.400 --> 42:24.800
seeded Earth. That might have been a legitimate way to kind of truncate the surface.

42:25.360 --> 42:28.240
But in the outer solar system, we might have completely different life forms

42:28.240 --> 42:33.280
on Enceladus, on Europa, and Titan. And that would be a cool thing because-

42:33.280 --> 42:38.480
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you just say that you think,

42:38.480 --> 42:43.520
in terms of likelihood, life started on Mars, statistically speaking,

42:43.520 --> 42:47.600
life started on Mars and seeded Earth? It could be possible because life was,

42:48.720 --> 42:53.360
Mars was habitable for the type of life that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.

42:54.240 --> 43:00.640
It seems to me that Mars got searching doing chemistry. It started way before.

43:00.640 --> 43:05.360
Yeah. And so they had a few more replicators and some other stuff. And if those replicators got

43:05.360 --> 43:10.080
ejected from Mars and landed on Earth, and Earth was like, I don't need to start again.

43:11.520 --> 43:16.400
Thanks for that. And then it just carries on. So I'm not going, I think we will find evidence

43:16.400 --> 43:22.400
of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake, contamination, or actually life,

43:22.400 --> 43:26.800
the earliest remnants of life. And that would be really exciting. There's a really good reason

43:26.800 --> 43:31.520
to go there. But I think it's more unlikely because of the gravitational situation in the solar system

43:31.520 --> 43:35.440
if we find life in the outer solar system. Tighten and all that. That would be its own

43:35.440 --> 43:40.720
thing. Exactly. Wow, that would be so cool. If we go to Mars and we find life that looks

43:40.720 --> 43:46.880
a hell of a lot similar to Earth life. And then we go to tighten and all those weird moons with

43:46.880 --> 43:51.760
the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff. And then we find there something that looks,

43:52.480 --> 43:58.720
I don't know, way weirder. Yeah. Some other, some non RNA type of situation.

43:58.720 --> 44:03.520
Almost life like in the prebiotic chemical space. And I think there are four types of exoplanets

44:03.520 --> 44:07.840
we're going to look for, right? Because when JWST goes up and touch wood, it goes up and

44:07.840 --> 44:13.360
everything's fine. When we look at a star, we know statistically most stars have planets around them.

44:13.360 --> 44:16.960
What type of planet are they? Are they going to be dead? Are they going to be

44:17.680 --> 44:22.320
just a prebiotic origin of life coming? So are they going to be technological?

44:23.200 --> 44:28.640
And, you know, so we have intelligence on them. And will they will they have died? So, you know,

44:28.640 --> 44:31.760
from, you know, had life on them, but not. Those are the four states of the world.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.400
And so, and suddenly, it's a bit like I want to classify planets, the way we classify stars.

44:36.960 --> 44:42.560
Yeah. And I think that in terms of their rather than having this, oh, we've found we found methane,

44:42.560 --> 44:46.320
there's evidence of life, we found oxygen, that's the evidence of life, we found whatever

44:46.320 --> 44:51.600
molecule marker and start to then frame things a little bit more.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.840
As those four states, which by the way, you're just saying four, but there could be a

44:57.120 --> 45:02.080
before the dead, there could be other states that we humans can even conceive of.

45:02.080 --> 45:07.120
Just prebiotic, almost alive, you know, got the possibility to come alive. I think.

45:07.120 --> 45:12.000
There could be a post technological, like whatever we think of as technology,

45:12.000 --> 45:20.480
that could be like pre-conscious, like when we all meld into one super intelligent

45:20.480 --> 45:23.760
consciousness or some weird thing that naturally happens over time.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.640
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that the all bets.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.440
The metaverse.

45:28.080 --> 45:35.360
Yeah. We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating, which is kind of an interesting idea,

45:35.360 --> 45:41.120
almost arbitrary number of copies of each other, much more quickly to can mess with different

45:41.120 --> 45:48.000
ideas in mind, like I can create a thousand copies of Lex, like every possible version of Lex,

45:48.000 --> 45:53.440
and then just see like, and then I just have them like argue with each other and like until,

45:53.440 --> 45:57.920
like in the space of ideas and see who wins out, how could that possibly go wrong?

45:57.920 --> 46:03.200
But anyway, but there's a, especially in this digital space where you could start exploring

46:03.200 --> 46:07.360
with AI's mixed in, you could start engineering arbitrary intelligences,

46:07.440 --> 46:12.160
you can start playing in the space of ideas, which might move us into a world that looks

46:12.160 --> 46:17.600
very different than a biological world. Like our current world, the technology,

46:17.600 --> 46:23.360
is still very much tied to our biology. It's, we might move past that.

46:23.360 --> 46:25.120
Oh, definitely. We definitely will.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.280
We definitely, because that could be another phase then.

46:27.280 --> 46:27.600
Sure.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.400
Because then you.

46:28.400 --> 46:31.520
But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you. I think so you can have,

46:31.680 --> 46:35.520
let's get this right. So dead world, no prospect of alive.

46:36.400 --> 46:41.440
Prebiotic world, life emerging, living, and technological. And you probably,

46:41.440 --> 46:44.320
and the dead one, you probably won't be able to tell between the dead never been alive.

46:44.320 --> 46:48.480
And the dead one, maybe what some artifacts, and maybe there's five, there's probably not more

46:48.480 --> 46:54.160
than five. And I think the technological one could allow, could have life on it still,

46:54.160 --> 46:58.720
but it might just have exceeded. Because, you know, one way that life might survive on earth

46:58.720 --> 47:03.120
is if we can work out how to deal with the coming, the real climate change that comes

47:03.120 --> 47:07.280
when the sun expands. It might be a way to survive that, you know.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.960
But yeah, I think that we need to start thinking statistically when it comes to

47:13.600 --> 47:15.120
looking for life in the universe.

47:15.120 --> 47:23.120
Let me ask you then, sort of statistically, how many alien civilizations are out there

47:23.840 --> 47:27.760
in those four phases that you're talking about? When you look up to the stars,

47:28.480 --> 47:35.520
and you're sipping on some wine, and talking to other people with British accents about

47:35.520 --> 47:42.080
something intelligent and intellectual, I'm sure. Do you think there's a lot of alien

47:42.080 --> 47:45.200
civilizations looking back at us? I'm wondering the same.

47:45.760 --> 47:52.480
My romantic view of the universe is really taking loans from my logical self. So what

47:52.480 --> 47:59.600
I'm saying is I have no idea. But having said that, there is no reason to

48:00.720 --> 48:07.680
suppose that life is as hard as we first thought it was. And so if we just take earth as a marker,

48:08.720 --> 48:13.200
and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena than just our biology,

48:13.200 --> 48:19.360
then I think the universe is full of life. And the reason for the Fermi paradox is not that

48:20.240 --> 48:25.440
they're not out there, it's just that we can't interact with the other life forms because they're

48:25.440 --> 48:30.560
so different. And I'm not saying that they're necessarily like has been depicted in a rival

48:30.560 --> 48:39.280
or other, you know, I'm just saying that perhaps there are very few universal facts in the universe.

48:40.000 --> 48:47.360
And that, and maybe that is not, it's quite hard, our technologies are quite divergent.

48:47.360 --> 48:51.600
And so I think that it's very hard to know how we're going to interact with alien life.

48:51.600 --> 48:55.200
You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible. I guess that was the intuition.

48:56.480 --> 49:04.800
You provided that the way biology itself, but even this particular kinds of biology that we

49:04.800 --> 49:14.720
have on earth is something that is just one sample of nearly infinite number of other possible

49:15.520 --> 49:20.960
complex autonomous self-replicating type of things that could be possible. And so

49:21.600 --> 49:30.640
we're almost unable to see the alternative versions of us. I mean, we'll still be able to

49:30.640 --> 49:35.920
detect them. We'll still be able to interact with them. We'll still be able to, like, which

49:36.960 --> 49:42.560
what's exactly is lost in translation? Why can't we see them? Why can't we talk to them?

49:42.640 --> 49:54.000
Because I too have a sense, you put it way more poetically, but it seems both statistically

49:54.880 --> 50:02.000
and sort of romantically, it feels like the universe should be teaming with life,

50:02.000 --> 50:09.600
like super intelligent life. And I just, I sit there and the Fermi Paradox is very,

50:09.600 --> 50:14.800
it's felt very distinctly by me when I look up at the stars because it's like,

50:15.840 --> 50:19.920
it's the same way I feel when I'm driving through New Jersey and listening to Bruce

50:19.920 --> 50:25.760
Springsteen and feel quite sad. It's like Lucy K talks about pulling off to the side of the road

50:25.760 --> 50:32.800
and just weeping a little bit. I'm almost like wondering like, hey, why, why aren't you talking

50:32.800 --> 50:36.800
to us? You know, it feels lonely. It feels lonely because it feels like they're out there.

50:37.040 --> 50:42.160
I think that there are a number of answers to that. I think the Fermi Paradox is perhaps

50:42.160 --> 50:48.400
based on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe, it would be similar to our life

50:49.040 --> 50:53.920
and there's only one solution. And I think that what we've got to start to do is go out and look

50:53.920 --> 51:02.160
for selection detection rather than an evolution detection rather than life detection. And I think

51:02.160 --> 51:07.520
that once we start to do that, we might start to see really interesting things. And we haven't

51:07.520 --> 51:13.440
been doing this for very long. And we are living in an expanding universe and that makes the problem

51:13.440 --> 51:21.840
a little bit harder. Everybody's always leaving. But I'm, I'm very optimistic that we will,

51:22.720 --> 51:26.720
well, I don't know, there are two movies that came out in the same within six months of one

51:26.720 --> 51:33.600
another, Ad Astra and Cosmos. Ad Astra, the very expensive blockbuster, you know, with Brad Pitt in

51:33.600 --> 51:38.400
it and saying there is no life and it's all, you know, we've got a life on Earth has more pressures

51:38.400 --> 51:42.800
and Cosmos, which is a UK production, which basically aliens came and visited Earth one day

51:42.800 --> 51:49.440
and they were discovered in the UK, right? It was quite, it's a fun film. But I really loved

51:49.440 --> 51:54.560
those two films. And I'm, and at the same time, those films, at the time those films are coming

51:54.560 --> 52:00.960
out, I was working on a paper, a life detection paper. And I fact, it was so hard to publish this

52:00.960 --> 52:06.400
paper. And it was almost as depressed that I got so depressed trying to get this science out there,

52:06.400 --> 52:13.520
that I felt the depression of the film and Ad Astra like life is there's no life elsewhere in

52:13.520 --> 52:18.800
the universe. And but I, but I'm incredibly optimistic that I think we will find life in

52:18.800 --> 52:23.680
the universe firm evidence of life. And it will have to start on Earth making life on Earth and

52:23.680 --> 52:29.120
surprising as we have to surprise ourselves and make non biological life on Earth. And then people

52:29.120 --> 52:33.760
say, well, you, you make this life on Earth, therefore, it's the, you're part of the causal

52:33.760 --> 52:40.320
chain of that. And that might be true. But if I can show how I, I'm able to do it with very little

52:40.320 --> 52:45.840
cheating or very little information inputs, just creating like a model planet, some description,

52:45.840 --> 52:51.360
and watching it, watching life emerge, then I think that we will be even to, to persuade even

52:51.360 --> 52:58.400
the hardest critic that that is, it's possible. Now with regards to the Fermi paradox, I think

52:58.400 --> 53:04.080
that we might crush that with the JWST. It's basically, if I recall correctly, the mirror is

53:04.080 --> 53:08.960
about 10 times the size of the Hubble, that we're going to be able to do spectroscopy,

53:08.960 --> 53:14.400
look at colors of exoplanets, I think, not brilliantly, but we'll be able to start to classify

53:14.400 --> 53:20.640
them. And we'll start to get a real feet feel for what's going on in the universe on these

53:20.640 --> 53:26.960
exoplanets. Because it's only in the last few decades, I think, maybe even last decade that we

53:26.960 --> 53:35.520
even came to recognize that exoplanets even are common. And I think that that gives us a lot of

53:35.520 --> 53:43.120
optimism that life is going to be out there. But I think we have to start framing, we have to start

53:43.120 --> 53:48.560
preparing the fact that biology is only one solution. I can tell you with confidence that

53:48.560 --> 53:54.000
biology on Earth does not exist anywhere else in the universe. We are absolutely unique.

53:54.640 --> 54:01.280
Well, okay, I love the confidence, but where does that confidence come from?

54:02.320 --> 54:07.600
Chemistry, like how many options does chemistry really have?

54:07.600 --> 54:11.520
Many. That's the point. And the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam comes in,

54:11.680 --> 54:19.920
is that people don't count the numbers. So if biology, as you find on Earth, is common everywhere,

54:19.920 --> 54:23.840
then there's something really weird going on that basically written in the quantum mechanics,

54:23.840 --> 54:27.760
there's some kind of these bonds must form over these bonds, and this catalyst must form over

54:27.760 --> 54:33.920
this catalyst when they're all quite equal. Life is contingent. The origin of life on Earth was

54:33.920 --> 54:39.840
contingent upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on Earth. So that means if we want

54:39.840 --> 54:45.280
to find other life-like, other Earth-like worlds, we look for the same kind of rocky world, we might

54:45.280 --> 54:53.680
look in the same zone as Earth, and we might expect reasonably to find biological-like stuff going on.

54:53.680 --> 54:58.160
That would be a reasonable hypothesis, but it won't be the same. It can't be. It's like saying,

54:58.720 --> 55:04.000
I don't believe in magic. That's why I'm sure. I just don't believe in magic. I believe in

55:04.000 --> 55:09.680
statistics and I can do experiments. And so I won't get the same, exactly the same sequence of

55:09.680 --> 55:14.720
events. I'll get something different. And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe, but it's not

55:14.720 --> 55:20.000
the same as our TikTok, right? That's what I mean. Which aspect of it is not the same?

55:20.000 --> 55:26.720
Well, I just think, so what is TikTok? TikTok is a social media where people upload videos,

55:26.720 --> 55:30.880
right? Silly videos. So I guess there might be... Well, there's humor, there's attention,

55:30.880 --> 55:37.200
there's ability to process, there's ability for intelligent organisms to collaborate on ideas

55:37.200 --> 55:41.440
and find humor and ideas and play with those ideas, make them viral, memes.

55:43.680 --> 55:46.480
Humor seems to be kind of fundamental to human experience.

55:46.480 --> 55:51.440
And I think that that's a really interesting question we can ask. Is humor a fundamental

55:51.440 --> 55:55.440
thing in the universe? I think maybe it will be, right? In terms of you think about in a game

55:55.440 --> 56:02.720
theoretic sense, humor, the emergence of humor serves a role in our game engine. And so if

56:02.720 --> 56:09.280
selection is fundamental in the universe, so is humor. Well, I actually don't know exactly

56:10.320 --> 56:18.880
what role humor serves. Maybe from a chemical perspective, it's like a catalyst for...

56:20.240 --> 56:23.680
I guess it serves several purposes. One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.

56:23.680 --> 56:31.120
That's modern humor. But humor is also a good way to deal with the difficulty of life. It's a kind

56:31.120 --> 56:38.480
of valve, release valve for suffering. Throughout human history, life has been really hard.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.920
And for the people that I have known in my life who've lived through some

56:42.960 --> 56:48.720
really difficult things, humor is part of how they deal with that. It's usually dark humor.

56:49.280 --> 56:56.080
But yeah, it's interesting. I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically

56:56.080 --> 57:01.840
general way to formulate what the hell is humor. What humor does it serve? But I still...

57:02.640 --> 57:10.320
We're kind of joking here, but it's a counterintuitive idea to me to think that

57:11.760 --> 57:18.080
life elsewhere in the universe is very different than life on earth. And also,

57:19.040 --> 57:25.440
like all of each instantiation of life is likely very different from each other.

57:26.400 --> 57:33.200
Like maybe there's a few clusters of similar like life, but it's much more likely is what you're

57:33.200 --> 57:38.080
saying. To me, it's a kind of novel thought. I'm not sure what to do with it. But you're saying that

57:39.200 --> 57:46.400
it's more common to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life than it is to be in some

57:46.800 --> 57:52.720
usual cluster. So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry that results in complexity,

57:52.720 --> 57:56.240
that's autonomous and self-replicating, however the hell you define life,

57:57.120 --> 58:04.400
that is going to be very different every time. I don't know. It feels like a selection is a

58:04.400 --> 58:11.600
fundamental kind of directed force in the universe. Won't selection result in a few pockets of

58:12.080 --> 58:20.880
interesting complexities? If we ran earth over again, over and over and over,

58:20.880 --> 58:24.880
you're saying it's going to come up, but there's not going to be elephants every time?

58:25.920 --> 58:31.760
Yeah, I don't think so. I think that there will be similarities. And I think we don't

58:31.760 --> 58:40.000
know enough about how selection globally works. But it might be that the elephant,

58:40.960 --> 58:44.560
the emergence of elephants was wired into the history of earth in some way, like the

58:44.560 --> 58:49.280
gravitational force, how evolution was going, the Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah,

58:49.280 --> 58:54.800
the emergence of mammals. But I just don't know enough about the contingency, the variability.

58:54.800 --> 59:00.080
All I do know is you count the number of bits of information required to make an elephant

59:01.200 --> 59:06.320
and think about the causal chain that provide the lineage of elephants going all the way back

59:06.320 --> 59:13.600
to Luca. There's a huge scope for divergence. Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry

59:13.600 --> 59:23.840
and selection, the things that result in self-replicating chemistry and self-replicating

59:23.840 --> 59:31.520
organisms, those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying. But once they're successful,

59:31.520 --> 59:38.800
they multiply. So it might be a tiny subset of all things that are possible in the universe,

59:38.800 --> 59:43.120
chemically speaking, it might be a very tiny subset that's actually successful at creating

59:45.120 --> 59:49.920
elephant-like creatures. Well, there's two different questions. The first one, if we were

59:49.920 --> 59:54.800
to reset earth and to start again. At the different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.720
Yeah, no. If we restart earth and start again, say we could go back to the beginning and do

59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.360
the experiment or have a number of earths, how similar would biology be? I would say that there

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:10.080
would be broad similarities. But the emergence of mammals is not a given unless we're going to

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.960
throw an asteroid at each planet each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happens.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.400
Then there's the other thing about when you go to another earth-like planet elsewhere,

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.400
maybe there's a different ratio, particular elements, maybe the bombardment at the beginning

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:32.880
of the planet was quicker or longer than earth. I just don't have enough information there. What

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:42.240
I do know is that the complexity of the story of life on earth gives us lots of scope for variation.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.720
And I just don't think it's a reasonable mathematical assumption to think that life on

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.080
earth that happened again would be same as what we have now. Okay. But you've also extended that

01:00:54.080 --> 01:01:01.120
to say that as an explanation for the Fermi paradox that that means we're not able to

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:07.680
interact with them. Or that's an explanation for why we haven't at scale heard from aliens is

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.280
they're different than us. We've only been looking for say 70, 80 years. So I think that the reason

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.280
we have not found aliens yet is that we haven't worked out what life is.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:26.800
No, but the aliens have worked that out surely. I mean, statistically speaking,

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:32.880
there must be a large number of aliens that are way ahead of us on this whole life question.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.800
Unless there's something about this stage of intellectual evolution that often quickly results

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:49.760
in nuclear war and destroys itself, like there's something in this process that eventually, I

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:55.120
don't know, crystallizes the complexity and it stops either dies or stops developing.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.560
But most likely they already figured it out. And why aren't they contacting us? Is it some

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.040
grad student somewhere wants to study a new green planet? Maybe they have. I mean,

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.560
I don't have a coherent answer to your question, other than to say that if there are other aliens

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.960
out there and they're far more advanced, they might be in contact with each other.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.360
And they might also, we might be at a point where what I'm saying quite critically is it takes two

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.120
to talk, right? So the aliens might be there. But if we don't have the ability to recognize them

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:37.200
and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going to want to talk to us. And I think that's a critical

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:44.320
point. Then probably, if that's a filter, there needs to be an ability for one

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.560
to communicate with the other. And we need to know what life is before we do that. So we haven't

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:53.920
qualified to even join the club to have a talk. Well, I think they still want to teach us how to

01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:01.280
talk, right? But my worry is that, or I think they would want to teach us how to talk like you do

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:14.640
when you meet it. I was going to say child, but that's a human species. And you want to try to

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:20.960
communicate with them through whatever devices you can, given what an ant is like. I worry mostly

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.680
about that humans are just too close-minded or don't have the right tools. I'm going to push

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.480
back on this quite significantly. I would say because we don't understand what life is,

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.360
and because we don't understand how life emerged in the universe, we don't understand the physics

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.200
that gave rise to life yet. That means our fundamental description. I'm way out of my

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.560
pay grade, even further out. But I'll say it anyway, because I think it's fun.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.120
You don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:54.000
So I would say that because we don't understand the universe yet, we do not understand how the

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.680
universe spat out life. And we don't know what life is. And I think that until we understand that,

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.720
it is going to limit our ability to even... We don't qualify to talk to the aliens.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.720
So I'm going to say that they might be there, but I'm not going to say that I believe in

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.400
interdimensional aliens being present in this world.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.360
Yeah, but I think you're just being self-critical, like we don't qualify. I think the fact that we

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.000
don't qualify qualifies us. We're interesting in our innocence.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.760
No, I'm saying that because we don't understand causal chains and the way that information is

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.080
propagated in the universe. And we don't understand what replication is yet. And we don't understand

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:41.760
how life emerged. I think that we would not recognize aliens. And if someone doesn't recognize you,

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.160
you wouldn't go and talk to it. You don't go and talk to ants. You don't go and talk to birds.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.000
Or maybe some birds you do, right? Because you can. There's just enough cognition.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.720
So I'm saying because we don't have enough cognitive... Our cognitive abilities are not

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.240
yet where they need to be. We probably aren't communicating with them.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:05.920
So you don't agree with the dating strategy of playing hard to get? Because us humans,

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.280
that seems to attract us.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.600
We're in a species that's fine, but I think we don't actually have abstraction.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.560
No, actually, I think in this talk, in this conversation, you've helped me crystallize

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.080
something that I think has been troubling me for a long time with the thermo paradox.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.880
I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue is to say that you would not go and talk to

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.560
your cat about calculus, right?

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.160
But I was so petty.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.000
Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat. The analogy is that the aliens are not going

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.640
to talk to us because we... And I'm using calculus as an analogy for abstraction.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:48.480
Because we lack the layer, the fundamental layer of understanding what life is and what the universe

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.120
is in our reality, that it would be so counterproductive interacting with intelligent alien species

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.400
that it would cause more angst for human race.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.080
They don't care. Okay, they got to be self-interested. So they'll probably...

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.520
They more care about... Is it interesting for them? Maybe they...

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:16.880
I mean, surely there's a way to pet the cat in this analogy.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.280
Because even if we lack complete understanding, it must be a very frustrating experience for

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:29.280
other kinds of intelligences to communicate with us. Still, there must be a way to interact with us.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.760
Preturb the system in interesting ways to see what these creatures do.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.880
We might actually find the answer. I mean, again, out of my pay grade in a simulation

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.120
of Earth, or let's say a simulation where we allow an intelligent AI to emerge, right?

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:54.240
And that AI, we then give it... The objective is to be curious, interact with other

01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:02.320
intelligence in its universe. And then we might find the parameters required for that AI to work...

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.880
And I think you'll find if the AI will not talk to other AIs that don't share

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.280
the ability to abstract to the level of the AI, because it's just a cat.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.200
And are you going to travel 20 light years to go and pet a cat?

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:22.080
So not because of the inability to do so, but because of boredom. It's more interesting.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.960
It will start talking to... It will spend most... It will spend a majority of its time talking to

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.040
other AI systems that can at least somewhat understand it. It's much more fun.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.080
It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious? Well, plants unconscious in the way

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.640
we typically think, but we don't talk to them. They could be, right?

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.320
But there's a lot of people on Earth who like gardening. There's always going to be a weird...

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.080
They're not talking. They're just gardening.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.240
Okay. Well, you're not romantic enough to see gardening as a way of communication between

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.160
humans and animals. Okay. You've got me there.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.520
But there's ways... There's always going to be the people who are curious. Jane Goodall,

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.400
who lives with the chimps, right? There's always going to be curious intelligence

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:09.680
species that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact. I mean, I think it's a super

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.040
cool idea that you're expressing. I just kind of have a sense... Maybe it's a hope that there's

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:21.360
always going to be a desire to interact even with those that can't possibly understand the depth of

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.600
what you understand. So I'm with you. So I want to be as positive as you that the aliens do exist

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:33.360
and we will interact with them. What I'm trying to do is to give you a reasonable hypothesis

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:39.040
why we haven't yet and also something to strive for to be able to do that. I mean,

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.360
there is the other view that the universe is just too big and life is just too rare.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.600
But I want to come up with an alternative explanation which I think is reasonable and not

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.760
being philosophically and scientifically thought out, which is this, if you can't actually communicate

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.480
with the object, the person, the thing competently, you don't even know it's there, then there's no

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.720
point yet. See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned with your hopeful vision, which is

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:13.760
like we need to understand the origin of life. It will help us engineer life. It will help us

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.280
engineer intelligent life through perhaps on the computer side through simulation and explore all

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.800
the ways that life emerges. And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason we don't see

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:32.400
overwhelming amounts of life is I actually believe aliens, of course, these are all just kind of

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.440
open-minded beliefs. It's difficult to know for sure about any of this, but I think there's a lot

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.240
of alien civilizations which are actively communicating with us and we're too dumb.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.400
We don't have the right tools to see it. That's what I'm saying.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:55.760
No, but maybe I misinterpreted you, but I interpret you just say they kind of tried a few

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.800
times and they're like, oh God. No, no, no. What I'm saying is we, so this goes two ways. Yeah,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.280
I agree with you. There could be information out there, but just put in such a way that we just

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.920
don't understand it yet. Right. So sorry if I didn't make that clear. I mean, it's not just,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.800
I don't think we qualify. I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.360
Right. So when you say qualified, got it, got it. So you mean we're just not smart enough,

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.400
the word qualified will stop me off. So we're not smart enough to do,

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.360
it's like, but we just need to get smarter. And there's a lot of people who believe,

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:37.120
let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings. So sightings of weird phenomena,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:47.200
that, you know, what does UFO mean? It means it's a flying object and it's not identified

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.600
clearly at the time of sighting. That's what UFO means. So it could be a physics phenomena,

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.440
could be ball lightning, it could be all kinds of fascinating. I was always fascinated with

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:04.160
ball lightning as a, like the fact that there could be physical phenomena in this world

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.400
that are observable by the human eye. Of course, all physical phenomenon generally

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.960
are fascinating that are, that, that really smart people can't explain. I love that.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.280
Cause it's like, wait a minute, especially if you can replicate it. It's like, wait a minute,

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.720
how does this happen? That's like the precursor to giant discoveries in chemistry and biology

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.080
and physics and so on. But it sucks when those events are super rare, right? Physically like

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:36.880
leg ball lightning. So, so that's out there. And then of course that phenomena could have

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.080
other interpretations that don't have to do with the physics, the chemistry, the biology of earth.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:49.040
It could have to do with more extraterrestrial explanations that in large part,

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.040
thanks to Hollywood and movies and all those kinds of things, captivates the imaginations

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.920
of millions of people. But just because it's science fiction that captivates the imagination

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.400
of people doesn't mean that some of those sightings, all it takes is one. One of those sightings

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:15.280
is actually a sign that it's extraterrestrial intelligence, that it's object that's not of

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.600
this particular world. Do you think there's a chance that that's the case? What do you make,

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.840
especially the pilot sightings, what do you make of those?

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:29.280
So I agree there's a chance, there's always a chance, any good scientist would have to

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:35.280
or observationist would have to, I want to see if aliens exist, come to earth.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.360
What I know about the universe is I think it's unlikely right now that there are aliens visiting

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:49.760
us, but not impossible. I think the releases, the dramatization that's been happening politically

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.280
saying we're going to release all this information, this classified information.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:13:03.680
I was kind of disappointed because it was just very poor material. And right now,

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.480
the ability to capture high resolution video, everybody is carrying around with them an

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:19.200
incredible video device now. And we haven't got more compelling data. And so that we've just

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:26.960
seeing grainy pictures, a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions and whatnot.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.280
And so I think on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely, but I think something

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.280
really interesting is happening. And also during the pandemic, right, we've all been locked down,

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.720
we all want to have, we want to our imaginations are, you know, running riot. And I think that

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.240
I don't think that the information out there is convinced me there are anything interesting

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.280
on the UFO side. But what it has made me very interested in about is how humanity is opening

01:13:53.280 --> 01:14:02.320
up its mind to ponder aliens and the mystery of our universe. And so I don't want to dissuade

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.000
people from having those thoughts and say, you're stupid and look at that, it's clearly incorrect.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.520
That's not right. That's not fair. What I would say is that I lack sufficient data, replicated

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.600
observations to make me go, oh, I'm going to take this seriously. But I'm really interested

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.840
by the fact that there is this, this great deal of interest. And I think that it drives me

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.960
to maybe want to make or make an artificial life form even more and to help NASA and the

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.960
Air Force and whoever go and look for things even more, because I think humanity wants to know

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.720
what's out there. There's this yearning, isn't there? Yeah, but I see I almost

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.920
depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you, but with the thing you just said, but

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:56.160
one of the disappointing things to me about the sightings, I still hold the belief that

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:08.000
a non zero number of them is an indication of something very interesting. So I don't

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.200
side with the people who say everything can be explained with sensor artifacts kind of thing.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.280
Yeah, I agree with you. I didn't say that either. I would say I just don't have enough data.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.320
But the thing I want to push back on is the statement that everybody has a high definition

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.880
camera. One of the disappointing things to me about the report that the government released,

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.000
but in general, just having worked with government, having worked with people all over,

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:40.320
is how incompetent we are. Like if you look at the response to the pandemic, how incompetent we are

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:47.840
in the face of great challenges without great leadership, how incompetent we are in the face

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:53.840
of the great mysteries before us without great leadership. And I just think it's actually,

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.240
the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras is not enough to capture the full richness

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:06.320
of weird of the mysterious phenomenon out there of which extraterrestrial intelligence

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.080
visiting Earth could be one. I don't think we have, I don't think everybody having a smartphone in

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:19.440
their pocket is enough. I think that allows for TikTok videos. I don't think it allows for the

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:26.400
capture of even interesting relatively rare human events. That's not that common. It's rare to have

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.920
be in the right moment in the right time to be able to capture the thing.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.680
I agree. I agree. Let me rephrase what I think on this. I haven't seen enough information. I

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.040
haven't really actively sought it out. I must admit, but I'm with you in that I love the

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.760
idea of anomaly detection in chemistry in particular. I want to make anomalies, sorry,

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:51.520
or not necessarily make anomalies. I want to understand an anomaly. Let me give you two from

01:16:51.520 --> 01:17:00.000
chemistry, which are really quite interesting. Phlogiston, going way back where people said

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.560
there's this thing called phlogiston. For ages, the alchemists got really this kind of that this

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:13.200
fire is the thing. That's one. Then we determined that phlogiston wasn't what we thought it is.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.600
Let's go to physics, the aether. The aifers are a hard one because I think actually the aether

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:25.360
might exist. I'll tell you what I think the aether is later. Can you explain the aether?

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.360
As the vacuums, the light traveling through the aether in the vacuum, there is some

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.280
thing that we call the aether that basically mediates the movement of light.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.920
Then the other one is cold fusion, which is more of a... A few years ago,

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.480
that people observed that when they did some electrochemistry, when they were splitting water

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.840
into hydrogen and oxygen, that you got more energy out than you put in. People got excited

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:58.080
and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction. In the end, it was kind of discredited because

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:04.240
you didn't detect neutrons and all stuff. I'm pretty sure... I'm a chemist. I'm going telling

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.320
you this on your podcast, but why not? I'm pretty sure there's interesting electrochemical phenomena

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.720
that's not completely bottomed out yet, that there is something there. However, we lack the

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:19.120
technology and the experimental design. All I'm saying in your response about aliens is we lack

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:25.840
the experimental design to really capture these anomalies. We are encircling the planet with

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:31.600
many more detection systems. We've got satellites everywhere. I do hope that we are going to discover

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:37.840
more anomalies. Remember, the solar system isn't just static in space. It's moving through the

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:43.520
universe. There's just more and more chance. I'm not one with Avi Loeb. He's generating all

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:51.920
sorts of a cult, I would say, with this, but I'm not against him. I think there is a finite chance

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.360
if there are aliens in the universe that we're going to happen upon them because we're moving

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.480
through the universe. What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has? He's doubling down

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.560
more and more and more and say there are aliens, interdimensional aliens and everything else. He's

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.920
gone from space junk accelerating out of to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:20.480
time. He's obviously bored. Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand. He's playfully

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:27.040
trying to interact with society and his peers to say, stop saying it's not possible, which I agree

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.080
with. We shouldn't do that, but we should frame it statistically in the same way we should frame

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:42.560
everything as good scientists statistically. Yeah, good scientists. Recently, the idea of good

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:49.680
scientists is, I take quite skeptically. I've been listening to a lot of scientists tell me

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:54.720
about what is good science. That makes me sad because you've been interviewing, well, I would

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:00.480
consider a lot of really good scientists. No, that's true, but that's exactly right. Most of the

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:08.560
people I talk to are incredible human beings, but there's a humility that's required. Science can

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:18.480
not be dogmatism. Sure, I agree. Authority, a PhD does not give you authority. A lifelong pursuit

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.840
of a particular task does not give you authority. You're just as lost and clues as everybody else,

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:31.120
but you're more curious and more stubborn. That's a nice quality to have, but overall, just

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:44.400
using the word science and statistics can often, as you know, become a catalyst for dismissing

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.400
new ideas out of the box ideas, wild ideas, all that stuff.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:21:00.240
Yes and no. I like to, some people find me extremely annoying in science because I'm

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:07.520
basically quite rude and disruptive. Not in a rude, some people say they're ugly or stupid or

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:15.840
anything like that. I just say, you're wrong, or why do you think this? Something, a gift I got

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.560
given by society when I was very young because I was in the learning difficulties class at school

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:28.080
as I was told I was stupid. I know I'm stupid, but I always wanted to be smart. I remember going

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.320
to school going, maybe today they're going to tell me I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday,

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.560
and it was always disappointed, always. When I went into academia and everyone said,

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:43.840
you're wrong, I was like, join the queue because it allowed me to walk through the wall. I think

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.000
that people like to always imagine science as a bit like living in a Japanese house,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.680
they're paper walls, and everyone sits in their room, and I annoy people because I walk straight

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:58.480
through the wall, not because why should I be a chemist and not a mathematician? Why should I

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.200
be a mathematician and not computer scientist? Because if the problem requires us to walk through

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:11.760
those walls, but I like walking through the walls, but then I have to put up, I have to

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:18.640
do good science, I have to win the people in those rooms across by good science, by taking

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:24.080
their criticisms and addressing them head on. And I think we must do that. And I think that I try

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:31.200
and do that in my own way. And I kind of love walking through the walls. And it gives me,

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:38.160
it's difficult for me personally, it's quite painful. But it always leads to a deeper understanding

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.400
of the people I'm with, and particularly the arguments I have with all sorts of

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.440
interesting minds, because I want to solve the problem, or I want to understand more about why

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:56.240
I exist. That's it, really. And I think we have to not dismiss science on that basis. I think we

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:03.120
can work with science. No, science is beautiful, but humans with egos and all those kinds of things

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:13.520
can sometimes misuse good things, like social justice, like all ideas were all aspired to

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:21.120
misuse these beautiful ideas to manipulate people to all those kinds of things. And that's,

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:28.000
there's assholes in every space and walk of life, including science. And those are,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.440
those are no good. But yes, you're right. The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:42.240
That said, for difficult questions, for difficult rare explanations for rare phenomena,

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:51.280
you have to walk cautiously. Because the scientific method, when you totally don't

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.320
understand something, and it's rare, and you can't replicate it, doesn't quite apply.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. I agree with you. The challenge is to, is to not dismiss the anomaly

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.640
because you can't replicate it. I mean, we can talk about this. This is something I realized when

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:15.680
we were developing assembly theory. People think in the track they're on is so dogmatic,

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.160
but there is this thing that they see, but they don't see. And it takes a bit of time,

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.720
and you just have to keep reframing it. And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.320
You know, why, why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life? I mean, who said,

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:36.480
was there, you know, does RNA have a special, special class of, of information that's encoded

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.640
in the universe? No, of course it doesn't, right? You know, RNA is not a special molecule

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:45.200
within the space of all the other molecules. But it's so elegant and simple of, and it works

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.280
so well for the evolution process that we kind of use that as an intuition to explain that

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:55.440
that must be the only way to have life. Sure. But you mentioned assembly theory. Well, first

01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:02.400
let me pause. Bathroom break needed? Yeah, let's take two minutes. We took a quick break and offline

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:10.320
you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home. And then I said that you're basically

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.280
Rick from Rick and Morty, which is something I've been thinking this whole conversation.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:23.120
And then you say that there's a glowing pickle that you used something involving cold plasma,

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.000
I believe, I don't know, but can you explain the glowing pickle situation?

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.280
And is there many arbitrarily many versions of you in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:44.640
I tried to make an electrochemical memory in at home using a, and the only way, using a pickle,

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.080
the only way I could get any traction with it was actually by plugging it into a very high

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.480
voltage alternating current and then putting in a couple of electrodes. But my kids weren't

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.160
impressed. They're not impressed with anything I do, any experiments I do at home, I think it's

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.160
quite funny. But you connected that pickle to some electro, I mean, you... To 240 volts,

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.840
yeah, AC. Yeah. And then had a couple of electrodes on it. So what happens is a pickle,

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.400
this is a classic thing you do. I mean, I shouldn't, pranks you do, you put a pickle

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:17.520
into the mains and just leave it, run away and leave it. And what happens is it starts to decompose,

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.640
it heats up and then explodes because the water turns to steam and it just violently explodes.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.280
But I wondered if I could cause the iron, sodium potassium ions in the pickle to migrate,

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.880
it'd been in a jar, right? So it'd been in a brine. That was, yeah, that was not my,

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.880
that was not my best experiment. So I've been far better experiments in my lab at home.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.840
At that time it was a failed experiment, but you never know. It could,

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.840
every experiment is a successful experiment if you stick with it long enough.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.920
Well, I mean, I get, I got kicked out of my own lab by my research team many years ago,

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.200
and for good reason. I mean, my team is brilliant and I used to go in and just break things.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.360
So what I do do at home is I have a kind of electronics workshop

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:05.200
and I prototype experiments there. Then I try and, then I try and suggest to my team sometimes,

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.360
maybe we can try this thing. And they would just say, oh, wow, that's not going to work

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.520
because of this. And I'll say, aha, but actually I've tried and here's some code and here's some

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.200
hard work and we have a go. So that I'm doing that less and less now as I get even more busy.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.160
But that's quite fun because then they feel that we're in the, you know, in the experiment together.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.200
You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick from Rick and Morty,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:40.080
connects up chemistry with computation. So sort of, and when we say chemistry,

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:47.840
we don't mean the simulation of chemistry or modeling of chemistry. We mean chemistry in

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:54.080
the physical space as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating. We'll talk about that.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.080
But first, you mentioned assembly theory. So we'll stick on theory and these big ideas.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:07.200
I would say revolutionary ideas. There's an intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:14.480
What is assembly theory? And generally speaking, how would we recognize life if we saw it?

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.640
So assembly theory is a theory. It goes back a few years now and my struggle for maybe almost

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.680
10 years when I was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:32.000
where I thought that everybody was dancing around the problem of what life is and what it does.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:36.560
But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is because I think it's easier. So assembly theory

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:42.560
literally says if you take an object, any given object, and you are able to break the object

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:48.880
into parts very gently, so just maybe let's say take a piece of very intricate Chinese porcelain

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.160
and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point and it will fragment into many parts.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.400
And if that object is able to fragment into many and you count those parts, the different parts,

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:07.120
so they're unsymmetrical. Assembly theory says the larger the number of parts,

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.720
unsymmetrical parts that object has, the more likely it is that object has been created by an

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:20.160
evolutionary or information process, especially if that object is not one-off, you've got an

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:26.320
abundance of them. And that's really important. Because what I'm literally saying about the

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:32.080
abundance, if you have a one-off object and you break it into parts and it has lots of parts,

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:38.960
you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate and complex, but it could be just random.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.480
And I was troubled with this for years because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:50.320
But when I talked to very good computational complexity computation lists, algorithmic

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.720
complexity people, they said, you haven't really done this properly, you haven't thought about it.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:30:00.800
It's like this is the random problem. And so I kept working this up because I invented an

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:06.400
assembly theory in chemistry, first of all, with molecules. And so the thought experiment was

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:12.240
how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it, that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.600
probabilistically. And if I found this molecule able to detect enough quantities in the same

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.000
object, like a machine, like a mass spectrometer, so typically in a mass spectrometer, you weigh

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.400
the molecules in electric field, you probably have to have the order of 10,000 identical molecules

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:33.440
to get a signal. So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex, what is the chance of them

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.360
occurring by chance? Well, we can do the math. Let's take a molecule like Strickneen or

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:47.360
yeah, so Strickneen is a good molecule actually to take. Or Viagra is a good molecule. I made jokes

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.160
about Viagra because it's complex molecule. And one of my friends said, if we find Viagra on Mars

01:30:52.160 --> 01:31:00.080
in detectable quantities, we know something is up. But anyway, it's a complex molecule.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.680
So what you do is you take this molecule in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:09.440
or in electric field, it breaks apart. And if the larger than the larger the number of different

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:14.640
parts you know, when it starts to get refresh old, my idea was that that molecule could not be

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:20.480
created by chance, probabilistically. So that was where assembly thought theory was born in an

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:25.440
experiment in a mass spec experiment. And I was thinking about this because NASA sending mass

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.720
spectrometers to Mars to Titan is going to send them to Europa. There's going to be a nuclear

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.760
powered mass spectrometer going to Titan. I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:40.240
They're not only sending a drone that's going to fly around Titan, it's going to be powered by a

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.920
nuclear slug, a nuclear battery, and it's going to have a mass spectrometer on it.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:51.120
Is this already launched? No, it's Dragonfly and it's going to be launched in a few years. I think

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.800
it got pushed a year because of the pandemic. So I think it's three or four years.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:01.680
Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan and collect

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.520
data about the composition of the various chemicals on Titan.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.320
Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA, I don't know if I'll be able to convince the Dragonfly team

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.200
that they should apply this approach, but they will get data and depending on how good their

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.520
mass spectrometer is. But I had this thought experiment anyway and I did this thought experiment

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.920
and for me it seemed to work. I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm in assembly theory

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.720
and I basically, assembly theory, if I take, let's just make it generic and let's just take the word

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:41.280
abracadabra. So can I, if you find the word, so if you have a book with lots of words in it and you

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:46.560
find abracadabra one off and there's a wrap book that's been written by, in a random way, you know,

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.400
set of monkeys in a room and you untype writers and you find one off abracadabra no big deal.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.360
But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra, well, that means something weird is going on.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.240
But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra. So abracadabra has a,

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.800
you know, has a number of letters in it, you can break it down, so you just cut the letters up.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.760
But when you actually reassemble abracadabra, the minimum number of weights of organizing

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:18.800
those letters, so you'd have an A, a B, you know, and keep going up. There's just the, you can,

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.920
when you cut abracadabra up into parts, you can put it together again in seven steps.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.160
So what does that mean? That means if you basically don't read, you're allowed to reuse

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.960
things you make in a chain at the beginning. That's the memory of the universe, the process

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:38.480
that makes abracadabra. And because that calls all chain, you can then get to abracadabra

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.240
quicker than the number of letters we're having to specify only in seven.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:48.720
So if you take that to a molecule and you cut the molecule up into parts, and you can,

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.560
on the causal chain, and you basically start with the atoms and then bonds,

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:58.000
and then you randomly add on those parts to make the A, make the B, make the, and keep going all

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.240
the way up, I found that literally a assembly theory allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:10.960
So when there's some information in there, and I realized the assembly theory isn't just

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.840
confined to molecular space, it can apply to anything, but let me finish the molecular argument.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:22.000
So what I did is I had this theory, I was one of my students, we wrote an algorithm,

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.520
we basically took the 20 million molecules from the database and we just calculate their assembly

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.280
number, and that's the index. Like basically, if I take a molecule and I cut it up into bonds,

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:39.680
what is the minimum number of steps I need to take to reform that molecule from atoms?

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.760
So reusability of previously formed things is somehow fundamental.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.080
Exactly. So it's like a memory in the universe, right? I'm making lots of leaps here, like,

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.400
it's kind of weird. I'm saying, right, there's a process that can form the A and the B and the C,

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.200
let's say, and then there's, and because we've formed A and B before, we can use A and B again

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.480
with no extra cost except one unit. So that's the kind of the chain of events.

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.560
And that's how you think about memory here when you say the universe, when you talk about the

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.840
universe and or life is the universe creating memory.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:16.800
Exactly. So we went through chemical space and we looked at the assembly numbers,

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.720
we were able to classify it, said, okay, let's test it, let's go. So we're able to take a whole

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:30.160
bunch of molecules and assign an assembly index to them. And it's just a function of the number

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:35.760
of bonds in the molecule and how much symmetry. So literally, assembly theory is a measure of how

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.800
little symmetry a molecule has. So the more asymmetry, the more information, the more

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.960
weird it is, like a Jackson Pollock of some description. So I then went and did a load

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.280
of experiments. And I basically took those molecules, I cut them up in the mass spec and

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.400
measured the number of peaks without any knowledge of the molecule. And we found the assembly number

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.320
there was a almost, not quite a one to one correlation, but almost because not all bonds

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:06.960
are equal, they have different energies. I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques,

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.680
NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules and

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.200
get a signature out. And they also used infrared. And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:25.040
correlation. So what am I saying? Saying by taking a molecule and doing either infrared or NMR or mass

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:31.280
spec, I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule, and then put it on a scale.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:39.120
And what we did in the next part of the work is we took molecules randomly from the environment,

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.560
from outer space, from all around Earth, from the sea, from Antarctica, and from fossils,

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.960
and so on. And even NASA, and they, because they didn't believe us, blinded some samples.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:59.200
And we found that all these samples that came from biology produced molecules that had a

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:05.760
very high assembly number above a threshold of about 15. So basically, all the stuff that came

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.600
from my ebiotic origin was low. There was no complexity there. So we suddenly realized that

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:17.520
on Earth, at least, there is a cutoff that natural phenomena cannot produce molecules

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:24.400
that need more than 15 steps to make them. So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:31.520
life, a scale of technology as well. And literally, you could just go sniffing for molecules off Earth

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.400
on Titan, on Mars. And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer that gives you more than

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:43.760
15 parts, you'll know pretty much for sure that it had to be produced by evolution. And this allowed

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.320
me to come up with a general definition of life based on assembly theory, to say that if I find an

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:57.440
object that has a large number of parts, say an iPhone, or Boeing 747, or any complex object,

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:03.280
and I can find it in abundance and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced by

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.240
an informational process or not. And that's what assembly theory kind of does. But it goes a bit

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:15.200
further. I then realized that this isn't just about life, it's about causation. So actually,

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.560
it tells you about where there's a causal structure. So now I can look at objects in the

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.480
universe, say that again, this cup, and say, right, I'm going to look at how many independent parts

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.320
it has. So that's the assembly number. I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups are two on

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:34.160
this table, maybe there's a few more you got snatched away. So assembly is a is a function of

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.840
the complexity of the object times the number of copy numbers of that object or function of the

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:45.600
copy number normalized. So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe, you have energy,

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:52.640
entropy, and assembly. So assembly, the way we should think about that is how much

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:59.200
reusability there is. Because what reusability is like the like, can you play devil's advocate

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:11.440
to this? Or could this just be a nice tertiary signal for living organisms? Like some kind of

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.560
distant signal that's, yeah, this is a nice property, but it's not capturing something

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.760
fundamental. Or do you think reusability is something fundamental to the life in complex

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:27.040
organisms? I think reusability is fundamental in the universe, not just for life in complex

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.040
organisms is about causation. So I think assembly tells you if you find objects, because you can

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.880
do this with trajectories as well, you think about it that in the unit, the fact there are objects

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:45.280
in the universe on earth is my is weird. You think about it, we should just have a

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:52.560
commentary explosion of stuff. The fact that not everything exists is is really weird.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:40:00.560
Yeah. And then as I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles, and the things that exist

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:10.640
are similar and multiply in copies. So I would say that assembly allows you to do something

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:16.160
that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy have got stuck with for a while.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:20.800
So I'm making, it's pretty bold. I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker on this at the

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.280
moment. And we're realizing we don't want to get ahead of ourselves because I think that

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:31.680
there's lots of ways where this is, you know, it's a really interesting idea. It works for molecules,

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.320
and it appears to work for any objects produced by causation. Because you can take a motor car,

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.120
you can look at the assembly of the motor car, look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.640
Assembly theory tells you there's a way of compressing and reusing. And so when people,

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.360
I talk to information theorists, they say, oh, this is just logical depth. I say it is

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.560
like logical depth, but it's experimentally measurable. They say, oh, it's a bit like

01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.000
Comma Golarov complexity. I say, but it's computable. And now, okay, it's not infinitely

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.320
computable, gets NP hard very quickly, right? It's very hard problem when you get, but it's

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.720
a computable enough, you contractible enough to be able to tell the difference between a

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:15.600
molecule that's been formed by the random background and by causation. And, and I think that that's

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.800
really interesting because until now, there's no way of measuring complexity objectively.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:29.680
Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons and programs and human beings to label things.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:35.840
Assembly is label free. Well, not entirely, we can talk about what that means in a minute.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.920
Okay. My brain has been broken a couple of times here.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.440
Sorry, I explained it really badly.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.520
No, it was very well explained. It was just fascinating. And it's a,

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:57.360
my brain is broken into pieces and I'm trying to assemble it. So NP hard. So when you have a molecule,

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.840
you're trying to figure out, okay, if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:13.120
which parts can we reuse to as an optimization problem and be hard to figure out the minimum

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:19.600
amount of reused components that will create this molecule. And it becomes difficult when you start

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:25.520
to look at a huge, huge molecules arbitrarily large. Cause I'm also like mapping this. Can I,

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:30.880
can I think about this in complexity generally, like looking at a cellular automata system and

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:37.200
saying like, what's the, what can this be used as a measure of complexity for like a arbitrarily

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.360
complicated system? Yeah, I think it can. It can. And I think that the question is, and what's the

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.560
benefit? Cause there's plenty of, I mean, in computer science and mathematics and physics,

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.760
people have been really seriously studying complexity for a long time. And I think there's

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:59.280
a really interesting problems of where we course grade and we lose information. And all assembly

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.800
theory does really assembly theory just explains weak emergence. And, and so what assembly theory

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:10.320
says, look, going from the atoms into atoms interact, those first replicators that build

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:16.400
one another assembly at the, the minimal level just tells you evidence that there's been replication

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:23.360
and selection. And I think the more selected something is the higher the assembly. And so

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:28.320
we were able to start to know how to look for selection in the universe. If you go to the moon,

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.160
there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon, except the human artifacts we've left there.

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:39.520
So again, let's go back to the sandbox. In assembly theory says, if all the sand grains could stick

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:44.080
together, that's the infinite convent or explosion in the universe, that should be the default.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:50.320
We don't have that. Now let's assemble sand grains together and let's, and do them in every

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:56.080
possible way. So we have a series of minimal operations that can move the sand together.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:00.000
But all that doesn't exist either. Now, because we have specific memory where we say, well,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.920
we're going to put three sand grains in a line or four, make a cross or a triangle,

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.440
or something unsymmetrical. And once we've made the triangle and the unsymmetrical thing,

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.840
we remember that we can use it again, because on that causal chain. So what assembly theory

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.640
allows you to do is go to the actual objects that you exist, you find in space. And actually,

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:22.960
the way you get there is by disassembling it says disassembly theory works by disassembling

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:30.080
objects you have and understanding the steps to create them. And it works for molecules beautifully

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.800
because you just break bonds. But like you said, it's going to be very difficult. It's a difficult

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.560
problem to figure out how to break them apart. For molecules, it's easy. If you just keep low

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:44.480
enough in molecular weight space, it's good enough. So it's a complete theory. When we start to think

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:49.040
about objects, we can start to assign, we can start to think about things at different levels,

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:54.560
what do you assign as your atom? So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing,

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:59.600
because word atom, I mean smallest breakable part. So in a molecule, the atom is the bond,

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:06.080
because you break bonds, not atoms, right? So in a car, the atom might be, I don't know,

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:13.440
a small amount of iron, or the smallest reusable part, a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.680
So you've got to be really careful in a micro process of the atoms might be transistors.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:26.560
And so the amount of assembly is something as a function, you have to look at the atom level.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.160
What are your parts? What are you counting? That's one of the things you get to choose.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.600
What is, at what scale is the atom? What is the minimal exact thing? I mean, there's a huge

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.720
amount of trade-offs in when you approach a system and try to analyze. Like if you approach earth,

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:45.680
you know, an alien civilization, try to study earth, what is the atom for trying to measure

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:52.720
the complexity of life? Are humans the atoms? I would say to start with, you just use molecules.

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.520
I can say for sure, if there are molecules of sufficient complexity on earth,

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.600
then I know that life has made them. And you can go further and show technology. There are

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:07.120
molecules that exist on earth that are not possible even by biology. You needed technology

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.360
and you needed microprocessors to get there. So that's really cool.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:18.480
And there's a correlation between the coolness of that and assembly number,

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.520
whatever the measure, what would you call the measure?

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:27.040
Assembly index. So there are three kind of fundamental kind of labels we have. So there's

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:32.480
the quantity of assembly and the assembly, so if you have a box, let's just have a box of molecules.

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.480
So I'm going to have my box, we count the number of identical molecules,

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:42.320
and then we chop each molecule up in a individual molecule class and calculate assembly number.

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:49.360
So basically, you then have a function that sums over all the molecules for each assembly,

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.160
and then you divide through. So you make it divide through by the number of molecules.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.160
So that's the assembly index for the box.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.600
So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box. So basically,

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.160
the assembly equation we come up with is basically the sum of e to the power of the assembly index

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:11.360
for molecule i times the number of copies of the molecule i, and then you normalize.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.680
So you sum them all up and then normalize. So some boxes are going to be more assembled than others.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.880
Yeah, that's what they tell me. So if you were to look at me as a box, say I'm a box,

01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:28.160
am I assembling my parts in terms of like, how do you know what's my assembly index and be gentle?

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.120
So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you. So let's just take a pile of sand the same

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:41.840
weight as you, and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules. I mean, and look at the

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.160
number of copies and assembly number. So in sand, let's say there's probably going to be nothing

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.720
more than the assembly number of two or three, but there might be trillions and trillions of

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.000
sand grains in your body, there might be, the assembly number is going to be higher,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.560
but there might not be as quite as many copies because the molecular weight is higher.

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:04.320
So you do want to average it out. You can average. You do average it.

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.120
I'm not, I'm not defined by the most impressive. No, no, you're an average in your volume. I mean,

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:14.000
we're just working this out. But what's really cool is that you're going to have a really high

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.080
assembly. The sand will have a very low assembly. Your causal power is much higher. You get to make

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:25.920
decisions. You're alive. You're aspiring assembly says something about causal power in the universe.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:33.040
And that's not supposed to exist because physicists don't accept that causation exists at the bottom.

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:38.480
So I understand at the chemical level why the assembly is causation. Why is it causation?

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.080
Because it's capturing the memory. Exactly. It's capturing memory, but there's not an

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:53.840
action to it. So I'm trying to see how it leads to life. Well, it's what life does. So I think it's,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.080
we don't know. That's a good question. What is life versus what does life do?

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.760
Yeah. So that's, this is the definition of life, the only definition we need.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.040
The assembly.

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:13.920
It's basically that life is able to create objects in abundance that are so complex.

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:19.360
Your semi-number is so high, they can't possibly form in an environment where there's just random

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:26.480
interactions. So suddenly you can put life on a scale and then life doesn't exist actually

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:34.240
in that kind. It's just how evolved you are. And you as an object, because you have incredible

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:46.000
causal power, you could go and launch rockets or build cars or create drugs or you can do so many

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.400
things. You can build stuff, build more artifacts that show that you have had causal power. And

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:59.040
that causal power was this kind of a lineage. And I think that over time, I mean, realizing that

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:06.080
that physics as a discipline has a number of problems associated with me as a chemist is kind

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:11.680
of interesting that assembly theory, and I'm really, you know, I want to maintain some,

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:15.680
some credibility in the physics side, but I have to push them because physics

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.520
is a really good discipline. It's reduced the number. Physics is about reducing the belief

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.480
system, but they're down to some things in their belief system, which is kind of really makes me

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.040
kind of grumpy. Number one is requiring order at the beginning of the universe magically. We

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.840
don't need that. The second is the second law. Well, we don't actually need that.

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:43.280
And this is blasphemous. In a minute, I'll recover my career in a second, although I think the good,

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.320
the only good thing about being in the religious chair means I think there has to be an active

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:55.600
parliament to fire me. Yeah. But you can always go to least Twitter and protest.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.440
And I think the third thing is that, so we've got, you know, we've got the order at the beginning.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.840
Second law. Yeah, the second law, and the fact that causation is emergent,

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.880
right? And that time is emergent. John Carroll just turned off this program.

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:15.440
I think he believes that it's emergent. So causation is not...

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:21.280
That's clearly incorrect, because we wouldn't exist otherwise. So time, so physicists have kind

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:27.040
of got confused about time. Time is a real thing. Well, I mean, so look,

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.880
I'm very happy with the current description of the universe as physicists give me, because I

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.960
can do a lot of stuff, right? I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think, and I can

01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:43.200
understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity. And so, and I can build transistors with quantum

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.520
mechanics, right? And I can do all this stuff. So I'm not saying the physics is wrong. I'm just

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.640
saying, if we say that time is fundamental, i.e. time is non-negotiable, there's a global clock,

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:59.680
I don't need to, I don't need to require that there's order being magically made in the past,

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:02.960
because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:09.360
So if time is fundamental, I mean, you've been referring to this kind of

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:17.520
an interesting formulation of that as memory. Yeah. So time, time is hard to like put a

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:22.880
finger on like, what the hell are we talking about? Well, it's just a direction, but memory

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:28.960
is a construction, especially when you have like, think about these local pockets of complexity,

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:36.000
these non-zero assembly index entities that's being constructed, and they remember,

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:41.600
never forget molecules. But remember, the thing is, I invented assembly theory.

01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:47.120
I'll tell you I invented it. When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is, I keep making fun of myself

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:52.240
to my search group. I've only ever had one idea. I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:57.200
so since I had that idea. Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had? So it's very kind of

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:04.400
hierarchical. Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry. That's very poetic. So I think I came up with assembly

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:09.840
theory the following idea. When I was a kid, I was obsessed about survival kits. What is the

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:15.520
minimum stuff that I would need to basically replicate my reality? And I love computers,

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.240
and I love technology or what technology was going to come. So I imagined that I would have

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:24.880
basically this really big truck full of stuff. And I thought, well, can I delete some of that

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.360
stuff out? Can I have a blueprint? And then in the end, I kept making this, making it smaller,

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.960
I got to maybe a half a truck, then to a suitcase. And then I went, okay, screw it. I want to carry

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:40.640
my entire technology in my pocket. How do I do it? And I'm not like going to launch into Steve,

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:46.960
Joel B, and you know, I play. I came up with a matchbox survival kit. In that matchbox survival

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:51.440
kit, I would have the minimum stuff that would allow me to interact the environment to build

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:57.920
my shelter, to build a fishing rod, to build a water purification system. And it's kind of like,

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:03.680
so what did I use in my box to assemble in the environment to assemble, to assemble, to assemble.

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:09.440
And I realized I could make a causal chain in my survival kit. So I guess that's probably why

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:16.240
I've been obsessed with assembly theory for so long. And I was just pre-configured to find it

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:22.880
somewhere. And when I saw it in molecules, I realized that the causal structure that we say

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:28.800
emerges, and the physics kind of gets really stuck, because they're saying that time, you can go

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.920
backwards in time. I mean, how do we let physicists get away with the notion that we can go back in

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:43.360
time and meet ourselves? I mean, that's clearly a very hard thing to allow. The physicists would not

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:50.000
let other sciences get away with that kind of heresy, right? So why are physicists allowed to

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.160
get away with it? So first of all, to push back, to play devil's advocate, you are clearly married

01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:03.920
to the idea of memory. You see in this, again, Rick from Rick and Morty Way, you have these

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:10.160
deep dreams of the universe that is writing the story through its memories, through its chemical

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:15.040
compounds that are just building on top of each other. And then they find useful components that

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:21.680
can reuse. And then their reused components create systems that themselves are then reused.

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:29.600
And all in this way construct things. But when you think of that as memory, it seems like quite

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:35.360
sad that you can walk that back. But at the same time, it feels like that memory, you can walk in

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.320
both directions on that memory in terms of time. You could walk in both directions. But I don't

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:50.480
think that that makes any sense. Because the problem that I have with time being reversible is that

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.840
I mean, I'm just a, you know, I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right? So I love burning

01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:01.040
stuff, you know, burning stuff and building stuff. But when I think of reversible phenomena,

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:06.720
I imagine in my head, I have to actually manufacture some time. I have to borrow time from the

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.320
universe to do that. I can't, when anyone says let's imagine that we can go back in time or

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.880
reversibility, you can't do that. You can't step out of time. Time is non-negotiable. It's happening.

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:23.120
No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental, which most of us do when we go

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.960
day to day, but it takes a leap of wild imagination to think that time is emergent.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.000
No, time is not emergent. Yeah. I mean, this is an argument we can have, but I believe

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.800
I can come up with an experiment. An experiment that proves that time cannot possibly be emergent.

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:46.480
Experiment that shows how assembly theory kind of is the way that the universe

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.720
produces selection and that selection gives rise to life. And also to say, well, hang on,

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.480
we could allow ourselves to have a theory that requires us to have these statements to be possible.

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:05.040
Like we need to have order in the past, or we can have used the past hypothesis,

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:13.120
which is order in the past as well. And we have to have an arrow of time. We have to

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:19.840
require that entropy increases. And then we can say, look, the universe is completely closed

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:25.280
and there's no novelty, or that novelty is predetermined. What I'm saying is very, very

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:31.040
important that time is fundamental, which means if you think about it, the universe becomes

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:34.960
more and more novel each step, it generates, there's more states in the next step than it was

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:40.160
before. So that means bigger search. So what I'm saying is that the universe wasn't capable of

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:47.200
consciousness at day one. Actually, because you didn't have enough states, but today the universe

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:52.400
is complex. So it's like, how? All right, all right, hold on a second. Now we've pissed off the

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:59.600
pants like it's two. Okay. No, that's brilliant. Sorry. A part of me is just joking, having fun

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.440
with this thing, but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff, and I'm trying to

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:08.720
slow it down before my brain explodes. So because I want to break apart some of the

01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:14.640
fascinating things you're saying. So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe,

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.400
because the number of states is increasing. What do you mean by states?

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.240
So I think the physicists almost got everything right. I can't fault them at all.

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.400
I just think there's a little bit of dog. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate. I'm very

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:31.200
happy to be entirely wrong on this, right? I'm not right on many things at all. But

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.200
but if I can make less assumptions about the universe with this, then potentially that's a

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:42.480
more powerful way of looking at things. If you think of time as fundamental, you can make less

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:46.960
assumptions overall. Exactly. The time is fundamental. I don't need to add on a magical

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:51.280
second law, because the second law comes out of the fact the universe is actually there's

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:55.440
more states available. I mean, we might even be able to do weird things like dark energy in the

01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.960
universe might actually just be time, right? Yeah, but then you have to still have to explain

01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:05.440
why time is fundamental, because I can give you one explanation that's simpler than time and say

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:12.160
God. Just because it's simple doesn't mean it's okay. You still have to explain

01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.960
God and you still have to explain time. Why is it fundamental? So let's just say existence is

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:22.640
default, which means time is the default. So how did you go from the existence to the

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:26.880
Well, look, we exist, right? So let's just take, be very

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:30.960
We're yet to talk about what exists mean. All right, let's go all the way back. Yeah, okay.

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:34.960
I think it's very poetic and beautiful what you're weaving into this. I don't think this

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:41.040
conversation is even about the assembly, which is fascinating. And we'll keep mentioning it

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:47.520
as an index and this idea that I don't think is necessarily connected to time. Oh, I think it

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.960
is deeply connected. I can't explain it yet. So you don't think everything you've said about

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:58.640
assembly theory and assembly index can still be correct even if time is emergent?

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:03.520
So yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work, I appear to be able to measure

02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.880
objects of high assembly in a mass spectrum and look at their abundance and you know,

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:11.840
all that's fine, right? It's a nice, if nothing else, it's a nice way of looking at how molecules

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:17.760
can compress things. Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental or not emergent for

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:24.640
assembly theory to work? No, I think I'm saying that the universe, it appears that the universe

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:28.240
has many different ways of using time, you could have three different types of time,

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:31.920
you could just have time that's the way I would think of it. If you want, if you want to hold

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.640
on to emergent time, I think that's fine. Let's do that for a second. Hold on to emergent time.

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.600
And the universe is just doing its thing. Then assembly time only exists when the

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.520
universe starts to write memories through bonds. So let's just say there's rocks running around,

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:52.160
you know, there's, when the bond happens and selection starts, suddenly there are,

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:57.280
the universe is remembering cause in the past. And those structures will have effects in the

02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.880
future. So suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point, which has a direction. And I think

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.520
Sean Carroll at this point might even turn the podcast back on and go, okay, I can deal with

02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.440
that. That's fine. But I'm just basically trying to condense the conversation and say, hey,

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:15.280
let's just have time fundamental and see how that screws with people's minds. Why-

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:18.080
You're triggering people by saying fundamental. Why not?

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.760
Well, why not? Let's say-

02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.160
Why am I, look, I'm walking through the wall. Why, why, why should I grow up in a world where time,

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.280
I don't go back in time. I don't meet myself in the past. There are no one,

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.160
there are no aliens coming from the future. Right?

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:35.520
But, you know, it's just like-

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.440
No, no, no. But that's not, no, no, no, hold on a second. That's like saying,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.600
we're talking about biology or like evolutionary psychology and you're saying, okay, let's just

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:50.560
assume that that clothing is fundamental. People wearing clothes is fundamental. It's like, no,

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:56.480
no, no, wait a minute. You can't, like, I think you're getting in a lot of trouble if you assume

02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.520
time is fundamental.

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.880
Why? Give me one reason why I'm getting into trouble time being fundamental.

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:08.560
Because you might not understand the origins of this memory that might be deeper. Like that,

02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.760
this memory, that could be a thing that's explaining the construction of these

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:24.080
higher complexities better than just saying it's a search. It's chemicals doing a search for

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:32.240
reusable, reusable structures that they can, like, then use as bricks to build the house.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:37.120
Okay. So, I accept that. So, let's go back a second because it's a kind of,

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.080
it is, I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part because I think we can carry on discussing it

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:50.080
for many, many, many, many, many, many days, many months. But I'm happy to accept that it might be

02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.200
wrong. But what I would like to do is imagine a universe where time is fundamental and time is

02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:02.720
emergent and ask, let's just then talk about causation. Because physicists require that causation.

02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:08.320
So, this is where I'm going to go. Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the micro scale.

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:12.800
Well, that clearly is wrong. Because if causation has to emerge at the macro scale, life cannot

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:18.240
emerge. So, how does life emerge? Life requires molecules to bump into each other, produce

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:23.200
replicators. Those replicators need to produce polymers. There needs to be cause and effect at

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:30.080
the molecular level. There needs to be a non-agirdic to an agirdic transition at some point. And

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:38.880
those replicators have material consequence in the universe. Physicists just say, oh,

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.680
you know what? I'm going to have a bunch of particles in the box. I'm going to think about it

02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:49.040
in a Newtonian way, in a quantum way. And I'll add on a narrow time so I can label things.

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:53.360
And causation will happen magically later. Well, how? Explain causation.

02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:00.000
And they can't. The only way I can reconcile causation is having a fundamental time,

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:04.560
because this allows me to have a deterministic universe that creates novelty.

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.240
And there's so many things from unpack here. But let's go back to the point. You said,

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:15.680
can assembly theory work with immersion time? Sure, it can. But it doesn't give me a deep

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:22.960
satisfaction about how causation and assembly gives rise to these objects that move through

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:29.200
time and space. And again, what am I saying? To bring it back, I can say without fear,

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:33.840
take this water bottle and look at this water bottle and look at the features on it, this writing,

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:39.120
you've got a load of them. I know that causal structures gave rise to this. In fact,

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.320
I'm not looking at just one water bottle here, I'm looking at every water bottle that's ever

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:48.240
been conceived of by humanity. This here is a special object. In fact, Leibniz knew this.

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:53.920
You know, Leibniz, who was at the same time of Newton, he kind of got stuck. I think Leibniz

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:58.880
actually invented assembly theory. You gave soul. The soul that you see in objects wasn't

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:04.240
the mystical soul, it is assembly. It is the fact there's been a history of objects related. And

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:10.720
without the object in the past, this object wouldn't exist. There is a lineage and there is

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:14.480
conserved structures, causal structures have given rise to those.

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.880
Fair enough. And you're saying it's just a simpler view with time is fundamental.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:27.600
And it shakes the physicist's cage a bit, right? I'm going to say, but I think that...

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.400
I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:38.240
I think that, I mean, I would say that, you know, Lee Smolin, I don't want to speak for Lee. I'm

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:43.600
talking to Lee about this. I think Lee also is an agreement that time has to be fundamental.

02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:48.320
But I think he goes further. You know, even in space, I don't think you can go back to the same

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:53.440
place in space. I've been to Austin a few times now. This is my, I think third time I've been to

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:58.080
Austin. Is Austin in the same place? No. The solar system is moving through space.

02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:05.920
I'm not going back in the same space. Locally, I am. Every event in the universe is unique.

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:13.920
In space. And time. And time. Doesn't mean we can't go back though. I mean,

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:19.920
you know, I mean, let's just, you know, rest this conversation, which was beautiful,

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:25.040
with a quote from the Rolling Stones that you can't always get what you want,

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:30.000
which is you want time to be fundamental. But if you try, you'll get what you need,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:37.120
which is assembly theory. Okay, let me ask you about, continue talking about complexity and

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:44.720
to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours that you're developing and I'm sure will continue

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:53.520
developing both in the lab and in theory. Yeah, it's, can't be said enough, just the ideas you're

02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:57.920
playing with it in your head are just, and we've been talking about it just beautiful.

02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:00.320
So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:09.840
maybe in an admiring romantic way, how does complexity emerge from simple rules? The why,

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:16.880
the how? Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there. I would say that the problem I have

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:21.280
right now is, I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well. The problem is I have this hammer

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:27.360
called assembly and everything I see is a nail. So now let's just apply it to all sorts of things.

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:30.720
We take the Bernard instability, the Bernard instability is you have oil,

02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:37.360
if you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan, when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns.

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:45.600
Take the formation of snowflakes, right? Take the emergence of a tropical storm

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:50.000
or the storm on Jupiter. When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:57.600
what they're saying is, let's take this collection of objects that are correlated in some way and

02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:03.680
try and work out how many moving parts or how this got, how this exists. So what people have been

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:10.000
doing for a very long time is taking complexity and counting what they've lost, calculating the

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.360
entropy. And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly is entropy tells you how much you've

02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:21.040
lost. It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone. But if you embrace it, go the bottom up with

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:28.000
assembly, those states, and you then understand the causal chain that gives rise to the emergence.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:33.600
So what I think assembly will help us do is understand weak emergence at the very least

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:41.040
and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way. And I've been fascinated with

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:48.400
complexity theory for many years. I mean, as soon as I could, I learned of the Mandelbrot set

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:55.120
and I could just type it up in my computer and run it and just show it and see it unfold.

02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:02.080
It was just this mathematical reality that existed in front of me. I just found

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:08.400
incredible. But then I realized that actually we were cheating. We're putting in the boundary

02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.760
conditions all the time. We're putting in information. And so when people talk to me about

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:19.520
the complexity of things, I say, but relative what? How do you measure them? So my attempt,

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:25.920
my small attempt, naive attempt, because there's many greater minds than mine on the planet right

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.240
now thinking about this properly. And you've had some of them on the podcast, right? They're just

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:36.800
absolutely fantastic. But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat the way we would explore

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:45.200
algorithmic complexity using assembly. What's the minimum number of constraints we need

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:50.960
in our system for this to unfold? So whether it's like, you know, if you take some particles and put

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:56.320
them in a box, at a certain box size, you get quasi-crystallinity coming out, right?

02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:02.880
But that emergence, it's not magic. It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:10.000
So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see is a direct read of the constraints we put

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.480
in, but we just don't understand. So as I said earlier, to the poor origin of life chemists,

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.240
you know, origin of life is a scam, I would say lots of complexity calculation theories,

02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:25.440
a bit of a scam, because we put the constraints in, but we don't count them correctly. And I'm

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:31.840
wondering if- Oh, you're thinking and starting to drop as assembly theory, the assembly index is

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:37.840
a way to count to the constraints. Yes, that's it. That's all it is. So assembly theory doesn't lower

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:43.040
any of the importance of complexity theory, but it allows us to go across domains and start to

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.800
compare things, compare the complexity of a molecule of a microprocessor of the text you've

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:56.960
writing, of the music you may compose. You've tweeted, quote, assembly theory explains why

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:02.560
Nietzsche understood we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom. So we've applied

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:08.560
assembly theory to cellular automata in life and chemistry. What does Nietzsche have to do

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:14.800
with assembly? Oh, that gets me into free will and everything. So let me say that again, assembly

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:20.400
theory explains why Nietzsche understood we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom,

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:24.400
limited freedom, freedom I suppose is referring to the fact that there's constraints.

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:33.280
Or what is radical freedom? What is freedom? So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom,

02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:41.280
and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination. And Nietzsche understood that his

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:46.720
freedom was somewhat more limited. And it kind of takes me back to this computer game that I played

02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:53.280
when I was 10. So I think it's called Dragon's Lair. Do you know Dragon's Lair? I think I know

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.280
Dragon's Lair, yeah. Dragon's Lair, I knew I was being conned, right? Dragon's Lair, when you play

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:01.440
the game, you're lucky that you grew up in a basically procedurally generated world.

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:07.520
That was RPG a little bit. No, it's like, is it turn-based play? Was it? No. It was a role-playing

02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:12.480
game, but really good graphics, and one of the first laser discs. And when you actually flicked

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.640
the stick, it's like it was like a graphical adventure game with animation. And when I played

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.880
this game, you could get through the game in 12 minutes if you knew what you were doing

02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:26.160
without making mistakes. You just play the disc, play the disc, play the disc. So it was just

02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:32.320
about timing. And actually, it was a complete fraud because all the animation has been pre-recorded

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:38.160
on the disc. It's like the Black Mirror, the first interactive where they had all the several million

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:43.760
kind of permutations of the movie that you could select on Netflix. I've forgotten the name of it.

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:50.000
So this was exactly that in the laser disc. You basically go left, go right, fight the yoga,

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.720
slay the dragon. And when you flick the joystick at the right time, it just goes to the next

02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:00.080
animation to play. It's not really generating it. And I played that game and I knew I was being had.

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:08.400
Oh, okay. So to you, dragging there is the first time you realized that free will is an illusion?

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:16.640
Yeah. And why does assembly theory give you hints about free will, whether it's an illusion

02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:22.720
or not? Yeah, so no, so not entirely. I do think I have some will. And I think I am an agent. And

02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:27.200
I think I can interact and I can play around with the models I have of the world and the

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.360
cost functions, right? And I can hack my own cost functions, which means I have a little bit of

02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:36.560
free will. But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe, I don't think I could suddenly say,

02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.000
I mean, actually, this is ridiculous, because now I say I could try and do it, right? It's like,

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:45.760
I'm suddenly give up everything and become a rapper tomorrow, right? Maybe I could try that,

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:51.680
but I don't have sufficient agency to make that necessarily happen. I'm on a trajectory. So when

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:57.760
in Dragon's Lair, I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with, where Sartre

02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.800
realized he thought that he had no assembly, no memory, he could just leap across and do everything.

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.480
And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don't have full freedom, but I have some freedom.

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:14.080
And assembly theory basically says that says, if you have these constraints in your past,

02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:19.440
they limit what you were able to do in the future, but you can use them to do amazing things. Let's

02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:25.200
say I'm a poppy plant and I'm creating some opiates. The opiates are really interesting

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:29.680
molecules. I mean, they're obviously great for medicine, great cause, great problems in society.

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:36.560
But let's just imagine we fast forward a billion years, what will opiate the opioids look like

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:41.520
in a billion years? Well, we can guess because we can see how those proteins will evolve, and we can

02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:46.800
see how the secondary metabolites will change. And but they can't go radical, they can't, they

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.520
can't suddenly become, I don't know, like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display.

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.960
They will have some, they will be limited by their causal chain that produced them.

02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.120
And that's what I'm getting at, saying you're, we're predicted, we are

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:06.480
unpredictably predictable, or predictably unpredictable, predictably unpredictable

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:10.640
within a constraint on the trajectory we're on. Yeah, so the predictably part is the

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:15.440
is the constraints of the trajectory. And the unpredictable part is the part that you still

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:21.520
haven't really clarified the origin of, of the little bit of freedom. Yeah. So you're, you're

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:27.600
just arguing, you're basically saying that radical freedom is impossible. You're, you're really

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.680
operating in a world of constraints that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:38.480
of the chemistry that led to who you are. Okay. But, you know, even just a tiny bit of freedom,

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:48.240
even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages, if you can move around in that cage

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:54.880
a little bit, you're free. I agree. And so the question is in assembly theory,

02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.320
if we're thinking about free will, where does the little bit of freedom come from? What is the

02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:08.240
eye that can decide to be a rapper? What, why, what is that? That's a cute little

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:14.080
trick we've convinced each other of so we can do fun tricks at parties, or is there

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:18.080
something fundamental that allows us to feel free, to be free?

02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:23.120
I think that that's the question that I want to answer. I know you want to answer it.

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:28.720
And I think it's so profound. I'd let me have a go at it. I would say that I don't

02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:32.480
take the stance of Sam Harris, because I think Sam Harris, when he said, the way he says it is

02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:36.160
almost, it's really interesting. I'd love to talk to him about it. Sam Harris almost thinks

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:42.560
himself out of existence, right? Because do you know what I mean? Yeah, well, I mean, he has

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:47.520
different views on consciousness versus free will. I think he saves himself with consciousness. He

02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:52.240
thinks himself out of existence with free will. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I mean, there's no point,

02:16:52.240 --> 02:17:01.760
right? He's a leaf floating on a river. Yeah. I think that he, he's, I don't know, I'd love

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:05.600
to ask him whether he really believes that and then we could play some games. Oh, yeah. No, no,

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:09.920
I then would say, I'll get him to play a game of cards with me. And I'll work out the conditions

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.000
on which he says no. And then I'll get him to the conditions he says yes. And then I'll trap

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.720
him in his logical inconsistency with that argument. Because at some point, at some point,

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:24.800
when he loses enough money, or the prospect of losing enough money, there's a way of basically

02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:31.600
mapping out a series of, so what will is about, let's not call it free will, what will is about

02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.840
is to have a series of decisions equally weighted in front of you. And those decisions aren't

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.920
necessarily energy minimization. Those decisions are a function of the model you've made in your

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:50.800
mind, you're in your simulation, and the way you've interacted in reality, and also other

02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:57.360
interactions that you're having with other individuals and happenstance. And I think that

02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:04.240
there's a little bit of delay in time. So I think what you're able to do is say, well,

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:09.920
I'm going to do the counterfactual. I've done all of them. And I'm going to go this way.

02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:14.880
And you probably don't know why. I think free will is actually very complex interaction between

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:20.720
your unconscious and your conscious brain. And I think the reason why we're arguing about it

02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:28.000
is so interesting. And we just, some people outsource their free will to that unconscious brain.

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:33.680
And some people try and overthink the free will in the conscious brain. I would say that

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.480
Sam Harris has realized his conscious brain doesn't have free will, but his unconscious brain does.

02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:41.920
That's my guess, right? And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.

02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.320
And that's kind of annoying. And so he's just, he's going through meditation,

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:52.560
come to acceptance with that fact. Yeah. Which is maybe okay. But I do think that I have

02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.080
the ability to make decisions and I like my decisions. In fact, I mean, this is an argument I

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.720
have with some people that some days I feel I have no free will and it's just an illusion.

02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:08.320
And this is one, and it makes me more radical if you like, you know, as a,

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:13.520
I get to explore more of the state space and I'm like, I'm going to try and affect the world now.

02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:18.480
I'm really going to ask the question that maybe I dare not ask or dare not or do the thing I dare

02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:25.840
not do. And that allows me to kind of explore more. It's funny that if you truly accept that there's

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:36.320
no free will, that is a kind of radical freedom. It's funny, but you're, because the little bit

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:43.280
of the illusion in under that framework that you have that you can make choices, if choice is just

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:48.720
an illusion of psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want. That's the- But we don't, do we?

02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:53.520
And I think- But because you don't truly accept that you think that there's

02:19:53.840 --> 02:20:00.880
like, you think there's a choice, which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want.

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:04.560
Like you feel like there's some responsibility for making the wrong choice, which is why you

02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:11.120
don't do it. But if you truly accept that the choice has already been made, then you can go,

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:19.680
I don't know what is the most radical thing. I mean, but I don't, I wonder what,

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:26.080
what am I preventing myself from doing that I would really want to do? Probably like humor stuff,

02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:34.480
like I would, I would love to, if I could like save a game, do the thing, and then reload it later,

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:40.000
like do undo, it'd probably be humor, just to do something like super hilarious.

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:47.280
That's super embarrassing. And then just go, I mean, it's basically just fun. I would add more

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:54.480
fun to the world. I mean, I sometimes do that as I, you know, I sometimes, I try and, I try and

02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:59.360
mess up my reality in unusual ways by just doing things because I'm bored, but not bored. I'm

02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:03.440
not expressing this very well. I think that this is a really interesting problem that perhaps the

02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.240
hard sciences don't really understand that they are responsible for because the question about

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:13.040
how life emerged and how intelligence emerges and consciousness and free will, they're all

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:17.840
ultimately boiling down to some of the same mechanics, I think my feeling is that they are

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:24.560
the same problem again and again and again, the transition from a, you know, a, a boring world

02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:28.640
or a world in which there is no selection. So I wonder if free will has something to do with

02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:33.280
selection and models and, and also the models you're generating the brain and also your, the

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:37.280
amount of memory, a working memory have available at any one time to generate counterfactuals.

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:42.400
Well, that's fascinating. So like the decision making process is a kind of selection and that

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:48.160
that could be just absolutely yet another, yet another manifestation of the selection mechanism

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:52.320
that's pervasive throughout the universe. Okay. That's fascinating to think about.

02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:59.840
Yeah. There's not some kind of fundamental its own thing or something like that that is just

02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:06.240
yet another example of selection. Yeah. And in the universe that's intrinsically open,

02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:09.760
you want to do that because you generate novelty. You mentioned something about

02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:15.680
do cellular automata exist outside the human mind in our little offline conversation.

02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:21.280
Why is that an interesting question? So cellular automata complexity,

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:27.840
what's the relationship between complexity in the human mind and trees falling in the forest?

02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:34.240
Infrastructure. So the CA, so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman were doing

02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:38.160
CA, they were doing on paper. CA is cellular automata. Yeah. Just drawing them on paper.

02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:42.480
How awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata on paper. Yeah.

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:48.720
And then they were doing a computer that takes like forever to print out anything and program.

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:52.480
Sure. People are not with the TikTok kids these days with the TikTok,

02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:58.880
don't understand how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata arbitrarily changing the

02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:03.920
rules as you want to the initial conditions and see the beautiful patterns emerge,

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:07.440
sing with fractals, all of that. Oh, I've got to, you've just given me a brilliant idea.

02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:10.880
I wonder if there's a TikTok account that's just dedicated to putting out CA rules and

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:16.160
isn't, we should make one. 100%. And that will get millions of views.

02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:22.720
Millions, yes. No, it'll get dozens. Just have them running. So look, I kind of,

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:33.600
CA, I love CA's. Sorry. Yeah, no. We just have to make one. I actually, a few years ago,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.960
I made some robots that talked to each other, chemical robots that played the game of Hex,

02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:44.160
invented by John Nash by doing chemistry and they communicated via Twitter,

02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:48.880
which experiments they were doing. And they had a, they had a, they had a lookup table of

02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:52.800
experiments and robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10. The other robot, okay, I'll do

02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:57.840
experiment one then. And they communicated via Twitter and then. Publicly or GMs? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:01.360
Oh, can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:06.240
Yeah, so it's a basically a hexagonal board and you try and basically, you color each

02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:10.480
hexing, each element on the board at each hexagon and you try and get from one side to the other

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:14.480
and the other one tries to block you. We, how are they connected? So what are the robots?

02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:19.680
So it's a chemical. Yeah, let's go back. So the two robots, each robot was doing

02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:24.080
dye chemistry. So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red, green, blue.

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:29.360
And they could just choose from experiments to do red, green, blue. Initially, I said to my group,

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.720
we need to make two chemical robots that play chess. And my group were like,

02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:36.320
that's too hard. No, go away. But anyways, we had the robot.

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:46.000
People listening to this should probably know that Lee Cronin is an amazing group of brilliant

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:52.480
people. He's exceptionally well published. He's written a huge number of amazing papers. Whenever

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:59.360
he calls himself stupid and is a sign of humility. And I deeply respect that and

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:03.760
appreciate it. So people listening to this should know this is a, this is a world-class

02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:08.160
scientist who doesn't take himself seriously, which I really appreciate and love. Anywho,

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:17.600
talking about serious science, we're back to your group rejecting your idea of chemical robots

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:26.160
playing chess via dyes. So you went to a simpler game of hex. Okay. So what else?

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:31.040
The team that did it were brilliant. I really take the, I think they still have PTSD from

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.640
doing it. Cause I said, this is a workshop. What I'd often do is I have about 60 people on my team.

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.040
And occasionally before lockdown, I would say, I'm a bit bored. We're going to have a workshop

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.720
on something. Who wants to come? And they're basically about 20 people turn up to my office.

02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:49.360
And I say, we're going to do this mad thing. And then the, it would just self-organize. And

02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.680
some of them would say, no, I'm not doing this. And then you get, you get left with the happy

02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:58.000
dozen. And what we did is we built this robot and doing dye chemistry is really easy. You can

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.400
just take two molecules, react them together and change color. And what I wanted to do is have a

02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:07.040
palette of different molecules. You could react commentarily and get different colors. So you

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:12.720
got two robots. And I went, wouldn't it be cool if the robots basically shared the same list of

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:17.440
reactions to do? And they said, oh, I'm, and because of, then you could do a kind of multi-core

02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:21.920
chemistry, like they weren't, so you could have two chemical reactions going on at once. And

02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:26.640
they could basically outsource the problem. But they're sharing the same tape. Exactly. So robot

02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:29.520
one would say, I'm going to do, I'm going to do experiment one. And the other robot says,

02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:33.520
I'll do experiment a hundred. And then they could cross it off. But I wanted to make it.

02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:38.320
That's brilliant, by the way. That is genius. Sorry. Well, I wanted to make it groovier. And I

02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:44.480
said, look, let's have them competing to make, so playing a game of hex. And so when the robot

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:50.640
does a, it does an experiment, and the more blue the dye, the more it gets to the chart, the higher

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:55.600
chance it gets to make the move it wants on the hex board. So if it gets a red color is like it's

02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:00.160
gets down weighted in the other robot. And so what the robots could do is they play each player move.

02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:05.200
And because the fitness function or the optimization function was to make the color blue,

02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:12.000
they started to invent reactions we didn't weren't on the list. And they did this by not

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.960
cleaning, because we made cleaning optional. So when one robot realized if it didn't clean its

02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:20.880
pipes, it could get blue more quickly. And the other robot realized that. So it was like getting

02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:28.240
dirty as well. I didn't tell the consequences of super intelligence. Okay. But that was the game.

02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:32.160
And we communicate through Twitter, though, they were doing it through Twitter and Twitter

02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.280
bland them a couple of times. I said, come on, you've got a couple of robots doing chemistry.

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:39.280
It's really cool to stop banning them. But in the end, they had, we had to take them off Twitter

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.280
and they just communicated via a server, because it was just, there were people saying you can

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:48.080
still find it cronin lab one and cronin lab two on Twitter. And it was like make move, wait,

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:56.080
you know, mix A and B, wait 10 seconds, answer blue, you know, I really find it super compelling

02:27:56.080 --> 02:28:02.320
that you would have a chemical entity that's communicating with the world.

02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:06.480
That was one of the things I want to do in my origin of life reaction, right, is basically

02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:12.800
have a, have a reactor that's basically just randomly enumerating through chemical space

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:17.600
and have some kind of cycle. And then read out what the molecules reading out using a mass

02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:23.520
spectrometer, and then convert that to text and publish it on Twitter. And then wait until it says

02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:28.160
I'm alive. I reckon that would get, I reckon that that Twitter account will get a lot of

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:31.520
followers. Yeah. And I'm still trying to convince my group that we should just make an origin of

02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:36.320
life Twitter account where it's going blue and it's like, hello, testing. I'm here.

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:40.480
Well, I'll share it. I like it. I particularly enjoy this idea

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:49.200
of a non human entity communicating with the world via a human design social network. It's

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:56.960
quite a beautiful idea. How we were talking about

02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.960
CAs existing outside the human mind. Yeah. So I really admire Stephen Wolfram. I think he was

02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.160
a genius, clearly a genius. And trapped in is actually is like a problem with being so smart

02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:13.760
if you get trapped in your own, you know, mind, right? And I've, I try to actually, I try to

02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:16.880
convince Stephen that assembly theory wasn't nonsense. He was like, no, it's just nonsense.

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:21.280
I was a little bit sad by that. So nonsense applied, even if we applied to the simple

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:25.920
construct of a one dimensional cellular automata, for example. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean,

02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:30.560
actually, maybe I'm doing myself a bit too down. It was, it was, it was just as a theory was coming

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:34.960
through and I didn't really know how to explain it. But, but we are going to use assembly theory

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:40.320
and CAs instead of automata. But I'm, I wanted to, what I was really curious about is why

02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.440
people are marvel. I mean, you marvel at CAs and they're complex. And I said, well,

02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:49.040
hang on that complexity is baked in because if you play the game of life

02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:55.040
in a CA, you have to run it on a computer. You have to have a, you have to do a number of

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:59.760
operations put in the boundary conditions. So is it surprising that you get this structure out?

02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:05.920
Is it manufactured by the boundary conditions? And, and it is interesting because I think

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:13.040
cellular automata running them is teaching me something about what real numbers are and aren't.

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:17.520
And I haven't quite got there yet. I was playing on the aeroplane coming over. I'm just realized

02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:21.440
I have no idea what real numbers are really. And I was like, well, I do actually have some

02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:28.000
notion of what real numbers are. And I think thinking about real numbers as functions,

02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:32.800
rather than numbers is more appropriate. And then if you then apply that to CAs,

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:39.040
then you're saying, well, actually, why am I seeing this complexity in this, in this rule?

02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:44.560
Is it, is it, you know, is it, is it, you've got this deterministic system,

02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:50.640
and yet you get this incredible structure coming out? Well, isn't that what you'd get with any real

02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:56.480
number as you, as you apply it as a function, and you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary

02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:02.480
position? And I wonder if CAs are just helping me, well, my misunderstanding is CAs might be

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.960
helping me understand them in terms of real numbers. I don't know what you think.

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:13.520
Well, the function is, but the devil's in the function. Like, which is the function that's

02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:21.520
generating your real number? Like that, it seems like it's very important, the specific

02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:26.080
algorithm of that function, because some lead to something super trivial, some lead to something

02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:33.600
that's all chaotic, and some lead to things that are just walked that fine line of complexity.

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:39.120
Yeah, I think we agree. So let's take it back a second. So take the logistic map or something,

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:45.600
logistic equation, where you have this equation, which is, you don't, you don't know what's going

02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:49.680
to happen to n plus one. But once you've done n plus one, you know, full time, you can't predict it.

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:56.720
For me, CAs and logistic equation feel similar. And, and I think what's incredibly interesting,

02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:04.960
and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA, but also I'm saying, well,

02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:08.480
what is it about the boundary conditions and the way I'm running that calculation?

02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:13.440
So in my group, with my team, we actually made a chemical CA. We made Game of Life. We actually

02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:17.760
made a physical grid. I haven't been able to publish this paper. It's been trapped in purgatory

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:22.880
for a long time. But you wrote up a paper on how to do a chemical formulation of the game of life,

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:26.880
which we made a chemical computer and a little cells. And I was playing Game of Life.

02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:31.120
With the BZ reactions, each cell would pulse on and off, on and off, on and off.

02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:36.000
We have little stirra bars, and we have little gates. And we actually played Conway's Game of

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.840
Life in there. And we got structures in that, we got structures in that game from the chemistry

02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:45.680
that you wouldn't expect from the actual CA. So that's kind of cool in that,

02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:51.280
because they're, they're, they're interacting outside of the cells. So what's happening is

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:56.000
you're getting annoyed. So the thing is that you've got this BZ reaction that gives on off,

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.800
on off, on off, but there's also a wake. And those wakes constructively interfere,

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:08.960
and it's such a non-trivial way that it's a non-deterministic. And the non-determinism

02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:14.080
in, in, in the system gives very rich dynamics. And I was wondering if I could physically make

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:22.320
a chemical computer with this CA that, that gives me something different. I can't get in a silicon

02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:28.160
representation of a CA where all the states are clean, because you don't have the noise

02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:32.000
trailing into the next round. You just have the state.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:37.040
So the, the paper in particular, so that's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer to

02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:42.160
construct a cellular automer and the famous one of Game of Life. But it's also interesting.

02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:48.720
The really interesting scientific question of whether some kind of random perturbations or

02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:59.840
some source of randomness can have a significant constructive effect on the complexity of the

02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:05.760
system. And indeed, I mean, whether it's random or just non-deterministic, and can we bake in that

02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:11.120
non-determinism at the beginning, you know, I wonder what, what is the, I'm trying to think

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:18.480
about what is the encoding space. The encoding space is pretty big. We have 49 starots of 49 cells,

02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:24.560
49 chem bits, all connected to one another in like an analog computer, but being read out

02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:30.160
discreetly as they come, the BZ reaction. So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator.

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:34.800
And what happened in each cell is it goes between red and blue. So two Russians discovered it,

02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:38.960
Beluzov-Zaposkinski. I think Beluzov first proposed it, and everyone said,

02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:42.480
you're crazy, it breaks the second law. And Zaposkinski said, no, it doesn't break the second

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:50.240
law, it's consuming a fuel. And so, and then, and it's like, there's a lot of chemistry hidden

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:54.880
in the Russian literature, actually, because Russians just wrote it in Russian, they didn't

02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:59.680
publish any English-speaking journals. It's heartbreaking, actually. Well, yeah, sad and

02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:04.240
it's great that it's there, right? It's not lost. I'm sure we will find a way of translating it

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:10.400
properly. Well, the silver lining slash great or sadness of all of this is there's probably ideas

02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:18.800
in English-speaking. Like, there's ideas in certain disciplines that if discovered by other

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:24.720
disciplines would crack open some of the biggest mysteries in those disciplines. Like, computer

02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:32.000
science, for example, is trying to solve problems like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems,

02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:38.400
as if it's not already been all addressed in cognitive science and psychology and mathematics

02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:44.160
and physics and just whatever you want to economics even. But if you look into that

02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:50.560
literature, you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas. Obviously, Russian is an interesting

02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:56.720
case of that because there's a Lawson translation, but you said there's a source of fuel, a source of

02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:02.400
energy. Yeah, yeah. So, the BZ reaction, you have an acid in there called Melonic Acid. Yeah.

02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:09.680
And what happens is it's basically like a battery that powers it and it loses CO2. So,

02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:14.320
decuboxlates. It's just a chemical reaction. What that means we have to do is continuously feed

02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:20.800
or we just keep the BZ reaction going in a long enough time. So, it's like it's reversible in time.

02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.160
But only like. Yeah.

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:28.960
Only like. But it's fascinating. I mean, the team that did it, I'm really proud of their

02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:34.640
persistence. We made a chemical computer. It can solve little problems. It can solve

02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:38.640
traveling salesman problems, actually. Nice. But like I say, it's-

02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.120
But not any faster than the regular computer. Is there something you could do?

02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:48.800
Maybe. I'm not sure. I think we can come up with a way of solving problems

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:55.920
also really complex hard ones. Because it's an analog computer and we can,

02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:00.960
it can energy minimize really quickly. It doesn't have to basically go through every

02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:07.840
element in the matrix. Like flip it. It reads out. So, we could actually do Monte Carlo

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:13.600
by just shaking the box. It's literally a box shaker. You don't actually have to

02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:17.360
encode the shaking of the box in a silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around.

02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:22.880
It's analog. It's natural. So, it's an organic computer.

02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:27.360
Yeah. So, I was playing around with this and I was kind of annoying some of my colleagues.

02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:31.360
I'm wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy, like quantum supremacy.

02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:37.760
And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be so we can actually start to solve problems

02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:43.520
faster than a silicon computer. But I'm not willing to state how that is yet because I'm

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:48.480
probably wrong. It's not that it's any top secret thing is I want, I think I can make a

02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.800
chemical computer that can solve optimization problems faster than a silicon computer.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.760
That's fascinating. But then you're unsure how big that has to be.

02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:00.800
Yeah. I think, I mean, it might be a big box hard to shake.

02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:04.160
It might be exactly a big box hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy.

02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:10.560
Did we answer the question about do cellular time exist outside the mind?

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:17.600
We didn't, but I would posit that they don't. But I think minds can, well...

02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:20.480
So, the mind is fundamental. What's the...

02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.960
What I mean is, well, I mean, sorry, let's go back. So, as a physical phenomena,

02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:31.120
do CAs exist in physical reality? Right? I would say they probably don't exist outside

02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.560
the human mind, but now we've constructed them. They exist in computer memories.

02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:39.840
They exist in my lab. They exist on paper. So, they emerge from the human mind

02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:45.760
I'm just interested in because Steven Wolfram likes CAs. A lot of people like CAs and likes to

02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:51.920
think of them as minimal computational elements. I'm just saying, well, do they exist in reality

02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:55.680
or are they a representation of a simple machine that's just very elegant to implement?

02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:59.520
So, there's a platonic question, I guess. I mean, it's...

02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.480
There's initial conditions. There's a memory in the system.

02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:10.880
There are simple rules that dictate the evolution of the system. So, what exists?

02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:17.040
The idea, the rules, the... Yeah, people are using CAs as models for things in reality to say,

02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:24.400
hey, look, you can do this thing in a CA. And when I see this, I'm saying, oh, that's cool.

02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.520
But what does that tell me about reality? Where's the CA in spacetime?

02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:32.000
I see. Well, that's right. It's a mathematical object. So, for people who don't know cellular

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.880
automata, there's usually a grid where there's one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional.

02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:44.000
And it evolves by simple local rules like you die or are born if the neighbors are alive or

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:51.840
dead. And it turns out if you have... With certain kinds of initial conditions and with

02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:58.000
certain kinds of very simple rules, you can create arbitrarily complex and beautiful systems. And to

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:09.600
me, whether drugs are involved or not, I can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it,

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:16.720
how such complexity can emerge. It gives me almost like... People talk about religious experiences.

02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:26.080
It gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse at the origin of this whole thing.

02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:35.920
Whatever is creating this complexity from such simplicity is the very thing that brought my

02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:46.720
mind to life. That's me, the human, our human civilization. And yes, those constructs are

02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:55.280
pretty trivial. That's part of their magic is even in this trivial framework, you could see the

02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.640
emergence or especially in this trivial framework, you could see the emergence of complexity from

02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:11.760
simplicity. I guess what Lee, you're saying is that this is not... This is highly unlike systems

02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:18.240
we see in the physical world, even though they probably carry some of the same magic mechanistically.

02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:25.120
I mean, I'm saying that the operating system that a CA has to exist on is quite complex.

02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:30.400
And so I wonder if you're getting the complexity out of the CA from the boundary conditions,

02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:35.840
the operating system, the underlying digital computer... Oh, wow. Those are some strong words

02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:41.360
against CA's then. Not again. I mean, I'm in love with CA's as well. I'm just saying,

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:47.120
they aren't as trivial as people think. They are incredible. To get to that richness,

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:54.880
you have to iterate billions of times and you need a display and you need a math coprocessor

02:41:54.880 --> 02:42:00.560
and you need a von Neumann machine based on a Turing machine with digital error correction

02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:08.080
and states. Wow. To think that for the simplicity of a grid, you're basically saying a grid is not

02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:12.880
simple. Yeah. It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life. Yeah.

02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:15.360
Yeah.

02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.280
Well then, what is simple?

02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:21.200
That's all I wanted to say. I agree with you with the wonder of CA's, I just think. But remember,

02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:27.360
we take so much for granted what the CA is resting on. Because von Neumann and Feynman

02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:31.120
weren't showing, weren't seeing these elaborate structures. They could not get that far.

02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:34.720
Yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind.

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:36.800
Yeah, exactly. The limitation of their pencil.

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:44.000
But I think that the question is whether the essential elements of the cellular automata

02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:52.080
is present without all the complexities required to build a computer.

02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:59.760
The reason I find it incredible is that my intuition is yes. It might look different.

02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:08.880
There might not be a grid-like structure, but local interactions operating under simple rules

02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:16.560
and resulting in multi-hierarchical complex structures feels like a thing that doesn't

02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:17.840
require a computer.

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:24.800
I agree. But coming back to von Neumann and Feynman and Wolfram, their minds and non-trivial minds

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:30.000
to create those architectures and do it and to put on those state transitions.

02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:37.760
I think that something that's really incredibly interesting that is understanding how the human

02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:40.400
mind builds those state transition machines.

02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:48.480
I could see how deeply in love with the idea of memory you are. It's like how much of E equals

02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:56.160
mc squared is more than an equation. It has Albert Einstein in it.

02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:07.600
You're saying you can't just say the equations of physics are a really good simple capture

02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:14.320
of a physical phenomena. That equation has the memory of the humans.

02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:16.080
Absolutely.

02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:25.520
But I don't know if you're implying this. That's a beautiful idea, but I don't know

02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:30.400
if I'm comfortable with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation.

02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:31.360
No, it enhances it.

02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:33.520
Because it's built on the shoulders, it enhances it.

02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:38.640
I think it enhances it. That equation is a minimal compressed representation of reality.

02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:44.960
We can use machine learning or Max Tecmark's AI Feynman to find lots of solutions for gravity,

02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:49.280
but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find are the maximally compressed representations?

02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:56.800
Yeah, but that representation, I guess the universe has the memory of Einstein with that

02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:02.800
representation, but then you can now give it as a gift for free to other alien civilizations.

02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:04.880
Einstein had to go through a lot of pain together, but it's a low memory.

02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:08.320
I say that physics and chemistry and biology are the same discipline.

02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:14.640
Laws in physics, there's no such thing as a law in physics, it's just low memory stuff.

02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:18.720
Because you've got low memory stuff, things reoccur quickly.

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.840
As you get building more memory, you get to chemistry, so things become more contingent.

02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:27.280
When you get to biology, more contingent still, and then technology.

02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:30.400
So the more memory you need, the more your laws are local.

02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:35.440
That's all I'm saying, and the less memory, the more the laws are universal,

02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:37.600
because they're not laws, they are just low memory states.

02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:45.520
We have to talk about a thing you've mentioned already a bunch of times, but

02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:54.080
doing computation through chemistry, chemical-based computation, I've seen you refer to it as

02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:00.320
in a sexy title of chem-putation.

02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:05.360
What is chem-putation and what is chemical-based computation?

02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:14.160
Chem-putation is a name I gave to the process of building a state machine to make any molecule

02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:22.720
physically in the lab. As a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand, and they're quite hard.

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:28.960
Chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge, a lot of ambiguity. It's not possible to go uniform

02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:34.960
me to the literature and read a recipe to make a molecule and then go make it in the lab every

02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:43.520
time. Some recipes are better than others, but they all assume some knowledge, and it's not

02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:51.120
universal what that is. So it's carried from human to human, some of that implicit knowledge.

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:54.800
You're saying, can we remove the humor from the picture? Can we program?

02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:57.280
By the way, what is a state machine?

02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:06.800
So a state machine is, I suppose, an object either abstract or mechanical, where you can do

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:13.600
a unit operation on it and flick it from one state to another. So a turnstile would be a

02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:18.400
good example of a state machine. There's some kinds of states and some kind of transitions

02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:24.880
between states, and it's very formal in nature in terms of, like, it's precise.

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:31.600
Yes, you can mathematically precisely describe a state machine. So a very simple Boolean

02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:39.920
gates are a very good way of building logic-based state machines. Obviously, a Turing machine,

02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:45.360
the concept of a Turing machine where you have a tape and a read head and a series of rules

02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:50.640
in a table, and you would basically look at what's on the tape, and if you're shifting the tape

02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:54.880
from left to right, and if you see a zero or one, you look in your lookup table and say,

02:47:54.880 --> 02:48:03.600
right, I've seen a zero and a one, and then respond to that. So the turnstile would be,

02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:10.720
is there a human being pushing the turnstile in direction clockwise? If yes, I will open,

02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:15.040
let them go. If it's anti-clockwise, no. So yeah, so a state machine has some labels

02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:22.720
and a transition diagram. So you're looking to come up with a chemical computer to form state

02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:30.480
machines to create molecules, or what's the chicken and the egg? So a computation is not

02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:34.320
a chemical computer, because we talked a few moments about actually doing computations with

02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:39.600
chemicals. What I'm now saying is I want to use state machines to transform chemicals.

02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:45.840
So build chemicals programmatically? Yeah. I mean, I get in trouble saying this. I said to my

02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:50.560
group, I shouldn't say it, because I said, look, we should make the crack bot in the crack robot.

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:57.920
Crack bot. The robot that makes crack, but maybe we should scrub this from...

02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.000
So maybe you can educate me on breaking bad with math, right?

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:13.280
Yeah. So in breaking bad... So you want to make basically some kind of mix of ex machina

02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:17.520
and breaking bad? No, I don't. For the record, I don't. But I said...

02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:21.200
You don't. I said, that's what I'm going to do once you release the papers.

02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:29.600
I shave my head, and I'm going to live a life of crime anyway. I'm sorry.

02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:34.560
No, no. So yeah, let's get back to... So indeed, it is about making drugs, but

02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:39.760
importantly, making important drugs. All drugs matter.

02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:46.640
Yeah. But let's go back. So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog. There is no state

02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:54.880
machine. And I wandered through the paper walls in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,

02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.440
okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog? And they said, well, chemistry is

02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:05.120
really hard. You can't automate it. It's impossible. I said, but is it impossible?

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:08.480
I said, yeah. And they said, I got the impression they were saying it's magic.

02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.240
And so when people tell me things are magic, it's like, no, no, they can't be magic, right?

02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:20.800
So let's break this down. And so what I did is I went to my group one day about eight years ago

02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:25.920
and said, hey, guys, I've written this new programming language for you. And so everything is

02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:30.000
clear. And you have to, you're not allowed to just wander around the lab willy-nilly,

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.280
you have to pick up things in order, go to the balance at the right time,

02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:36.880
and all this stuff. And they looked at me as if I was insane and basically kicked me out of the

02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:40.880
lab and said, no, don't do that. We're not doing that. And I said, okay, so I went back the next

02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:46.640
day and said, I'm going to find some money so we can make cool robots do chemical reactions.

02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:50.240
And everyone went, that's cool. And so in that process,

02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:55.680
the first to try to convert the humans to become robots. And next you

02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:59.840
agree, you might as well just create the robots. Yes. But so in that, in that, the formalization

02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:03.760
process. Yeah. So what I did is said, look, a chemical, to make a molecule, you need to do

02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:08.000
four things abstractly. I want to make a chemical Turing machine. Because a Turing machine,

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.360
you think about this, imagine a Turing machine. Turing machine is the ultimate

02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:18.560
abstraction of a computation. Because it's been shown by Turing and others that basically

02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:23.280
a universal Turing machine should be able to do all computations that you can imagine. It's like,

02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:27.760
wow, why don't I think of a Turing machine for chemistry? Let's think of a magic robot

02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:32.800
that can make any molecule. Let's think about that for a second. Okay, great. How do we then

02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:37.680
implement it? And I think it's right. So what is the abstraction? So to make any molecule,

02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:42.080
you have to do a reaction. So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction in a flask,

02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:46.400
typically, then you're after the reaction, you have to stop the reactions, you do what's called

02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:52.160
a workup. So whatever, call it down, add some liquid to it, extract. So then after you do a

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:56.160
workup, you separate. So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out. And then

02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:02.560
the final step is purification. So reaction, workup, separate purify. So this is basically

02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:08.160
like my exactly like a Turing machine where you have your tape, you have your tape head,

02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:12.720
you have some rules, then you run it. So I thought, cool. I went to all the chemists and said,

02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:19.360
look, chemistry isn't that hard. Reaction, workup, separation, purification, do that in cycles,

02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:26.000
forever, for any molecule, all the chemistry done. And they said, chemistry is that hard.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:30.800
I said, but just in principle, and I got a few very enlightened people to say, yeah, okay,

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:38.400
in principle, but it ain't going to work. And this was in about 2013, 2014. And I found myself going

02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:42.640
to an architecture conference almost by accident. It's like, why am I at this random conference

02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:48.080
on architecture? And that was because I published a paper on inorganic architecture. And they said,

02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:52.640
come to architecture conference, but the inorganic architecture is not nano architecture. And I went,

02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:57.520
okay, and then I found these guys at the conference, 3d printing ping pong balls and shapes. And this

02:52:57.520 --> 02:53:01.520
is 3d printing was cool. And it's like, this is ridiculous. Why are you 3d printing ping pong

02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:05.200
balls? And I gave them a whole load of abuse, like I normally do when I first meet people,

02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:09.600
how to win friends and influence people. And then I was like, Oh, my God, you guys are geniuses.

02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:13.280
And so I got a got from they were a bit confused because I was calling them idiots and then call

02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:18.080
them geniuses. It's like, will you come to my lab? And we're going to build a robot to do chemistry

02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:22.160
with a 3d printer. And they said, Oh, that's cool. All right. So I had them come to the lab,

02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:27.280
and we started to 3d print test tube. So you imagine, you know, 3d printer bottle, and then

02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:33.280
and then in the and then use the same gantry to basically rather than to square out a plastic

02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:37.520
out of a nozzle, have a little syringe and jump chemicals in. So we had the 3d printer because

02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:42.400
simultaneously print the test tube and then put chemicals into the test tube. And then

02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:46.960
was this really end to end? Yeah, I was like, that'll be because they've got gco to do it all.

02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:52.000
I was like, that's cool. So I got my group doing this and I developed a bit and I realized that we

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:57.840
could take those unit operations. And we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves. And I realized

02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:02.560
that I could basically take the literature. And I made the first version of the computer

02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:09.280
in 2016, 17, I made some architectural decisions. So I designed the pumps and valves in my group,

02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:14.880
I did all the electronics in my group, they were brilliant. I cannot pay tribute to my group enough

02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:18.640
in doing this. They were just brilliant. And there were some poor souls there that said, Lee,

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:23.520
why are you making this design electronics? I'm like, well, because I don't understand it.

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:26.800
And they're like, so you're making his design stuff because you don't understand? I was like,

02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:31.440
yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some? I said, well, we can, but then I don't understand

02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:36.240
how to, you know, what bus they're going to use and there's serial ports and all this stuff. I just

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:41.280
wanted, and I made, I came up with the decision to design a bunch of pumps and valves and use

02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:46.720
power of the ethernet. So I got one cable for power and data, plug them all in, plug them all

02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:53.040
into a router. And, and then I made the state machine. And there was a couple of cool things I

02:54:53.040 --> 02:55:01.360
did. Oh, they did actually. We got the abstraction. So reaction, work, work up separation, purification.

02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:09.680
And then I made the decision to do it in batch. Now it's in batch. All chemistry had been digitized

02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:14.480
before apparently it was it's been done. But everyone been doing it in flow. And flow is

02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:19.600
continuous. And there are infinities everywhere. And you have to just, and I realized that I could

02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:25.760
actually make a state machine where I basically put stuff in the reactor, turn it from one state to

02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:31.200
another state, stop it and just read it out. And okay, and I was kind of bitching it's electrical

02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:33.840
engineer saying you have it easy, you don't have to clean out the electrons, you know,

02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:39.200
electrons don't leave a big mess, they leave some EM waste. But in my state machine, I built in

02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:43.200
cleaning. So it's like, we do all operation, then it cleans the backbone, then can do it again.

02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:49.120
That's fascinating. So what we managed to do over a couple of years is, is develop the hardware,

02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:53.520
develop the state machine. And we encoded three molecules, we did three, the first three, we did

02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:58.960
nitole, sleeping drug, refinimide, anti-seizure and Viagra. You know, and I would like to make jokes

02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:04.560
on the paper, it's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's very good. And then and then

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:10.560
in the next one, what we did said, okay, my poor organic chemist said, look, Lee, we've worked with

02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:16.720
you this long, we've made a robot that looks like it's going to take our jobs away. And, and not

02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:20.640
just take our jobs away that what we love in the lab, but now we have to become programmers,

02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:24.000
but we're not even good programmers, we just have to spend ages writing lines of code

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:31.040
that are boring, and it's not as elegant. I went, you're right. So then, but I knew because I had

02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:36.400
this abstraction, and I knew that there was language, I could suddenly develop a state machine

02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:42.000
that would interpret the language, which was lossy and ambiguous, and populate my abstraction.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:46.880
So I built a chemical programming language that is, is actually going to be recursively innumerable,

02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:49.600
it's going to be a true and complete language, actually, which is kind of cool, which means

02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:55.680
it's for me very viable. So where we are now is we can now read the literature using a bit of

02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:59.360
natural language processing, it's not the best, the many other groups have done better job,

02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:04.960
but we can use that language reading to populate the state machine, and basically add

02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:11.280
subtract, there's, we got about a number of primitives that we, the, you know,

02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:15.680
basically program loops that we dovetail together, and we can make any molecule with it.

02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:19.760
Okay, so that's, that's a kind of program synthesis. So you start at like, literally,

02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:24.320
you're talking about like a paper, like a scientific paper, that's being read,

02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:33.360
yeah, natural language processing, extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions, and

02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:42.000
the chemical molecules and compounds involved. And then that's, that in GPT

02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:49.200
terms, serves as a prompt for the program synthesis, that's kind of trivial right now,

02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:53.680
there you have a bunch of different like for loops and so on, that creates a program in this

02:57:54.400 --> 02:58:01.360
chemical language, that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer, the computer,

02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:07.120
yeah, computer, that works. Yeah, everything sounds better in your

02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:11.760
British accent, but I love it. So the, into the computer, and that's able to then

02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:18.560
basically be a 3D printer for these for molecules. Yeah, I wouldn't call it a 3D printer, I would

02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:22.560
call it a universal chemical reaction system, because 3D printing gives the wrong impression,

02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:28.000
but yeah, and, and it purifies. And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it

02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:36.160
the KIDL code is, is really interesting, because now, so computation, what is computation?

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:43.520
Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think. Computation is the process of taking

02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:48.640
chemical code, and some input reagents, and making the same molecule, making the molecule

02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:54.800
reproducibly every time without fail. What is computation? It's the process of taking a,

02:58:54.800 --> 02:59:00.880
using a program to take some input conditions and give you an output, same every time, right,

02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:06.400
reliably. So the, the problem is, now maybe you can push back and correct me on this.

02:59:07.360 --> 02:59:14.080
So I know biology is messy. My question is how messy is chemistry? So the, if we use the analogy

02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:22.960
of a computer, it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise, that it's repeatable,

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:29.360
it makes errors almost never. If it does the exact same way over and over and over and over.

02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:33.760
What about chemistry? Is there messiness in the whole thing? It, can that be somehow leveraged?

02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:38.160
Can that be controlled? Can that be that removed? Do we want to remove it from the system?

02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:44.720
Oh, yes and no, right. This, is there messiness? There, there is messiness, because chemistry is

02:59:44.720 --> 02:59:49.520
like you're, you're, you're doing reactions on, on billions of molecules, and they don't

02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:54.400
always work, but you've got purification there. And so what we've found is at the beginning,

02:59:54.400 --> 02:59:58.880
everyone said it can't work. It's going to be too messy. It will just fail. And I said, but

02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:02.000
you managed to get chemistry to work in the lab. Are you magic? Are you doing something?

03:00:02.560 --> 03:00:06.560
So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer or the ENIAC,

03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:14.080
five million soldered joints, 400,000 valves exploding all the time. Was that, would you have

03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:20.320
gone, okay, that's messy. So we've got the, and have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?

03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:26.080
We've got 15 computers in the lab now and they, are they unreliable? Yeah, they fall apart here

03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:32.160
in there, but are they getting better really quickly? Yeah. Are they now able to reliably make,

03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:36.320
are we at the point in the lab where there are some molecules we would rather make on the computer

03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:40.400
than have a human being make? Yeah, we've just done, we've just made a

03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:48.720
anti-influenza molecule and some antivirals, six steps on the computer that would take a human

03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:56.080
being about one week to make arbidol of continuous labor. And all they do now is load up the reagents,

03:00:56.080 --> 03:01:01.120
press go button and just go away and drink coffee. Wow. So this, I mean, and this is,

03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:06.400
you're saying this computer is just the early days. And so like some of the criticism just

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:10.320
have to do with the early days. And yes, I would say there's something like this is

03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:18.800
quite impossible. So the fact that you're doing this is incredible. Not impossible,

03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:24.320
of course, but extremely difficult. It did seem really difficult. And I do keep pinching myself

03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:28.640
when I go in the lab. I was like, is it working? Like, yep. And it's not, you know, it does clog.

03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:35.280
It does stop. You got to clean. This is great. You know, but it's getting more reliable because

03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:40.480
I made some, we just made design decisions and said, we are not going to abandon the abstraction.

03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:46.800
Think about it. If the Von Neumann implementation was abandoned, I mean, think about what we do

03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:53.840
to semiconductors to really constrain them to what we do to silicon in a fab lab. We take

03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:58.880
computation for granted, silicon is not in its natural state. We are doping the hell out of it.

03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:03.600
It's incredible what they're able to accomplish and achieve that reliability at the scale they do.

03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:09.920
Like you said, that's after Moore's law what we have now. And where we, you know,

03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:15.360
how it started, you know, we started at the bottom, now we're here.

03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:19.440
We have only have 20 million molecules, well, say 20 million molecules in one database,

03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:24.640
maybe a few hundred million in all the pharmaceutical companies. And those few hundred

03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:29.520
million molecules are responsible for all the drugs that we've had in humanity except, you know,

03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:34.320
biologics for the last 50 years. Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print,

03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:38.640
goes out of prints because there's only a finite number of manufacturing facilities in the world

03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:44.320
that make these drugs. Is that a print? Yeah. It's the printing press for chemistry. Yeah.

03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:49.840
And not only that, we can protect the KIDL so we can stop bad actors doing it. We can encrypt them.

03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:54.480
And we can give people life. Yeah, that's the name of the programing language.

03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:58.480
The KIDL is the name of the programming language and the code we give the chemicals.

03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:04.560
So Kai, as in, you know, just for, it's like a, it's actually like an XML format. But

03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:10.640
I've now taken it from script to a, to a fully expressible programming language so we can do

03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:14.720
dynamics and there's four loops in there and conditional statements. Right. But the structure

03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:21.280
it started out as a, like a, like an XML thing. Yeah. Yeah. And now we also, the chemist doesn't

03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:26.160
need to program in KIDL. They can just go to the software and type in add A to B reflux,

03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:29.280
do what they would normally do. And he just converts it to KIDL and they have a linter to

03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:35.600
check it. An error correct. So how do you, you know, not with ASCII, but because it's a Greek

03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:41.760
letter, how do you go with, how do you spell it? Just using the, the English alphabet.

03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:48.160
XDL? XDL, or we use, we put in Kai. And it was named by one of my students. And I,

03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:51.280
one of my postdocs many years ago, and I quite liked it. It's like,

03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:55.520
it's important, I think, when the team are contributing to such big ideas,

03:03:55.520 --> 03:04:01.040
because there are ideas as well. I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronin or anything

03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:07.360
that, because they keep saying, you know, is a, is it the chemistry when they're putting stuff in

03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:10.800
the computer? One of my students said, we are asking now, is it Cronin complete? And I was like,

03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:15.760
what does that mean? And I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine? And I was like,

03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:20.480
oh, is that a compliment or a, or a majority? But they're like, well, it might be both.

03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:27.360
Yeah. So you tweeted, quote, why does chemistry need a universal programming language?

03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:34.480
Question mark. For all the reasons you can think of, reliability, interoperability,

03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:40.640
collaboration, remove ambiguity, lower cost, increased safety, open up discovery,

03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:46.000
molecular customization, and publication of executable chemical code.

03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:54.640
Which is fascinating, by the way, just publish code. And can you maybe elaborate a little bit

03:04:54.640 --> 03:05:01.440
more about this KDL? What does the universal language of chemistry look like? A Cronin complete

03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:03.440
language?

03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:09.440
Well, it's a Turing complete language, really. But so what it has, it has a series of operators

03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:18.240
in it, like add, heat, stir. So there's a bunch of just unit operations. And all it is, really,

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:24.000
is just, it's, with chemical engineers, when I talked about this, that you've just rediscovered

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:29.840
chemical engineering. And I said, well, yeah, I know. I said, well, that's trivial. I said, well,

03:05:29.840 --> 03:05:34.880
not really. Well, yes, it is trivial. And that's why it's good. Because not only have we rediscovered

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:38.560
chemical engineering, we've made it implementable on the universal hardware that doesn't cost

03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:46.800
very much money. And so the KDL has a series of statements like define the reactor. So defines

03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:54.960
the reagents. So they're all labels. So you assign them. And what I also implemented at the beginning

03:05:54.960 --> 03:06:00.800
is because I give all the hardware IP address, you put it on a graph. And so what it does is

03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:07.200
like the graph is equivalent to the process of firmware, the processor code. So when you take

03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:12.000
your KDL, and you go to run it on your computer, you can run it on any compatible hardware and

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:16.000
any configuration says, what's your, what's your graph look like? As long as I can solve the problem

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.320
on the graph with these unit operations, you have the resources available, it can compile,

03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:28.560
chem piles. We can carry on for years. I mean, it is really, it's a compilation.

03:06:29.760 --> 03:06:36.000
And what it now does is it says, okay, the problem we have before is it was possible to

03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:40.400
do robotics for chemistry, but the robots were really expensive. They were unique.

03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:45.920
They were vendor locked. And what I want to do is to make sure that every chemist in the world

03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:51.120
can get access to machinery like this at virtually no cost, because it makes it safer.

03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:56.160
It makes it more reliable. And then if you go to the literature and you find a molecule that

03:06:56.160 --> 03:07:00.320
could potentially cure cancer. And let's say the molecule that could potentially cure cancer

03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:06.400
takes you three years to repeat. And maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time,

03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:13.360
and they never get it back. So it's really hard to, to kind of get all the way to that molecule,

03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:17.680
and it limits the ability of humanity to build on it. If they just download the code and can

03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:24.400
execute it, it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory notebook in chemistry is a data

03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:30.160
cemetery, because no one will ever reproduce it. But now the data cemetery is a Jupyter

03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:34.560
notebook, and you can just execute it and people can play with it. The access to it

03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:41.440
reverses the magnitude is increased. We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies,

03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:44.880
I think there's way more exciting possibilities, but they're also terrifying

03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:50.160
possibilities. And we'll talk about all of them. But let me just kind of linger on the

03:07:50.160 --> 03:07:53.600
machine learning side of this. So you're describing programming, but

03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:59.280
it's a language. I don't know if you've heard about Open AI Codex, which is-

03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:00.400
Yeah, I'm playing with it.

03:08:00.400 --> 03:08:02.240
Hey, playing. Of course you are.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.880
You really are Rick from Rick and Morty. This is great. Okay.

03:08:10.800 --> 03:08:14.240
Except philosophically deep. I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.

03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:21.520
So for people who don't know GPT, GPT-3, it's a language model that can do natural language

03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:27.040
generation. So you can give it a prompt and it can complete the rest of it. But it turns out

03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:31.680
that that kind of prompt, it's not just completes the rest of it, it's generating

03:08:34.560 --> 03:08:39.520
like novel sounding text. And then you can apply that to generation of other kinds of stuff.

03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:45.920
So these kinds of transformer based language models are really good at forming

03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:55.120
deep representations of a particular space, like a medium, like language. So you can then apply

03:08:55.120 --> 03:09:01.680
the specific subset of language like programming. So you can have it learn the representation of

03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:07.840
the Python programming language and use it to then generate syntactically and semantically correct

03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:14.720
programs. So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest problems in computer science,

03:09:14.720 --> 03:09:19.040
which is program synthesis. How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?

03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:28.640
So what OpenAI Codex does is it generates those programs based on a prompt of some kind.

03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:33.120
Usually you can do a natural language prompt. So basically as you do when you program, you write

03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:40.000
some comment, which serves the basic documentation of the inputs and the outputs and the function

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:44.960
of the particular set of code and it's able to generate that. The point being is you can generate

03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:54.720
programs using machine learning using neural networks. Those programs operate on the boring old

03:09:55.600 --> 03:10:01.600
computer. Can you generate programs that operate this guy be a clever version of programs for this

03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:08.160
but can you write programs that operate on a computer? Yep. There's actually software out

03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:16.240
there right now. We can go and do it. It's a heuristic. It's rule based. But we have what we've done

03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:24.160
inspired by Codex actually is over the summer, I ran a little workshop. Some of my groups got

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:30.560
this inspired idea that we should get a load of students and ask them to manually collect data,

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:40.400
to label chemical procedures into QIDL. And we have a cool synth reader. So there's a bunch of

03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:46.880
people doing this right now, but they're doing it without abstraction. And because we have an

03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:53.520
abstraction that's implementable in the hardware, we've developed basically a chemical analog of

03:10:53.520 --> 03:11:00.400
Codex. We say abstraction in the hardware. What do you mean? So right now,

03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:04.880
a lot of people doing machine learning and reading chemistry and just saying, oh,

03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:10.160
you've got all these operations, ad shake, whatever he, but because they don't have a uniform,

03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:15.040
I mean, there's a couple of groups doing it, competitors actually, they're good, very good.

03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:27.360
But they can't run that code automatically. They are losing meaning. And the really important

03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:32.720
thing that you have to do is generate context. And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction

03:11:32.720 --> 03:11:40.400
is make sure we can pull the context out of the text. And so can we take a chemical procedure

03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:45.360
and read it and generate our executable code? Yes. What's the hardest part about that whole

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:50.480
pipeline from the initial text interpreting the initial text of a paper, extracting the

03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:56.720
meaningful context and meaningful chemical information to then generating the program,

03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:02.640
to then running that program in the hardware? What's the hardest part about that pipeline as we

03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:11.280
look towards a universal Turing computer? So the hardest thing with the pipeline is that

03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:18.640
the software, the model gets confused between some meanings, right? So if

03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:25.200
chemists are very good at inventing words that aren't broken down, so I would, the classic word

03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:31.040
that you would use for boiling something is called reflux. So reflux is you'd have a solvent in

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:35.920
the round bomb flask at reflux, it would be boiling, going up the reflux condenser and coming down.

03:12:35.920 --> 03:12:44.240
But that term reflux to reflux could be changed, you know, to people often make up words, new words,

03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:50.080
and then the software can fall over. But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python,

03:12:50.800 --> 03:12:56.240
or any programming language, is identify when things aren't matched. So you present the code,

03:12:56.240 --> 03:12:59.920
and you say this isn't matched, you may want to think about this, and then the user goes and says,

03:12:59.920 --> 03:13:05.440
oh, I mean reflux and just ticks a box and collects it. So what the codex or the chemx

03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:13.520
does in this case, is it just, it suggests the first go, and then the chemist goes and

03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:19.600
corrects it. And I really want the chemist to correct it, because it's not safe, I believe,

03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:24.960
for to allow AI to just read literature and generate code at this stage.

03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:35.600
Because now you're having actual, by the way, chemx, nice, nice name. So you are unlike,

03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:42.800
which is fascinating. We live in a fascinating moment in human history. But yes,

03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:52.800
you're literally connecting AI to some physical, and like, it's building something in the physical

03:13:52.800 --> 03:14:02.080
realm, especially in the space of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.

03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:07.520
Yeah. Yeah, I would say that's right. And it's really important to understand those

03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:12.560
labeling schemes, right? And one of the things I was never, I was always worried about the beginning

03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:18.080
that the abstraction was going to fall over. And the way we did it was just by brute force to start

03:14:18.080 --> 03:14:21.040
with, we just kept reading the literature and saying, is there anything new? Can we add a new

03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:27.280
rule in? And actually, our QIDL language expand exploded. There were so many extra things we

03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:31.520
had to keep adding. And then I realized the primitives still were maintained, I could break

03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:36.720
them down again. So we get, it's pretty good. I mean, there are problems, there are problems of,

03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:40.560
you know, interpreting any big sentence and turning it into an actionable code.

03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:44.080
And the codex is not without its problems. You can, you can crash it quite easily, right? You

03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:51.040
can generate nonsense. But boy, it's interesting. I would love to learn to program now using codex,

03:14:52.240 --> 03:14:56.000
right? Just hacking around, right? And I wonder if chemistry in the future will learn to

03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.640
do chemistry by just hacking around with the system, writing in different things. Because

03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:05.840
the key thing that we're doing with the chemistry is that where a lot of

03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:11.520
mathematical chemistry went wrong is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica,

03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:17.440
he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A or molecule A reacts with molecule B to

03:15:17.440 --> 03:15:23.120
give molecule C. That's not what chemistry is. Chemistry is take, take some molecule,

03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:31.040
take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it and then extract it. So the programming language

03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:37.040
is actually with respect to the process operations. And if you flick in process space,

03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:43.120
not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything. Because there's only a finite number of processes

03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:49.040
you need to do in chemistry. And that, and that's reassuring. And so, so we're in the middle of it,

03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:54.400
it's really exciting. It's not, you know, the be all in the end all, and there is like I say,

03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:58.560
errors that can creep in. One day, we might be able to do it without human interaction,

03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:04.160
you simulate it, and you'll know enough about the simulation that will, you know, the lab won't

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:08.880
catch fire. But there are so many safety issues right now that we've got to really be very careful,

03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:13.200
you know, protecting the user, protecting the environment, protecting misuse. I mean,

03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:17.520
there's lots to discuss, if you want to go down that route, because it's very, very interesting.

03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:25.360
You don't want novachocks being made, or explosives being made, or recreational drugs

03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:31.040
being made. But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug that's going to be

03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:37.360
important for them looking at their, you know, particular assay on a bad actor trying to make

03:16:37.360 --> 03:16:41.920
methamphetamine? I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor, but that's exactly what I'm

03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:46.560
going to do. I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first. Don't worry, we can protect you

03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:57.280
from yourself. Okay. I'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope. Does this ultimately

03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:06.000
excite you about the future? Or does it terrify you? So let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental.

03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:14.000
It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress that will have to happen,

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:21.680
that will happen, that there's no stopping it. And I, as we've been talking about, I see obviously

03:17:21.680 --> 03:17:29.200
a huge number of exciting possibilities. So whenever you automate these kinds of things,

03:17:29.200 --> 03:17:35.920
just the world opens up. It's like programming itself, and the computer, regular computer,

03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:43.440
has created innumerable applications and made the world better in so many dimensions,

03:17:43.440 --> 03:17:48.160
and it created, of course, a lot of negative things that we, for some reason, like the focus on,

03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:55.280
using that very technology to tweet about it. But I think it made a much better world,

03:17:55.280 --> 03:18:03.280
but it created a lot of new dangers. So maybe you can speak to when you have, when you kind of

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:12.720
stand at the end of the road for building a really solid, reliable universal computer,

03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:18.160
what are the possibilities that are positive? What are the possibilities that are negative?

03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:22.960
How can we minimize the chance of the negative? Yeah, that's a really good question. So there's

03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:30.160
so many positive things from drug discovery, from supply chain stress, for basically enabling

03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:33.920
chemists to basically build more productive in the lab, right? Where the computer's not

03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:37.440
going to replace the chemist. There's going to be a Moore's law of molecules, right? There's

03:18:37.440 --> 03:18:41.440
going to be so many more molecules we can design, so many more diseases we can cure.

03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:45.520
So chemists in the lab, as researchers, that's better for science, so they can

03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:50.640
build a bunch of, like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace. So it's not

03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:54.800
just the development of drugs, it's actually like doing the basic understanding of the science of

03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:59.280
drugs. And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now, we're all living longer, we're all

03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:04.880
having more and more, we know more about our genomic development, we know about our predetermination,

03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:11.360
and we might be able to, one dream I've got is like, imagine, you can work at your genome

03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:16.240
assistant tells you you're going to get cancer in seven years time, and you have your personal

03:19:16.240 --> 03:19:21.440
computer that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it, right? That's a really positive

03:19:21.440 --> 03:19:27.760
idea. The other thing is, is when drugs, so right now, I think it is absolutely outrageous

03:19:28.560 --> 03:19:35.280
that not all of humanity has access to medicine. And I think the computer might be able to change

03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:39.680
that fundamentally because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured. So let's stop thinking

03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:46.400
about manufacturing in different factories. Let's say that clinical grade computers or drug grade

03:19:46.400 --> 03:19:52.560
computers will be in facilities all around the world, and they can make things on demand

03:19:52.560 --> 03:19:57.120
as a function of the cost. Maybe people won't be able to afford the latest and greatest patent,

03:19:57.120 --> 03:20:01.920
but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing and will basically democratize,

03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:07.680
make available drugs to everybody that they need. And there's lots of

03:20:08.640 --> 03:20:14.080
of really interesting things there. So I think that's going to happen. I think that now let's take

03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:20.720
the negative. Before we do that, let's imagine what happened to go back to a really tragic

03:20:20.720 --> 03:20:26.400
accident a few years ago, well, not an accident, an act of murder by that pilot on the, I think it was

03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:32.560
Euro wings or Swiss wings off. But what he did is the plane took off. He waited till his pilot

03:20:32.560 --> 03:20:39.520
went to the toilet. He was a co-pilot. He locked the door and then set the autopilot above the

03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:46.480
Alps. He set the altimeter or the descend height to zero. So the computer just took the plane into

03:20:46.480 --> 03:20:53.520
the Alps. Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy that obviously the guy was mentally ill, but it

03:20:53.520 --> 03:20:58.400
wasn't just a tragedy for him. It was for all the people on board. But what if, and I was inspired

03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:05.280
by this, and I thinking, what can I do to do, to anticipate problems like this in the computer,

03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:11.200
had the software, and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus will be thinking, oh, maybe I can give the computer

03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:15.680
a bit more situational awareness. So whenever one, some tries to drop the height of the plane,

03:21:15.680 --> 03:21:19.280
and it knows above the Alps will just say, oh, no, computer says, no, we're not letting you do that.

03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:23.920
Of course, he would have been able to find another way, maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or

03:21:23.920 --> 03:21:29.520
something. But keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories that can go negative,

03:21:29.520 --> 03:21:36.640
all those kinds of running into the Alps, and try to at least make it easy for the engineers

03:21:36.640 --> 03:21:41.120
to build systems that are protecting us that. Yeah. And let's just think, so what are in the

03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:45.040
computer world right now with KIDLs? Let's just not think about what I'm doing right now. What

03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:48.800
I'm doing right now is it's completely open, right? Everyone's going to know KIDLs and be playing with

03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:52.960
them, making them more easier and easier and easier. But what we're going to start to do,

03:21:52.960 --> 03:22:00.800
it makes sense to encrypt the KIDLs in such a way you're, let's say you work for a pharmaceutical

03:22:00.800 --> 03:22:05.120
company, and you have a license to make given molecule, where you get issued with a license

03:22:05.120 --> 03:22:08.960
by the FDA or your local authority, and they'll say, right, your license to do it,

03:22:08.960 --> 03:22:14.560
here it is, it's encrypted, and the KIDL gets run. So you have a license for that instance of use.

03:22:14.560 --> 03:22:19.360
Easy to do. Computer science has already solved the problem. So the fact that we all trust online

03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:25.840
banking, right, the right now, then we can secure it. I'm 100% sure we can secure the computer.

03:22:26.880 --> 03:22:32.560
Because of the way we have a many, you know, it's like the same mapping problem that you,

03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:37.120
to actually reverse engineer a KIDL will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key.

03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:44.320
You know, brute force, it will be cheaper to just actually buy the regulated medicine.

03:22:44.320 --> 03:22:49.280
And actually, people aren't going to want to then make their own fake pharmaceuticals,

03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:54.720
because it'll be so cheap to do it. We'll drop the cost of access to drugs. Now what will happen?

03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:58.880
Recreational drugs. People start saying, well, I want access to recreational drugs.

03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:04.400
Well, it's going to be up to, it's going to accelerate that social discussion that's happening

03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:10.240
in the US and Canada and in the UK, everywhere, right? Because cost goes down, access goes up.

03:23:10.240 --> 03:23:14.720
Giving cannabis, THC, to some people who've got epilepsy isn't literally

03:23:14.720 --> 03:23:18.960
forgive the term and no brainer, because these poor people go from seizures like

03:23:18.960 --> 03:23:21.520
every day to maybe seizures just once every few months.

03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:26.720
That's an interesting idea that tried to minimize the chance that it can get into

03:23:26.720 --> 03:23:32.000
like the hands of individuals, like terrorists or people that want to do harm.

03:23:33.040 --> 03:23:37.520
Now, with that kind of thing, you're putting a lot of power in the hands of

03:23:38.480 --> 03:23:44.160
governments, in the hands of institutions. And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism you

03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:50.080
might have of governments that can sometimes use these for ill, use them as weapons of war,

03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:59.520
not weapons, not tools of betterment. So, and sometimes not just war against other nations,

03:23:59.520 --> 03:24:03.200
but war against its own people, as has been done throughout history.

03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:08.560
Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it, a decentralized peer-to-peer version

03:24:09.200 --> 03:24:12.880
where, and what you have to do, I'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain,

03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:16.800
but there is a way of maybe taking KydLs and put them in blockchain. Here's an idea,

03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:21.920
let's just say, the way we do it in my lab right now is we go to the literature, we take a recipe

03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:27.920
to make a molecule, convert that to KydL and diligently make it in the robot and validate it.

03:24:28.880 --> 03:24:33.280
So, I would call mining, proof of work, proof of synthesis, right?

03:24:33.280 --> 03:24:34.880
Proof of synthesis.

03:24:34.880 --> 03:24:38.800
Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly, when you actually synthesize it,

03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:42.160
you can get the analytical data, but there's also a fingerprint in there of the impurities

03:24:42.160 --> 03:24:47.280
that get carried across, because you can never make something 100% pure. That fingerprint will

03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:51.840
allow you to secure your KydL. So, what you do is encrypt those two things. So, suddenly,

03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:57.760
you can have people out there mining, and what you could do perhaps is do the type of thing,

03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:03.040
we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing should have been done in COVID,

03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:08.000
where people are given the information. So, you have just been in contact with someone COVID,

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:13.440
you choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home, you choose, right? So, now, if we could imagine

03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:18.480
a similar thing, like you have got access to these chemicals, they will have these effects,

03:25:18.480 --> 03:25:24.240
you choose and publicize it, or maybe it's out somewhere, I don't know, I'm not a policy maker

03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:30.640
on this. And my job here is to not just make the technology possible, but to have it as open as

03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:35.760
a discussion as possible with people to say, hey, can we stop childhood mortality with this

03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:42.320
technology? And do those benefits outweigh the one-off where people might use it for terrorism,

03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:47.360
or people might use it for recreational drugs? Chemify, which is the name of the entity that

03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:52.240
will make this happen, I think we have some social responsibilities as an entity to make sure that

03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:57.440
we're not enabling people to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will. And what we have to do

03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:02.160
is have a discussion with society, with the people that invest in this, with people that are going

03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:06.720
to pay for this, to say, well, do you want to live longer? And do you want to be healthier?

03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:11.680
And are you willing to accept some of the risks? And I think that's a discussion to have.

03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:17.120
So, by the way, when you say personal drugs, do you mean the illegal ones? Or do you have a concern

03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:25.840
of just putting the manufacture of any kind of legal drugs in the hands of regular people,

03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:29.760
because they might, like dose matters, they might take way too much?

03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:36.160
I mean, I would say, to be honest, the chances of computers being, well, should always never. So,

03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:38.800
the fact I can now say this means it's totally going to come true, right?

03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:40.800
Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to do it.

03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:45.200
I cannot imagine that computers will be in people's houses anytime soon,

03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:51.120
but they might be at the local pharmacy, right? And if you've got a drug manufacturing facility

03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:55.440
in every town, then you just go and they give you a prescription and they do it in such a way,

03:26:55.440 --> 03:27:01.120
they format it so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day. You get one manufactured

03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:04.880
for you that has all the materials you need in the right distribution.

03:27:04.880 --> 03:27:09.840
Got it. But you mentioned recreation drugs and the reason I mentioned it, because I know people

03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:16.080
are going to speak up on this. If the drug is legal, there's, to me, no reason why you can't

03:27:16.080 --> 03:27:19.280
manufacture, I mean, for recreation. I mean, you can do it right now.

03:27:19.280 --> 03:27:21.040
What do you have against fun, Lee?

03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:29.360
So, I mean, I'm a chemistry professor in a university who's an entrepreneur as well.

03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:32.800
I just think I need to be as responsible as I can in the discussion.

03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:38.640
Not sure, sure. But I know, so let me be the one that says there's nothing,

03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:43.760
because you have said recreational drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence.

03:27:43.760 --> 03:27:44.960
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:51.680
I think let's make sure we draw a line that there's real dangers to the world of terrorist,

03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:55.200
of biowarfare, and then there's a little bit of weed.

03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:02.880
So, I have, I mean, I think it's up to the society to tell his governments what it wants,

03:28:02.880 --> 03:28:09.680
what's acceptable, right? And if it becomes, let's say that THC's become, you know, heavily

03:28:10.400 --> 03:28:15.520
acceptable, and that you can modify them. So, let's say there's, let's say it's like blood type,

03:28:15.520 --> 03:28:21.040
there's a particular type of THC that you tolerate better than I do, then why not,

03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:23.040
why not have a machine that makes the one you like?

03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:23.440
Yeah.

03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:24.320
And then, and why not-

03:28:24.320 --> 03:28:25.680
It's the perfect brownie.

03:28:26.880 --> 03:28:32.240
And I think that that's fine. But I'm, you know, we're so far away from that.

03:28:32.240 --> 03:28:36.160
I can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right? And I mean, it's reliability and all this

03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:40.320
other stuff. But what I think is going to happen in the short term, it's going to turbo charge

03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:45.360
molecular discovery, reliability, and that will change the world.

03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:49.200
That's super exciting. You have a draft of a paper titled,

03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:52.880
autonomous intelligent exploration, discovery and optimization of nanomaterials.

03:28:53.760 --> 03:28:57.920
So, we are talking about automating engineering of nanomaterials.

03:28:58.800 --> 03:29:04.080
How hard is this problem? And as we continue down this thread of the positives

03:29:04.800 --> 03:29:08.880
and the worrisome, what are the things we should be excited about?

03:29:09.600 --> 03:29:14.080
And what are the things we should be terrified about? And how do we minimize the chance of the

03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:17.200
terrifying consequences?

03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:22.640
So, in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting. So, the robot basically

03:29:23.280 --> 03:29:29.200
is an embodied AI. I really, I really like AI in a domain specific way.

03:29:29.760 --> 03:29:35.440
One of the, as you should say at this point, there was an attempt in the 60s, Joshua Leidenberg

03:29:35.440 --> 03:29:41.280
and some really important people did this that made an AI to try and guess if organic molecules

03:29:41.280 --> 03:29:46.320
in the mass spectrometer were alien or not. Yes. And they failed because they didn't have assembly

03:29:46.320 --> 03:29:53.440
theory. Wait, what does assembly theory give you about alien versus human life?

03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:57.440
Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown, the degree of unknowns. You can fingerprint stuff.

03:29:57.440 --> 03:30:01.360
They weren't looking at, they were trying to basically just look at the corpus of

03:30:02.080 --> 03:30:07.040
complex organic molecules. So, when I was a bit down about assembly theory, because I couldn't

03:30:07.040 --> 03:30:13.360
convince referees and couldn't convince computational people interested in computational

03:30:13.360 --> 03:30:19.120
complexity, I was really quite depressed about it. And I mean, I've been working with Sarah Walker's

03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:23.840
team and I think she, you know, I think she also invented assembly theory in some way. We can talk

03:30:23.840 --> 03:30:32.320
about it later. When I found the AI not working for the Dendral project, I suddenly realized I

03:30:32.320 --> 03:30:39.920
wasn't totally insane. Coming back to this nano robot, so what it does is basically like a computer,

03:30:39.920 --> 03:30:46.000
but now what it does is it squirts a liquid with gold in it in a test tube, and it adds

03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:53.120
some reducing agents, there's some electrons to make the gold turn into a nanoparticle.

03:30:53.120 --> 03:30:57.120
Now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle, it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon. So it's a bit

03:30:57.120 --> 03:31:02.240
like if you look at the sheen on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something. Those are the ways

03:31:02.240 --> 03:31:08.480
of conducting electrons basically reflect light. What we did is we randomly squirt the gold,

03:31:08.480 --> 03:31:12.640
the gold particle and the reducing agent in and we measure the UV, we measure the color.

03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:17.920
And so what we do is we've got the robot has a mind. So it has a mind where

03:31:18.720 --> 03:31:24.640
in a simulation, it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon, the color that comes out,

03:31:24.640 --> 03:31:29.360
randomly generates imagines in its head. It then, well, the others, that's the imaginary side of

03:31:29.360 --> 03:31:34.480
the robot and the physical side of the robot, it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color

03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:40.320
and it uses a genetic algorithm and a map elite actually on it. And it goes around in cycles

03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:47.840
and refines the color to the objective. Now we use two different points. We have an exploration

03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:54.320
and optimization. They're two different. So the exploration just says, just do random stuff

03:31:54.320 --> 03:31:57.360
and see how many different things you can get. And when you get different things,

03:31:57.360 --> 03:32:02.480
try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper. And what it does after a number

03:32:02.480 --> 03:32:09.040
of cycles is it physically takes a sample of the optimized nano material, resets all the

03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:15.280
round bottom flasks, cleans them, and puts the seed physical seed back in. And what this robot

03:32:15.280 --> 03:32:22.160
is able to do is is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions in just 1000 experiments in

03:32:22.160 --> 03:32:28.000
three days. And it makes five generations of nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer in terms

03:32:28.080 --> 03:32:32.240
of shape and color and definition. And then at the end, the output. So Kydial code.

03:32:34.080 --> 03:32:41.600
Wow, it's doing the search for programs in the physical space. So it's doing a kind of reinforcement

03:32:41.600 --> 03:32:48.800
learning with the exploration and optimization. And that Kydial will work on any computer or

03:32:48.800 --> 03:32:53.440
any qualified heart. So now that's it. That's now that's a general piece of code that can

03:32:53.600 --> 03:33:00.240
replicate somewhat, maybe perfectly what it created. That's amazing. That's incredible.

03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:04.560
But the nanoparticles themselves are done. The robot has all the thinking. So we don't try and

03:33:04.560 --> 03:33:10.080
imply any self replication or try and get the particles to make themselves, although it would

03:33:10.080 --> 03:33:15.520
be cool to try. So well, there you go. That's that those are famous last words for the end of human

03:33:15.520 --> 03:33:23.200
civilization would be cool to try. So is it possible to create molecules that start approaching

03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:30.080
this question that we started this conversation, which which is the origin of life to start to

03:33:30.080 --> 03:33:37.920
create molecules that have lifelike qualities. So have the replication have like complex start

03:33:37.920 --> 03:33:42.800
to create complex organisms. So we have done this with the oxides. I talked about earlier

03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:47.680
with them limping oxides and the rings and the bulls. And the problem is that that what they

03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:54.400
do, they autocatalytically enhance one another. So they would, I guess you would call itself

03:33:54.400 --> 03:34:03.200
replication. But because there's limited function and mutation, they're pretty dumb. So don't do

03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:12.480
very much. So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer a nano material and nano material

03:34:12.480 --> 03:34:16.960
life form in the short term, like I said earlier, my aim is to do this, of course, I mean, I'm,

03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:19.600
you know, on one hand, I'm saying it's impossible. On the other hand, saying I'm doing it. So

03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:24.320
which is Italy, you know, it's like, well, like, we're, I think we can do it, but only in the

03:34:24.320 --> 03:34:28.960
robot. So the causal chain that's going to allow it is in the robot. These particles, if they do

03:34:28.960 --> 03:34:33.760
start to self replicate, the system's going to be so fragile, that I don't think anything

03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:39.280
dangerous will come out. It doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them as potentially, you know,

03:34:40.880 --> 03:34:44.160
I mean, I don't want to scare people like gain of function, we're going to produce stuff that

03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:52.560
comes out. Our number one kill switch is that we always try to search a space of objects that

03:34:53.200 --> 03:34:56.800
don't exist in our reality, don't exist in the environment. So even if something got out, it

03:34:56.800 --> 03:35:01.520
just would die immediately. It's like making a silicon life form or something, or, you know,

03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:06.640
which is the opposite of oftentimes gain of function research just focused on like, how do

03:35:06.640 --> 03:35:12.400
you get a dangerous thing to be closer to something that works with humans? Yeah. So

03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:19.600
having jumped a human. So that's the one good mode to operate on is always try to operate on

03:35:20.960 --> 03:35:25.600
chemical entities that are very different than the kind of chemical environment that humans

03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:30.240
operate in. Yeah. And also, I mean, I'll say something dramatic, which may not be,

03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:38.960
may not be true. So I should be careful. If let's say we did discover a new living system,

03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:44.480
that it was made out of a shadow biosphere, and we just released it in the environment,

03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:52.560
who cares? It's going to use different stuff. It'll just live. Just live? Yeah. I thought one

03:35:52.560 --> 03:35:57.200
of my biggest fantasies is actually is like a planet that's basically half in the sun. It

03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:02.080
doesn't rotate, right? And you have two different origins of life on that planet.

03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:07.840
And they don't share the same chemistry. Yeah. And then the only way time they recognize each

03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:10.800
other is when they become intelligent, they go, well, what's that moving? Yeah.

03:36:12.880 --> 03:36:18.240
They co-evolve, and that's fascinating. I mean, so one fascinating thing to do is exactly what

03:36:18.240 --> 03:36:27.600
you were saying, which is a life bomb, which is like try to focus on atmospheres or chemical

03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:36.000
conditions of other planets and try within this kind of exploration optimization system,

03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:42.240
try to discover life forms that can work in those conditions, and then you

03:36:42.800 --> 03:36:47.200
send those life forms over there and see what kind of stuff they build up. Like you can do like a

03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:53.360
large scale. It's kind of a safe physical environment to do large scale experiments. It's

03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:57.680
another planet. Yeah. So look, I'm going to say something quite contentious. I mean,

03:36:57.680 --> 03:37:01.360
Elon wants to go to Mars. I think it's brilliant wants to go to Mars, but I would counter that and

03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:08.240
say, is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity off Earth? Or what about just technology? So if

03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:12.640
we do technology, so Elon, I don't need to take a computer to Mars because he needs to manufacture

03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:17.760
drugs on demand, right? Because you zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code. Or what

03:37:17.760 --> 03:37:23.280
we do is we actually say, hang on, it's quite hard for humans to survive on Mars. Why don't we write

03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:28.240
a series of origin of life algorithms where we embed our culture in it, right? It's a very Ridley

03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:35.600
spot from Vethius, right? Yeah. Which is a terrible film, by the way, but anyway. And dump it on Mars

03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:41.600
and just terraform Mars. And what we do is we evolve life on Mars that is suited to life on Mars.

03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:45.680
Yeah. Rather than brute forcing human life on Mars. So one of the questions is,

03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:51.120
you know, what is human culture? What are the things you encode? Some of it is knowledge. Some

03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:57.360
of it is information. But the thing that Elon talks about, the thing I think about,

03:37:57.360 --> 03:38:05.520
I think you think about as well is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human,

03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:12.640
which is our particular kind of consciousness. So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.

03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:15.440
Yeah. That's one of the questions is, can we

03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:25.120
instill consciousness into other beings? Because that's a sad thought that whatever

03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:32.560
this thing inside our minds that hopes and dreams and fears and loves can all die.

03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:39.200
Yeah. But I think you already know the answer to that question. I have a robot lawn mower at home.

03:38:40.080 --> 03:38:46.880
My kids call it CC, call cutter. It's a robot mow. And the way it works, it has an electric field

03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:52.320
around the perimeter. And it just tell it the area. And it goes out and goes from its base

03:38:52.400 --> 03:38:57.520
station just mows a bit, gets to the perimeter, detects, and then chooses a random angle,

03:38:57.520 --> 03:39:03.280
rotates around and goes on. Yeah. But my kids call it call cutter. It's a she. I don't know why

03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:07.760
it's a she. They just, they were, they were like, quite young. They called it, I don't want to be

03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:13.600
sexist there. It could be a he, but they liked. They gendered the lawn mower. They gendered the

03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:19.280
lawn mower. Okay. Yeah. Why not? But I was thinking this lawn mower, if you apply integrated information

03:39:19.280 --> 03:39:24.800
theory to lawn mower lawn mowers conscious. Now information, integrated information theory

03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:29.280
is that people say as a flawed way of measuring consciousness, but I don't think it is. I think

03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:35.120
assembly theory actually measures consciousness in the same way. Consciousness is something that

03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:40.960
has generated over a population of objects of humans. Consciousness didn't suddenly spring in.

03:39:40.960 --> 03:39:45.360
Our consciousness is evolved together, right? The fact we're here and the robots we leave behind,

03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:51.440
they all have some of that. So we won't lose it all. Sure, consciousness requires that we have

03:39:51.440 --> 03:39:56.080
many models being generated. It's not just one domain specific AI, right? I think the way it

03:39:56.080 --> 03:40:01.440
creates consciousness, I'm going to say unashainably, the best way to make a consciousness is in a

03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:06.160
chemical system, because you just have access to many more states. And the problem right now,

03:40:06.160 --> 03:40:11.600
we're making silicon consciousness. You just don't have enough states. So there are more

03:40:12.240 --> 03:40:16.000
states, or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible in your brain than

03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:21.200
there are atoms in the universe. And you can switch between them. You can't do that on a

03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:26.800
Core i10. It's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors, but you can't reconfigure

03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:32.960
them as dynamically. Well, you've shared this intuition a few times already that the larger

03:40:32.960 --> 03:40:40.480
number of states somehow correlates to greater possibility of life. But it's also possible

03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:46.000
the constraints are essential here. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but coming back to the you worry that

03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:55.520
something's lost, I agree. But I think that we will get to an AGI. But I wonder if it's not,

03:40:56.080 --> 03:41:00.400
it can't be separate from human, it can't be separate from human consciousness, because

03:41:00.400 --> 03:41:06.400
the causal chain that produced it came from humans. So what I kind of try and suggest heavily to

03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:12.960
people worry about the existential threat of AI saying, I mean, you put it much more elegantly

03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:18.560
earlier, like we should worry about dark algorithms written by human beings on Twitter,

03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:24.800
driving us insane, right? And doing acting in odd ways. Yeah, I think intelligence,

03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:33.040
this is what I have been in eloquent in trying to describe it, partially because I try not to think

03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:37.680
too deeply through this stuff, because then you become a philosopher, I still aspire to

03:41:37.680 --> 03:41:47.600
actually building a bunch of stuff. But my sense is super intelligence leads to deep integration

03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:54.320
into human society. So like intelligence is strongly correlated, like intelligence,

03:41:54.320 --> 03:42:01.440
the way we conceive of intelligence materializes as a thing that becomes a fun

03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:09.840
entity to have at a party with humans. So it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor,

03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:16.880
like intelligence like knowledge, ability to do reasoning and so on, but also humor, emotional

03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:26.880
intelligence, ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams, to play the game of human

03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:32.720
civilization, the push and pull, the whole dance of it, the whole dance of life. And I think that

03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:39.360
kind of super intelligent being is not the thing that worries me. I think that ultimately will

03:42:39.360 --> 03:42:46.480
enrich life. It's again, the DOM algorithms, the DOM algorithms that scale in the hands of people

03:42:46.480 --> 03:42:52.720
that are too don't study history, that don't study human psychology and human nature, just applying

03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:57.920
too broadly for selfish near term interests. That's the biggest danger.

03:42:58.480 --> 03:43:04.960
Yeah, I think it's not a new danger, right? I now know how I should use Twitter and how I

03:43:04.960 --> 03:43:10.800
shouldn't use Twitter. I like to provoke people into thinking. I don't want to provoke people

03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:15.600
into outrage. It's not fun. It's not a good thing for humans to do. And I think that when you get

03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:21.040
people into outrage, they take sides. And taking sides is really bad. But I think that we're all

03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:26.160
beginning to see this. And I think that actually, I'm very optimistic about how things will evolve.

03:43:26.160 --> 03:43:33.200
Because, you know, I wonder how much productivity has Twitter and social media taken out of

03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:38.800
humanity? Because how many now? I mean, so the good thing about Twitter is it gives power,

03:43:38.800 --> 03:43:45.600
so it gives voice to minorities, right? And that's good, in some degree. But I wonder how much

03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:49.760
voice does it give to all sorts of other

03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:56.080
problems that don't need this emerge? By the way, when you say minorities, I think,

03:43:57.680 --> 03:44:02.800
or at least if I were to agree with you, what I would say is minorities broadly defined in these

03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:12.800
small groups of people that it magnifies the concerns of the small versus the big.

03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:19.840
That is good to some degree. But I think, I mean, I have to be careful because I think I have a very,

03:44:20.800 --> 03:44:24.960
I mean, I think that the world isn't that broken, right? I think the world is pretty cool place.

03:44:24.960 --> 03:44:31.600
I think academia is really great. I think climate change presents a really interesting problem for

03:44:31.600 --> 03:44:37.680
humanity that we will solve. I like how you said it's a pretty cool problem for civilization. It's

03:44:37.680 --> 03:44:45.840
a big one. There's a bunch of really, really big problems that if solved can significantly improve

03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:51.440
the quality of life for a large, that ultimately is what we're trying to do. Improve how awesome life

03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:56.560
is for the maximum number of people. Yeah. And I think that the coming back to consciousness,

03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:02.000
I don't think the universe is doomed to heat death, right? It's one of the optimists. That's why I want

03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:05.760
to kind of nudge you into thinking that time is fundamental. Because if time is fundamental,

03:45:05.760 --> 03:45:11.520
then suddenly you don't have to give it back. The universe just constructs stuff. And what

03:45:11.520 --> 03:45:15.840
we see around us in our construction, I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization

03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:21.280
is. And I mean, look at the fundamentals. We're good until the sun expands, right?

03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:26.400
We've got quite a lot of resource on earth. We're trying to be quite cooperative. Humans are nice

03:45:26.400 --> 03:45:33.040
to each other when they're not under enormous stress. But coming back to the consciousness

03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:38.880
thing, are we going to send human beings to Mars or conscious robots to Mars? Or are we going to

03:45:38.880 --> 03:45:44.960
send some hybrid? And I don't know the answer to that question right now. I guess Elon's going

03:45:44.960 --> 03:45:51.360
to have a pretty good go at getting there. I'm not sure whether I have my doubts, but I'm not

03:45:51.360 --> 03:45:57.680
qualified. I'm sure people have their doubts that computation works. But I've got it working.

03:45:58.160 --> 03:46:06.960
And most of the cool technologies we have today, and take for granted, like the airplane,

03:46:06.960 --> 03:46:13.440
aforementioned airplane, were things that people doubted. Like majority of people doubted before

03:46:13.440 --> 03:46:19.760
they came to life. And they come to life. And speaking of hybrid AI and humans, it's fascinating

03:46:19.760 --> 03:46:25.280
to think about all the different ways that hybridization, that merger can happen. I mean,

03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:29.440
currently I have a smartphone, so there's already a hybrid. But there's all kinds of

03:46:29.440 --> 03:46:35.680
ways that hybrid happens, how we and other technology play together, like a computer.

03:46:35.680 --> 03:46:43.360
How that changes the fabric of human civilization is wide open. Who knows? Who knows? If you remove

03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:52.160
cancer, if you remove major diseases from humanity,

03:46:52.800 --> 03:46:58.160
there's going to be a bunch of consequences we're not anticipating. Many of them positive,

03:46:59.120 --> 03:47:05.440
but many of them negative. Many of them, most of them, at least I hope, are weird and wonderful

03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:11.040
and fun in ways that are totally unexpected. And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of

03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:16.400
Jack Daniels and a rock, we'll say, kids these days don't appreciate how hard we had it back in

03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:22.880
the day. I got to ask you, speaking of nudging, you and Yosha Bach

03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:29.840
nudge each other on Twitter quite a bit in wonderful intellectual debates. And of course,

03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:33.680
for people who don't know, Yosha Bach is this brilliant guy. He's been on the podcast a couple

03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:41.040
times. You tweeted, or he tweeted, Yosha Bach, everyone should follow him as well.

03:47:41.040 --> 03:47:48.080
You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin, Dr. Lee Cronin. He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin.

03:47:48.080 --> 03:47:53.680
We discussed that while we can translate every working model of existence into a Turing machine,

03:47:54.320 --> 03:48:00.320
the structure of the universe might be given by wakes of nonexistence in a pattern generated by

03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:08.560
all possible automata, which exists by default. And then he followed on saying, face to face is

03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:17.040
the best. So the dinner was face to face. What is Yosha talking about in wakes, quote, wakes of

03:48:17.040 --> 03:48:24.240
nonexistence in a pattern generated by all possible automata, which exists by default.

03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:32.240
So automata exists by default, apparently. And then there's wakes of nonexistence with the hells

03:48:32.960 --> 03:48:38.960
nonexistence in the universe. And also in another conversation,

03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:46.320
you tweeted its state machines all the way down, which presumably is the origin story of this

03:48:46.320 --> 03:48:54.400
dinner discussion. And then Yosha said, again, nudging, nudging, nudging slash trolling.

03:48:55.440 --> 03:49:01.600
Yosha said, you've seen the light, welcome friend. Many foundational physicists effectively believe

03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:07.840
in some form of hypercomputation. Lee is coming around to this idea. And then you said,

03:49:08.480 --> 03:49:13.120
I think there are notable differences. First, I think the universe does not have to be a computer.

03:49:13.120 --> 03:49:18.560
Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges constructors that build computers. And

03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:28.480
third is that there is something below church Turing. Okay. What the heck is this dinner

03:49:28.480 --> 03:49:35.040
conversation about? Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit. Are there

03:49:35.040 --> 03:49:41.760
interesting agreements or disagreements between Ewan and Joshua Bach that can elucidate some

03:49:41.760 --> 03:49:47.040
of the other topics we've been talking about? Yeah. So Yash has an incredible mind and he has,

03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:55.360
he's so well read and uses language really elegantly. It bamboozles me at times. So I'm

03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:03.040
so often I'm using, I'm describing concepts in a way that I built from the ground up.

03:50:03.040 --> 03:50:07.440
And so we misunderstand each other a lot. And he's floating in the clouds, is that what you're

03:50:07.440 --> 03:50:12.160
saying? Something like, not quite, but I think so this concept of a Turing machine. So a Turing

03:50:12.160 --> 03:50:19.040
machine, Turing machines, I would argue, and I think this is not the Turing machine, the universe

03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:23.920
is not a Turing machine. Biology is not even a Turing machine, right? And because Turing

03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:28.240
machines don't evolve, right? There's a, there is this problem that people see Turing machines

03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:32.640
everywhere. But is an interest in the universe gave rise to biology that gave rise to intelligence

03:50:32.640 --> 03:50:37.520
that gave rise to Alan Turing, who invented the abstraction of the Turing machine, and allowed

03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:44.640
us to digitize. And, and so I've been looking for the mystery at the origin of life, the origin

03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:49.920
of intelligence and the origin of this. And I, when I discussed with Yash, I think Yash, he was

03:50:49.920 --> 03:50:54.160
saying, well, the universe of course, the universe is a Turing machine, of course, there's a,

03:50:54.160 --> 03:50:59.040
there's a hyper computer there. And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms.

03:50:59.680 --> 03:51:04.080
Because of course, it's possible for a Turing machine or computers to exist in the universe,

03:51:04.080 --> 03:51:09.440
we have them. But what I'm trying to understand is, where did the transition of continuous to

03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:15.520
discrete occur? And I've been, and this is because of my, my general foolishness of understanding

03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:25.200
the continuous. But I guess what I'm trying to say is, there were constructors before there

03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:31.840
were abstractors. Because how did the universe abstract itself into existence? And it goes

03:51:31.840 --> 03:51:35.120
back to earlier saying, could the universe of intelligence have come first?

03:51:35.120 --> 03:51:37.120
What's the constructor, what's an abstractor?

03:51:37.200 --> 03:51:44.240
So the abstractor is the ability of, say, of Alan Turing and Goodall and Church

03:51:45.040 --> 03:51:52.160
to think about the mathematical universe and to label things. And then from those labels to come

03:51:52.160 --> 03:51:58.720
up with a set of axioms with those labels, and to basically understand the universe mathematically

03:51:58.720 --> 03:52:04.640
and say, okay, I can label things. But where did the labeler come from? Where is the prime labeler?

03:52:04.720 --> 03:52:14.400
Even if the universe is not a Turing computer, does that negate the possibility that a Turing

03:52:14.400 --> 03:52:19.520
computer can simulate the universe? Like, just because the abstraction was formed at a later time,

03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:24.720
does that mean that abstraction? This is to our cellular automata conversation.

03:52:24.720 --> 03:52:25.200
Yeah.

03:52:25.200 --> 03:52:29.280
You were taking away some of the magic from the cellular automata because very intelligent

03:52:29.280 --> 03:52:32.240
biological systems came up with that cellular automata.

03:52:32.240 --> 03:52:36.800
Well, this is where the existence is the default, right? The fact that we exist and we

03:52:36.800 --> 03:52:41.040
can come up with a Turing machine, does that mean the universe has to be a Turing machine as well?

03:52:41.920 --> 03:52:46.880
But can it be a Turing machine though? So there has to be in a canopy?

03:52:46.880 --> 03:52:56.240
Can it be? Sure. I don't understand if it has to be or not. Can it be? But can the universe have

03:52:56.800 --> 03:53:01.840
Turing machines in it? Sure. They do exist now. I'm wondering though,

03:53:03.760 --> 03:53:09.360
maybe, and this is Ren, if things get really hairy, is I think the universe maybe in the past

03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:13.200
did not have the computational power that it has now.

03:53:17.760 --> 03:53:23.920
This is almost like a law of physics. So the computational power is not

03:53:26.960 --> 03:53:31.840
you can get some free lunch? Yeah. I mean, the fact that we now, we sit here in this period

03:53:31.840 --> 03:53:35.280
in time and we can imagine all these robots and all these machines and we built them.

03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:39.680
And so we can easily imagine going back in time that the universe was capable of having them,

03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:45.200
but I don't think it can. So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally.

03:53:45.200 --> 03:53:49.280
And I think that's why I don't want to go back to the time discussion, but I think it has some

03:53:49.280 --> 03:53:53.840
relationship with it. The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be and is going to

03:53:53.840 --> 03:54:00.480
continue getting smarter over time because of novelty generation and the ability to create

03:54:00.480 --> 03:54:05.120
objects within objects within objects. You know, there's a perhaps as grounded in physics,

03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:11.680
there's intuition of conservation that stuff is conserved. Like, you're not, you've always had

03:54:11.680 --> 03:54:17.840
all everything, you're just rearranging books on the bookshelf through time.

03:54:18.480 --> 03:54:21.600
So you're saying like new books are being written.

03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:25.040
Which laws do you want to break? The origin of the origin of the Big Bang,

03:54:25.760 --> 03:54:28.640
you had to break the second law because we got order for free. Yeah.

03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:32.240
Well, what I'm telling you now is that the energy isn't conserved in the universe.

03:54:33.280 --> 03:54:35.360
Oh, it's the second law. Okay, I got you.

03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:38.000
So because, but not in a mad way.

03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:46.400
Okay, so computation potentially is not conserved, which is a fascinating idea.

03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:52.160
Intelligence is not conserved. Complexity is not conserved.

03:54:54.560 --> 03:55:00.080
I suppose that's deeply connected to time being fundamental.

03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:06.720
The natural consequence of that is if time is fundamental, and the universe is inflating in

03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:12.640
time, if you like, then there are one or two conservation laws that we need to have a look at.

03:55:12.880 --> 03:55:18.160
And I wonder if that means the total energy of the universe is actually increasing over time.

03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:25.600
And I might, this may be completely ludicrous, but we do have all this dark energy that we have,

03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:30.240
we have some anomalies, let's say, dark matter and dark energy. If we don't add them in,

03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:36.560
galaxies, so dark matter, I think doesn't, doesn't hold, you know, you need to hold the galaxies

03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:40.320
together. And there's some other observational issues. Could dark energy just be time?

03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:47.680
So figuring out what dark energy is might give us some deep clues about this,

03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:52.560
not just time, but the consequences of time.

03:55:53.120 --> 03:55:57.280
So it could be that, I mean, I'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed in this

03:55:57.280 --> 03:56:03.680
free lunch, but I'm saying if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric, and it appears to be,

03:56:04.640 --> 03:56:11.600
and it's generating novelty, and it appears to, couldn't that just be a mechanistically how

03:56:11.600 --> 03:56:20.000
reality works? And therefore, I don't really like this idea that the, so I want to live in

03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:26.240
a deterministic universe that is undetermined. Right? The only way I can do that is if time

03:56:26.240 --> 03:56:31.360
is fundamental. Because otherwise, it's all, all the rest of us just, it's just slight of hand,

03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:37.360
because the physicists will say, yes, everything's deterministic, Newton is Newtonian mechanics

03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:43.120
is deterministic, quantum mechanics is deterministic, let's take the Everettian view. And then basically,

03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:47.920
we can just draw out this massive universe branching, but it closes again, we get it all back.

03:56:47.920 --> 03:56:53.200
And don't worry, your feeling of free will is effective. But what the physicists are actually

03:56:53.200 --> 03:57:01.200
saying is the entire future is mapped out. And that is clearly, problematical. And clearly,

03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:07.280
because that's not so clear. Yeah, it's just, it's just problematic.

03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:13.040
Yeah, yeah, so it's, because that maybe is just the way it is. It's problematic to you,

03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:16.800
but the creature along the timeline. I want to reduce the number of beliefs I need to

03:57:16.800 --> 03:57:23.120
understand the universe. So if time is fundamental, I don't need to have magic order at the beginning,

03:57:23.840 --> 03:57:28.720
and I don't need a second law. But you do need the magical belief that time is fundamental.

03:57:28.720 --> 03:57:34.240
Well, I need the, I need the observation that I'm seeing to be just the how it is all the way down.

03:57:34.240 --> 03:57:42.000
But the earth also looks flat. If you, if you agree with your observation, so we can't necessarily

03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:46.240
trust our observation. I know the earth isn't flat because I can send the satellite into space.

03:57:46.240 --> 03:57:50.480
No, but now you see, now you're using the tools, the science and the technology.

03:57:50.480 --> 03:57:54.080
But I'm using, what I'm saying, I'm going to do experiments that start to show.

03:57:54.960 --> 03:58:01.120
I mean, I think that it's worth, so if you can't, so if I cannot do an experiment or

03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:05.840
a thought experiment that will test this assumption, then the assumption is without

03:58:05.840 --> 03:58:12.000
merit really in the end. You know, that's, it's fine. So that's a beautiful idea you hold yourself

03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:19.280
to. That's, that's a, that's given that you think deeply in a philosophical way, you think about

03:58:19.280 --> 03:58:25.600
some of these really important issues and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory.

03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:33.200
It's really nice that you're always grounded with experiment. That's, that's so refreshing.

03:58:33.200 --> 03:58:40.480
That's so beautifully refreshing. Now that we're holding you to the grounded and experiment

03:58:40.480 --> 03:58:44.560
to the harsh truth of reality. Let me ask the big, the big ridiculous question.

03:58:45.280 --> 03:58:48.960
What is the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life?

03:58:48.960 --> 03:58:55.760
Why this time is fundamental. It's marching forward and along this

03:58:56.720 --> 03:59:04.480
long timeline come along a bunch of descendants of apes that have come up with cellular automata

03:59:04.480 --> 03:59:11.760
and computers and now computers. Why? I have so many different answers to this question.

03:59:11.760 --> 03:59:16.400
It depends on, on what day I would say that given the way of the conversation we had today,

03:59:16.400 --> 03:59:22.560
I'd say the meaning. Well, we make our own meaning. I think that's fine. But I think the universe wants

03:59:22.560 --> 03:59:29.600
to explore every possible configuration that it's allowed us to explore. And this goes back to the

03:59:29.600 --> 03:59:34.480
kind of question that you're asking about Yasha and the existence and non-existence of things,

03:59:34.480 --> 03:59:38.400
right? So if the universe is a Turing machine is churning through a lot of states

03:59:39.360 --> 03:59:44.240
and you think about combinatorial theory before assembly theory, so everything is possible.

03:59:45.120 --> 03:59:51.280
What Yasha and I were saying is, well, not everything is, we don't see the combinatorial

03:59:51.280 --> 03:59:58.400
explosion. We see something else. And what we see is evidence of memory. So there's,

03:59:58.400 --> 04:00:04.000
there clearly seems to be some interference between the combinatorial explosion of things

04:00:04.080 --> 04:00:09.440
and what the universe allows. And it's like this kind of constructive, destructive interference.

04:00:10.560 --> 04:00:17.600
So maybe the universe is not just about, it is assembling objects in space and time.

04:00:18.160 --> 04:00:23.680
And those objects are able to search more space and time and the universe is just infinitely

04:00:23.680 --> 04:00:29.120
creative. And I guess I'm searching for why the universe is infinitely creative is infinitely

04:00:29.120 --> 04:00:33.680
creative. And maybe the meaning is just simply to make as many objects create as many things as

04:00:33.680 --> 04:00:38.560
possible. And I see a future of the universe that doesn't result in the heat there for the universe.

04:00:38.560 --> 04:00:44.320
The universe is going to extract every ounce of creativity it can out of it because that's

04:00:44.320 --> 04:00:50.400
what we see on earth, right? And if you think that almost like intelligence is not conserved that

04:00:50.400 --> 04:00:58.560
maybe creativity isn't either, maybe like it's an infinite well. So like creativity is ultimately

04:00:58.640 --> 04:01:04.400
tied to novelty. You're coming up with cool new configurations of things and maybe that just

04:01:04.400 --> 04:01:10.720
can continue indefinitely. And this human species that was created along the way is probably just

04:01:12.320 --> 04:01:18.560
one method like that's able to ask the universe about itself. It's just one way to explore

04:01:18.560 --> 04:01:24.240
creativity. Maybe there's other meta levels on top of that. Like obviously as a collective

04:01:24.240 --> 04:01:31.600
intelligence will create organisms, maybe there'll be organisms that ask themselves questions about

04:01:31.600 --> 04:01:39.280
themselves in a deeper, bigger picture way that we humans do. First to ask questions about the

04:01:39.280 --> 04:01:44.960
humans and then construct some kind of hybrid systems that ask themselves about the collective

04:01:44.960 --> 04:01:48.960
aspect. Just like some weird stacking that we can't even imagine yet.

04:01:48.960 --> 04:01:53.360
And that stacking, I mean, I've discussed this stacking a lot with Sarah Walker who's a professor

04:01:53.440 --> 04:02:02.000
of physics and astrobiology at ASU. And we argue about how creative the universe is going to be

04:02:02.000 --> 04:02:07.920
and is it just deterministic and all that because I think she's more of a free will thinker and I'm

04:02:07.920 --> 04:02:13.280
of a less free will thinker, but I think we're beginning to converge and understanding that

04:02:13.920 --> 04:02:18.080
because there's simply a missing understanding right now that we don't understand how the

04:02:18.080 --> 04:02:22.960
universe, we don't know what rules the universe has to allow the universe to contemplate itself.

04:02:23.440 --> 04:02:28.880
So asking the meaning of it before we even know what those rules are is premature, but my guess

04:02:28.880 --> 04:02:33.840
is that it's not meaningless and it isn't just about that. And there are three levels of meanings.

04:02:33.840 --> 04:02:37.280
Obviously the universe wants us to do stuff. We're interacting with each other. So we create

04:02:37.280 --> 04:02:42.720
meaning in our own society and our own interactions with humanity. But I do think there is something

04:02:42.720 --> 04:02:50.640
else going on. But because reality is so weird, we're just scratching at that. And I think that

04:02:50.640 --> 04:02:57.280
we have to make the experiments better. And we have to perhaps join across not just for the

04:02:57.280 --> 04:03:01.920
computation lists and what I tried to do with Yasha is meet him halfway. So what happens if I

04:03:01.920 --> 04:03:07.120
become a computation list? What do I gain? A lot, it turns out, because I can make Turing machines

04:03:07.120 --> 04:03:11.120
in the universe. Because on the one hand, I'm making computers, which are state machines inspired

04:03:11.120 --> 04:03:15.840
by Turing. On the other hand, I'm saying they can't exist. Well, clearly, that's that I can't

04:03:15.840 --> 04:03:20.320
have my cake and eat it. So there's something weird going on there. So then did the universe have to

04:03:20.320 --> 04:03:24.240
make a continuous to discrete transition or is the universe just discrete? It's probably just

04:03:24.240 --> 04:03:31.200
discrete. So if it's just discrete, then there are, I will then give Yasha his Turing like property

04:03:31.200 --> 04:03:35.360
in the universe. But maybe there's something else below it, which is the constructor that constructs

04:03:35.360 --> 04:03:42.400
the Turing machine, that then constructs, you know, is a bit like the, you generate a computing

04:03:42.400 --> 04:03:47.840
system that then is able to build an abstraction that then recognizes, it can make a generalizable

04:03:47.840 --> 04:03:53.760
abstraction because human beings with mathematics have been able to go on and build

04:03:53.760 --> 04:03:58.720
physical computers, if that makes any sense. And I think that's the meaning. I think that's,

04:03:58.720 --> 04:04:03.360
you know, as far as we can, the meaning will be further elucidated with further experiments.

04:04:06.720 --> 04:04:13.920
Well, you mentioned Sarah, I think you and Sarah Walker are just these fascinating human beings.

04:04:14.880 --> 04:04:20.080
I'm really fortunate to have the opportunity to be in your presence to study your work,

04:04:20.080 --> 04:04:26.400
to follow along with your work. I'm a big fan. Like I told you offline, I hope we get a chance

04:04:26.400 --> 04:04:32.080
to talk again with perhaps just the two of us, but also with Sarah, that's a fascinating dynamic

04:04:33.760 --> 04:04:38.080
for people who haven't heard. I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk,

04:04:38.080 --> 04:04:43.120
but you have an incredible dynamic. And I also can't wait to hear you and Yasha talk.

04:04:43.120 --> 04:04:49.760
So I think if there's some point in this predetermined or yet to be determined future

04:04:51.440 --> 04:04:58.080
where the three of us, you and Sarah or the four of us with Yasha, could meet and talk would be

04:04:58.080 --> 04:05:04.480
a beautiful future. And I look forward to most futures, but I look forward to that one in particular.

04:05:04.480 --> 04:05:08.160
Lee, thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today.

04:05:08.160 --> 04:05:09.440
Thanks, Lex. It's been a pleasure.

04:05:10.400 --> 04:05:15.440
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin. To support this podcast, please check

04:05:15.440 --> 04:05:20.800
out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from the mad

04:05:20.800 --> 04:05:29.280
scientist Rick Sanchez of Rick and Morty fame. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise,

04:05:29.280 --> 04:05:36.400
you're just an inner chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows

04:05:36.400 --> 04:05:42.000
you. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
