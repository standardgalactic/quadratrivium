0	5440	The following is a conversation with Ye, the legendary artist, producer and designer, formerly
5440	10160	known as Kanye West on this, the Lex Friedman podcast.
11360	19520	Based off of our connection and just you being a friend, I need to show you my two tech companies
19520	24000	and get your perspective on it. Because now I have friends that can give a perspective. Like
24000	27600	when I would work on albums, I had other friends that worked on albums and they would give me
27600	31840	their perspectives on it. You want to do this? We are doing it. This is part of it. This is part
31840	36400	of it? Absolutely. All right. Beautiful. Oh, well, I wanted to finish. The thing is, okay,
36400	41040	you're going to ask me different questions, but I'm about growing and building and bringing
41040	47920	the idea to life. So when I see you, I say, oh, this guy understands how to hire engineers.
47920	52240	Where I'm coming from, coming from Hollywood, coming from press, coming from media,
52960	59280	all of the guys, so many of the guys that have been like voices and faces and talking heads,
59280	64880	whatever, have not understood how to engineer product. And that's the reason why I was able
64880	71360	to jump past everyone in the entertainment field and become whatever the net worth is.
71920	77280	I'm going to stop putting the whole black thing on my worth. Let's just see where I am
77280	82640	on the scale of life, because that's a cop out for me to say, rich is black guy of all time,
82640	89600	because that's feeding into the same trauma economy that Black Lives Matter feeds into.
89600	95680	That's why I love and respect engineers. That's the only thing that we really need to teach
95680	101520	in school is engineering. We don't need to teach history. We don't need to teach anything
101520	107840	that is subjective. It needs to only be engineering, taught in school, and everything
107840	116080	else needs to be recessed. Any force subjective information is just to weaken and indoctrinate
116960	121840	our species. And that's what schools do now. As an engineer, I love hearing you say that,
121840	127360	but to push back, history is not, the interpretation of history might be subjective,
127360	133040	but history has some facts, and they're useful to give a grounding to the way you do engineering.
133040	140160	I don't 100% believe in anything, any concept of the future or any concept of history,
140160	146640	because history was just written by the victors. If I see stuff happen on the day,
146640	152080	that later that day, is reported wrong. How wrong is something reported a thousand years ago?
152640	158480	And why would we argue about something that's not in the now? Because that's the only thing that
159040	162800	everyone can agree upon is that it is now, right now.
162800	167920	Yeah. Well, you try not to make the mistakes of the past. That's the usefulness of history,
167920	169200	the limited usefulness of history.
169200	172720	The biggest mistake from the past that we keep making is looking at the past.
173360	176000	Too much. Giving too much value to the past.
176000	181200	Too much value to the past. We are now. We are now. We are here. We are one species.
181200	188560	We are one race. We're here. And it's time. And the leadership is changing,
188560	193440	because you have Elon as a leader. Yay, as a leader. And we are the top leaders.
194000	195680	We're more influential than the presidents.
196560	202480	So you're a human being with engineering challenges before you, with the STEM player,
202480	206880	with Parler. What's the hardest thing in front of you on the engineering front?
206880	212160	That's the first sentence that any of our species needs to hear when they're born.
212880	216480	You are a human being with engineering challenges,
216480	221280	and I consider challenges to be opportunities in front of you.
221280	223680	Literally, like, let me see a piece of paper. I need to write that down.
223680	226960	That's the beginning of our new species constitution.
228800	232000	I'm going to do the paper like this wide, put it in widescreen.
232080	248000	This, this for Ridley, you are, no, let me like, you are a being
248000	266640	with engineering opportunities or challenges opportunities.
269200	274560	I'm sorry, I don't spell as good as John Legend opportunities
274800	285040	and before you. I like the before, because it can mean,
285040	290960	actually it can mean forward or before you. This right here, I've always said I'm the top five
290960	297280	writer in human existence, but this is like, this right here is pushing me to like number four,
297280	299440	number three. It's a good one.
299440	303280	Because who would you say is the top, it's top writer in human existence, we know who it is.
303280	304800	That's subjective. Who's that?
304800	308800	It's factual though. It's like, okay, who's the top person in tech history?
309600	310560	It's not subjective.
311840	312320	Wow.
312320	319600	There's a non-subjective answer to both of those. Both of those people have influenced
320720	323520	30% of our existence.
323520	327600	So the influence is the main metric of greatness.
327600	332480	Okay, one person, 30% of our language was, the English language was written by them,
332480	335760	the other person, 30% of the products we use was led by them.
336640	338560	So 30% of our language was written by them.
338560	341920	Oh, Shakespeare, and then the product, product, product, product.
343520	344160	Steve Jobs.
346160	351280	You put Steve above like Elon's of the world, because Steve was a designer, not,
351280	355680	he's a designer engineer, but he's a designer, he's a visionary in the design space.
355680	358000	Well, I would lean to him because I'm not an engineer, right?
358000	358560	So I'm more like-
358560	362080	Then you're an engineer. If Steve is an engineer, you're an engineer.
362240	363200	Essentially.
363200	364880	He's a cultural engineer.
364880	368960	Like the people who run the emotions of the world and run the world off of people's
368960	372880	emotions right now are social engineers.
372880	377600	And social engineering is so important, like city design.
377600	379040	There's a fancier word for that.
380080	385120	But I was in Oxner last night to see Anthony Jeselnick.
385920	391440	And I gotta find out what his opening joke was, because I'm doing interviews and I'm thinking
391440	396400	I'm funny. And I like that he said, he's just kept on saying 20 year anniversary,
396400	397680	I've been doing this for 20 years.
398400	405360	And his opening joke was so high level, I realized that I wasn't funny.
405360	409200	I realized that this dude is a professional at what he does.
409200	411520	And so many things are subjective. I always talk about this.
411520	417920	It's like, you know, people are arguing like, is Emily Radikowski the hottest, you know, person?
417920	422960	And I'm like, that's such a subjective thing.
422960	428720	But like if you go and shoot three pointers with Steph Curry, it's not subjective, right?
428720	433760	Or if you go and compare bank accounts with Elon, it's not subjective.
433760	436640	And another thing that's not subjective, porn.
438480	439600	What about it?
439600	442240	Dicksize. It's not subjective. You can measure.
442320	450080	But porn is more about more than just dicksize.
450080	453600	And greatness is more than the size of the bank account, right?
453600	454800	So there's a subjective.
454800	456160	But greatness is subjective though.
456800	462960	Right. So do you care about the stuff that's objective or subjective more?
464640	468640	Because greatness to me is what matters. The bank account comes and goes.
469600	473200	The impact on our society, like you said, social engineering,
473200	475760	the impact on the collective intelligence of our species,
476320	479360	that what permeates throughout the rest of the time.
479360	485040	I like what you said. The impact, I'm taking notes.
485040	487120	How did you say the impact?
487120	489120	On the collective intelligence of our species.
489120	494160	The impact on the collective.
494720	505600	And yeah, it's writing down the words that came out of my dumb mouth.
506240	507360	I have made it in life.
510720	514240	There's a lot of people that have kind of like sat through.
514240	516800	I wanted to wear a different color hoodie because I was just tired of saying this hoodie
516800	522640	in all the interviews. And there's a lot of kids that are with me.
522640	523680	They see what I'm saying.
524240	529200	And they had to sit through all of the muck of all the previous interviews to get to this.
530080	539920	Every interview has been just an emotional, it's just like been an argument up to this point.
540640	548960	This is the first of, this is the next frontier of where our species is going to head.
549520	551280	It starts here. It starts with you, Lex.
552080	557600	So this is the first time I heard you say the word engineering at least so many times,
557600	560080	which I love hearing. So this is where you're at.
560800	565680	You're like that newborn. You're a being with engineering opportunities.
565680	569280	Yeah. And we're all a newborn because in Christianity we say born again.
569280	574800	We're all newborns and everyone can, everyone's shell, like the word can.
575520	583840	The only thing about shell is it kind of dictates and can kind of let people off the hook.
583840	590800	So I haven't found the perfect post Shakespeare and post Steve Jobs and post Elon and post
590800	602160	Yay and post Drake way to communicate this. But we update and we do. And what the current
602160	605760	media structure, no, it's not actually nothing is holding us.
605760	610800	There's nothing actually holding us back because I'm still alive. I'm still alive.
610800	615680	Like they could have killed me at, you know, George Bush don't care about black people.
615680	621360	They could have killed me at Beyonce had the best video, but we're here now.
621360	625440	So we just keep on leaning and leaning and leaning. And there's these things where I just
625440	632480	think about, you know, there'll be times when I'm at war and every now and then when the,
633040	638560	when the bomb stopped going off and all the headlines and the smearing and all that stopped
638560	645200	going off, I think about my family and I think about Kim and I think about how, you know,
645760	651440	King Koopa has her in the castle right now. And just on Mario Brothers, you know how it is,
651760	658320	you go for the princess and you get to this level and it's like, I'm like, I sung the song
658320	663360	wrong, right? And then they take the princess again. Which one are you, Mario? Yeah.
666080	673120	What's your favorite thing, the thing you love the most about Kim? From a Mario perspective
673120	680800	and the princess? Looking back. Was there a moment? She's definitely my favorite of all time.
680800	687760	Yeah. Was there a moment that, you know, like that catches you off guard and you say, I love this
687760	704080	human being? Yeah. I mean, it's just the DNA is like, she's a mix of Rob and Chris.
704400	711440	Can you explain? I mean, that's like a really high pool right there.
713680	715840	Those are like two geniuses.
718800	726480	So, okay. So like the entire history of evolution of the human species created this DNA. They
726480	731600	created this being. There's a life there. There's a set of memories and a history that brought you
731680	738400	together and you're like, damn, I like this DNA. Yeah. And so certain people have just like high
739200	745760	DNA. Ivanka Trump has high DNA. You know, it's like- How's your DNA? Pretty good.
747760	752800	I think we've seen that. It's been proven. I mean, but look at my mom and look at my dad.
752800	756000	You know, me and my dad have a water purification center in the DR
756320	764240	right now. And my dad is the original Steve Jobs and he was blocked by people around him
764240	768800	and people were using him and taking advantage and, you know, not believing in his vision.
768800	774000	My dad's the educated version of yay. What did you learn about life from your dad?
775440	781600	And my dad got girls too. But those are small details. That's a big detail. Being that I found
781680	788320	my dad's, you know, playboy when I was five years old, it greatly affected my motivation.
789120	792320	Yeah. Okay. So that's part of the engine that drives, yay.
792320	799200	Absolutely. I remember when Pharrell was first in all the videos and my girl was like,
800160	803200	girls like Pharrell. And I was like, I want girls that like me too.
803840	807520	Funny that that's behind all the ambition, all the drive.
808240	811280	That's how we make people. That's how people are made.
812240	819440	It's the desire to be loved. Is that at the individual level just being noticed and also
819440	826400	at the societal level of scale? Well, now I've gone past. I'm like at that place
827200	836240	where Nikolai Tesla was later into his career where it wasn't about being loved. It wasn't
836240	843360	about sitting at the dinner parties next to Anna Wintour and stuff. It was about getting the idea
843360	853040	across. So I have these cells that are very, and I just keep on saying really Scott, but
853040	860400	really Scott has a special anointing. It isn't just sci-fi what he's doing. There's something in
860560	865520	there just like George Lucas. There's something different that's there.
868720	876000	So what are you drawing? I'm drawing these new living cells that we will exist in.
877440	881600	And this is over. Okay, let's do like,
882560	890480	I don't like talking about money because man made money anyway. It's like four quadrillion
891360	897440	respected dollars, and then you have other forms of currency. Of course, social currency is super
897440	907680	important right now, but this is a drawing and it's at a pretty good place now. This would be 40,000
907680	911280	square feet. I want to start just talking in meters. I just think we should go to
912400	916240	anything to restore the tower of Basil like they said when the,
918800	926560	I'm just draw a person here for scale. Yeah, that would help. Okay. What do you think of that?
926560	933920	Look at my person see the scale in this room. All right. So wait, the dot is the person? Yeah.
934880	940240	I'm saying it's 40,000 square feet, but that would be like. What are the other parts of the cell?
941280	945440	Okay, so what it's a screen. It doesn't go all the way to the top and it's one
946000	950960	hole for light, but the water and the light and air all come in from the top. So that's like
952640	959360	like the mouth and then this is the belly button. We're God's iPhone. We're his greatest creation.
960160	965760	So this is all connected. These are all connected. Yeah, some drawing how these other cells go next
965760	972320	to each other. What's the vision here? Happiness. Then we talk about like, what's the motivation?
972320	981840	Like, yeah, there's a motivation somewhere in the back of my mind of my family. And if it's like
982560	990080	where Moses smite the rock and God didn't allow him to get to the promised land,
990080	995920	because the promised land is family. That is the problem. That is earth. I mean, that is heaven
995920	1001840	or earth is family. Family is heaven. That's the promised land and for your family to be together.
1003520	1009760	So say I smite the rock and God doesn't let me have my family back. My mission
1010320	1020480	and life is still to promote families at all costs and make family's existence easier. So
1020480	1025520	you take this thing, you put localized, a localized farm, say if it's in community,
1025520	1032160	that we do localized growing and then we partner with Big Pharma and all and say,
1032160	1037680	hey, you're actually going to make more money by making better food. Because at the end of
1037680	1042400	the day, you want money right now. It's like everyone knows that between the pesticides and
1042400	1046160	between the medical industry and especially America that we're keeping people sick. And
1046160	1052240	we know that McDonald's makes food that kills people and Coca Cola selling sugar water and all
1052240	1059440	this like just in case I haven't pissed off enough people in power. You're going to piss off the
1059440	1066160	sugar. Anybody that's powered on sugar. Well, sugar, what's the health was actually a documentary
1066480	1072880	on sugar. It wasn't about how bad meat was. It was like a reverse documentary on sugar.
1073920	1077840	I don't know if you call it reverse like a sub, but if you watch it again, when they show sugar
1077840	1085840	and it's just the sugar looks super clean. Yeah, just as I state, as I state these things,
1086640	1093200	I know that I know I have protection. If I have God's protection, that's why I'm here
1093200	1099440	to this state, right? So it's for me to have this platform and express exactly what I feel
1099440	1106960	because it's kids out there, right? That it's kids that are going to save the world through
1106960	1116080	engineering and through facts. And I've got to get download as much of the information and as much
1116080	1121600	of the don't be afraid to state your facts is the biggest thing because the world is being
1121600	1127280	ran by fear. And that is, no, actually God runs the world, but there's just like little cloud,
1127280	1134080	this patina of our ego that deals with the money and the car and the girl we're dating and all
1134080	1137520	this in the clothes you wear and spending too much on clothes. And a lot of stuff that I've
1137520	1142160	been involved with promoting. So now what I'm promoting is you have the idea, you say it out loud,
1142160	1148240	like if you had Tourette's, say your truth out loud. If you hate, yeah, you hate me, say that
1148240	1157440	out loud, say whatever you feel out loud. Like you say it nonviolently, nonviolent. I have to
1157440	1165680	say that as a shout out to Alex Jones and Trump where they try to say that when they say their
1165680	1170640	truth's out loud that it's inciting violence. So let's be like really clear. I'm saying that
1171600	1178640	they have criminalized free thought. I hate when people use they, like they gets to blame for
1178640	1184720	everything, right? It's always they. Who the fuck is they? Exactly. The problem is they's us.
1185520	1192240	Yeah. Well, I love that. What we needed to do is turn I to we. So we take the responsibility
1192320	1201840	and turn they to us. So we take accountability to us. They to I to we and they to us.
1202720	1206720	And that relates, it's a language at the same time you're seeing the language
1206720	1213200	of our surroundings. You're seeing the language of, one of the things, okay, let's go back to the
1213200	1220080	cell explanation because I'm also doing a, what's that thing when Elon just put all the information
1220160	1225520	open and people could figure out, they could figure it out and open source. So I'm open sourcing
1225520	1235760	this idea right now so that, you know, engineers and anointed people beings, anointed beings can
1235760	1244560	collectively contribute to this, to push our species forward. So where I've got to with my
1244560	1251840	research is that there will be a hole at the top that allows natural light, natural air,
1252640	1258880	and there's a constant water system. So it becomes like a water city where it's a constant flow
1259840	1265120	that's not, it's, it's regenerative. It's not wasting the water and it's just a constant flow.
1265120	1272960	So I put the toilet really close to where this, this, I don't want to call it a wave pool,
1272960	1279840	but in the pool, the water is not still. So that exists in, in water, surrounded by water.
1279840	1284560	Well, the living room is, you have two rooms, you have the dry room, which people have called
1284560	1292240	a living room before, and then you have the wet room. How is that a source of happiness?
1293520	1298800	What is broken about our world today that that gives you in terms of the pursuit of
1298800	1303200	happiness is just one of the things in the previous declaration of it.
1303200	1310960	All of our buildings are based on just the industry and the economy. And then people lean
1310960	1318880	into what people are used to seeing. Like what we think is attractive, because then you go back to
1319360	1330880	the, you know, women who give life. So everyone wants to be attractive to the attractive.
1331520	1341920	And that's the reason why the media goes and gets, you know, Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian, Emily
1341920	1352080	Radikowski. Those are the only ones I'm going to, there's more. There's more, but I'm, I'm
1352080	1356720	thinking of ones that I think are attractive. It is subjective. Yeah, because it's subjective. So
1356720	1366880	to my subjective, which I think, I think the only guys that could argue with me on, on my opinion,
1366880	1372560	on girls would be Brad and Leo, because we're the only ones with the track record, you know,
1372560	1378560	everything else. So if everybody else is subjective, we've got history. So are you,
1378560	1384320	are you, are you happy? Absolutely. I'm just here. It's actually,
1384640	1395440	it's difficult to make me unhappy. Now I could deal with frustrations,
1396480	1402720	but when those frustrations are, it's like, when you've allowed people to be in your life that
1402720	1407920	shouldn't be there, and then they do the thing you knew they were going to do and you're screaming
1407920	1415600	at them, but you really need to scream at yourself. Yeah. So you realize anything that's like anger
1415600	1419680	or frustration, that's something that's wrong with you that needs to be dealt with.
1421280	1426400	Yes. Like right now, okay, say I got this pattern cutter that I wanted
1428480	1433280	to remove because I felt like she was copying our patterns into the computer,
1433280	1437120	and I didn't know why she wanted to do that. And I just wanted to do the patterns by hand.
1438000	1443920	And then, you know. You mean like automating the patterns? Yeah. And my head of it,
1443920	1445920	because they just, that's the whole thing. It's like,
1448160	1452960	it's a war of, it's a war of human beings and robots. Yeah, but that makes them more efficient,
1452960	1457680	right? You don't like the efficiency. You like the creativity of the singular nature of the pattern.
1457680	1462960	I believe that the human beings, and I'm saying this to you as a person who makes robots and a
1462960	1467840	person who's friends. I'm deeply offended right now. Yeah. But I'll, you know, I'll let it go.
1467840	1475280	Okay. So yeah, I believe that the- Yeah, it hates robots. I'm not gonna put that out. It's a joke.
1475280	1478800	Robots have feelings too. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That was also a joke.
1479440	1485760	We need to clarify that for future robots. But the pattern cutter, the pattern cutter,
1485760	1490240	you don't like that. That had to be that you can't have that part of your life.
1490320	1497200	That's not what I'm, I'm, my, everything that I'm doing is for
1501520	1508880	the sake of the human race. There's things in capitalism, there's things
1509760	1521200	in technology. Well, tech, technology and original human species can exist in a peaceful way.
1523200	1528800	As long as the people that know how to make robots aren't using their robots to control the humans.
1530080	1533840	Lex? Definitely something I have to be concerned about as we become more
1533920	1539120	technological savvy. That, my friend, is why engineering isn't everything,
1539840	1547360	that you have to desperately study the lessons of history. In Nazi Germany, science was used
1548000	1554880	to create atrocities. Engineering the same. Engineering could be a tool of war.
1555840	1561040	We are still in the Holocaust. A friend, a Jewish friend of mine said,
1564080	1569360	go visit the Holocaust Museum. And my response was, let's visit our Holocaust Museum, Planned
1569360	1575840	Parenthood. With all due respect, I grew up in the Soviet Union. I'm Jewish.
1576320	1586880	Parts of my family perished in the Holocaust of Nazi Germany. I have to push back that there is a
1586880	1593200	difference of the atrocities at that scale, at that time, on an entire people.
1593200	1596720	I was going to say the number, that's the difference. It's not the number.
1596720	1604080	Because six million will also, African Americans are actually Jew also, the lost tribe of Israel.
1604480	1607840	Push back on that too. Okay, so everyone came from Africa.
1608560	1612400	I'm African. I'm basically African American. We're brothers.
1612400	1615840	And we're both Jew and we're brothers. We're human.
1616400	1621280	Six million people died in the Holocaust. Over 20 million have died by the hands of abortion.
1622400	1629600	The media promotes the my body, my choice, which is actually still a promotion for Planned
1629600	1639200	Parenthood. 50% of Black deaths a year is actually abortion. It's not the cop with the knee.
1639200	1643760	It's not Black on Black violence and gang violence. It's not heart attacks. It's actually abortion.
1643760	1649520	The most dangerous place for a Black person in America is in their mother's stomach.
1652000	1657280	There's 902 million abortions in the United States a year. I hear you.
1658240	1666400	But there's something about the rape, the torture, the murder of children, women, men,
1666960	1672720	the complete humiliation and just the suffering that was endured during World War II.
1673360	1677200	That's what we deal with on our TVs right now with Black people.
1678160	1683920	Soros would use Black trauma economy to win an election.
1684160	1689760	And what I love is having a healthy conversation and as opposed to, there's certain things,
1689760	1695280	you know, boom, this drops, people are going to have pussy hats on. Boom, this drops is going to be,
1695280	1699600	you know, Black people and white people with signs. Boom, this drops. So, hey, China,
1700560	1707200	hey, left agenda, hey, what we're going to do is say that our species can have a healthy conversation.
1707760	1711920	Can I just linger on this? Because when you say Jewish media,
1713840	1718400	there's an echo of a pain that people feel that reminds an entire...
1718400	1720240	You're saying it's redundant, right?
1721520	1724320	No, I'm not saying it's redundant. I'm saying it's redundant.
1724320	1725680	You're saying it's redundant.
1725680	1726560	It's a redundant thing.
1727760	1733760	I'm saying that it's something that Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany said.
1733760	1742080	I'm saying it's been said so many times in order to murder and torture Jewish people
1742960	1744960	that it just rings wrong.
1746240	1751600	Just like the N word when spoken by people that have the same skin color as me,
1752160	1755840	it reminds people of a very dark time.
1755840	1759280	I know. If Jewish people would accept that I'm Jew,
1759280	1763120	then they would see what I'm saying in a different way. They would hear it in a different way.
1763200	1766560	But see, the people, you saying you're Jewish, that...
1766560	1768080	No, I'm Jew. Not Jewish.
1768080	1770640	Jewish means like that of a Jew. I'm saying I'm Jew.
1770640	1771440	You're Jew.
1771440	1772320	Blood of Christ.
1772320	1773600	That comes from...
1773600	1773920	Right.
1778720	1783280	Are you a follower of the philosophy of the black Hebrew Israelites?
1784320	1786400	Because that's where the idea comes from.
1787840	1791920	Not all of those folks are extremists, but some are extremists.
1791920	1798000	I'm a follower of the idea. I have a vague idea that all people came from
1798800	1801680	Africa, but what I wanted to do...
1802960	1810160	Okay, now I could Andy Kaufman this about seven more minutes and then tell you what it is.
1810160	1810640	Should I count?
1810640	1811440	What the whole point is?
1811440	1812800	Let's count. Seven minutes.
1812800	1816160	No, I did this to do a spoiler alert.
1816160	1816800	Sure, spoiler.
1817360	1819280	What's the first thing I said at the beginning?
1820000	1823520	We're talking about engineering and humans, we're all human.
1823520	1826160	And I said, and then what did I say we shouldn't focus on?
1826160	1826640	Race.
1826640	1830640	Not just that. I said, they shouldn't teach this in school.
1831440	1831920	History.
1831920	1838320	The history because what they do, what schools are doing is exactly what the CIA
1839200	1846000	does with Pixar films and Disney films. They make Bambi's mom die in the beginning,
1846800	1852800	right? And off that pain comes a purchase of ice cream.
1852800	1855360	Off that pain comes, I need some more toys.
1855360	1857360	Off that pain comes, I need a bigger house.
1857360	1860400	Off that pain comes, I need more girls than my wife.
1860400	1868560	Off that pain comes, so they put that pain in to make us, now we're the orphans of capitalism,
1868560	1874480	to make us be consumers and we need to be a community, not just consumers.
1874480	1878400	So I could have went another seven minutes by being a person
1879680	1884160	who presents himself in a way that says, well, I don't have to feel your pain
1884160	1886960	because I also have pain too that's not being recognized.
1886960	1890880	And in every interview, when I say, well, why did I get to the point of putting up the tweet,
1892400	1896320	no one wants to understand why I got to that point, right?
1896320	1896720	You had pain.
1896720	1897360	You had pain.
1897360	1897680	Yeah.
1897680	1898800	You had pain in your heart.
1898800	1909040	But let's say this, undoubtedly Jewish people have a lot of movies about that pain
1909040	1914720	and black people have a lot of movies about the pain of slavery, right?
1914720	1919600	It's almost impossible to find a movie about Mansa Munsa.
1919600	1923440	When you go to the African History Museum in Washington, D.C.,
1923440	1929200	it doesn't start with the idea of Africans being kings.
1929760	1933120	It starts with the idea of Africans being slaves.
1933120	1936160	But here's another interesting point about this.
1936160	1939360	This was said to me one time and it stuck with me as a family member of mine.
1940800	1946800	With Africans, how many times you've heard like a rapper or, you know, talk about we were kings.
1948960	1951920	That's incorrect if we're Jew.
1954320	1957920	If we're Jew and since we are, we weren't the kings.
1958640	1961280	We were the slaves that Moses freed.
1963440	1967200	Africans have always said, we've heard, you've listened to rap music and hear black people say,
1967200	1969680	we kings, we blood of the pharaohs.
1971200	1975680	And if we are Jew, then we weren't.
1976640	1978800	We were the people that Moses freed.
1979200	1984080	And when we talk about, have you heard black people talk about 400 years of slavery?
1984960	1989280	All right, that is, and we're having this history lesson, right?
1990080	1991600	I thought history doesn't matter.
1991600	1995920	You're exploring ancient history and drawing deep wisdom from it.
1996480	1999200	And at the same time saying, we need to forget all of it.
2000000	2001840	We need to put that behind us.
2001840	2002400	Absolutely.
2003680	2005680	We need to forget it and we need to move forward.
2006240	2010640	There is so much wisdom to draw from history, even the 20th century.
2011200	2016800	Look at this communism without the lessons of history of the 20th century.
2017440	2022560	Communism sounds like a great idea, except that some of the worst atrocities
2023520	2030640	conducted by Stalin and Mao that killed 500 plus million people,
2030640	2036400	not just killed, tortured, starvation, where people, the cannibalism, they ate each other.
2036400	2037760	They ate their children.
2038800	2041040	There's just dark people.
2041040	2045680	People should read some books on this on the hall in Amor in 1930s.
2045680	2046240	But I disagree.
2046240	2051520	With that lesson, we would, and now it's becoming more popular, Marxism and communism.
2051520	2053200	I'm not disagreeing that that happened.
2053760	2059120	I'm disagreeing that we need to harp on the things that happen.
2059120	2062400	Because the truth is, I'm giving a fact.
2062400	2069600	50% today of, let's say, you don't call black people Jew, right?
2069600	2075520	Black people's deaths today is a abortion today right now.
2075520	2078480	Like that, it's not racism.
2079040	2081120	That's too wide of a term.
2081120	2088480	It's genocide and population control that black people are in today in America
2088480	2096320	that is promoted by the music and the media that black people make that Jewish record labels
2096320	2099840	get paid off of or media companies, record labels media company also.
2099840	2101200	So let's give it a wider, you know,
2101920	2103760	I agree with Martin Luther King.
2104640	2112640	I have a dream too, that one day you would not be judged by the color of your skin or your race,
2113360	2116640	black or Jew, but by the content of your character,
2116640	2119840	all the assholes that fucked you over in the music industry,
2119840	2124480	fuck artists over in the music industry, are individuals.
2124480	2125440	They're not Jews.
2127360	2128320	They are Jewish.
2130320	2135440	They're human with opportunities and they took those opportunities.
2135440	2137280	I don't care if they're Jewish.
2137280	2140080	Do you feel like I should release that pain and separate it?
2141600	2142320	Yes.
2142320	2147600	Okay, so if you're saying I should release that pain and separate it,
2147600	2152080	then I'm telling you, you should release your pain and separate it.
2152080	2159120	And we could get to this, the list of how you are being with engineering opportunities.
2159120	2160080	That's 100%.
2160080	2162720	I see what you're doing, that exactly you're doing.
2162720	2167680	The pain, I'm going to let it go, engineering challenges, I get it.
2167680	2172400	One of the problems you highlight is people get fucked over in the music industry
2173040	2176960	and get fucked over in the media, get fucked over all over the place.
2176960	2184160	They created, there was a Jewish trainer that brought me to the hospital and put
2184160	2185920	in press that I went to the hospital.
2185920	2192400	I know friends that off of exhaustion, a Jewish doctor, they diagnosed me because they were.
2193360	2200160	Diagnose me with bipolar disorder and shot me with medication and put me on medication,
2200160	2206080	then put it in the press and every time, even if I wore the wrong color hat that a nigger is not
2206080	2213040	supposed to wear, then they immediately say he's off of his shit, he's off his meds,
2213040	2218640	he's off of his rocker and it's literally used as a scarlet letter control mechanism
2219200	2223360	for the people understand the kids, the colleges, the high schools.
2223920	2226320	What do you think they put me right now?
2227520	2230800	They put me as the prophet, not the leader.
2230800	2236320	It doesn't have to be the leader, because we need a more intelligent person to be the leader,
2236320	2239360	but at least they put me as the prophet.
2239360	2243840	They put me as the only person that would say this and I'm just saying that was four
2244560	2253280	Jewish members that controlled my voice because for the fact that 90% of black people in entertainment
2253280	2260800	from sports to music to acting are in some way tied into Jewish business people.
2260800	2267440	Meaning that in some way, just like if Ram is sitting next to Obama or Jared sitting next to
2267440	2276000	Trump, there's a Jewish person right there controlling the country, the Jewish controlling
2276000	2280800	that who gets the best video or not, controlling what the media says about me.
2280800	2282800	It's a person, not Jewish.
2282800	2283680	Let me just say one thing.
2283680	2286880	But they are though, that's the only thing, it just so happens that they are.
2288880	2292960	That doesn't mean that I hate them, that just means that they are.
2292960	2295680	But it's a dog whistle too.
2296240	2303120	Let me just say, as I would love to add more love to the world, I would love you to do that
2303120	2307760	as a person with a big voice, with a big powerful voice that a lot of people look up to.
2307760	2311840	And when you say Jewish media, it's funny how this world works that way.
2311840	2320080	When you say Jewish media or Jews are controlling the voice of black artists, black people, black
2320080	2320560	artists.
2320560	2323200	When you say that, I'm not allowed to say it out loud.
2323200	2324160	You can say it.
2324160	2330400	There's a large number of people that are hurting and have anger and even have hate in their heart
2330400	2337360	when they hear Jewish media, they start, that hate starts being directed towards the Jewish people.
2338960	2340720	Do you acknowledge that?
2342560	2350160	Can you feel the hate in the world that comes to the surface when you say stuff like that?
2350960	2357680	Okay, I feel that when we go into therapy, my dad was a therapist.
2357680	2361840	And obviously I've got some therapy skills myself.
2361840	2368480	A lot of people, my music is healing, these type of spa-like existences are healing,
2368480	2372400	the color palace I use are healing, and we can use healing words, right?
2372640	2381680	What I really feel there, I feel that there's no accountability and no responsibility on
2381680	2388240	Jewish people in media to at least start with owning up with the facts of what's dealt with
2388240	2394960	and tell me if I say the facts out loud, to the point of Ari Emanuel writing a letter in
2394960	2399920	the Financial Times trying to take food out of my children's mouth, telling people that
2399920	2408400	they're not allowed to work with me. Even Chris Como or Pierce Morgan getting me to apologize and
2408400	2415520	separate Jewish business people from the families of the Jewish business people, which I did,
2416080	2421600	update. I did that, that already happened. That was a shitty apology. That wasn't really an apology.
2421600	2427920	But shout out for that conversation. I need to get on my knees and kiss the dick of Howard Stern.
2428880	2430480	You don't need to kiss anyone's dick.
2431040	2434320	That's what you guys are acting like. You guys, look at that.
2434320	2441360	Because you're talking about it as a shitty opinion, apology, but where's our fucking apology?
2441360	2445280	Watch this. We don't get... Thank you. Let's move on.
2445280	2449040	What? Sorry. Do I need to get on my knees or no?
2449040	2456560	And kiss my dick. Just escalated quickly. That's escalated quickly.
2460240	2467120	No, I'm saying where's our apology, but we can't get to apology because you're telling me there's
2467120	2475440	no right way for me to word it. So tell me, for me, a person who's been fucked on my deals
2475440	2480800	and a person that has friends that never figured out how to make shoes with a German company
2480800	2484560	that couldn't tell me to wear a BLM shirt and take off my red hat,
2484560	2487200	like what would have happened if I was at Nike, right?
2489440	2494400	Tell me exactly how to engineer the situation I'm in.
2494400	2500000	Tell you exactly how. You got a big voice. Have the balls as a man to call out the individuals.
2500000	2505840	Don't call them Jews. Call them by their name and start a war against those individuals.
2505840	2509680	They're not Jewish. But if that's the case, will you help me with that?
2510240	2516320	Sure. Okay. 100%. Assholes are asked. Well, let me like flip that too. I don't understand the industry.
2516320	2521760	Well, I see that people are fucking people over for sure. But how do you solve that?
2521760	2527280	If you run... If you right now run the world's... You're doing a million things,
2527280	2532800	but say you ran also a record label. I have ran a record label. I've been ran by a record label
2532800	2538240	where I was the face of a record label and had Big Sean and different people complaining to me.
2538240	2542720	And I knew fuck about running a record label. I was simply just a talented producer
2542720	2547760	and an influencer that then started good music, but I wasn't the one running good music.
2547760	2552080	How would you do it differently? This is something I propose. I would look at
2552320	2564720	the top 10 execs in three fields, in sports, film, and music. And I would look at the top 10
2567440	2572960	clients, participant act talent. I would look at the top talent in each of those fields,
2572960	2577680	the top 10 of them. And some of them are going to be Tom Brady. Some of them are going to be Taylor
2577760	2584080	Swift. Some of them, they're not all going to be black, right? Some of them will be Adele,
2584080	2594560	right? And we'll look at all their contracts transparently and we'll compare the notes
2594560	2600160	and re-engineer like it's a new constitution. Because when I told my dad, when I was 19,
2600160	2605040	I was going to get into the music industry, he begged me not to. He said, I heard it's treacherous.
2605760	2610960	Now I'm in a position where I've been through it. I saw it. I went out, made some money somewhere
2610960	2617760	else. I saw my name get smeared. I saw my family get destroyed. I saw my reputation get destroyed.
2617760	2623760	And I'm back here to have this kind of... I'm back here as a being with engineering opportunities.
2625040	2632160	If you say as a shitty apology, what is the version of the apology short of kissing Howard
2632160	2636640	Stern's dick? I don't think anyone wants to kiss Howard Stern's dick. That's the whole point,
2636640	2640400	Howard Stern. Nobody wants to kiss your dick. So shut the fuck up. I said, by the way,
2640400	2647600	I'm antagonizing you, Howard Stern. I used to be a fan of you. Yeah, me too. Yeah. I'm still a fan
2647600	2654080	sometimes. Now you're just doing clickbait like everybody else. Now you're just a sad old man,
2654080	2660960	Howard. All right. Now, Howard Stern, this is the first time anyone's said your name in years.
2661600	2665200	Your own family doesn't say your name unless they're calling to get their bills paid.
2667120	2674400	You're going hard. See, that's beautiful right there. That's much better than calling Jewish
2674400	2680960	media. Go after individuals. Go after individuals. You don't talk shit about me. Talk shit about me.
2680960	2683200	This is great. And you know what that is? Yeah, what's that?
2685520	2690720	Engineering. That's an engineer's approach. Yeah, engineers. Yeah. Yeah, you should learn some of
2690720	2697680	that. We all can use our pain against each other or we can say we're being with engineering
2697680	2703040	opportunities and we can know about history. So let me change something. We can have
2705360	2710320	a, just to be judgmental, people say that should not judge. I've been talking to Camille Vasquez.
2710640	2716000	She says, I'm very judgmental. That's what we're doing. I believe, now you could go to Bible and
2716000	2720480	one thing's going to say one thing, another thing may be contradicted in a way and then the pastor
2720480	2731280	has to unpack it. I believe that we are to judge. If you look at some food and it's got a fly coming
2731280	2736880	out of it, you can then judge at that point. You're supposed to use your better judgment.
2737280	2741040	Whenever someone doesn't want to change something they're doing, they'll say,
2741040	2748320	don't judge me. But as a species, you call for me, you got the breakthrough. And by the way,
2748320	2756560	it's only an engineer that I would respect to tell me of how to update how I'm communicating.
2756560	2764000	Because this started off, right? I've been through all these interviews. Let me go to this. You said
2764000	2771360	this was a sorry apology. I was very specific. I said the Jewish, because by the way, it's a barrage,
2771360	2775280	right? It's a thing where I don't even remember the names at a certain point, right? It's like,
2775840	2779680	if a girl was getting raped by men,
2782720	2789600	if that person's not 18, right? And she was getting raped since 14, right? And she still
2789600	2798720	got this face, this super like Irina Shake level face, right? She might say, I hate men.
2799920	2806720	That woman may say, I hate men. She might get to that point because she was raped. On my contracts,
2806720	2811440	and no one can say this is ramped up. No one, Howard Stern can't say this is ramped up. Ari
2811440	2817120	Emmanuel can't say this is ramped up. George Soros knows damn well that I'm not ramped up.
2817120	2824640	George Soros knows like, wow, this guy's like a younger guy that's looking at what I did and
2824640	2832000	looking at how I control the world silently. And he's calling it out. And he's not using any of
2832000	2837360	the fear tactics. I can't send his homeboys around him. I can't send his wife to him. This guy,
2837360	2842720	that's what George Soros sees, right? When he's dealing with me, right? So what you guys are
2842720	2849840	actually asking me to do, I'm comparing myself to that 18 year old beautiful woman that had been
2849840	2858720	mistreated by men for four years of her life, right? And you're saying, as a man, you can't blame
2858720	2868800	all men. And I'm saying as a responsible forward philosopher leader, okay, I'll drop the pain.
2869280	2877280	And I will specify because I'm up here. I lost my fucking family. I lost my kids. I lost my best
2877280	2884880	friend in fashion. I lost the black community. I lost, you know, people said I lost my mind.
2884880	2890880	All of these things lost my reputation. And I'm up here just like, I just want my family,
2891760	2898400	but I don't want my family to have to say what the left wants us to say. To have to say what
2898400	2903920	China wants us to say. I want to be an American and protect my kids and protect my wife and raise
2903920	2911200	my kids as Christians and have my wife be a Christian and innovate and America made rock
2911200	2917040	and roll. I want to innovate as a creative person and be a successful American. But all of that
2917040	2923120	had been taken away from me. So I'm coming back and I'm removing the PSTD right now, right? I'm
2923120	2927120	standing up and saying the only way that we're going to be able to get past this and the way God
2927120	2934480	is going to use me right now is for me to stop talking about the pain, stop talking about what
2934480	2940560	happened and do something about it. And that's where I'm at right now in this moment. Like, yeah,
2940560	2945520	people agree. At least there was something where you could say he has a reason of why he got to
2945520	2953360	that tweet. And what you're doing for me today is saying, yo, that was a sorry apology. And let's
2953440	2962480	specify, I'm not asking for anyone out here to empathize or sympathize for a, you know,
2962480	2968800	a dude worth $11 billion that can make money disappear, I mean, appear at a thin air in five
2968800	2974080	different industries, you know, I'm not asking for the I'm not asking for anybody to sympathize with
2974080	2980480	someone who's married to Kim Kardashian dated Irene and shake, but like, I feel like I'm just not
2980480	2988400	going to get the sympathy vote in this situation. Right. So I feel your pain. I feel, yeah, I feel
2988400	2992720	like no one's going to feel my pain. Only only Brad and Leo could feel my pain. Right. So the,
2993760	3002320	so, but still, but here today, when you said as a sorry apology, what's the, what's the apology
3002320	3010480	that you're looking for as a, as a Jewish engineer, not say as Lex, let's not talk about
3011280	3020640	you being Jewish as Lex. What's the apology that you want me to say to, am I allowed to say Jewish?
3020640	3026240	Tell me, is it anti-semitic for you to say Jewish out loud? No, there's a, I don't like the allowed
3026720	3032960	that presumes censorship. I think you choose, you have a powerful voice. Did I prove, did I,
3032960	3037200	did I prove that there was censorship over the past two weeks? I proved it. Who censored you?
3037200	3045200	Oh, drink champs. Oh my Lord. Oh, like Twitter and so on. Twitter. That has less to do. Drink
3045200	3052000	champs. That hurt you, that drink champs, that Nora took it down, took down your conversation. No.
3052560	3057760	It didn't hurt you. Man, you got to be honest about the pain.
3058720	3067440	What's still the kids we used to be? I put my hand on the stove to see if I still bleed
3068800	3076560	and nothing hurts anymore. I feel kind of free. No, do you think,
3078880	3087040	you know, I went to Japan for two to three months, right? The day I had Sunday service,
3087680	3091680	my kids are supposed to be there and my kids would know where to be found.
3092320	3100720	And I text Kim and said, where are my kids? We get into an argument and then I get a text
3100720	3106880	from a number I don't know and it's Pete Davidson bragging about being in bed with my wife.
3106960	3113680	Then... Just fucking with you?
3113680	3119920	Well, at that point, it's like they're trying to put me in jail or put a friend of mine in jail
3121680	3128240	because then I'm going to go surround the hotel and do all, you know, do something
3128240	3133520	which would have me not be able to be here. And instead I walked away from that situation.
3133520	3138400	I went to Japan, like the samurai that I am, and went to the top of the mountain.
3140240	3147520	Because I knew that, I mean, I knew there was no way she could love this dude,
3147520	3151280	not just because he's ugly, he's not black. She likes black guys. Every guy that she,
3152000	3158560	you know, is wit, looks exactly the same. Ray J, Reggie Bush, at that time Kanye West,
3158560	3163040	she has a type, just like how I have a type. Like a lot of my girls look kind of similar to her
3163040	3167280	because in a video game character, people have, people have their type, right? So I knew that
3167280	3173360	this was like... The princess has a type and she likes Mario. Right, there you go.
3173360	3180320	As somebody cares for you and hopefully can be a friend. Yay, I gotta say these words and the
3180320	3190000	words about Jews is not the words of a samurai, of a great man. I would say, you know, you said
3190560	3195360	something that inspired, that resonated with a lot of people when you said George Bush doesn't
3195360	3201040	care about black people. I have to say, as somebody who cares for you, that yay,
3201040	3209520	the artist formerly known as Kanye West, doesn't care about Jewish people. In the same way you
3209520	3215520	spoke about George Bush being a politician and not giving a fuck about the poor people that
3216320	3222240	suffered after Katrina, you're not giving a fuck about the suffering of the Jewish people
3222240	3229840	across the world. Why am I not? Because you're feeding, you're giving strength, motivation to
3229840	3233280	hate groups. But we already updated, I gave an apology, you said it wasn't good enough.
3233280	3236080	Yeah, that's right. And now you're telling me, no, I'm not gonna...
3236080	3241040	You don't need to kiss anyone's dick. What you have to do is to say, it was wrong to say,
3241040	3245040	there's no Jewish media, there's no Jewish... There isn't.
3245040	3250960	There's no control of the media by Jewish people. You're an engineer, brother. If you're an engineer
3250960	3256240	and you're not holding to the truth, that's not engineering. Engineering is not, that's not,
3256240	3261120	that doesn't, that's hate, that's not engineering. Engineering costs... I'm gonna build a better
3261120	3265440	record label. It's called stereotypes. And I'm going to respect our... Stereotypes exist for a
3265440	3270640	reason. Engineers don't do stereotypes. I do. Stereotypes are dumb. They allow you to channel
3270640	3274080	hate towards the other. You know what the biggest thing is? Yeah.
3275040	3280320	With something, a veteran that was sitting next to me at Cheesecake Factory last night,
3281360	3289280	he said, you know, the general justice, he serves for whoever is the president, right?
3289280	3295760	And he said, what's happening in politics is we're forgetting we're on the same side.
3296720	3301840	We're forgetting we're on this. This is someone is practically... Now he's a nurse. So he's still,
3302560	3309040	you know, fighting for humanity in a way. He went from holding, you know, guns in battle to being
3309840	3317120	a nurse and when people are battling for their lives. And he said, we're forgetting we're on the
3317120	3326960	same side. This is a person that no matter who becomes president, he can still be told to go to war.
3328160	3339280	And the chaos that's created by the media has split the country in half. And what we... What
3339280	3344880	us as beings with an engineering opportunity need to do right now is find the blue water.
3345600	3352400	Where do we... Where are places that we agree on? And I want you to finish everything...
3353760	3363120	I'm going to let you finish everything that you want to express to me. Get off all... I'm your
3363120	3368080	scarecrow today. I'm your punching bag today for everything I did. And I want you to stand up for
3368080	3374160	all of the hate that I'm your Al Gore when he lost the election. Remember, he almost became a
3374160	3380160	punching bag for the lady that had voted on him. And she just said all this stuff. And he's like,
3380160	3386160	I know, I agree with you, right? But there's nothing, you know, that he could do about it.
3386160	3391440	With this, it's like things that you're saying, I agree with you. You know, it's like if you sit
3391440	3398640	some kids in the... In the principal's office and I punch somebody, right? I took... I took my hand,
3398640	3407520	right? As what it really means. Even Aria Emmanuel had to say, this is a pop icon, right? And I went
3408240	3416240	and just punched an entire people at one time or said that I was about to... I went like this,
3417040	3422160	right? And I got blacked out, black mirrored, done, right? And it's like, what were you even
3422160	3433040	going to do? And why did you go like this? I went like this because I can't even do... I would look
3433040	3443360	insane to physically show you a metaphor, a physical representation of my last 20 years
3444320	3451840	of what I've been through as a musician, as a father, and as a black person with a political
3451840	3457200	opinion. A great man still through the pain does the right thing. And I think the right thing
3458000	3463280	is to not say that there's Jewish control of the media. That's incorrect, though. That's a
3463280	3468960	fucking lie. There is. And they did come and bully me. It proved the point. No, the reason you don't
3468960	3477280	say it is because the world is much bigger than the, forgive me, the narrow little world you exist in.
3477280	3482080	Your impact stretches way past those little boardroom meetings over contracts.
3482080	3484240	So what should I have done? What should I have done?
3484240	3487040	Not say that you should be a strong man that doesn't mention,
3487600	3491840	that doesn't mention religion or people and then fight. Do you want to win this fight?
3491840	3493680	How do I win? How do we win?
3493680	3498160	Call out individual people built. That's one way because they have a big voice. The other voice
3498160	3506480	that I prefer is to build another label. I feel like you're controlling my creative narrative and
3507040	3509600	because just like how you're telling me I shouldn't have said that,
3509600	3511920	do you think there are people telling me I shouldn't have wore a red hat?
3513920	3519040	No, because you asked me, what should I have done? You're supposed to be a scarecrow,
3519040	3522560	so I thought I'm going to beat the shit out of the scarecrow with my words, right?
3522560	3525040	You let me. It was consensual.
3525040	3528320	The punching bag is a bit, because scarecrow actually has a different real name.
3528320	3528800	Yeah, that's right. I'm not a good person.
3528800	3531040	So let's say a punching bag. I shouldn't say a scarecrow.
3531920	3537600	But every single person that I've sat with from the point when I wore the red hat to now has
3537600	3542800	done the same thing. Sit in the principal's office and don't do what you're doing.
3543360	3549840	We're in the generous closet right now together. The red hat is very different. The red hat is
3551040	3558640	you have a set of beliefs. You represent half the country that has a hope, a vision for the
3558640	3563680	future of America that's very different than without any purpose whatsoever saying Jewish
3563680	3565440	media, Jewish control of the media.
3565440	3571600	You said there's no purpose, so you're taking away my history and my reason of what my purpose was.
3573120	3574400	I'm saying it was done.
3574400	3579200	Also, I'm speaking my voice vocalizing.
3579200	3585040	Also, it's God's plan. There's a lot of things that open up. Let me tell you something that
3585040	3590800	opened up. There's a guy, like I told you, that was running STEM player who I've had issues with,
3590800	3598640	we hadn't got paid on certain things, right? And he took his IQ, his know-how, his engineering
3598640	3604800	know-how to, he basically was trying to adidas me with, even though I was the bigger money in
3604800	3610960	the situation, that was fun and we funded together. And he hired these engineers and he said,
3611040	3614240	well, because of your comments, we're not going to be able to hire anybody else.
3614800	3617600	And I was like, well, how many Jewish people do we have in our company? He said,
3617600	3622080	I don't know. He didn't say exactly, right? I said, do we have Black people? He said,
3622640	3628160	yes, I said how many? He said two. So we have like 60 full-time employees, like 40 half-time
3628160	3641760	and part-time. And I took as a responsibility, let's take a step back from us being one species
3641760	3648320	and say, hey, you're Jewish, I'm Black, right? For this example, for the sake of this example.
3648320	3657040	And I said, wow, I'm sure I could hire more than two Black engineers. And what happens is,
3658160	3664080	because there are so many businessmen that just so happen to be Jewish, that it's good
3664080	3668640	business, right? Just to monopolize. That's what people are looking. Everybody wants to be Elon,
3668640	3675760	right? So the- I just agree with that. Okay, but let me finish this point.
3676320	3678160	I'm going to let you finish. I'm going to let you finish.
3678160	3685040	A lot of businessmen want to be as successful as Elon and as popular as Elon. A lot. Like,
3685040	3689040	I just worded like that, which I hate the term a lot, actually. I want to be more specific,
3689040	3695200	but I don't- I haven't done the math on it. Let's say some. Factually, for sure, there are some
3695760	3700800	business people of all different walks and backgrounds that would like to be as rich
3700800	3706880	and as popular as Elon Musk. So let me just take a step back from the we're one species
3706880	3713120	into the we're separated by race, gender, socioeconomic class conversation and say,
3713120	3718640	as a black owner of two tech platforms, hardware and software, I need to take
3719440	3726800	action. Let's not call it affirmative. Let's just say I need to take action and I need to take
3726800	3738080	accountability and ensuring that black engineers are hired. And guess what? Hired together.
3738880	3744800	Because when the black people that are brilliant are separated from our culture,
3744800	3751680	we forget who we are. And we'll get to a point where, you know, OJ would say, I'm not black,
3751680	3759280	I'm OJ. Because just to be on the golf course, we put on the golf shirt. But the golf shirt
3759280	3766720	might not be something that our culture would have done. And now our culture in poorer communities
3767600	3773520	everybody's got Draco on them. Everybody's got a gun on them. Oh, if you run up on me on a gas
3773520	3778240	station, I'm going to kill you. Hey, you ain't got to talk to me like a man if I haven't killed at
3778240	3782560	least five people. But you know what happens is we can kill five people, we could kill 10 people
3782560	3789600	and still be in the media as long as we play by the rules, right? Because what will happen is
3789600	3796080	any of these guys that have talked about killing people in different things, unless Trump
3796080	3800000	had pardoned them, right? But let's say, even if Trump had pardoned them, they could still go to
3800000	3808000	someone like a little boozy or meek mills or puff daddy, anybody, and say, hey, we need you to talk
3808000	3813840	shit about yay right now. And also you're not allowed, if you do want to vote for Trump or vote
3813840	3820480	outside of what this arrangement is, then we're going to put you in jail. And we're not going to
3820480	3827440	bring you down. We have this on you. You get what I'm saying? If I had ever killed someone,
3828240	3835920	if I wasn't the bitch with the pink polo on, I wouldn't be able to be the vocal man that I am
3835920	3840480	today. You understand what I'm saying? This is the reason why I'm happy that my gangster
3840480	3848080	disciple brothers kept me from the initiations, which made me feel like a pussy my whole life,
3848800	3857360	right? But now I am someone who legally can say this. Other people in my position,
3857360	3864480	they legally cannot speak. They legally cannot speak, or they will go to prison.
3865760	3871120	I am in a bit of a glass prison because I don't have say so of where my children go to school.
3871840	3876960	But I'm in a freedom place where I can have this conversation with you right now.
3877600	3885040	And that is, I don't like the word breakthrough. That's God's hand on this situation.
3885920	3890080	But you get what I'm saying about, if I hadn't said the tweet, I wouldn't have had to take the
3890080	3895440	accountability myself to hire black engineers into my two tech platforms.
3895440	3898960	Yeah. And do you get what I'm saying? That's a beautiful personal journey you're on.
3899520	3903280	But do you get what I'm saying? That personal is for my people as a whole.
3903280	3911840	As a tribal person, as a small company, as a tribal person, I believe that I am my people.
3913120	3920320	And the thing that businessmen have done to my people have pulled the brightest out of our tribes
3920320	3926800	and siloed them and made us lose our culture and lose who they were. All the only thing I wanted
3926800	3934640	to say a Virgil's funeral, which I wasn't allowed to. It was a white pastor that talked the majority
3934640	3944560	of the funeral. Half the funeral was pissed. And this pastor actually married me and Kim.
3944560	3951840	He looks like Justin Timberlake a little bit. And he talked half the funeral. He knew Virgil's
3951840	3958160	passing, did a collaboration with him before he passed, by the way, right? A clothing collaboration.
3958160	3966800	I didn't know Virgil was passing, but the thing I wanted to say, I saw ASAP Rocky and I saw some
3966800	3975760	other members of his gang, you know, in the audience at the funeral. And all I wanted to tell him is,
3976400	3986960	don't let them split the gang up. Don't let them split the gang up. When I did the first Yeezy,
3988400	3995680	because I did Kanye West two fashion shows before as a high-end luxury, all-leather kind of
3995680	4001520	designer, not all leather, but you know, high-end materials, mink, this kind of thing.
4002320	4010480	And then I came back with Yeezy with Adidas. And this fashion show was so popular that Justin
4011040	4015840	Bieber had to sit in the second row, right? This thing had every name you could think of. It had
4016800	4023920	Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner. It was Kylie's first fashion show she'd been in.
4023920	4028160	And in the second fashion show, I put Kylie and Bella Hadid next to each other
4028160	4035040	in the fashion show. You had Puff Daddy. At that time, Puff Daddy had beef with Drake. Drake
4035040	4040960	still came to the show and Jay-Z had to break up the fight backstage. The designers, you had Jerry
4040960	4046240	Lorenzo, that's head of Fear of God. You had Kim Schwab, head of Skims. You had Virgil Abloh, head of
4046240	4055360	Louis Vuitton. You had Dimna, head of Balenciaga, all working for the leader, for the philosopher,
4055760	4063280	for the person that put, who put this together? Me, that's who. You had these people working for
4063280	4070800	the king in New York, basically the boss. Yeezy in the audience, Rihanna in the audience,
4072400	4077680	Beyonce in the audience, sitting next to Anna Wintour in this audience. And guess who heard
4077680	4082720	wind of this? One of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnault caught wind of this.
4083360	4090880	What's going on? They're building up something and we need to stop it. So then he met with me
4090880	4097280	and politely offered me backing from my clothing line. It would be Kanye West, they would get
4097280	4103520	49%, 51%, I would get 49%, they'd have control and they were going to give me all of the support
4103520	4111280	from Louis Vuitton. So I had to go to Adidas and I told Adidas, hey, let's adimnify the apparel.
4112160	4116160	So Adidas, you're not going to do the apparel anymore. Hey, we had a, we had a good time,
4116160	4120480	but we're going to run off with Giselle now, right? So the, that's like you told your girl
4120480	4124560	that and you're like, ah, no, we're supposed to, we had the proudest moment of our career and so.
4126080	4132720	So then he offers me the deal and Alexander Arnault, who's went to gone on and rape and pillage
4132720	4138480	from all of the talent that I had afterwards, said, I say, before I tell Adidas to adimnify
4138480	4145360	the apparel, can I get a written contract from your dad, Bernard Arnault? And he says, my dad
4145360	4149360	will never go back on his word. So you already know what this thing is going, right? You can
4149360	4156320	spoiler alert, right? He went back on his word. So three months into the deal, I get Anna Winter,
4157200	4162800	I say, who should I use for my lawyer? She picks my lawyer for me, right? I just found out even a
4162800	4169440	couple of days that the lawyer demanded an airplane during negotiations, had nothing to do with me,
4169440	4174720	right? They said the Bernard Arnault got freaked out and then Alexander Arnault calls me and says,
4175280	4181360	the deal got dropped at the board. I went back and told my high maintenance wife,
4182240	4186720	I was supposed to become this designer at Louis Vuitton or the Louis Vuitton group was going
4186720	4191600	to back the Kanye West line because that's how good I've done in fashion, babe. And now the deal
4191600	4198240	has dropped. Now the deal has dropped. So then I did a second collection and we didn't have any
4198240	4203840	support to be able to build the collection. Then I went and found and third collection, we did it.
4204560	4210480	We took over MSG. Fourth collection went and the show started an hour late. Then a week later,
4210480	4220320	Kim got robbed. Then I told Scooter Braun, my manager at that time, I say, I, I'm looking,
4220320	4225440	you know, I need to go to Japan. I'm tired. I'm tired. He says, no, you need to make more money.
4226720	4234880	I do four more shows on a second leg of the tour and I suffer from exhaustion and go to
4234880	4241600	the hospital and then get diagnosed with a disorder. This is the first time I ever suffered
4241600	4247440	from exhaustion. By the way, I haven't been to the hospital since. I haven't been to the hospital
4247440	4256320	since and haven't taken, you know, medication in two years. And I'm sure there'll be people
4256320	4260480	in the media, we won't say, we're from, we'll say, well, that's obvious, right? So,
4262080	4268320	so right now I'm talking to you, right? I'm not on medication. I just go to sleep, right? I have
4268320	4274240	sleep. Have you been able to sleep? This, that's, that's, that's, that's too low hanging fruit for
4274240	4278480	you. You're, you're more, you're, I, I, I expect more. I agree. I agree. I agree. That was dumb.
4278480	4284400	I regret it. That's like, that's like, that's like Pierce Morgan trying to grab ratings. Everybody,
4284400	4288880	you got a whole life ahead of you. You got a whole life ahead of you. You got these guys
4288880	4292640	are at the end of their life. Oh, good. Good. Good. So this story.
4292640	4300320	Call me out of my shit. I love it. But then, amidst that, the same guy that dropped my deal,
4300320	4307440	Bernardo, I know, goes and hires my best friend, goes and hires my main engineer, right? It would
4307440	4313600	have been like them hiring, you know, Elon from Peter, before they figured out Paul,
4314240	4319520	before they figured out PayPal. But it, it all, Paul, it sounds like, uh, it all,
4319520	4322640	Paul sounds like Paul. I just said, cause I'm a Christian. I thought it was cool.
4322640	4327040	But it would have been like, what if someone could have went in and took Elon away from
4327040	4332960	Peter before they pay Paul, before they, I just, cause they pay Paul, before they pay Paul,
4333520	4338320	before they, it just too close. It just sounds so fresh. The fact that it's so close, right?
4338320	4345600	And that's, that's what happened, right? They broke the gang up. And I'm telling you right now,
4346400	4350960	that hadn't happened. Virgil's alive. I'm still married. You know what I'm saying? The power
4350960	4356560	structure was broken then, right? Because we were building some, Kylie wasn't a billionaire that,
4356560	4362720	you know what I mean? We were building something together that a French colonizer came in
4363600	4371760	and caught it early and tried to destroy it. But the only thing is God is alive and I'm anointed.
4372400	4379520	And even with those drawbacks, losing my wife, losing my friend, uh, uh, exhaustion, um,
4379520	4384000	all of these late night tweets that piss off an entire group, you know, like this,
4384240	4392240	this, the frustration still there. We work, I work for God and God runs the world and we'll see
4392240	4399040	what, we'll see what happens. But in those words, don't you feel that being split up?
4399040	4403600	Don't you feel you're doing the thing that you stand against, which is playing victim?
4404560	4410720	Aren't you playing victim to the forces in the world? I didn't play, I didn't even get a chance
4410800	4416240	to play. I just said I was about to. I said like this, like, no, you played pretty damn well.
4416240	4421440	What do you mean? What do you mean about to? You're like one of the greatest designers in
4421440	4427280	history, fashion designers. You're playing. What do you, you are playing. What does that even mean?
4427280	4434160	I thought you're referring to the tweet. All of them. There's a full set of things that you're
4434160	4441040	under attack for the tweet and everything beyond that. But like you're, you're blaming,
4441680	4447920	not blaming, but you're saying that the Jewish media, the Jewish record labels, the Jewish
4448640	4454160	people, forget Jewish or not. It doesn't matter. It's playing victim, right?
4455040	4461520	Ultimately, I am fighting a battle in the spiritual form and anyone that believes in God
4461520	4468160	and is looking at this interview would agree with that. And I just so happen to be a bright part
4468800	4476720	of God's army. I'm fighting for us to live. The greatest gift is life itself. I am pro-life.
4477440	4484640	I am pro-God. I believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and died for our sins.
4485440	4494720	What do you feel about another attack, another painful thing? I imagine it's super painful,
4494720	4503840	is Balenciaga pulling, you had a really close relationship and friendship with their creative
4503840	4512000	director. Like how do you feel about all of it? I told you I sang the song. I'll sing another song
4512000	4520400	from one of my mentors' future. I never felt pain. I didn't felt too much pain. Like there was a day
4520400	4527120	where I was headed to Nashville to meet with George Farmer, who was the CEO of Parla, the day
4527120	4536160	when we made the announcement. At that same day, Balenciaga was taking my imagery off of their
4536160	4544800	site and the drink champs was being taken down. And I said, this is the happiest day of my life.
4546640	4553280	I love cutting the grass low. People wasn't really with you. They was part-time. People switch up
4553280	4559680	when it's wartime. I'd rather have people who are really with me and that people who are just
4559680	4566080	trying to use me. Listen, as a friend, somebody cares for you. You have to be really careful.
4566080	4571600	By the people, by all people always, the people that are going to try to be close to you now,
4572240	4577680	you don't know if you can trust them. Even more. With the Balenciaga, I have more to say about it
4577680	4589200	though. Yeah. Let's do this. Dimna will still work for Yay someday. And this is just speeding the
4589200	4596320	process up. Have you talked? Can you share if you've talked? Yes, I talked to Dimna. We're
4596320	4603280	Kendrick Spirits. None of this can keep us away from each other. I brought Dimna to Gap to be able
4603280	4608400	to bring the best product in the world. At that time, I wanted to go under $100. Now I'm like,
4608400	4618800	okay, we're going to go $20 a product. I brought Dimna in to engineer. That's why I said engineer
4618800	4624640	by Balenciaga, Yeezy Gap engineer by Balenciaga, to engineer the best product for the people. The
4624640	4636000	people that they say are at the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy need chart, they're at the bottom
4636000	4646800	of the pyramid. Gap didn't want that. Balenciaga didn't want that. Our genders were not aligned.
4646800	4654480	I was brought in to the Gap for political reasons and influence, like a Virgil, like a George Floyd.
4655200	4660400	When popular celebrities are brought into Fortune 500 companies, it's not to raise the stock.
4661120	4670320	It's to strengthen the position and influence. And it's definitely not to be out here letting a
4670320	4682080	nigga think he's Steve Jobs. Yeah, there's people like that. But you, as a great man and visionary,
4683600	4690960	your job is to understand that game and be one step ahead. Well, that's why I'm telling them.
4691680	4694720	That relationship, you know, some relationships only last for a summer.
4695600	4700480	Yeah. You know, some last for a year, the relationship ran its course. You know,
4701920	4707760	in that relationship, I invested a lot of my social capital and actual capital.
4708480	4714640	I spent somewhere between five to $10 million personally on Balenciaga. How much money do you
4714640	4721920	think Balenciaga had paid me in the past two years? Just take a really wild guess, a really wild
4721920	4729600	less than that. Just take a super wild one. Just go to the furthest extent of your imagination.
4731920	4743920	1.2 million. Lower. 500,000. Lower. Zero. Zero. All right. And actually, two weeks ago,
4744560	4752720	I paid at a Saints account, $862,000, not in clothes for me from Balenciaga, from the store,
4753440	4760480	in royalties to Balenciaga, where the deal had been engineered, where I was coming out of my
4760480	4771920	pocket. So I paid, last year, I paid Demna $3 million to design the collection, right? And we
4771920	4779360	got it out of the Gap Marketing Fund. And he was going to deliver 160 skews or 120 skews.
4779360	4788320	100 skews are separate items of clothing, so styles of clothing. So he ended up delivering
4788320	4793120	about 60. I feel like we're on the people's court because we actually are, right? We're in the court
4793120	4800720	of public opinion. So he delivered about 60. There were all kinds of people that were working.
4800720	4806640	Part of the reason why I had to give Demna, I wanted to compete with him. I didn't want to
4806640	4813600	have to get him. When I made Stronger, I did it to compete with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake,
4813600	4819440	because my fiance at that time liked Justin Timberlake just a little bit too much. So I made
4819440	4825280	it to compete. And then we had the song out. It's number one on Apple. It's blowing up. I play it
4825280	4833120	in a club and it sounds muddy. It doesn't sound the way Sexy Back sounded in the club. So I go to
4835360	4842720	Pharrell Williams to do the drums. And it doesn't... It sounds like a different record.
4842720	4846560	And though it can't be a different record, because I'm like, I'm going to swap it out on radio,
4846560	4851760	right? Then I go to Swiss Beats. It sounds like a different record. I go to Timbaland,
4851760	4862960	the person who did Sexy Back, and he did it in five minutes and then spent the rest of the hour
4862960	4867360	talking about how nobody could have done it, except for him, running around the studio.
4867360	4871200	I'm the best. No one could have done it. That's why he had to go to me. He had to go to the king.
4872000	4874880	He had a point, right? He had a point, right? So...
4875600	4880080	What makes us so muddy? Is it the beat? It was in the drums. It was some that Timbaland had in
4880080	4888320	those drums. Like, now, watch this. I said I'm going Def Con 3, right? And the actual...
4888880	4892400	I spelled it wrong. I have a tendency to do that. I'm not quite John Legend,
4892400	4900480	tight sweater level, spelling B level. So I feel a parallel to me going to Timbaland
4901360	4907520	to when I said, hey, you as an engineer, I need to work with you as an engineer that is Jewish
4908320	4914880	to look at these contracts and what my people, not just black people, let's say artists,
4914880	4918720	are dealing with in our contracts. These contracts need to be fixed.
4919360	4924880	Everyone could be so mad at the messenger, right? Yay, you said it the wrong way.
4925920	4931760	You're offensive. You're like Hitler now because you said it. You said this out loud,
4931840	4939280	but it does not... You weren't getting enough sleep. All this shit does not negate the fact
4940160	4946240	that we do have Houston, we have a problem. Yeah, but we is just the music industry.
4946960	4950160	Like, there's a lot of hate that was created by just saying that, you know?
4950720	4954320	But you're saying what is just, is everything to me, right? Yeah, yeah.
4955360	4960080	One person can mean everything to me, right? And for George Bush, winning an election was
4960080	4965280	everything. And then when you said George Bush doesn't care about black people, that you woke
4965280	4972480	him up. You woke the people up to the fact that he was narrowly being selfish. There's a sense to
4972480	4977600	which you're being corrupted by your own greatness. You're focusing too much on the industry that
4977600	4983680	you've made great, that you've rose to the very top. One of the richest artists in history,
4983680	4990240	one of the greatest designers... I'm not... I am the richest artist in history. Probably the
4990240	4996080	richest artist in history. Yeah, I don't... They say... The funny thing is they're like, oh,
4996080	5002160	rich is black, but it's like, oh, also rich is actor, rich is musician, rich is fashion designer,
5002160	5006240	like it's a bunch of riches in that one. You know what I'm saying? It's like richer than Ralph
5006240	5012720	Laurent, like richer than Amani, like richest, like of that, but still low. Because where do
5012720	5019040	you put that on the totem? Because I don't even want to... Man's bank account is in everything.
5020160	5028160	I would say you and I are equal in a certain deep sense, no matter what the bank account says.
5032640	5038400	So I wanted to give you some theme music for your moments. It's not a little muddy.
5038400	5041840	Let me give you the Timberland version. Thank you.
5044080	5047520	So the other thing about, like say, like Balenciaga is
5049600	5052960	Demna will work with Ye someday and
5058720	5063760	for Cedric and for Francois Pinot and Salma is a beautiful human being.
5064080	5075120	Five years from now, you'll hear and know the name Ye and know things that we did
5076720	5083920	and Balenciaga is not going to make it onto your questions. Would you, as a gambling man,
5083920	5086560	would you bet on that? I would bet on that. I can see it in your eyes.
5087520	5091280	So it was actually a sad day for me, not for me,
5091920	5098640	but more for Balenciaga. When I heard that, I was just like, oh, shame.
5100800	5106800	Let me ask you a silly question just about Demna. I read something that you two talked about,
5107360	5111440	like buttons for a few hours. They're my gum drop buttons.
5112240	5116000	Just an added accent. Me and Demna only speaking Shrek.
5116800	5122640	What's your philosophy with which you approach design? You are one of the great fashion designers
5122640	5128320	of our time. How do you think about it? Do you have a philosophy?
5128320	5135440	You know what I like about the zipper is the zipper, the zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt
5136320	5140800	because you could get on your douchebag shit and like unzip it and give it a little bit of
5141680	5144880	that type of look. Which is the douchebag?
5147440	5153280	The douchebags that go to Vegas unbutton their dress shirt. The problem with the pullover hoodie
5154000	5160560	is you can't do the douchebag thing when you unbutton it, but then still get the stomach
5160560	5167920	because the thing is the ultimate look would be like a military tank pullover hoodie and if you
5167920	5172400	get a little hot, you take off the hoodie, but you're like crazy in shape.
5173840	5175440	So it gives you that flexibility?
5175440	5181120	Yeah, the zipper is giving some flexibility and it's like maybe you want to keep your jacket
5181120	5186800	on. This is considered like a hoodie to be like a jacket. If you want to keep your jacket on, then
5189040	5195920	you might want to do this as well as pulling it all the way off. It's just comfort, but then you get
5198640	5204160	can I do a jogging pant on this with elasticity? Now people argue about climate,
5205600	5210080	where we are with the climate. I take responsibility as being the most influential
5212160	5224240	designer of all time to say we're going to use biodegradable clothing. Now the issue there is
5224400	5236880	the elastic is not biodegradable. So that means it's actually better to use jeans and a belt
5237840	5243360	than to have an elastic waistband because elastic waistband is not biodegradable.
5244320	5256720	So I use the planet as a big, the future of the planet is a big piece of the way I engineer
5257520	5259680	and the way we talk about where designs are going.
5259680	5264720	The constraints on your design and engineering is given by the planet, by the future of the planet.
5264720	5269120	Yes. That could almost make Jewish people like me again.
5270000	5277440	Every time you say Jewish people, I think I've been maybe reading a little too much about
5277440	5286640	Warlord or two, but man, I recommend you listen to some audio books or read some books on the
5286640	5295440	Holocaust because like it's heavy. It's heavy. It will put into context the impact of your words.
5296080	5299760	Would you read books on the current Holocaust that Black people are in?
5302720	5309520	What have you read about abortion? I've read a lot of short form writing and I listened to a lot
5309520	5319280	of debates because it's really humbling that the question of when does life begin is a really
5319280	5325520	difficult question. For me, it is an engineering scientist. It's a philosophical question.
5325520	5329680	I mean, we could just go on population control, not like if abortion is right or wrong.
5330320	5340000	We could say factually, the clinics were made by eugenics for population control and it is
5340000	5346400	controlling the population as is the never being given a 40 acres in a mule. So you don't have the
5346480	5351760	opportunity and when the people that do have the opportunity are separated from our people,
5351760	5356320	our tribe, and placed in suburban communities next to us, Chris Rocker put it, the dentist,
5356880	5364000	and whitewashed and made to shut the fuck up and vote left or whatever niggers are supposed
5364000	5374960	to do when we make it. As opposed to saying, okay, we're building schools, we're building up choirs,
5374960	5381680	we're building up our own leagues, basketball teams, our own factories. We started the first
5383120	5392160	sportswear factory in America since World War II was actually this factory I put in Cody.
5392160	5399200	So when I'm 45 years old, we're on this journey right now. This is the other thing about this,
5399520	5405840	people, just in general, they love me so much. I'm actually a hard guy to really hate for a
5405840	5412960	long period of time because of my huge cock. That's what I noticed. I didn't understand why
5412960	5419120	you showed it to me when we first met, but now I understand. It's very nice. Congratulations.
5420880	5427360	I know you don't talk about it, but your hat does say 24. If you run for president,
5427360	5428960	what kind of ideas would you represent?
5433760	5443280	That we're beings with engineering opportunities, I would represent.
5457680	5465120	Just as you served a platform here, there's something that happened on my last run that
5466800	5475120	I thought, I feel, I know was brilliant. It was noisy, but it was brilliant. I had one rally,
5476080	5483360	and in the rally, I just let people come up and I gave them a platform. It's our responsibility
5484080	5493520	to listen to the pain and hear the pain and understand, even when we're the ones that
5493520	5500160	cause the pain, like with my tweet. It's my responsibility to hear you and understand
5500720	5506240	why you feel like that, but it's our responsibility as a people to understand each other,
5507200	5518000	to give people a voice. People need the voice, and even right now, what I'm doing or how God
5518000	5526000	is using me, I'm showing where our voices are being muted. There's professors that are actually
5526000	5532800	intelligent, actually have multiple degrees that have been canceled from their schools,
5533760	5541440	and they don't have a music industry, or a fan base, or a shoe design, or a smoking hot ex-wife
5541440	5547120	to complain about. They've just got the truth of what they saw and what they dedicated to this
5547120	5555440	country and to education that has been muted by schools that have been taken over with an agenda,
5556160	5562240	and so you want the brightest minds to be these professors, and then you mute them,
5562240	5568640	and they have nowhere to go, and you might get a guy now that went from being someone's
5568640	5575600	favorite professor to he's working at Starbucks like he was back in school, or like he was back
5575600	5582000	in high school. So even if that voice is about anger and hate, it still deserves to be heard?
5582960	5590160	Yeah, it deserves to be heard, and we deserve to ask why. You have to ask why. I just feel
5590160	5598880	like that's what's- I feel like that is- sympathize with Mr. Hugecock. I'm just saying that it just
5598880	5606720	needs to be- You should change that to your name on Twitter while you're still allowed on there.
5606720	5611840	Yeah, do you think that would get censored? I feel like they definitely cut it down as
5611840	5620720	of interest. The- I'm pointing out this- I'm pointing out this truth. Now I'm saying this
5620720	5631120	is not a Christian thing, right? And you know, I wonder right there, when I say these jokes,
5632160	5638560	is it something that- because I do feel like laughter is the key- engineering and laughter,
5638560	5647200	right? Is the key to peace. Like when I go get my teeth cleaned and I have the nitrous, there's
5649440	5653520	something that I want to go and hug Christian, or I want to go and hug Corey Gamble. I want to go
5653520	5658800	and hug Howard Stern. No one wants to hug Howard Stern, but you know, just if-
5658800	5665120	No, no, no, no. Let's- I think- I would love to see you two hug it out and make up, even though all
5665120	5669440	the shit talking back and forth. What about talking it out, or is he going to be screaming at me?
5670480	5674400	Yeah, judgmental and that kind of stuff. No, I hope- I hope there's love there.
5674400	5684480	You know, the thing is, I think Howard's just jealous. You know, not just- not just jealous of
5684480	5691040	my cock. He's also- he's jealous that I started my campaign earlier than him.
5692000	5696480	You gotta let go of that jealousy. You gotta let go of that jealousy, Howard.
5697120	5700880	Howard and everybody else. Jealous is a natural human thing, man.
5700880	5707760	I wonder just as a Christian, right, when I joke and say this stuff, I- it's like, hmm, am I being
5707760	5719520	disobedient to God? Because as a boss, right, I'll talk to an employee and I'll be like,
5719520	5726560	why didn't you just listen? Because I've got the bigger plan, right? So it's like me talking to God,
5726560	5734400	were there things that I did in this interview that were disobedient to God? And- and for those
5734400	5740960	things, I- I pray and I repent for anything that I've said that was disobedient to God.
5741520	5747680	Humor is not one of them. Jokings. I feel like humor is the way we avoid so much suffering
5747680	5752640	in the world. It's the way to- it's like a catalyst for love. Like it's a way to-
5754080	5757920	people that have gone through some of the darkest trauma that I've ever met through war,
5757920	5764880	I just came back from Ukraine, they're laughing. They're- they're making jokes. That's the best
5764880	5769840	way to deal with dark times. I don't know what it is about, like humans. I feel like humor,
5771040	5775520	that's the best way to social engineer a good future. I think it's humor. Not taking
5775600	5779200	shit too seriously. That's the problem with censorship. One of the things that really suffer
5779920	5786000	is humor. Jokes. Maybe going too far in the jokes. You mentioned Anthony Jocelynik. That guy goes
5786000	5792560	hard. That guy goes really hard and it's great. He crosses all- he crosses all the lines and he's-
5792560	5797600	that's why he's a genius. And that's what people feel is refreshing when he does it. I don't know
5797600	5801920	what it is. But then it's like hurtful when I do it. But I'll tell you something that was interesting.
5802000	5810640	I'm pretty sure Anthony doesn't like- sorry for the assumption, but just most comedians I know
5811280	5818080	didn't vote for Trump. That's interesting. That's saying there aren't comedians that did,
5818080	5821280	but just the ones I know because I live in California, right? But they have an appreciation
5821280	5826160	for Trump because of the sense of humor. Yeah. Gotta ask you about parlor and engineering because
5826160	5833680	I'm interested about that. Hey man, I'm actually trying to hold it together. You're pretty- you're
5833680	5840080	pretty offensive towards a lot and- I'm not looking to be offensive. I really want to bring
5840080	5844240	people together and get these sales done. I know, but the work- 100% I see your vision.
5844240	5850960	How do we do that? With somebody who care- well, don't say Jewish media and Jewish controlled media.
5850960	5862640	J.M. Man, you sound- you sound like- it sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany
5862640	5868800	that was leading up to the atrocities. Oh, he would say J.M.? Yeah, he was a brand of J.M. That's
5868800	5882880	right. No, it's just the implied, like this memified prejudice towards a group in a way
5882880	5888080	that's going to lead to hate. And I know you don't mean that. I know you have love in your heart.
5888080	5890880	That's what I'm trying to- You know what was the prejudice towards a group that led to hate?
5891840	5905440	BLM. BLM took a black person, showed his death on camera, because okay, there are examples of
5906800	5912960	us being killed and being killed on camera, but if it was spread on camera, it was done on purpose
5912960	5924960	by the media, because 14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago every week, and it's not spread that much.
5925760	5933040	They, like you said, singled out a person, directed everything on that person, right,
5933040	5940800	as the martyr, and raised the people that hadn't had any- we didn't have our 40 acres of the mule,
5940800	5945600	we didn't have, you know, like a lot of things, right? Like that black people have not ever been
5945600	5954160	given. So once we're given just a little bit, like your life matters, right? Then we literally like,
5954160	5964640	okay, now we're being hurt, right? But actually, the death toll is up. The city where this happened
5964640	5970160	is completely been turned to a war zone. They actually, it's actually something like Candace
5970160	5978480	Owens can actually specify this better, but it's like its own city or something. They made it not
5978480	5984720	be a part of the actual state or something. It's like DC and stuff. It's like Washington DC now
5984720	5995840	and stuff, and that has to be from a government. You know, that's got higher level agenda written
5995840	6001360	all over it. Yeah, they're using the death of an individual. Yeah, sure, the media are,
6001920	6006720	not the Jewish media, the media, and that's the media is fucked up. That machine
6009600	6016400	does, takes whatever tragedy and pushes it towards whatever narrative that gets more clicks and views
6016400	6021120	and so on. Sure, and then politicians do the same. They use the media to influence the media,
6021120	6032720	to tell a story. This is a simple thing I put. I believe that the idea of anti-Semitism and
6033920	6047520	the closeness of the Holocaust is used by certain individuals in media to not take
6047600	6057040	accountability for the bad things that are happening. What's happening is there's a new
6057040	6064560	frontier, meaning it used to be okay for somebody to be a billionaire. We thought about a billionaire,
6066400	6070880	a lot of times you think of them actually kind of being out of shape, and 20 years ago, 30 years
6070880	6075280	ago, like Onassis or something. You thought about a different way. Now you think about a
6075280	6081120	billionaire. You think about Elon. You think Kim. You think, yay, you think it's a new kind of
6081120	6087760	billionaire. It's not just Soros is a billionaire. It's a new form of billionaire. Well, right now,
6087760	6094240	what I'm calling for the industry is, I'm calling the industry out and saying, hey,
6094960	6101760	it just so happens that there's been times where I had my lawyer was Jewish, my regular was Jewish,
6102320	6108880	like eight people that basically would collude and talk without me were in groups saying, okay,
6108880	6112160	this is what the tour is going to be. This is this next house, and they were making all these
6112160	6116240	decisions, and they're making all this money. And at the end, I was like, I ended my tour,
6116240	6120640	and I don't have the money. And it just so happens that that's the case, that what they were. But
6120640	6127360	what I'm saying is, if everyone can say, hey, you can't point out this fact, or we're going to say
6127360	6133200	you're anti-Semitic, and we're going to call you Hitler, I feel that there has to be at least
6133200	6142240	1% of safeguarding the ability to screw the artist based on saying it's anti-Semitic
6142240	6150320	by pointing out that they just so happen to all be Jewish. And I don't think that's anti-Semitism.
6150320	6156320	I just think that's, hey, this is another thing like, okay, the Kardashians, when you hear that,
6156880	6162640	do you think male or do you think female? You think female. You get what I'm saying? You think
6162640	6168960	this is the realities. This is why rap works, right? They're going to make an anti-women thing
6168960	6175200	in a second, right? And it's going to say, well, if you point out that these five women, six women,
6175200	6180080	are having a meeting on where the Christmas party is, and none of the ballplayers or rappers
6180080	6185120	that they have babies with have any say so, so that Christmas happened at Courtney's house
6185120	6190800	all eight years when I was there. And it never happened at anyone else's black family house,
6191360	6196960	right? If I'm the one that pointed it out, they just don't have, they don't have their,
6196960	6203040	or your anti-Semitic word to say, shut the fuck up. Because this is the way it runs and
6203040	6209360	this is the way we want to do it. If you say that though that women are silencing the black voice,
6210320	6216080	yes, you're going to get the same response, but especially if it historically resonates.
6216080	6222560	But what about the fact that it's true? When you talk in groups, that breeds hate.
6223440	6228080	When you talk about individuals, it solves problems. You're an engineering.
6228080	6234160	Okay, but this is something I pointed out on Pierce. I said, if a black person gets pulled over with a
6234160	6240880	car, and it's three other people in the car, they're also going to jail. They're not going to
6240880	6247040	single them out. They're going to say, you guys are all in collusion. I just described collusion
6247040	6255520	five times in this interview. And you keep on going back to this is like 1930. This is like this.
6255520	6262960	This is like that. What I'm saying is look, I want to work with you as an engineer to free
6262960	6271200	my people. Can we start as a being with engineer opportunities right here? I am sorry to the
6271200	6281440	people who had to be hurt and affected by that. Now we are here and I'm looking to solve it.
6281440	6286560	But what happens is every time if I talk to any of these business people one by one,
6286560	6291440	because mind you, I didn't get to the tweet by not having a conversation. I had the conversations
6291440	6297120	beforehand before I got to the tweet. Now we're going to take it to the stage. Now we're on the
6297120	6303920	world stage, right? And you saw Ari Emanuel do exactly the kind of thing that I was saying had
6303920	6309680	been done behind closed doors. Now he's doing it in open doors. They told Candice Owens,
6309680	6317920	I couldn't be on the daily wire. Like you can't even explain yourself and we don't care how you
6317920	6323600	got to that point either. And that's fucked up. They told Candice you can't be on daily.
6323600	6329040	Is that even about... Yes, she did. That's what they said. And you know what? And you can have
6329040	6333040	my voice raised or lower. I'm going to do it lower, right? Because what's happening to me by
6333760	6342720	I put it in your words, the media is saying not only can you not explain yourself, we don't care
6342720	6348160	how you got to that point. You need to apologize and you can't explain. And that's the end of the
6348160	6354400	story. So just apologize so we can have Mel Gibson do some more films is exactly what Ari Emanuel
6354400	6360960	was saying. No one is looking to change the problem that led so many people to that same
6360960	6365280	level of frustration. And I just so happened to be the one that's not going to back up on it
6365280	6373200	until this changes. Because you know what? I'm sorry. I had a sleepy text. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
6373200	6384160	for everything. I'm sorry that I put that I was 512 or 511 on Tinder. Okay. My cock is not 14
6384160	6390400	inches. I lied. Okay. It's only 13. Yeah. So I'm sorry, right? So the...
6391040	6397280	Why are you dropping so many facts today? So what I'm saying is, but where do we get to this?
6397280	6404080	Because even you, as engineering, as intelligent as you are, you just like everyone else that I
6404080	6410080	say and was colluding won't let us get to the point of fixing it. Yeah. But I'm not, I think you're
6410080	6414720	more powerful than the media. I'm not saying you need to apologize because the media I'm saying
6415360	6418880	everything we've been talking about just because I care for you and I want you to be
6418880	6424320	the best possible man you can be. To me, a definition of a great man, I'm with Martin
6424320	6429520	Luther King on this. You don't talk about Jews or black people. You talk about engineering.
6429520	6434080	You talk about humanity. You solve problems. You identify the problems in the world and you don't
6434080	6440240	come from a place of resentment. This group did this, this, fuck all that. That is in the past.
6440240	6444560	You just build solutions. I'm going to create a new record label. I'm going to create a new
6444560	6448400	design firm. I'm going to create a new social network. I'm going to do it better. I'm going to
6448400	6452480	do it right. I'm going to do it right by the people that I know don't have a voice. I'm going to
6452480	6457680	give them a voice and talk about that. Is it okay to call out collusion? Do people collude in your
6457680	6462240	business? Under you? Like the engineers that come together and say, they collude against the bosses,
6462240	6466560	right? You know why Bernardo No offered the deal and took it away from me? Collusion.
6468000	6472880	Because I was too powerful with the collective that I had right there. He had to stop that at all
6472880	6479600	costs. They said, for whatever reason, this kid, yay, it has the ability to have all of the Kardashians,
6479600	6486320	Jay-Z and Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Demna, Virgil, all these people in the same room working towards
6486320	6493280	the same goal. I've been that person since preschool. That's called a leader, right?
6493280	6501440	And right now, what I'm saying is, hey, for the people in business, whatever their background
6501440	6507440	is, whether they turn their cell phones off on Friday or not, there's been some bad business
6507440	6513680	done. There's some bad business practices. And we have to change that because this game is like
6513680	6522560	boxing. More people end up retarded than rich. And I'm saying like beat to a pulp, driven crazy,
6522560	6528960	beat by the media to a pulp. Right now, the media has done everything they could to make me apologize
6528960	6535680	and to make me look crazy. And that one person has done anything to find out why I was frustrated
6535680	6542320	enough to do that tweet. And that's facts. And that's fucked up. Well, I was hoping to. I am
6542320	6546960	finding out. We found out. I mean, but I want solutions. See, there's something about human
6546960	6552480	nature where if you focus too much on resentment. We're not focusing on anymore. Fuck the resentment.
6552480	6557360	We're moving forward. Right. So there's two things I think that are required for. I mean,
6557360	6561920	this is how I've lived my life for great engineering. You surround yourself in your
6561920	6568240	personal life by people you trust. And then in your professional life from the engineering
6568240	6573680	perspective with the team, with an incredible team, and everything else doesn't matter. That
6573680	6579040	allows you not to focus on other groups, how they're fucking you over, how they're like trying to
6579040	6583440	manipulate a collude and all that kind of stuff. You focus on solutions and you find a way around
6583440	6588160	all the difficult shit. That's it. If you have people in your life, you can trust.
6589920	6593280	That's like lifelong. You said like some people you're with for the summer,
6594400	6599440	for a year, find people you can be with for your whole life. Do you have people in your life
6599440	6608560	that you trust? Like really trust? No, I trust God. At any point, a human being can like,
6608560	6617440	I could like, if I like go and like, really, you know, treat this guy like a piece of shit or do
6617440	6623760	this and that, am I supposed to, you know, trust him to be loyal and stay in the situation? No,
6623760	6628720	I trust people to be people and people are flawed. And people can have the right intentions,
6628720	6635120	but it only makes sense for us to work together when our agendas align. When Kim was pulled
6636080	6644160	really far to the left, our agendas no longer, you know, aligned so that made the marriage
6644800	6648960	impossible. It aligned where it's like, oh, I could wear a red hat that can help her to get
6648960	6655360	Alice Johnson out of jail because Trump's willing to do that for my wife because I was the only
6655360	6659680	person in my position that stood up and say, wait a second, I like you, you know, because
6660160	6665120	but isn't there a deeper agenda, the human agenda of just being in love? Like that's just
6665120	6669600	Paul. What you're talking about, red hat is just politics, right? I mean, the world is becoming
6669600	6674000	more and more transactional every day. And actually, marriages are actually, actually
6674000	6678880	originally based on transactions, you know, and that's why they're less needed, the more autonomous
6678880	6684000	as we come, or the world makes it less needed. I feel like we do need each other. I feel like we
6684000	6691680	do need someone we can always, you know, count on. It's like, I'm yay, pulled away by King Koopa,
6691680	6697120	which is the media, the politics, the promise, oh, we're going to keep you safe. So the thing,
6697120	6703840	the reason why I get, you know, really frustrated with Chris Jenner is she says losing Rob Kardashian
6704480	6709520	was the greatest mistake of her life, but she never gave Kim's hand over in marriage,
6709520	6716000	because this is the bottom line. When me and Kim met, we were millionaires or whatever, right?
6716000	6722320	You're telling me you just hand her hand over in marriage that your daughter's not successful,
6722320	6728000	handing your hand over in marriage to, but no, she had to still be the husband to all of her
6728000	6735520	daughters. And we see what the results are consistently. So that's where I get, you know,
6735520	6742880	frustrated. It's like, let that go. Let this person do what you made mistakes on. Don't make
6742880	6746960	this person relive those same mistakes and then put that agenda into my daughters too.
6748560	6754640	Is there somebody in your life close to you that you trust enough to call you out on your
6754640	6762560	bullshit? We're all full of shit sometimes. What's my bullshit? Well, some of it I pointed out today,
6762640	6766560	but I don't know you deeply enough. What was the bullshit? Jewish media, Jewish...
6766560	6771200	That's not bullshit. The bullshit is that the Jewish media won't admit...
6771200	6776320	Your dad was right. Your dad was right. The words you used, you weren't...
6776880	6780080	And I said it, you're not going to make me say it 800 more times.
6781280	6784640	I don't know if you resonate it, because you keep saying like the words...
6784640	6789040	Did it resonate to y'all that y'all ain't do nothing about it? And that all y'all want to do
6789040	6794720	is have somebody apologize and sweep under the rug your bullshit that you've been doing the whole
6794720	6801440	time. You want the same bullshit as the other people. So you're doing the same thing that the
6801440	6806480	other, let's say, media, because I'm not allowed to say, has done. So until somebody says...
6806480	6812800	Which is what, man? Which is what? I'm trying to call you out on your bullshit because I hope
6812800	6815760	I'm somebody you can trust. That's it. I don't fucking trust you.
6818000	6821920	Well, you should find people in your life you can trust. Don't tell me what I should do.
6821920	6828720	I'm not one of your BLM marchers. Listen, I'm with you on the BLM. A lot of organizations
6829680	6834320	use tragedy. And I watched the Candice Owens documentary.
6835280	6840640	And what was your take on it? I think it's important to question the mainstream narratives,
6840640	6849120	but I don't agree with it. I still believe that George Floyd died from the knee of the cop,
6850000	6856400	not from fentanyl. And even if that was the case, there's still 50% of Black deaths is actually
6856400	6864400	abortion. So let's get into engineering. Let's just go... How do you fix that?
6864400	6873680	Population control is social engineering and its most literal form. The Blacks that are under
6873680	6878480	population control, that's something that... I mean, that's just what it is.
6879120	6882960	African Americans are not choosing to get at the abortion. I mean, it's a choice. It's an individual
6882960	6888800	choice. But we're being influenced to. Well, then speak to the community and help. I mean,
6888800	6894800	I don't know what the engineering solutions there are. It could be you're doing that in part
6894800	6900080	by speaking to the value and the power of family. Well, watch this. I was building
6901600	6910640	shelters. I bought land in Calabasas. I bought two ranches in Wyoming, 300 acres in Calabasas,
6910640	6916160	12,000 acres in total in Wyoming. And I started building ideas for shelters.
6916400	6924400	And God set it on my heart to make monasteries, which would be modern day facilities that don't
6924400	6933920	turn people down, that have farms, that have shelter, clothing. But first of all, water.
6933920	6940560	First of all, knowledge, because knowledge is the most important resource to our species
6940560	6947120	above water. Knowledge, it's itself. Because then you can go get water. I mean, you can argue like
6947120	6953200	if you're a baby, how do you go out? But the baby doesn't have it. So someone with the knowledge
6953200	6963760	then feeds the baby the water. But it's important that those with the knowledge teach the baby
6963760	6970160	how to find the water themselves. And the business people that I've been dealing with
6970160	6976000	have been keeping the baby sick by not sharing the information and the knowledge
6976000	6981360	with inside of those contracts. My people are sick. If I load up
6982880	6990400	Apple Music right now, and I play the top songs in the rap chart, I would tell you my people
6990400	6998080	are sick. If I go to the restaurants in opportunity zones, and we look at the calorie rating and the
6998080	7005440	cholesterol, I would tell you that my people are sick. If we look at the obesity rate, if you go to
7005440	7011520	just a restaurant somewhere in middle America, Denny's or something, I went to Denny's the other
7011520	7017280	day, you will see that my people are sick and my people meaning all people. But black people are
7017280	7025280	very influential to all people. So if the media picks an overweight black woman and says,
7025280	7034080	this is body goals, then the media are influencing my people to stay sick. And it just so happens
7034720	7044960	that that night, I was so frustrated after 20 years that I had to call it out in one tweet
7044960	7052000	that now, even if I say, hey, okay, I was frustrated for these reasons, now it's not good enough.
7052000	7057120	You've literally tried to make me re-apologize 10 times in this meeting,
7057120	7063520	resay this, resay that, but it doesn't change the fact that my people are sick. And I'm the only
7063520	7070080	person in my position that will say that my people are sick. Today, not 30 years ago, not 60 years,
7070080	7076400	my people are sick today. 50% of my peoples of deaths are abortion today. My people don't have
7076400	7082560	the opportunities today, even to the point that because if J.P. Morgan had been nice to me and
7082560	7086640	if Alex Klein and STEM player had been fair to me, different things, then I wouldn't even point
7086640	7092320	it out that we don't have any black, we have two black engineers. So I have to have a responsibility
7092320	7101600	obviously to all people, but specifically to my tribe, because tribes move. Tribalism is real
7101600	7107760	with black people to separate the brightest from the tribe or to separate the leaders. It is factual
7107760	7113280	that the CIA removed the leaders from the black community, put crack in the communities, put
7113280	7117200	guns in the communities, and locked up all the leaders and called them gang leaders, right?
7117760	7122800	Locked up all the leaders, locked up all the fathers. Now 72% of black mothers are raising
7123600	7130000	children by themselves. This is an agenda like a Tuskegee experiment set on my people, right?
7130000	7137360	And what I'm calling out for the black people in entertainment is, what are we doing? We have to
7137360	7143520	collude. And if we don't collude, because even if I said, hey, I'd like to make a company that's all
7143520	7150080	black, right? Is that okay for me to say? Is that okay for me to say? Or is that anti-Semitic?
7150880	7156720	See, if I hadn't crossed the line so far, then that would have sounded anti-Semitic. Now I've
7156720	7162800	stretched a bit, so now we can go to, okay, let's make an all black company. But that would have
7162800	7168000	been anti-Semitic. Just that concept, because you could word that in a different way that would
7168000	7174160	sound anti-Semitic. I don't know, man. No, no, listen, if you were, if I said I didn't want to have the
7174160	7179840	Jewish people in the company, would that be anti-Semitic? It would sound like it, right? You'd
7179840	7185200	say I'm from 1930s, right? Yeah. But for me as a tribe to say, no, I want an all black company,
7185920	7190640	right? I'm generally against that kind of thing. But first of all, you have the right to do whatever
7190640	7196640	the hell you want. Well, what I'm saying is that's what I feel may need to happen for my people to
7196720	7202880	have power again, because when my people have been left under the media's control, we've been made
7202880	7208240	sick. We've been allowed to be sick. We've been, and we're promoting sickness. I think, at least in
7208240	7215040	the engineering realm, I haven't met an engineer who happens to be black who would like to be called
7215040	7220640	a black engineer. And when you have a company of all black people that are engineers, I don't know
7220640	7228240	the creative arts, I apologize. But engineering, they really tried to look at each other's humans
7228240	7233600	and look at the problem. And you want to know, you want to have the confidence that everybody on the
7233600	7244240	team is the best possible person for the job. What I can say is the world is sick. And I have
7244320	7253280	slight images of utopia, slight images of happiness, slight images as a visionary and a creator.
7254240	7262400	And I know for a fact, the way that business deals have been done for me are keeping the world sick.
7264560	7272400	Fix them. I see that's what you're trying to do. And you probably listen, people should not doubt
7272400	7279360	you. But I got to tell you, I have to be honest. This is silly because you don't know me.
7280000	7284880	But it hurt when you say you don't trust me. You kind of lost me. I don't think anyone's ever said
7284880	7294720	that to me. I don't know, man. Fuck that. I don't care about views or clickbait or any of that bullshit.
7295760	7301280	I just thought you were one of the greatest artists ever. It'd be cool to talk to you.
7301280	7306160	And I feel like you got pain you're working through. And never had anyone say that to me.
7307200	7311440	I'm just being a mess about it, I guess. It's fucked up though. But maybe it's not.
7311440	7314240	Maybe you shouldn't trust it, but I just haven't had that experience.
7315040	7318880	Yeah. Do you think I would trust anybody at this point in my life?
7318880	7326480	Yeah, it's tough. It's tough. I hear you. And it's also kind of good to see how much strength you got.
7327200	7330320	You're not broken by any of this. You're under a lot of attack.
7331280	7338080	A lot of attack by a lot of people. You have a vision and you're trying to feel your way through
7338080	7343680	it. And you might get destroyed for it. That's the human, that's the risk you take.
7345360	7349040	It's a wonderful life though. What do you hope your legacy is?
7349760	7352800	To be forgotten. Do you think you'd be forgotten?
7353600	7360560	Because the memory, there's ego and memory in the memories. Who designed the sidewalk?
7361120	7366720	Who designed the water fountain? Who designed the stop sign? Who designed the stop light?
7366720	7371920	These things are so ubiquitous that the person that designed them is forgotten.
7373600	7380960	If it's a good idea, it's a God idea. And I don't know, VCs can own it.
7383200	7389360	So you want your designs in all rounds of life to be so simple that they
7391760	7397440	permeate everything. They take over. And you're forgotten. That's a successful design.
7397440	7398960	Is you're forgotten? Yes.
7400320	7404560	Do you have advice for people? A lot, a lot, a lot of young people look up to you.
7404560	7409520	Do you have advice for young people of how to live a life they can be proud of?
7409520	7413920	Don't tweet while you're sleepy.
7415120	7415680	Take a nap?
7417680	7422080	Surely there's other things. I love the humor. Don't take it seriously, I suppose.
7422080	7422800	That's what that means.
7424640	7432240	We don't send sleepy tweets unless you buy your own social platform the very next week
7432240	7437040	called Parler. But other than that, if you're not going to buy your own social platform,
7437920	7442560	is that why you bought Parlers so you could be sleepy and send messages out into the world?
7443360	7447760	I actually am really interested in the engineering aspects of Parler. Is there a vision there?
7447760	7450080	Because I'm also super interested in Elon by Twitter.
7450640	7460880	I like Instagram better than Twitter. And I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg liked Instagram better than
7460880	7467040	Facebook or saw how valuable that was and he bought it.
7467040	7470880	So you'd like to take Parler or something, whatever is the magic that makes Instagram work,
7470880	7471840	you want to push there?
7471840	7477440	I thought it was interesting how it felt like Snapchat made the Kardashians bully Instagram.
7478720	7482640	What's the point of Snapchat going to war on Instagram?
7483600	7487600	Yeah, I mean, just everyone wants to say, well, this is our value, Snapchat.
7487680	7490320	No one wants to lose their value to someone else's value, whatever.
7491360	7496400	And everything is just, what's the difference between permanent and temporary?
7497440	7503680	Is this a permanent structure? And until God says it's not, it's like nothing's permanent.
7503680	7507920	Our life is not permanent. So how do we just let go of those things?
7507920	7512960	Even like going from the name Kanye West to Yay was the beginning of just letting go
7513680	7518960	of some things, of these titles. Like we need to remove the titles like, hey,
7519760	7527920	if I have to leave Adidas and I have to go next computers, that may take me out of the
7528480	7535680	billionaire standing all together. And I got to get low for having long God says I have to get low
7535760	7543600	and refocus. I've been reshaping, refocusing my staff. I had some people that were good
7543600	7548240	and I had some people that weren't. I had too many people and I've got a vision inside of me.
7548240	7552960	And I'm like, this is how I make this vision. I have to bring this vision to life.
7554080	7561200	I have to bring these houses to life. I was talking to one of our architects on,
7562160	7567280	you know, we're actually getting close on it. I've like built it a few times. I had like the
7567280	7576240	domes you probably saw and I said, you know, how we transform Kim's house and we're getting there.
7576240	7581680	So you want to get into architecture? Like you really want this to become physical reality?
7581680	7585280	Yes. And I've got close. Rome wasn't built to the day.
7585280	7589520	Yeah, but Rome had to start somewhere. I got to call you out on the advice.
7589520	7593360	There really is a lot of people that look up to you and you've lived a really difficult life
7594640	7599680	and you made it through all of it. What do you advise them to do?
7600240	7608240	Do everything that you feel. Even if you are told that it's the wrong thing. No, no, no, no, no,
7608240	7614480	no, but not anything violent. So do what you feel. Say what you feel. Like trust your heart.
7614560	7621120	Yeah, trust your gut. Trust your instincts because that instinct is who God made you to be.
7622240	7626960	Not, you know, what lines up with your like frat brothers or what lines up with
7627840	7632080	what your dad wanted or what lines up with your classmates or, you know, it's just
7634000	7638320	God has something inside of you and when you walk down the street, you're thinking about it
7638320	7642720	and then you just see it in the window and you go down another street and you see the same thing
7642720	7647280	or you're thinking about a number and that number pops up or you see it on a license plate and that's
7647280	7658560	just, you know, something is trying to say be the maximum. Yay. You know, be the maximum you
7659280	7668000	and God won't give you anything that you can't handle. So for me, everything is a yes. I think
7668000	7674960	they say be like water. I know Bruce Lee said that or a matter of fact, just be
7676240	7680640	because we are beings with engineering opportunities.
7681840	7689200	Beautifully put. Yay. I have hope. I have faith that however this turns out that
7690160	7694800	you have the skill and the capacity to really add love to the world and I hope you do that.
7695040	7700640	I really, really hope you do that and we talked about the tension of that, the challenges and
7700640	7707200	the opportunities of that. I mean, I see how we could be of use to each other. You actually have
7707200	7713840	a particular thing for me as I eject from media because even also, you know, I'm really big at
7713840	7719520	like, you know, burning the Phoenix too. All you know as an engineer that your cells completely
7719760	7726160	regenerate every seven years. I think I rushed the process a little bit. So I run around looking
7726160	7732560	like a burn victim sometimes. Yeah. But I gotta tell you, anyone I am close with, I work with,
7732560	7737680	there has to be trust, there has to be love and I think you've been burned quite a bit in your life.
7739200	7742240	Sometimes I did it myself. I put my hand on the stove.
7742480	7749600	Love. So how do we get to engineering? There's a deal to be done here. Not saying you're making
7749600	7753200	this money off of that. I'm making that money off. I don't care about money, by the way.
7753200	7760880	Same twins. So there's dealings here. You got pain, I got pain, but we're beings with
7760880	7765600	engineering opportunities. For a long time, I thought somebody should create a new social network
7766400	7772160	and it looks like great engineering could do that. You got two at one time from two of your
7772160	7776880	homeboys at one time. Yeah. And that's a great way. I mean, every, you know, it can be done from
7776880	7782880	scratch or it can be done anew with an already established platform. Yeah. I'm very excited
7782880	7790080	by that possibility. Parler is smaller. Twitter is larger. I wonder whether you can do any kind of
7790080	7794560	revolutionary engineering with a large company. If anyone can, I would say it's Elon.
7795120	7801760	Well, Elon can look at what we do over here. That's why I like, God does this a lot of times.
7803360	7809760	He creates doppelgangers. There's a lot of examples where theory happened two places at
7809760	7814800	one time. A really similar type of personality happens at one time.
7814800	7818800	It's weird. It's beautiful. It's hilarious, actually. It's kind of humorous.
7819600	7827680	So we should just share every piece of information together as I go build
7828640	7833760	Parler and as he builds up Twitter and see how to make both those better. But I'll be like,
7833760	7840560	hey, I'm not going to let Snapchat bully me out of adding something to it that's best. It should
7840560	7850640	just be the best platform possible. That means TikTok has amazing features.
7850640	7856240	Twitter has amazing things about it. I know this girl that's like, I like Instagram better than
7856240	7861600	Twitter. She likes that Twitter has porn. But other than that, Instagram. But I was like,
7862480	7867280	Instagram is porn also. It's soft. It's more subtle. It's not telling you. It's not
7867920	7871040	it's not conservative by any means.
7873520	7877040	And that's the thing. You have to please a lot of people with these platforms.
7877040	7882960	And I think the goal of a platform should be to help individuals
7884960	7892240	maximize their long-term happiness and growth, like intellectually, spiritually,
7892240	7895520	psychologically, all of that. And it's a tricky thing to figure out how to do that.
7896480	7899680	Of course, you could just have a platform that's just strictly for fun. I think that's
7899680	7906560	where TikTok leans. But there has, I think there's a balance to strike. Like Twitter,
7906560	7910240	there's a lot of intellectual philosophical stuff going on on Twitter, but it somehow
7910240	7915200	currently makes it too easy to be divisive and hateful towards each other and cancel and all
7915200	7920080	that kind of stuff. I think we need to have these healthy conversations. That's what it is,
7920080	7926160	healthy conversations, healthy dialogues. That's the biggest thing. Like when I first wore the red
7926160	7934640	hat, the conversation is less healthy than it is today. The conversation about George Floyd,
7935520	7941600	you know, it's like, did I send the tweet the right way? Did his Candace Owens documentary
7941600	7948480	perfect? Is it Michael Moore? Is that documentary a perfect century self? Is it fully accurate?
7948480	7956000	You know, it's two to three hours of a transmit of information through a particular, usually one
7956000	7962320	person's view. And anything you want to research, if you're interested in it,
7963680	7970560	you got to look at 10 versions of it, 20 versions of it. George Floyd, we've looked at one version
7970560	7978640	of that. Now we have a second. Well, by the time we get to the, you know, I know this is like,
7979600	7984880	it's not my last hoodie, but it's definitely not my first hoodie that I put on. You know,
7984880	7992400	it's like, that's how we got to, like even this particular size of zipper or the fact that, you
7992400	7999120	know, for people who know, they know that that's like car heart, even though the car heart tag
7999120	8004720	isn't there anymore, you just know by the shape of it, you feel it. So it abstracts, it takes into
8004720	8011520	like this Cubist place, like Picasso, Matisse, or African Cubism, or Dire Straits Money for nothing,
8011520	8017600	and your chicks for free. Look at that. I wouldn't think you'd reference Dire Straits. Look at you.
8017600	8023280	That video. Yeah, I know. It's a great video. Your encyclopedic knowledge of music is great.
8023280	8031520	I think that, you know, porn is not just sexual. That term actually relates to torture. Like,
8031520	8036320	you know what I'm saying? Like watching people beat each other up on, on Worldstar or something,
8036320	8041680	you know, it's like, that's called torture porn. There's also food porn. How do you explain that?
8041680	8046880	What's food porn? Food porn is like looking at really delicious cakes and cookies and steak and so
8046880	8052000	on. And you're like, holy shit. Exactly. Architecture. Like this people who love architecture,
8052000	8055200	when they see architecture, I know, I got friends that would be like, oh, that's porn.
8055760	8058720	Yeah. Architecture. Yeah. Yeah, it's like,
8060000	8067040	that's like love, like dopamine fueled love for a thing. Yeah, we need, that's beautiful. I think
8067040	8074000	that's beautiful. Well, I think as long as nobody's getting hurt. The intoxication that people have,
8075040	8079360	you know, the worst part is like, when one person's in love and the other person's in like,
8079680	8086880	that's us right now. Well, who's in like? No, because you said you love Bill Maher and you like me.
8088480	8095600	And I love you. So that was, no, I actually love you both. All right. All right. And the funny thing
8095600	8110640	is like, as a visionary, visionaries are more extreme than business people. Because a visionary
8111280	8117440	would do bad business for their vision. A business person will never do bad business.
8117440	8122080	It's well put. Yeah, it's really well put. So when you say I don't care about money, it's like,
8122080	8126800	yeah, I feel you. Like I feel that I care in a way that I need that. But
8129120	8142560	I care about the vision that I have to a Steve Jobs level to the point of putting that above
8144160	8149840	my regular human existence, meaning having to go and take all the arrows,
8150480	8158480	that I become a soldier of the vision. Because someone could say, a wife could say to,
8159120	8166960	like say, like in the 60s, their husband's about to go to war. The wife may not want
8166960	8174960	their husband to go to war because of their children. But he's going to war
8174960	8178720	because of their children.
8181120	8184960	Definitely. Do you regret any aspect of just giving everything to your vision?
8185600	8189200	I mean, you've spoken about that saying like, I got fucked over in the business side.
8189840	8194640	I promise that I had to stop envying
8195280	8209760	cool people at their current cool time. If anything, if someone's cool, and I say their name a lot,
8210560	8218640	I'm going to flash the light on them so much that it ages their coolness. It's actually a war
8218640	8229040	technique, showered in compliments. Because to be able to stay at 45 years old is still
8229040	8236080	be the bad kid in class. At 45, I'm still in the principal's office. Because if you look at,
8236080	8241760	like say fashion, right? If you think of something fashionable, it's probably going to look like the
8241760	8247520	kid in the principal's office. That's going to be the fashion. And that's part of the reason why
8247520	8254640	I'm the most influential person at fashion. And fashion because I refuse to leave the principal's
8254640	8260000	office. If the substitute teacher comes in, I'm going to say, you got a big butt.
8260560	8266960	Yeah. Right back to the principal's office. And people are going to be like, yo.
8268400	8273360	And that's what you keep on saying. Like, who can we talk to? Because no one can talk to me.
8274080	8283280	No, I'm out of control, bro. It's just God, then me, and then fuck everybody. That's
8283280	8287360	really how I live my life. And I just want to say this one thing about the children thing,
8287360	8291760	I wanted to put that point together, put that idea together that I don't like the word point.
8291760	8296080	I'm really big on words, words being powerful, says the person with the sleepy tweet.
8298000	8299040	You're full of contradictions.
8299760	8305440	Yeah. I'm a human being, right? It's like, some days I'm like, I could go 30 days and be sullable.
8305440	8312240	You know, like really like I'm a monk. I'm being like faithful to God. And then I'll go like working
8312240	8316800	out. No carbs. Like my weight will fluctuate. And I'll have times I'm like, I don't feel like
8316800	8322160	being told what to do. So I don't want to work out with a trainer. And I just want to drink this
8322160	8330080	Hennessy. But I want to say this thing that I will text to Kim sometimes. I'll say, you may not
8330080	8338240	understand what I'm doing right now, but you will. And that's what I would say to everyone.
8338240	8344560	You may not understand what I'm doing. And this gives a little bit, maybe we're like 20% there,
8344560	8347680	but there's still going to be people, we leave this interview and they were like,
8347680	8353440	I still don't like the way you apologize. I still don't want to say what my involvement would have
8353440	8357920	been to make him lead them to that point. And we just want things to be how they are. There's
8357920	8363360	people in the world who want the world to stay as it is. And there's people who want to change the
8363360	8369680	world. And that's happened throughout time. They say that with Da Vinci halfway into a conversation,
8369680	8374880	he could not suffer fools so much that he would walk away halfway into the conversation.
8375520	8384800	And I said, well, that's why it's the Da Vinci code and not the Da Vinci world. And every time
8384800	8392400	I go and piss off a group of people or do these things, on some end, it's like I could be turning
8392400	8399440	my thing from a potential world vision to a code, or I could be opening up conversations with new
8399440	8407200	friends that I may trust someday. That's beautiful. Because the change you will have on the world,
8407200	8414080	that you don't know for sure, but it'll happen across years, even decades. So you have to think
8414080	8418880	in the future. Like you're working in the future. Your actions are working in the future. And a
8418880	8423280	lot of people will judge this conversation and others you've done and so on in the present. And
8423280	8427920	that doesn't matter. You know why I apologize? Why I say I'm sorry to the Jewish people that I hurt?
8428800	8437200	It's not about, like I said, I'm not going to hold this apology hostage. Obviously it's about God,
8437200	8442800	but God is everything. So what's the point of even having language and you can't engineer if you say
8442800	8451280	God, God, God. God asks us to be judgmental so that you become a fewer doctor. It's your judgment
8451280	8457680	that saves grandma. And God puts that in this. We have God inside us. We're a piece of God.
8457760	8465760	Also, right? So I'm going to go specific to a person. That story about Da Vinci alone
8466560	8472880	is enough of a reason for me to give a sincere apology to the Jewish people. Because I do believe
8473520	8478480	that there's a Da Vinci code inside of all of my misspellings and scribbles right here
8479360	8489200	that God wants me to get to the world. And when I'm in my way, if God has set something on me,
8489200	8493600	when I'm in my way, I'm in God's way. Now I can point at other people and say, Hey,
8493600	8499120	you guys are in God's way because you're not listening to me. But if I'm in my way,
8499120	8505280	I'm not listening to God. And for me to be a philosopher and a leader or whatever other language,
8505280	8512880	I have to listen to God. So before God, what I would do is start off as a samurai and say,
8512880	8517920	I'm sorry for hurting you as a Jewish person. I'm sorry for the way that made you feel.
8518560	8526000	And I'm sorry for the entire population of a race that I feel is actually my brothers because I
8526000	8531520	classify and feel that I'm also connected with Christ in that way, that my people came from
8531520	8537760	Africa in that way. And I can't say it's this exact teaching or that exact teaching, but I feel
8537760	8542720	that there's an important, you know, the sons of Abraham, however we want to word it, right,
8542720	8548400	for us to come together and bring our different talents together to serve God collectively.
8548960	8557200	And he, as much of an alien as I am, he does not call for me to alienate. And that's what
8557200	8564080	the problem has been, especially in politics and in America. He plays America as the TV,
8564080	8569120	as the radio to the world. We invented rock and roll, right? We are the influencers of the rest
8569120	8575120	of the planet. We're the youngest startup in history, right? We're the youngest country,
8575120	8580880	we're the youngest superpower, right? So for me in my position, the fact that I can talk to
8580880	8585440	Trump one day and be at a game with Kim Kardashian the next day and then be
8585440	8592560	at Paris Fashion Week, they don't want me to be involved with language of decisive,
8592560	8600320	divisive language, you know, proving that I can be just as racist as a racist white person.
8600320	8606480	Oh, I can, I can be a racist black person also. That's not what God has called me to do. So how
8606560	8615040	do I simplify and say, hey, to you as a visionary, as a, as an engineer, as a person that's giving
8615040	8620960	me a platform that as my brother, I want to apologize to you for how that made you feel
8620960	8627040	and to the rest of the people that carry specifically that pain, not the pain that I
8627040	8631120	talk about. That doesn't seem to be as much of a pain for people when I talk about
8632000	8637280	the abortion clinics and stuff. That's, it's like, that's the argued pain even in my own community.
8637280	8643840	Like not everyone thinks that's a pain, but for the Jewish community, it's collectively this was
8644640	8651440	a pain and I've gone, I've gone so far just psychologically on this journey since that
8651440	8657200	statement had happened where I didn't want to like give up the candy in my pocket. I didn't
8657200	8661920	want to say, Hey, I stuck my hand, my hand in the candy jar. I wanted to defend my freedom of
8661920	8667680	speech. I wanted this, but even with freedom of speech, pain is pain. Causing people to hurt
8667680	8674080	is not helping. Causing people to hurt is not helping. So that means I have to take a more
8674080	8681760	sophisticated approach to engineering this problem. This problem is the opportunity.
8682640	8689680	And yes, that what could some people may deem as a mistake, would it be more genuine if I called
8689680	8698000	it a mistake? I think I would be hypocritical by calling a mistake with the ending of that,
8698000	8702240	the idea I'm going to say out loud. So I, I'm not, I don't try to be a hypocrite on purpose.
8702480	8713200	So, but I will call it a mistake to add a genuine, to be genuine about the feeling with that mistake
8715840	8723440	with me as a human being, not to justify, but I have to state that God makes no mistakes,
8723440	8729120	because if I hadn't made that mistake, I wouldn't be in front of you today. And that's not to justify
8730080	8737920	this sleepy text, but I can tell you're a man that has love in his heart. And I hear that,
8737920	8743200	I hear it through the words explicitly and implicitly. And I think if we're to engineer a
8743200	8750000	better future, the way to do that is with love. So as one human to another, I love you, brother.
8750080	8756160	Thank you for talking today. This is great. I like you too. Son of a bitch.
8760160	8765920	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. To support the
8765920	8770720	spot guests, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with
8770720	8778720	some words from Ye himself. Nothing in life is promised except death. Thank you for listening
8778720	8788720	and hope to see you next time.
