1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,760
What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,920
The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,200
focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,920
visual perception, and consciousness.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,760
He's the author of over 120 scientific papers

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,120
on these topics, and his most recent book titled

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,080
The Case Against Reality, Why Evolution

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,640
Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,720
like those of Donald Hoffman's attempt to shake

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,840
the foundation of our understanding of reality,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,240
and thus they take a long time to internalize deeply.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,400
So proceed with caution. Questioning the fabric of reality

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
can lead you to either madness or the truth.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,120
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

19

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,000
And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
In your book The Case Against Reality,

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,120
Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,920
you make the bold claim that the world we see with our eyes is not real.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,600
It is completely detached from objective reality.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,120
Can you explain this idea? Right.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,240
So this is a theorem from Evolution of a Natural Selection.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,400
So the technical question that I and my team asked was,

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,080
what is the probability that natural selection would shape

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,240
sensory systems to see true properties of objective reality?

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
And to our surprise, we found that the answer is precisely zero, except for one

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,400
kind of structure that we can go into if you want to.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
But for any generic structure that you might think the world might have,

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,160
a total order, a topology metric, the probability is precisely zero

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,400
that natural selection would shape any sensory system of any organism

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,480
to see any aspect of objective reality.

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:15,200
So in that sense, what we're seeing is what we need to see

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
to stay alive long enough to reproduce.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,880
So in other words, we're seeing what we need to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,000
So the evolutionary process, the process that took us from the original life on earth

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,280
to the humans that we are today, that process does not maximize

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
for truth and maximizes for fitness, as you say.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Fitness beats truth.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,680
And fitness does not have to be connected to truth is the claim.

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,680
And that's where you have an approach towards zero of probability that we

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,240
have evolved human cognition, human consciousness, whatever it is,

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,160
the magic that makes our mind work, evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,040
but its ability to survive in the environment.

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
That's exactly right.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,360
So most of us intuitively think that surely the way that evolution will make our senses

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,880
more fit is to make them tell us more truths, or at least the truths we need to know

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,360
about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
That's the standard view.

54
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,840
And it was the view I took.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
I mean, that's sort of what we're taught or just even assume.

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
It's just sort of like the intelligent assumption that we would all make.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
But we don't have to just wave our hands.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,240
Evolution of a natural selection is a mathematically precise theory.

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,600
John Maynard Smith in the 70s created evolutionary game theory.

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,400
And we have evolutionary graph theory and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,320
And so we don't have to wave our hands.

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,640
It's a matter of theorem and proof and or simulation before you get the theorems and proofs.

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
And a couple of graduate students of mine, Justin Mark and Brian Marion,

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,440
did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off that there was something going on here.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
And then I went to a mathematician, Chaitan Prakash and Manish Singh and

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,680
some other friends of mine, Chris Fields.

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
And but Chaitan was the real mathematician behind all this.

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,680
And he's proved several theorems that uniformly indicate that with one exception,

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,760
which has to do with probability measures, there's no the probability zero.

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
The reason there's an exception for probability measures,

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,480
so-called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes, is that for any scientific theory,

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,880
there is the assumption that needs to be made that the whatever

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,040
structure, the whatever probabilistic structure the world may have,

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure of our perceptions.

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,880
If they were completely unrelated, then no science would be possible.

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,160
So this is technically, the map from reality to our senses has to be a so-called

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,480
measurable map, has to preserve sigma algebras.

78
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,160
But that means it could be infinite to one and it could collapse all sorts of event information.

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,880
But other than that, there's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory for fitness payoff

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,520
functions, for example, to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
So you can ask the technical question. This is one of the avenues we took.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,520
If you look at all the fitness payoffs from whatever world structure you might want to

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
imagine, so a world with, say, a total order on it.

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's got n states and they're totally ordered.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,120
And then you can have a set of maps from that world into a set of payoffs,

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,920
say from zero to a thousand or whatever you want your payoffs to be.

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,440
And you can just literally count all the payoff functions.

88
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
And just do the combinatorics and count them.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
And then you can ask a precise question.

90
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
How many of those payoff functions preserve the total order?

91
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
If that's what you're looking for.

92
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
Or how many preserve the topology?

93
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
And you just count them and divide.

94
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
So the number that are homomorphisms versus the total number,

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,560
and then take the limit as the number of states in the world,

96
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,760
and the number of payoff values goes very large.

97
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,600
And when you do that, you get zero every time.

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,320
Okay, there's a million things to ask here.

99
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,520
But first of all, just in case people are not familiar with your work,

100
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,360
let's sort of linger on the big, bold statement here,

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,040
which is the thing we see with our eyes

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
is not some kind of limited window into reality.

103
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
It is completely detached from reality,

104
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
likely completely detached from reality.

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,040
You're saying 100% likely.

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.

107
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,920
In the way we have this intuition,

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,200
there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,760
but underneath it all, there's atoms.

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
And there's an entire century of physics

111
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,920
that describes the functioning of those atoms

112
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,680
and the quarks that make them up.

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,760
There's many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields

114
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,200
and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up

115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
to something that's perceivable to us,

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,280
both with our eyes, with our different senses as this table.

117
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,640
Then there's also ideas of chemistry

118
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,480
that overlays of abstraction from DNA to embryos,

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,000
the cells that make the human body.

120
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,760
So all of that is not real.

121
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,400
It's a real experience and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.

122
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,200
So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.

123
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
We want to think that the perceptions are real.

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,640
So their perceptions are real as perceptions.

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
We are having our perceptions,

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship

127
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
between our perceptions and reality.

128
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,520
If I look up and see the moon,

129
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,040
then there is something that exists in space and time

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,880
that matches what I perceive.

131
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,400
And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution

132
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,520
by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.

133
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,760
That our perceptions are there.

134
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,040
They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

135
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,720
They're not there to show you the truth.

136
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,000
In fact, the way I think about it is they're there to hide the truth

137
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,400
because the truth is too complicated.

138
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,320
It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop to write an email.

139
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,160
What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
but good luck trying to do it that way.

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
The reason why we have a user interface

142
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,

143
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,520
the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
If you had to know all that truth,

145
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,960
your friends wouldn't hear from you.

146
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
So what evolution gave us was perceptions

147
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
that guide adaptive behavior.

148
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
And part of that process, it turns out,

149
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,840
means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.

150
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,080
So what's the difference between hiding the truth

151
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,480
and forming abstractions, layers upon layers of abstractions

152
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,720
over these over low level voltages and transistors and chips

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
and programming languages from assembly to Python

154
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
that then leads you to be able to have an interface like Chrome

155
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,240
where you open up another set of JavaScript and HTML programming

156
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,280
languages that lead you to have a graphical user interface

157
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,840
on which you can then send your friends an email.

158
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,760
So is that completely detached from the zeros and ones

159
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
that are firing away inside the computer?

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,920
It's not.

161
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
Of course, when I talk about the user interface on your desktop,

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,960
there's this whole sophisticated backstory to it,

163
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
right, that the hardware and the software

164
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,160
that's allowing that to happen.

165
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,120
Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?

166
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,960
to tell you what is that backstory.

168
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,960
It's going to say that whatever reality is,

169
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
and that's the interesting thing.

170
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,560
It says whatever reality is, you don't see it.

171
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
You see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you

172
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,720
what that user interface is, how it's built, right?

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,760
Now, we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface,

174
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
but already we're going to look at that and go,

175
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,840
okay, before I would look at neurons,

176
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,520
and I was assuming that I was seeing something

177
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,840
that was at least partially true.

178
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
And now I'm realizing it could be like looking

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,120
at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop,

180
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,480
and good luck going from that to the data structures

181
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
and then the voltages.

182
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,280
And I mean, good luck.

183
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,880
There's just no way.

184
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,600
So what's interesting about this is that our scientific theories

185
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,280
are precise enough and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,

186
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,640
but, and even limits of the theories themselves.

187
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
But they're not going to tell us what the next move is,

188
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
and that's where scientific creativity comes in.

189
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
is not alien to physicists.

191
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
The physicists are saying precisely the same thing,

192
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
that space time is doomed.

193
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
We've assumed that space time is fundamental.

194
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,240
We've assumed that for several centuries,

195
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,360
and it's been very useful.

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
So all the things that you were mentioning,

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
the particles and all the work that's been done,

198
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,080
that's all been done in space time,

199
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,360
but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.

200
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,040
There's no such thing as space time fundamentally

201
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,040
in the laws of physics.

202
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,800
And that comes actually out of gravity together

203
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,760
with quantum field theory.

204
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,960
It just comes right out of it.

205
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,880
It's a theorem of those two theories put together.

206
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,920
But it doesn't tell you what's behind it.

207
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
So the physicists know that their best theories,

208
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,840
Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together,

209
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,280
entail that space time cannot be fundamental,

210
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,760
and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.

211
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,400
They're just irreducible representations

212
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
of the symmetries of space time.

213
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
That's what they are.

214
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,440
So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
We put together what the physicists are discovering,

216
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,080
and we can talk about how they do that.

217
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
And then we, the new discoveries

218
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,280
from evolution of a natural selection,

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,680
both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.

220
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,080
And what both are saying is space time has had a good ride.

221
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,160
It's been very useful.

222
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,400
Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.

223
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,240
And it's time for us to go beyond.

224
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,200
When you say space time is doomed, is it the space?

225
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Is it the time?

226
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,200
Is it the very hard coded specification of four dimensions?

227
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,320
Or are you specifically referring to the kind of

228
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,240
perceptual domain that humans operate in,

229
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,200
which is space time?

230
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
You think like there's a 3D,

231
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
like our world is three-dimensional,

232
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,280
and time progresses forward.

233
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,000
Therefore, three dimensions plus one, 4D.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
What exactly do you mean by space time?

235
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,920
What do you mean by space time is doomed?

236
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,560
Great, great.

237
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
So this is, by the way, not my quote.

238
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,960
This is from, for example, Nima Arkany Ahmed

239
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

240
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,160
Ed Whitten also there.

241
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.

242
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,200
So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,

243
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,560
this is what the physicists are saying.

244
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,240
Yeah, the physicists, they're space time skeptics.

245
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
Yeah, they're saying that, and I can say exactly why

246
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,520
they think it's doomed, but what they're saying is that,

247
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,760
because your question was what aspect of space time,

248
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,880
what are we talking about here?

249
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
It's both space and time.

250
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
They're union into space time as in Einstein's theory.

251
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,320
That's doomed.

252
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,240
And they're basically saying that

253
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,120
even quantum theory, this is Nima Arkany Ahmed especially.

254
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,880
So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.

255
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
So that the notion of Hilbert space,

256
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
which is really critical to quantum field theory,

257
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,920
quantum information theory, that's not going to figure

258
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,200
in the fundamental new laws of physics.

259
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,440
So what they're looking for is some new mathematical structures

260
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,200
beyond space time, beyond Einstein's four-dimensional space time,

261
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,720
or super symmetric version, geometric algebra,

262
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
signature, two comma four kind of,

263
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,200
there are different ways that you can represent it,

264
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,440
but they're finding new structures.

265
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,200
And then by the way, they're succeeding now.

266
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,880
They're finding, they found something called the amplitude

267
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,520
to hydrant.

268
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,520
This is Nima and his colleagues, the cosmological polytope.

269
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,280
These are, so there are these like polytopes,

270
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,520
these polyhedra in multi-dimensions, generalizations of simplices

271
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,200
that are coding for, for example, the scattering amplitudes

272
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,800
of processes in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.

273
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,480
So they're finding that if they let go of space time completely,

274
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,720
they're finding new ways of computing these scattering amplitudes

275
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
that turn literally billions of terms into one term.

276
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,640
When you do it in space and time, because it's the wrong framework,

277
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
it's, it's, it's just a user interface from,

278
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,800
that's now from the evolutionary point of view,

279
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
it's just user interface.

280
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,560
It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.

281
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
So it's missing deep symmetry,

282
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
it's something called a dual conformal symmetry,

283
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
which turns out to be true of the scattering data,

284
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,640
but you can't see it in space time.

285
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,160
And it's making the computations way too complicated

286
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,120
because you're trying to compute all the loops and Feynman diagrams

287
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,240
and all the Feynman integrals.

288
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,880
So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes

289
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,400
is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,

290
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,840
locality and uniterity.

291
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
And so by, when you enforce those,

292
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,520
you get all these loops and multiple, you know,

293
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,480
different levels of loops.

294
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,440
And for each of those, you have to add new terms to your computation.

295
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,080
But when you do it outside of space time,

296
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,600
you don't have the notion of uniterity.

297
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
You don't have the notion of locality.

298
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,200
You have something deeper.

299
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,080
And it's capturing some symmetries that are actually true of the data.

300
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,640
And, but then when you look at the geometry of the facets of these polytopes,

301
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,720
then certain of them will code for uniterity and locality.

302
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
So it actually comes out of the structure of these deep polytopes.

303
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,400
So what we're finding is there's this whole new world,

304
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,920
now beyond space time, that is making explicit symmetries

305
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
that are true of the data that cannot be seen in space time.

306
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,920
And that is turning the computations from billions of terms

307
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,320
to one or two or a handful of terms.

308
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,200
So we're getting insights into symmetries.

309
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,280
And we're, and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple

310
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,720
because we're not doing something silly.

311
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
We're not adding up all these loops in space time.

312
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,640
We're doing something far deeper.

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,240
But they don't know what this world is about.

314
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,600
So, you know, they're in an interesting position

315
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,880
where we know that space time is doomed.

316
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,200
And I should probably tell you why it's doomed,

317
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,720
what they're saying about why it's doomed.

318
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,440
But, but they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.

319
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,560
What, what flashlight are we going to use to look into the dark

320
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,600
beyond space time?

321
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,800
Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory can't tell us.

322
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,920
What's beyond them.

323
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,240
All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,

324
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,000
space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
10 to the minus 43 seconds.

326
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,920
Beyond that, space time doesn't even make sense.

327
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,840
It just has no operational definition.

328
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond.

329
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
And so they're, they're just looking for deep structures.

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
Like guessing is really fun.

331
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,440
So these really brilliant guys, generic, brilliant men and women

332
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
who are doing this work, physicists,

333
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,240
are making guesses about these structures.

334
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
Informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,

335
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,800
well, okay, what deeper structure could give us the stuff

336
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
that we're seeing in space time,

337
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,720
but without certain commitments that we have to make

338
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
in space time, like locality unit.

339
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
So they make these brilliant guesses.

340
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
And of course, most of the time you're going to be wrong.

341
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,520
But once you get one or two, that start to pay off.

342
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
And then you get some lucky breaks.

343
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
So they got lucky break back in 1986.

344
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor

345
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,560
took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in

346
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,520
at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.

347
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
So that kind of scattering thing.

348
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,160
So it's like apparently for people who are into this,

349
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,920
that's sort of something that happens so often

350
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,240
you need to be able to find it and get rid of those

351
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
because you already know about that and need to.

352
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,120
So you needed to compute them.

353
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it.

354
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,920
Even for the supercomputers couldn't do that

355
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,400
for the many billions or millions of times per second

356
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,040
they needed to do it.

357
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,720
So they bagged, the experimentals bagged the theorists

358
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,560
and please can you, you got it.

359
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
So Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,

360
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,440
hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then a little bit later they guessed

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
one term expression that turned out to be equivalent.

363
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,120
So billions of terms reduced to one term

364
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,720
that's so-called famous Park-Taylor formula, 1986.

365
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
And that was like, okay, where did that come from?

366
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,560
What, this is a pointer into a deep realm

367
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,560
beyond space and time, but no one, I mean,

368
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,600
what can you do with it?

369
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,040
And they thought maybe it was a one-off,

370
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,760
but then other formulas started coming up

371
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,400
and then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamad and his team

372
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,160
found this thing called the amplituhedron

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
which really sort of captures the whole,

374
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
a big part of the whole ball of wax.

375
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.

376
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,320
So I won't say they did it all by any means.

377
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.

378
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,880
So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars of modern science,

379
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,160
quantum field theory with gravity on the one hand,

380
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,560
and evolution by natural selection on the other.

381
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
Just in the last 20 years have very clearly said

382
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
space-time has had a good run.

383
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,680
Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.

384
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,600
So we had a great ontology of space-time,

385
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
a great methodology of reductionism.

386
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,280
Now it's time for a new trick.

387
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
But now you need to go deeper.

388
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,760
And show, by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away everything we've done,

389
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,560
not by a long shot.

390
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
Every new idea that we come up with beyond space-time

391
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
must project precisely into space-time.

392
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
And it better give us back everything that we know and love in space-time

393
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,680
or generalizations.

394
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,800
Or it's not going to be taken seriously and it shouldn't be.

395
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,560
So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going to do

396
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,440
beyond space-time.

397
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,520
It needs to project into space-time.

398
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
And whatever this deeper theory is,

399
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,720
it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.

400
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
This may not be part of this deeper realm.

401
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space-time

402
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
and project it into space-time,

403
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,680
it has to look like evolution by natural selection.

404
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,320
Or it's wrong.

405
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,360
So that's a strong constraint on this work.

406
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,160
So even the evolution by natural selection and quantum field theory

407
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,640
could be interfaces into something that doesn't look anything like,

408
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,080
like you mentioned.

409
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,800
I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution might be

410
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,160
a very crappy interface into something much deeper.

411
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,880
That's right.

412
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,040
They're both telling us that the framework that you've had can only go so far.

413
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,000
And it has to stop.

414
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,440
And there's something beyond.

415
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,040
And that framework, the very framework that is space and time itself.

416
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Now, of course, evolution by natural selection is not telling us

417
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
about like Einstein's relativistic space time.

418
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.

419
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,600
It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,

420
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,040
which we have used as the basis for creating first a Newtonian space versus time

421
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,440
as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.

422
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,560
And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.

423
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,960
So the relationship between what evolution is telling us

424
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
and what the physicists are telling us is that,

425
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:09,440
in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time are formulated as sort of

426
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,400
rigorous extensions of our perceptual space,

427
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,040
making it mathematically rigorous and laying out the symmetries that they find there.

428
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,720
So that's sort of the relationship between them.

429
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,040
So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively.

430
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,640
And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical extension

431
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,880
of that into the Einsteinian formulation has to be,

432
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
as well, not the final story.

433
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,080
There's something deeper.

434
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,120
So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces.

435
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,040
As we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics,

436
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,280
these are all, in your view, interfaces.

437
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,640
Are we getting closer to objective reality?

438
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,000
How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science,

439
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,680
the reason we like those interfaces is because they're predictive of some aspects,

440
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,880
strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.

441
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,440
Is that completely deviating from our understanding of that reality?

442
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,920
Or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?

443
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,200
Well, of course, one critical constraint on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested

444
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,800
and pass the experiments that we have for them.

445
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,400
So no one's arguing against experiments being important

446
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,560
and wanting to test all of our current theories and any new theories on that.

447
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,520
So that's all there.

448
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,800
But we have good reason to believe that science will never get a theory of everything.

449
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Everything, everything.

450
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
Everything, everything, right, a final theory of everything, right?

451
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,600
I think that my, my own take is for what it's worth is that

452
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,040
girdles in completeness theorem sort of points us in that direction,

453
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,480
that even with mathematics, any finite axiomatization that's

454
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,400
sophisticated enough to be able to do arithmetic,

455
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,160
it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true,

456
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,800
that can't be proven, can't be deduced from within that framework.

457
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,840
And if you add the new statements to your axioms,

458
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,160
then there'll be always new statements that are true,

459
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,000
but can't be proven with a new axiom system.

460
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,560
And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,

461
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,960
and also now evolution, are mathematical.

462
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
So our theories are going to be, they're going to have their own assumptions,

463
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
and they'll be mathematically precise.

464
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,320
And there'll be theories perhaps of everything except those assumptions,

465
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
because assumptions are, we say,

466
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
please grant me these assumptions.

467
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,640
If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain this other stuff.

468
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,520
But so you have the assumptions that are like miracles,

469
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
as far as the theory is concerned, they're not explained,

470
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
they're the starting points for explanation.

471
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,240
And then you have the mathematical structure of the theory itself,

472
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,880
which will have the girdle limits.

473
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:16,400
And so my take is that reality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend

474
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,320
any conceptual theory that we can come up with.

475
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
There's always going to be mystery at the edges.

476
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,360
Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.

477
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,680
Okay.

478
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,080
And truths.

479
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,840
So there's this idea that is brought up in the financial space of settlement,

480
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,720
of transactions.

481
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,400
It's often talked about in cryptocurrency especially.

482
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,600
So you could do, money, cash is not connected to anything.

483
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,080
It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,

484
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,240
but then you can use money to exchange value to transact.

485
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,880
So when it was on the gold standard,

486
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,280
the money would represent some stable component of reality.

487
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation

488
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
if we generalize that idea?

489
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:21,520
Isn't it better to connect your, whatever we humans are doing in the social interaction

490
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,560
space with each other, isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective to connect it

491
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:33,600
to some degree to reality so that the transactions are settled with something that's universal,

492
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,360
as opposed to us constantly operating in something that's a complete illusion?

493
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?

494
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:50,800
Like where you really deviate very, very far away from the underlying reality?

495
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,720
Or do you not never get in trouble for this?

496
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,800
Can you just completely drift far, far away from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?

497
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,240
That's a great question.

498
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,800
On the financial side, there's two levels at least that we could take your question.

499
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,720
One is strictly evolutionary psychology of financial systems.

500
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,800
And that's pretty interesting.

501
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,360
And there, the decentralized idea, the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies may make

502
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,920
good sense from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.

503
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,600
Human nature being what it is, putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers

504
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:37,040
depends a lot on the veracity of those and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.

505
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,200
We have ample evidence time and again that's often betrayed.

506
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,040
So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say, to have a decentralized, I mean,

507
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,480
democracy is a step in that direction.

508
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,160
We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do.

509
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,760
We decentralize things, because if you have Marcus Aurelio says you're emperor,

510
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,480
you're great.

511
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,040
If you have Nero, it's not so great.

512
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,240
And so we don't want that.

513
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,160
So democracy is a step in that direction.

514
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,800
But I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step

515
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,120
and is going to even make the democratization even greater.

516
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
So that's one level.

517
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,720
Also, the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is also

518
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
a consequence of evolution.

519
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
That's also a feature, I think.

520
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,480
You can argue from the long span of living organisms, it's nice for power to corrupt.

521
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:41,840
So mad men and women throughout history might be useful to teach us a lesson.

522
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
We can learn from our negative example, right?

523
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,120
Exactly.

524
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,920
Right.

525
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,240
Power does corrupt, and I think that you can think about that again from an evolutionary

526
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,720
point of view.

527
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
But I think that your question was a little deeper.

528
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,200
When that was, does the evolutionary interface idea sort of unhinge science from

529
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,480
some kind of important test for the theories?

530
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,760
Does it mean that anything goes in scientific theory, but if we don't see the truth,

531
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,080
is there no way to tether our theories and test them?

532
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,080
And I think there's no problem there.

533
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,520
We can only test things in terms of what we can measure with our senses in space and time.

534
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,000
So we're going to have to continue to do experiments, but we're going to understand

535
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,240
a little bit differently what those experiments are.

536
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,600
We had thought that when we see a pointer on some machine in an experiment,

537
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,920
that the machine exists, the pointer exists, and the values exist even when no one

538
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,640
is looking at them, and that they're an objective truth.

539
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
And our best theories are telling us no.

540
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,840
Pointers are just pointers, and that's what you have to rely on for making your judgments.

541
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,840
But even the pointers themselves are not the objective reality.

542
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,840
So and I think Gertl is telling us that not that anything goes, but

543
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,800
as you develop new axiom systems, you will find out what goes within that axiom system

544
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,600
and what testable predictions you can make.

545
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,680
So I don't think we're untethered.

546
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,840
We continue to do experiments.

547
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,960
What I think we won't have that we want is a conceptual understanding

548
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,640
that gives us a theory of everything that's final and complete.

549
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,720
I think that this is, to put it another way, this is job security for scientists.

550
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,120
Our job will never be done.

551
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
It's job security for neuroscience.

552
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,640
Because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,

553
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,440
we saw neurons and neural networks and action potentials and synapses and so forth,

554
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,680
and that was the reality.

555
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
Now we have to reverse engineer that.

556
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
We have to say what is beyond space-time?

557
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,680
What is going on?

558
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,240
What is a dynamical system beyond space-time?

559
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,480
That when we project it into Einstein space-time,

560
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,920
gives us things that look like neurons and neural networks and synapses.

561
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,400
So we have to reverse engineer.

562
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,880
So there's going to be lots more work for neuroscience.

563
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,760
It's going to be far more complicated and difficult and challenging.

564
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,960
But that's wonderful.

565
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,920
That's what we need to do.

566
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,280
We thought neurons exist when they are perceived and they don't.

567
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,920
In the same way that if I show you, when I say they don't exist,

568
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,360
I should be very, very concrete.

569
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,400
If I draw on a piece of paper a little sketch of something that is called the necker cube,

570
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,640
it's just a little line drawing of a cube.

571
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,920
It's on a flat piece of paper.

572
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,320
If I execute it well and I show it to you, you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.

573
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,680
Sometimes you'll see one face in front.

574
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,120
Sometimes you'll see the other face in front.

575
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,960
But if I ask you, which face is in front when you don't look?

576
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,320
The answer is, well, neither face is in front because there's no cube.

577
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,560
This is a flat piece of paper.

578
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,520
So when you look at the piece of paper, you perceptually create the cube.

579
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,120
And when you look at it, then you fix one face to be in front and one face to be in front.

580
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,920
So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.

581
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,080
Space time itself is like the cube.

582
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,840
It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,

583
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,280
whatever your sensory systems mean now, because we now have to even take that for granted.

584
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,720
But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly.

585
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,920
And they're data structures and the computer science says,

586
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,600
and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.

587
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
So you create them and garbage collect them.

588
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:45,440
But is it possible that it's mapped well in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality?

589
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,560
The sheet of paper, the two-dimensional space, or we can talk about space time,

590
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,480
maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand, but we'll one day understand

591
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,520
what that mapping is.

592
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
But it maps reliably.

593
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,320
It is tethered in that way.

594
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,440
Well, yes.

595
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,600
And so the new theories that the physicists are finding beyond space time have that kind of

596
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,080
tethering.

597
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,760
So they show precisely how you start with an amplitude hydrant

598
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,600
and how you project this high-dimensional structure into the four dimensions of space time.

599
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,240
So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.

600
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,040
And they're doing the same thing with the cosmological polytopes.

601
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,800
So they're the ones that are making the most concrete and fun advances going beyond space time.

602
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
And they're tethering it.

603
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,960
They say this is precisely the mathematical projection from this deeper structure into space time.

604
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,800
One thing I'll say about, as a nonphysicist, what I find interesting is that they're finding just

605
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,320
geometry, but there's no notion of dynamics.

606
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,960
Right now, they're just finding these static geometric structures,

607
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,120
which is impressive.

608
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,240
So I'm not putting them down.

609
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,440
This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated and brilliant and adventurous.

610
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,160
It's all those things.

611
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,800
And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective because geometry is beautiful.

612
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
It's absolutely.

613
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,680
And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data that can't be seen in space time.

614
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,160
But I'm looking for a theory beyond space time that's a dynamical theory.

615
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,840
I would love to find, and we can talk about that at some point, a theory of consciousness in which

616
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,320
the dynamics of consciousness itself will give rise to the geometry that the physicists are

617
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,760
finding beyond space time.

618
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,520
If we can do that, then we'd have a completely different way of looking at how consciousness

619
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,160
is related to what we call the brain or the physical world more generally.

620
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,360
Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues, about 99% of them, are trying to...

621
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,600
They're assuming space time is fundamental.

622
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,880
They're assuming that particles are fundamental, quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.

623
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,000
Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental.

624
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,920
And that therefore neurons and brains are part of objective reality.

625
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,840
And that somehow when you get matter that's complicated enough,

626
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,760
it will somehow generate conscious experiences by its functional properties.

627
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,040
Or if you're panpsychist, maybe in addition to the physical properties of particles, you add

628
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,120
consciousness property as well.

629
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,080
And then you combine these physical and conscious properties to get more complicated ones.

630
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,480
But they're all doing it within space time.

631
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,680
All of the work that's being done on consciousness and its relationship

632
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,760
to the brain has all assumed something that our best theories are telling us is doomed,

633
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,720
space time.

634
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,240
Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?

635
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
So you bring up space time.

636
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,320
I mean, that's just one useful interface we've used for a long time.

637
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Surely there's other interfaces.

638
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,360
Is space time just one of the big ones that you...

639
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,520
To build up people's intuition about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?

640
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,240
Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw in the way we see the world?

641
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,600
Well, everything else that we think we know are things in space time.

642
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,160
Sure.

643
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:32,720
And so when you say space time is doomed, this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,

644
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.

645
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,760
Not to the scientific method, but to the fundamental ontology and also the fundamental

646
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,280
methodology, the ontology of space time and its contents, and the methodology of reductionism,

647
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,920
which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time, we will find more and more fundamental

648
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,240
laws.

649
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,720
And that's been very useful for space and time for centuries, reductionism for centuries.

650
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,640
But now we realize that that's over.

651
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Reductionism is in fact dead as a space time.

652
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
What exactly is reductionism?

653
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,600
What is the process of reductionism that is different than some of the physicists that

654
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,920
you mentioned that are trying to let go of the assumption of space time?

655
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,640
What can be on?

656
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,200
Isn't that still trying to come up with a simple model that explains this whole thing?

657
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,480
Isn't it still reducing?

658
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,040
It's a wonderful question because it really helps to clarify two different notions,

659
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,280
which is scientific explanation on the one hand and a particular kind of scientific explanation

660
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
on the other, which is the reductionist.

661
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,720
So the reductionist explanation is saying, I will start with things that are smaller

662
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,040
in space time and therefore more fundamental, where the laws are more fundamental.

663
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,800
So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.

664
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,160
Whereas in science, more generally, we just say like when Einstein did the special theory

665
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,440
of relativity, he's saying, let me have a couple postulates.

666
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:11,040
I will assume that the speed of light is universal for all observers in uniform motion

667
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:18,080
and that the laws of physics, for uniform motion, are that's not a reductionist.

668
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,920
Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.

669
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,280
I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.

670
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
It's not a reductionist thing.

671
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,800
You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.

672
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,560
You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.

673
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
Same thing with this theory of gravity.

674
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,600
It's the falling elevator idea, right?

675
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,440
So it's not a reductionist kind of thing.

676
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,680
It's something different.

677
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,320
So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.

678
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Reductionism has been a particularly useful kind of scientific explanation,

679
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,360
for example, in thermodynamics, where the notion that we have of heat,

680
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,760
some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat.

681
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,040
It turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered, well, hey, if we go to smaller

682
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,840
and smaller scales, we find these things called molecules or atoms.

683
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,640
If we think of them as bouncing around and having some kind of energy,

684
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,840
then what we call heat is really can be reduced to that.

685
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,960
So that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,

686
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,760
is a useful kind of scientific explanation that works within a range of scales

687
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
within space time.

688
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,320
But we know now precisely where that has to stop,

689
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,080
at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

690
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,360
And I would be impressed if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.

691
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,760
I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

692
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,160
I don't even know how to comprehend either of those numbers, frankly.

693
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,360
Just a small aside, because I am a computer science person,

694
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
I also find cellular automata beautiful.

695
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,280
So you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram, who recently has been very excitedly exploring

696
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,920
a proposal for a data structure that could be the numbers that would make you a little bit

697
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,440
happier in terms of scale, because they're very, very, very, very tiny.

698
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,920
So do you like this space of exploration of really thinking, letting go of space time,

699
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,080
letting go of everything and trying to think what kind of data structures could be

700
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,760
underneath this whole mess?

701
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,240
That's right.

702
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,680
So if they're thinking about these as outside of space time,

703
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
then that's what we have to do.

704
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,560
That's what our best theories are telling us.

705
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,480
You now have to think outside of space time.

706
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,240
Now, of course, I should back up and say, we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?

707
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,880
But that doesn't mean that there's not good work to do Newton.

708
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,080
There's all sorts of Newtonian physics that takes us to the moon and so forth,

709
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,840
and there's lots of good problems that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.

710
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
The same thing will be true of space time.

711
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,840
We'll still, it's not like we're going to stop using space time.

712
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,320
We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.

713
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:04,080
But for those scientists who are really looking to go deeper, to actually find the next,

714
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,360
just like what Einstein did to Newton, what are we going to do to Einstein?

715
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,880
How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory to something deeper?

716
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,120
Then we have to actually let go.

717
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,520
And if we're going to do like this automata kind of approach,

718
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,520
it's critical that it's not automata in space time, it's automata prior to space time,

719
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
from which we're going to show how space time emerges.

720
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
If you're doing automata within space time, well, that might be a fun model,

721
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,840
but it's not the radical new step that we need.

722
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,080
Yeah, so the space time emerges from that whatever system,

723
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,360
and like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.

724
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,360
Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means when we go beyond?

725
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,600
When you start to think about dynamics, that could mean a lot of things.

726
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,320
Even causality could mean a lot of things if we realize that everything's an interface.

727
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,280
Like what, how much do we really know is an interesting question?

728
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,360
Because you brought up neurons, I got to ask you on another, yet another tangent.

729
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,000
There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at called,

730
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,440
Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?

731
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,360
And I just enjoyed that thought experiment that they provided, which is,

732
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,360
they basically, it's a couple of neuroscientists, Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,

733
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,680
who use the tools of neuroscience to analyze a microprocessor.

734
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,520
I saw a computer chip.

735
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,320
If we lesion it here, what happens and so forth, and if you go and lesion in a computer,

736
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,040
it's very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers are not going to give you a lot

737
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,320
of insight into how it works.

738
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,000
And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of just using the basic approaches of

739
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,360
neuroscience collecting the data, trying to intuit about the underlying function of it.

740
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,440
And that helps you understand that our scientific exploration of concepts,

741
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:04,080
depending on the field, are maybe in the very, very early stages.

742
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,360
I wouldn't say it leaves us astray.

743
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,920
Perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not a, it's not anywhere close to some fundamental

744
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,320
mechanism that actually makes the thing work.

745
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,960
I don't know if you can sort of comment on that in terms of using neuroscience to understand

746
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,080
the human mind and neurons.

747
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,280
Are we really far away potentially from understanding in the way we understand

748
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,680
the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?

749
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,200
So one thing about understanding is you can understand for fun.

750
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,960
The other one is to understand so you could build things.

751
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
And that's when you really have to understand.

752
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,840
Exactly.

753
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,520
In fact, what got me into the field that I at MIT was work by David Maher on this very topic.

754
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,720
So David Maher was a professor at MIT, but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience, studying

755
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,200
just the architectures of the brain.

756
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,480
But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.

757
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,960
He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was, left him unsatisfied because he didn't

758
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,680
know what the cerebellum was for and why it had that architecture.

759
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:29,120
And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there and he said, he had this three-level

760
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,640
approach that really grabbed my attention.

761
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,720
So when I was an undergrad at UCLA, I read one of his papers in a class and said,

762
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,280
who is this guy?

763
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,440
Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.

764
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,720
What is being computed and why?

765
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,280
An algorithm.

766
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,320
How is it being computed?

767
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,880
What are the algorithms?

768
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,920
And then the hardware.

769
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
How does it get instantiated in the hardware?

770
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,640
And so to really do neuroscience, he argued, we needed to have understanding at all those levels.

771
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,320
And that really got me.

772
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,320
I loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was saying, if you can't build it,

773
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,000
you don't understand it effectively.

774
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,840
And so that's why I went to MIT.

775
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:07,520
And I had the pleasure of working with David until he died just a year and a half later.

776
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,920
So there's been that idea that with neuroscience, we have to have,

777
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,800
in some sense, a top-down model of what's being computed and why

778
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,920
that we would then go after.

779
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,800
And the same thing with the trying to reverse engineer a computing system like your laptop.

780
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,520
We really need to understand what the user interface is about and why we have

781
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,080
what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.

782
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,360
You need to know why to really understand all the circuitry and what it's for.

783
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:48,880
Now, evolution of a natural selection does not tell us the deeper question

784
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,120
that we're asking, the answer to the deeper question, which is why.

785
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,800
What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?

786
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,200
All it tells us is that whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

787
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,360
What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

788
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,000
So just to linger on this fascinating bold question that shakes you out of your dream state,

789
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:27,040
does this fiction still help you in building intuitions as literary fiction does about reality?

790
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:36,240
The reason we read literary fiction is it helps us build intuitions and an understanding

791
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,320
in indirect ways sneak up to the difficult questions of human nature.

792
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,280
Great fiction.

793
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,160
Same with this observed reality.

794
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,120
Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,

795
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,080
help us build intuition about deeper truths of how this whole mess works?

796
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,480
Well, I think that each theory that we propose will give its own answer to that question.

797
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,240
When the physicists are proposing these structures like the amplitude

798
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,040
hydrant and cosmological polytope, associated hydrant and so forth, beyond space time,

799
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,960
we can then ask your question for those specific structures and say,

800
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,840
how much information, for example, does evolution of a natural selection and the

801
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,880
kinds of sensory systems that we have right now give us about this deeper reality?

802
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,920
And why did we evolve this way?

803
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,960
We can try to answer that question from within the deeper.

804
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,880
So there's not going to be a general answer.

805
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,280
I think what we'll have to do is posit these new deeper theories

806
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,520
and then try to answer your question within the framework of those deeper theories,

807
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,480
knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.

808
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,200
So is this paralyzing though?

809
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,840
Because how do we know we're not completely adrift out to see

810
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,000
lost forever from, so like that our theories are completely lost?

811
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,680
So if it's all, if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,

812
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,680
if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,

813
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,440
isn't that paralyzing for a scientific mind?

814
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,200
Well, it's interesting that you say introspect to the bottom,

815
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,800
because there is that, there is one, again, this isn't the same spirit of what I said before,

816
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,640
which is it depends on what answer you give to what's beyond space time,

817
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,120
what answer we would give to your question, right?

818
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,880
So but one answer that is interesting to explore is something that spiritual traditions

819
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,600
have said for thousands of years, but haven't said precisely.

820
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,800
So we can't take it seriously in science until it's made precise,

821
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,240
but we might be able to make it precise.

822
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,640
And that is that they've also said something like space and time aren't fundamental,

823
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,000
they're Maya, they're illusion.

824
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,120
And but that if you look inside, if you introspect

825
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,600
and let go of all of your particular perceptions,

826
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,080
you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.

827
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:18,720
And that is, they claim, being in contact with the deep ground of being that transcends

828
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,480
any particular conceptual understanding.

829
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,280
If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,

830
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,520
but and I'm not saying it's not correct, I'm just saying if that's correct,

831
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,200
then it would be the case that as scientists, because we also are in touch with this ground of

832
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,360
being, we would then not be able to conceptually understand ourselves all the way.

833
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,160
But we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.

834
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,920
And so we would, there would be a sense in which there is a fundamental grounding to the whole

835
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,640
enterprise, because we're not separate from the enterprise.

836
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,280
This is the opposite of third, the impersonal third person science.

837
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,640
This would make science go personal all the way down.

838
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,600
And but but nevertheless, scientific, because the scientific method would still be

839
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,400
what we would use all the way down for the conceptual understanding.

840
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,720
Unfortunately, you still don't know if you went all the way down.

841
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,200
It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is, and we'll talk about it,

842
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,320
is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.

843
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,320
It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality, but you still don't know when you

844
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,720
get to the bottom, you know, a lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs, and they'll

845
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,600
say, well, that takes my mind to certain places where it feels like that is

846
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,960
revealing some deeper truth of reality.

847
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,800
But you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.

848
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,400
That's, that's in your view of this, you really don't know.

849
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,600
I mean, Gato's incompleteness is that you really don't know.

850
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,560
My own view on it, for what it's worth, because I don't know the right answer,

851
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,880
but my own view on it right now is that it, it's never ending.

852
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,040
I think that there will never, that this is great, as I said before, great job security for science,

853
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,680
and that we, if this is true, and if, if consciousness is somehow important or

854
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,440
fundamental in the universe, this may be an important fundamental fact about consciousness

855
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,480
itself, that, that it's never ending exploration that's going on in some sense.

856
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,760
Well, well, that's interesting, let me push back on the job security.

857
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,080
Okay.

858
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,800
So maybe as we understand this kind of idea deeper and deeper, we understand that the pursuit

859
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:48,320
is not a fruitful one, that maybe we need to, maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere,

860
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,120
is you get smarter and smarter and smarter.

861
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:58,240
You realize that like exploration is, there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.

862
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,520
You could be, you could be sort of living maximally in some way that's not exploration.

863
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,960
You know, I could, there's all kinds of video games you can construct and put yourself inside

864
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,400
of them that don't involve you going outside of the game world.

865
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,880
It's, you know, feeling for my human perspective, what seems to be fun is challenging yourself,

866
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
and overcoming those challenges.

867
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,000
So you can constantly artificially generate challenges for yourself,

868
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,640
like Sisyphus and his boulder, just, and that's it.

869
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,960
So the scientific method that's always reaching out to the stars, that's always trying to figure

870
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,360
out the puzzle on bottom puzzle, the trick, always trying to get to the bottom turtle.

871
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,880
Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition that that's infinite pursuit, we get,

872
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,760
we agree to start deviating from that pursuit, start enjoying the here and now versus the

873
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,480
looking out into the unknown always.

874
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:07,440
Maybe that's looking out into the unknown is a early activity for a species that's evolved.

875
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,400
I'm just sort of saying pushing back is you probably got a lot of scientists excited in terms

876
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,520
of job security.

877
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:20,320
I could envision where it's not job security or scientists become more and more useless.

878
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:29,600
Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom that allows us to study our own history,

879
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,160
but not much more than that.

880
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,400
Just to find pushback.

881
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,200
That's good pushback.

882
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,520
I'll put one in there for the scientists again, but sure.

883
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,440
But then I'll take the other side too.

884
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:49,200
So when Faraday did all of his experiments with magnets and electricity and so forth,

885
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,160
came with all this wonderful empirical data and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it and

886
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,080
wrote down a few equations, which we can now write down in a single equation,

887
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,880
the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra, just one equation.

888
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:09,360
That opened up unbelievable technologies where people are zooming and talking to each other

889
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,720
around the world, the whole electronics industry.

890
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,160
There was something that transformed our lives in a very positive way.

891
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,560
With the theories beyond space time, here's one potential.

892
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,040
Right now, most of the galaxies that we see, we can see them,

893
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,000
but we know that we could never get to them no matter how fast we traveled.

894
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,200
They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond, so we can't ever get to them.

895
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,640
There's all this beautiful real estate that's just smiling and waving at us,

896
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,680
and we can never get to it.

897
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,160
But that's if we go through space time.

898
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,600
But if we recognize that space time is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.

899
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,160
We're not little things inside space time.

900
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,440
Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.

901
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,360
It's just the other way around.

902
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,960
Once we understand that and we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time,

903
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,560
maybe we won't have to go through space time.

904
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,680
Maybe we can go around it.

905
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,160
Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri and not go through space.

906
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,640
I can just go right there directly.

907
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,520
It's a data structure.

908
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,800
We can start to play with it.

909
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,480
I think that for what it's worth, my take would be that the endless

910
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,000
sequence of theories that we could contemplate building will lead to an endless

911
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,360
sequence of new remarkable insights into the potentialities, the possibilities

912
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:47,520
that would seem miraculous to us, and that we will be motivated to continue the exploration

913
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,000
partly just for the technological innovations that come out.

914
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,680
But the other thing that you mentioned, though, what about just being?

915
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,240
What have we decided instead of all this doing and exploring what about being?

916
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:09,840
My guess is that the best scientists will do both and that the act of being

917
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,840
will be a place where they get many of their ideas and that they then pull into their conceptual

918
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,640
realm.

919
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,040
And I think many of the best scientists, Einstein comes to mind where these guys say,

920
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,880
look, I didn't come up with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.

921
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,920
I was thinking in vague images and it was just something non-conceptual.

922
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,720
And then it took me a long, long time to pull it out into concepts and then

923
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,560
longer to put it into math.

924
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,600
But the real insights didn't come from just slavishly playing with equations.

925
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
They came from a deeper place.

926
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,600
And so there may be this going back and forth between the complete non-conceptual

927
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,520
where there's essentially no end to the wisdom.

928
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,520
And then conceptual systems where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.

929
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,240
And that may be if consciousness is important and fundamental.

930
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,600
That may be what consciousness, at least part of what consciousness is about, is this

931
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,920
discovering itself, discovering its possibilities, so to speak.

932
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,800
And we can talk about what that might mean by going from the non-conceptual to the conceptual

933
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,520
back and forth to get better and better and better at being.

934
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:26,720
Right.

935
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,080
Let me ask you, just to link on the evolutionary, because you mentioned

936
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,560
evolutionary game theory and that's really where you, the perspective from which you come

937
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,920
to form the case against reality.

938
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,880
At which point in our evolutionary history do we start to deviate the most from reality?

939
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,960
Is it way before life even originated on earth?

940
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,800
Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?

941
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,520
Or is it when some inklings of what we think of as intelligence or maybe even

942
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,800
complex consciousness started to emerge?

943
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,720
So where did this deviation, just like with the interfaces in a computer,

944
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:27,040
you start with transistors and then you have assembly and then you have C, C++,

945
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,360
then you have Python, then you have GUIs, all that kind of, you have layers upon layers.

946
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,560
When did we start to deviate?

947
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:40,080
Well, David Maher, again, my advisor at MIT, in his book Vision, suggested that the more

948
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:46,560
primitive sensory systems were less realistic, less theoretical, but that by the time you got

949
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,240
to something as complicated as the humans, we were actually estimating the true

950
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,280
shapes and distances to objects and so forth.

951
00:58:53,840 --> 00:59:00,160
So his point of view, and I think it was probably, it's not an uncommon view among

952
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:07,280
my colleagues, that the sensory systems of lower creatures may just not be complicated

953
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,960
enough to give them much, much truth.

954
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,800
But as you get to 86 billion neurons, you can now compute the truth or at least

955
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,160
the parts of the truth that we need.

956
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,120
When I look at evolutionary game theory,

957
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,120
one of my graduate students, Justin Mark, did some simulations using genetic algorithms.

958
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:34,400
So there, he was just exploring, we start off with random organisms, random sensory genetics

959
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,600
and random actions and the first generation was unbelievably, there was a foraging situation,

960
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,080
they were foraging for resources and most of them, you know, stayed in one place,

961
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:51,840
didn't do anything important and, but we could then just look at how the genes evolved and what

962
00:59:51,840 --> 01:00:04,080
we found was, what he found was that basically you never even saw the truth organisms even come

963
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,560
on the stage.

964
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,720
If they came, they were gone in one generation, they just weren't.

965
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:16,240
So they came and went, even just in one generation, they just are not good enough.

966
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,160
The ones that were just tracking, their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs

967
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,400
were far more fit than the truth seekers.

968
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,760
So from, so an answer at one level, I want to give an answer to a deeper level,

969
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,160
but just with evolutionary game theory, because my attitude as a scientist is,

970
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,480
I don't believe any of our theories.

971
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,680
I take them very, very seriously, I study them, I look at their implications, but

972
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,640
none of them are the gospel, they're just the latest ideas that we have.

973
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:52,320
So the reason I study evolutionary game theory is because that's the best tool we have

974
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,240
right now in this area.

975
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,280
There is nothing else that competes.

976
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,360
So as a scientist is my responsibility to take the best tools and see what they mean.

977
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,840
And the same thing the physicists are doing, they're taking the best tools and looking at what

978
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,480
they entail.

979
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,720
But I don't, I think that science now has enough experience to realize that we should not

980
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,040
believe our theories in the sense that we've now arrived.

981
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,320
In 1890, it was a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.

982
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:28,240
They were discouraging bright young students from going into physics because it was all done.

983
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,720
And that's precisely the wrong attitude.

984
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,840
Forever is the wrong attitude forever.

985
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,400
The attitude we should have is a century from now, they'll be looking at us and laughing

986
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,600
at what we didn't know.

987
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,080
And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.

988
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,720
Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant right now, our final theory of

989
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,200
everything.

990
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,600
A century from now, they'll look at us like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,

991
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,280
how could they have been so dumb?

992
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,600
Yeah, so I don't want to make that mistake.

993
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,800
So I'm not Dr. Nair about any of our current scientific theories.

994
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,200
I am Dr. Nair about this.

995
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,320
We should use the best tools we have right now.

996
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,040
And with humility.

997
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,360
Well, so let me ask you about game theory.

998
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:20,240
There's, I love game theory, evolution game theory, but I'm always suspicious of it,

999
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,160
like economics.

1000
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:30,160
When you construct models, it's too easy to construct things that oversimplify

1001
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:38,800
just because we are human brains enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables

1002
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:45,280
that somehow represent organisms or represent people and running a simulation that then allows

1003
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,960
you to build up intuition.

1004
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,760
And then it feels really good because you can get some really deep and surprising intuitions.

1005
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,760
But how do you know your models aren't the assumptions underlying your models on some

1006
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,800
fundamentally flawed.

1007
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,880
And because of that, your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.

1008
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,920
So I guess my question is, what are the limits in your use of game theory,

1009
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,160
evolution game theory, your experience with it?

1010
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,760
What are the limits of game theory?

1011
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,640
So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues and friends who have tried to rerun

1012
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,400
simulations and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth is not comfortable.

1013
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,320
And so many of my colleagues are very interested in trying to show that we're wrong.

1014
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,480
And so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something, as you're suggesting,

1015
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,880
maybe something special that wasn't completely general.

1016
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,160
We've got some little special part of the whole search space and evolutionary game theory

1017
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,440
in which this happens to be true.

1018
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,560
But more generally, organisms would evolve to see the truth.

1019
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,360
So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.

1020
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:53,840
And they suggested that if you use thousands of payoff functions,

1021
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,600
our simulations would just use a couple, one or two,

1022
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,160
because it was our first simulations.

1023
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,120
So that would be a limit.

1024
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,680
We had one or two payoff functions we showed the result in those,

1025
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
at least for the genetic algorithms.

1026
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,400
And they said, if you have 20,000 of them, then we can find these conditions in which

1027
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,400
truth-seeing organisms would be the ones that evolved and survived.

1028
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:25,120
And so we looked at their simulations, and it certainly is the case that you can find

1029
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,520
special cases in which truth can evolve.

1030
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,400
So when I say it's probability zero, it doesn't mean it can't happen.

1031
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,120
It can happen.

1032
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,880
In fact, it could happen infinitely often.

1033
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,320
It's just probability zero.

1034
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,600
So if probability zero things can happen infinitely often.

1035
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,040
When you say probability zero, you mean probability close to zero.

1036
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,960
To be very precise.

1037
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,560
So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane,

1038
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:56,080
and I use a probability measure in which the area of a region is this probability,

1039
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,520
then if I draw a curve in that unit square,

1040
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:07,840
it has measure precisely zero, precisely, not approximately, precisely zero.

1041
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,280
And yet it has infinitely many points.

1042
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,360
So there's an object that for that probability measure has probability zero,

1043
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,240
and yet there's infinitely many points in it.

1044
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,840
So that's what I mean when I say that the things that are probability zero

1045
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
can happen infinitely often in principle.

1046
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,280
Yeah, but infinity, as far as I, and I look outside often at walk around

1047
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,280
and I look at people, I haven't never seen infinity in real life.

1048
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,920
That's an interesting issue.

1049
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,720
I've been looking.

1050
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,440
I've been looking.

1051
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,120
I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.

1052
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,600
And so the tools of mathematics, you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism

1053
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,120
that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.

1054
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,400
That's a big debate in mathematics.

1055
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,960
The intuitionist versus the ones who take, for example, the real numbers as real.

1056
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,960
And that's a fun discussion.

1057
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,800
Nicholas Giesen has a physicist who has a really interesting work recently

1058
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,760
on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,

1059
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:13,440
you could effectively quantize Newton, and you find that Newtonian theory and quantum theory

1060
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,320
aren't that different once you go with it.

1061
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:16,880
It's funny.

1062
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,000
It's really quite interesting.

1063
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,640
So the issue you raise is a very, very deep one, and one that I think we should take quite

1064
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:30,400
seriously, which is how shall we think about the reality of the contrast hierarchy,

1065
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:41,760
a1, a2, and all these different infinities versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?

1066
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,200
So everything's computable in some sense.

1067
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,520
Everything's finite as big as you want, but nevertheless finite.

1068
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:57,520
So yeah, ultimately boils down to whether the world is discrete or continuous in some

1069
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,400
general sense.

1070
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,320
And again, we can't really know, but there's just a mind-breaking thought, just common sense

1071
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:12,560
reasoning, that something can happen and is yet probability of it happening is 0%.

1072
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,160
That doesn't compute for common sense computer.

1073
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,800
Right.

1074
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,520
This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician to really, and I'm not.

1075
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,880
Sharp is one word.

1076
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:31,440
What I'm saying is common sense computer is, I mean that in a very kind of,

1077
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:38,000
in a positive sense, because we've been talking about perception systems and interfaces,

1078
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:44,960
if we are to reason about the world, we have to use the best interfaces we got.

1079
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:52,480
And I'm not exactly sure that game theory is the best interface we got for this.

1080
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:59,280
And applications of mathematics, tricks and tools of mathematics to game theory is the

1081
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,360
best we got when we're thinking about the nature of reality and fitness functions and

1082
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,560
evolution, period.

1083
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,000
Well, that's a fair rejoinder.

1084
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And I think that that was the tool that we used.

1085
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,840
And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool, and here's why.

1086
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,400
This is this mathematical tool better captures the essence of Darwin's idea.

1087
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,160
John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it with evolutionary game theory.

1088
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,440
There's this better, this thing.

1089
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,240
Now, there are tools like evolutionary graph theory, which generalize evolutionary game

1090
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:32,880
theory.

1091
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,520
And then there's quantum game theory.

1092
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:43,760
So you can use quantum tools like entanglement, for example, as a resource in games,

1093
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:50,640
that change the very nature of the solutions, the optimal solutions of the game theory.

1094
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,320
Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.

1095
01:08:54,320 --> 01:09:00,640
It's a really interesting challenge of these ideas where, okay, if you have a very large

1096
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:07,440
number of fitness functions, or let's say you have a nearly infinite number of fitness functions,

1097
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:13,680
or a growing number of fitness functions, what kind of interesting things start to emerging?

1098
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:19,760
If you are to be an organism, if to be an organism that adapts means having to deal with

1099
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,080
an ensemble of fitness functions.

1100
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,920
Right.

1101
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,960
And so we've actually redone some of our own work based on theirs.

1102
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,240
And this is the back and forth that we expect in science, right?

1103
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,520
And what we found was that in their simulations, they were assuming that you

1104
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,760
couldn't carve the world up into objects.

1105
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,920
And so we said, well, let's relax that assumption.

1106
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,960
Allow organisms to create data structures that we might call objects.

1107
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,520
And an object would be you take, you would do hierarchical clustering

1108
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,720
of your fitness payoff functions, the ones that have similar shapes.

1109
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:59,440
If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50 are all very, very similar.

1110
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,600
So I can take all the perception action fitness stuff and make that into a data structure,

1111
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,600
and we'll call that a unit or an object.

1112
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,440
And as soon as we did that, then all of their results went away.

1113
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,640
It turned out they were the special case and that the organisms that were allowed

1114
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,240
to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs were the ones that were.

1115
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,120
So the idea is that objects then, what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?

1116
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,360
This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle, it was because I was seeing a true

1117
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,200
object that existed whether or not it was perceived.

1118
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,920
Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.

1119
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:44,960
I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding a convenient way of looking at various fitness

1120
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:50,640
payoffs. I can use this for drinking. I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.

1121
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,080
I could beat someone with head with it. If my goal is mating, this is pointless.

1122
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:04,080
So I'm seeing for what I'm coding here is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.

1123
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,560
When I pick up an apple, now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs for.

1124
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,520
When I pick up a rock, I'm getting, so for every object, what I'm getting is a different set

1125
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:23,440
of payoff functions with various actions. And so once you allow that, then what you find is once

1126
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,720
again that truth goes extinct and the organisms that just get an interface are the ones that that

1127
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:36,800
win. But the question I'm just sneaking up on, this is fascinating, from where do fitness functions

1128
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:43,440
originate? What gives birth to the fitness functions? So if there's a giant black box that

1129
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,960
just keeps giving you fitness functions, what are we trying to optimize? You said that water

1130
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:58,560
has different uses than an apple. So there's these objects. What are we trying to optimize?

1131
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,520
And why is not reality a really good generator of fitness functions?

1132
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,760
So each theory makes its own assumptions and says, grant me this and I'll explain that. So

1133
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,320
evolutionary game theory says grant me fitness payoffs, right? And grant me strategies with payoffs

1134
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,960
and I can write down the matrix for this strategy interacts with that strategy. These are the payoffs

1135
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,960
that come up. If you grant me that, then I can start to explain a lot of things. Now you can ask

1136
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:33,440
for a deeper question like, okay, how does physics evolve biology and where do these fitness payoffs

1137
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:42,240
come from? Now that's a completely different enterprise and of course evolutionary game

1138
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,560
theory then would be not the right tool for that. It would have to be a deeper tool that

1139
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:54,800
shows where evolutionary game theory comes from. My own take is that there's going to be a

1140
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:04,640
problem in doing that because space time isn't fundamental. It's just a user interface and

1141
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,840
that the distinction that we make between living and non-living is not a fundamental distinction.

1142
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,120
It's an artifact of the limits of our interface. So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important

1143
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:23,600
wrinkle. It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental because if something looks like it's

1144
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:30,080
inanimate, it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living. Now it's much more complicated.

1145
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:36,480
Certain things are obviously living. I'm talking with you. I'm obviously interacting with something

1146
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,920
that's alive and conscious. I think we've let go of the word obviously in this conversation.

1147
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,720
I think nothing is obvious. Nothing's obvious, that's right. But when we get down to like

1148
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:54,400
an ant, it's obviously living but I'll say it appears to be living. When we get down to a virus,

1149
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:00,160
now people wonder and when we get down to protons, people say it's not living and my attitude is,

1150
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:05,680
look, I have a user interface. The interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality

1151
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:13,040
and others to... It's an uneven representation, put it that way. Certain things just get

1152
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:19,760
completely hidden. Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy and matter that's out there.

1153
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,520
Our interface just flat out hides them. The only way we get some hint is because

1154
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,920
gravitational things are going wrong within our... So most things are outside of our interface.

1155
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,640
The distinction between living and non-living is not fundamental. It's an artifact of our

1156
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:45,360
interface. So if we really want to understand where evolution comes from to answer the question,

1157
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,040
the deep question you asked, I think the right way we're going to have to do that is to come up

1158
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:57,680
with a deeper theory than spacetime in which there may not be the notion of time and show that

1159
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,360
whatever this dynamics of that deeper theory is. By the way, I'll talk about how you could have

1160
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,320
dynamics without time, but the dynamics of this deeper theory, when we project it into,

1161
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,160
in certain ways, then we do get spacetime and we get what appears to be evolution by natural

1162
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:18,720
selection. So I would love to see evolution by natural selection. Nature, red and tooth and

1163
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,880
claw, people fighting and animals fighting for resources and the whole bit, come out of a deeper

1164
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,840
theory in which perhaps it's all cooperation. There's no limited resources and so forth,

1165
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,840
but as a result of projection, you get space and time, and as a result of projection, you get

1166
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,040
nature, red and tooth and claw, the appearance of it, but it's all an artifact of the interface.

1167
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:44,720
I like this idea that the line between living and non-living is very important

1168
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:52,080
because that's the thing that would emerge before you have evolution, the idea of death.

1169
01:15:52,080 --> 01:16:00,960
So that seems to be an important component of natural selection, and if that emerged,

1170
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:07,040
because that's also asking the question, I guess, that I ask, where do fitness

1171
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:13,920
functions come from? That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right? It's what's the

1172
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:22,560
why, why, why? And one of the big underlying whys, okay, you can start with evolution on earth,

1173
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,000
but without living, without life and death, without the line between the living and the dead,

1174
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,440
you don't have evolution. So what if underneath it, there's no such thing as the living and the dead?

1175
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:42,000
There's no, like this concept of an organism period. There's a living organism that's defined

1176
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:51,840
by a volume and space time that somehow interacts, that over time maintains its integrity somehow,

1177
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:58,320
it has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind, the outside world, the environment,

1178
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:04,160
and then inside there's an organism. So you're defining an organism, and also you're defining

1179
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:11,280
that organism by the fact that it can move, and it can become alive, which you kind of think of as

1180
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:16,320
moving, combined with the fact that it's keeping itself separate from the environment. So you can

1181
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:22,720
point out that thing is living, and then it can also die. That seems to be of all very

1182
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:30,000
powerful components of space time that enable you to have something like natural selection and

1183
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,600
evolution. Well, and there's a lot of interesting work, some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston

1184
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:42,960
and others where they have Bayes net kind of stuff that they build on and the notion of a

1185
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,560
Markov blanket. So you have some states within this network that are inside the blanket, then you

1186
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,880
have the blanket, and then the states outside the blanket, and the states inside this Markov blanket

1187
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,800
are conditionally independent of the states outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.

1188
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:04,400
And what they're looking at is that the dynamics inside of the states inside the Markov blanket

1189
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:09,360
seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside and react to them in a way. So it seems

1190
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:14,240
like you're doing probabilistic inferences in ways that might be able to keep you alive. So

1191
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:20,800
there's interesting work going on in that direction. But what I'm saying is something

1192
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,480
slightly different. And that is, like when I look at you, all I see is skin heronize, right? That's

1193
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:32,240
all I see. But I know that there's a deeper reality. I believe that there's a much deeper

1194
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,840
reality. There's the whole world of your experiences, your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.

1195
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,720
In some sense, the face that I see is just a symbol that I create, right? And as soon as I

1196
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:48,480
look away, I delete that symbol. But I don't delete you. I don't delete the conscious experience,

1197
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:54,880
the whole world of your... So I'm only deleting an interface symbol. But that interface symbol

1198
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:05,520
is a portal, so to speak. Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal into your beliefs, into your

1199
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,800
conscious experiences, into... That's why we can have a conversation. Your consciousness is

1200
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,800
genuinely affecting mine. Mine is genuinely affecting yours. Through these icons, which I

1201
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,120
create on the fly. I mean, I create your face when I look, I delete it. I don't create you,

1202
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:28,000
your consciousness, that's there all the time. But I do... So now when I look at a cat, I'm creating

1203
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,320
something that I still call living, and I still think is conscious. When I look at an ant, I create

1204
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,920
something that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious. When I look at something I call a

1205
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,200
virus, now I'm not even sure I would call it living. And when I look at a proton, I would say,

1206
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:52,000
I don't even think it's not alive at all. It could be that I'm nevertheless

1207
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,640
interacting with something that's just as conscious as you. I'm not saying the proton is

1208
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,360
conscious. The face that I'm creating when I look at you, that face is not conscious. That face

1209
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,280
is a data structure in me. That face isn't... It's an experience. It's not an experiencer.

1210
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:14,960
Similarly, a proton is something that I create when I look or do a collision

1211
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:21,360
in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that. But what is behind the entity and space time?

1212
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,520
So I've got this space-time interface, and I just got this entity that I call a proton.

1213
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,720
What is the reality behind it? Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures,

1214
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,880
ample two Hadron, the associate Hadron. What's behind those? Could be consciousness,

1215
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,640
what I'm playing with. In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,

1216
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,680
I could be interacting with consciousness. Again, to be very, very clear, because it's

1217
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:50,320
easy to... Listen, I'm not saying a proton is conscious. Just like I'm not saying your face

1218
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:56,880
is conscious. Your face is a symbol I create and then delete as I look. And so your face is not

1219
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,760
conscious, but I know that that face in my interface, the Lex Friedman face that I create,

1220
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,800
is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal into your consciousness. The portal is less clear

1221
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,320
for a cat, even less clear for an ant. And by the time we get down to a proton, the portal is not

1222
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,240
clear at all. But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness. It just means

1223
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:24,960
my interface gave up. And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after. So your question

1224
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,400
really forces out a big part of this whole approach that I'm talking about.

1225
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:35,600
So this portal and consciousness, I wonder why you can't... Your portal is not as good to a cat,

1226
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:41,360
to a cat's consciousness than it is to a human. Does it have to be...

1227
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:48,320
It has to do with the fact that you're human and just similar organisms, organisms of similar

1228
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,160
complexity, are able to create portals better to each other? Or is it just...

1229
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,800
As you get more and more complex, you get better and better portals?

1230
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,800
Well, let me answer one aspect that I'm more confident about. Then I'll speculate on that.

1231
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:10,000
Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons and elementary particles more generally? So quarks,

1232
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,440
leptons, and gluons, and so forth? Well, the reason for that is because those are just

1233
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:21,120
symmetries of spacetime. More technically, they're irreducible representations of the

1234
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:31,440
Poincaré group of spacetime. So they're just literally representations of the data structure

1235
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:37,200
of spacetime that we're using. So that's why they're not very much insightful. They're just almost

1236
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,400
entirely tied to the data structure itself. There's not much... They're telling you only

1237
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,920
something about the data structure, not behind the data structure. It's only when we get to higher

1238
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,520
levels that we're starting to, in some sense, build portals to what's behind spacetime.

1239
01:22:52,240 --> 01:23:01,280
Sure. Yeah. So there's more and more complexity built on top of the interface of spacetime with the

1240
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:11,280
cat. So you can actually build a portal, right? Yeah, right. Yeah, this interface of face and hair

1241
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:22,560
and so on, skin. There's some sinking going on between humans, though, where we sink. You're

1242
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:31,120
getting a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head and starting to get a foggy view of my

1243
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:37,840
memories in my head. Even though this is the first time we're talking, you start to project your own

1244
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:45,840
memories. You start to solve a giant hierarchy of puzzles about a human, because we're all... There's

1245
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,160
a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes. So you start to make a lot of inferences and you build

1246
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:56,080
up this model of a person. You have a pretty sophisticated model of what's going on underneath.

1247
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,960
Again, I just... I wonder if it's possible to construct these models about each other and

1248
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:10,080
nevertheless be very distant from an underlying reality. There's a lot of work on this. So there's

1249
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:15,520
some interesting work called Signaling Games, where they look at how people can coordinate and

1250
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,480
come to communicate. There's some interesting work that was done by some colleagues and friends of

1251
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:30,000
mine, Louis Naranze and Natalia Komarova and Kimberly Jamison, where they were looking at

1252
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:40,000
evolving color words. So you have a circle of colors, the color circle, and they wanted to see

1253
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,640
if they could get people to cooperate and how they carved the color circle up into units of words.

1254
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,680
So they had a game, theoretic kind of thing that they'd had people do. What they found was that

1255
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:58,720
so most people are trichromats. You have three kinds of cone photoreceptors, but there are some

1256
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:03,600
a lot of men, 7% of men have our dichromats. They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.

1257
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:11,680
They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence on the final ways that the whole

1258
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:17,840
space of colors was carved up and labels attached. You needed to be able to include the dichromats

1259
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,760
in the conversation. So they had a bigger influence on how you made the boundaries

1260
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,400
of the language. I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight that there's going

1261
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:32,560
to be, again, a game, perhaps a game or evolutionary or genetic algorithm kind of thing that goes on

1262
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:40,320
in terms of learning to communicate in ways that are useful. So yeah, you can use game theory to

1263
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,360
actually explore that or signaling games. There's a lot of brilliant work on that. I'm not doing it,

1264
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:52,080
but there's work out there. So if it's okay, let us tackle once more and perhaps several more

1265
01:25:52,080 --> 01:26:00,240
times after the big topic of consciousness. This very beautiful, powerful things that perhaps is

1266
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:06,880
the thing that makes us human. What is it? What's the role of consciousness in, let's say even just

1267
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,920
the thing we've been talking about, which is the formation of this interface,

1268
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,400
any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking about it?

1269
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:25,680
Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say. 99% are, again, assuming that

1270
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:32,320
spacetime is fundamental. Particles in spacetime matter is fundamental. And most are reductionist.

1271
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:42,960
And so the standard approach to consciousness is to figure out what complicated systems of matter

1272
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,480
with the right functional properties could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.

1273
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:56,880
That's the general idea. So maybe you have to have neurons. Maybe only if you have neurons,

1274
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,040
but that might not be enough. They have certain kinds of complexity in their

1275
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,640
organization and their dynamics, certain kind of network abilities, for example.

1276
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:14,560
So there are those who say, for example, that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse

1277
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:22,400
of quantum states of microtubules and neurons. So this is Hamroff and Kenrose have this kind of.

1278
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:28,240
So you start with something physical, a property of quantum states of neurons,

1279
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:35,040
of microtubules and neurons. And you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those

1280
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,560
is consciousness or conscious experiences. Or integrated information theory. Again,

1281
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,720
you start with something physical. And if it has the right kind of functional properties,

1282
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,000
it's something they call fee, with the right kind of integrated information,

1283
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:54,800
then you have consciousness. Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,

1284
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,560
where you might say, well, in addition to the particles in space and time,

1285
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,280
those particles are not just matter, they also could have a unit of consciousness.

1286
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,480
And so, but once again, you're taking space and time and particles as fundamental.

1287
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:16,160
And you're adding a new property to them, say consciousness. And then you have to talk about

1288
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,760
how when a proton and a neutron or proton and electron get together to form hydrogen,

1289
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:28,400
then how those consciousnesses merge to or interact to create the consciousness of hydrogen,

1290
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:33,520
so forth. There's attention schema theory, which again, this is how neural network

1291
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,880
processes representing to the network itself, it's attentional processes, that could be

1292
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:47,600
consciousness. There's global workspace theory. And neuronal global workspace theory.

1293
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,840
Workspace theory. So there's many, many theories of this type. What's common to all of them

1294
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:58,160
is they assume that space time is fundamental. They assume that physical processes in space

1295
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,480
time is fundamental. Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,

1296
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:10,320
it's almost dualist in that regard. And my attitude is, our best science is telling us

1297
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:18,320
that space time is not fundamental. So why is that important here? Well, for centuries,

1298
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:26,080
deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water as the fundamental elements.

1299
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,800
It was a reductionist kind of idea. Nothing was more elemental than those. And you could

1300
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,840
sort of build everything up from those. When we got the periodic table of elements,

1301
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:43,040
we realized that, of course, we want to study earth, air, fire, and water. There's combustion

1302
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:50,960
science for fire. There's sciences for all these other things, water and so forth. So we're going

1303
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:56,080
to do science for these things, but fundamental, no, no. If you're looking for something fundamental,

1304
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,360
those are the wrong building blocks. Earth has many, many different kinds of elements

1305
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,080
that project into the one thing that we call earth. If you don't understand that there's

1306
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,520
silicon, that there's iron, that there's all these different kinds of things that project

1307
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:16,240
into what we call earth, you're hopelessly lost. You're not fundamental. You're not going to get

1308
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:22,160
there. And then after the periodic table, then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,

1309
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:29,760
the particles of the standard model of physics. And so we actually now know that if you really

1310
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,920
want to get fundamental, the periodic table isn't it. It's good for chemistry and it's just

1311
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,720
wonderful for chemistry. But if you're trying to go deep, fundamental, what is the fundamental

1312
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:46,000
science? That's not it. You're going to have to go to quarks, leptons, and gluons, and so forth.

1313
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:53,360
Well, now we've discovered spacetime itself is doomed. Quarks, leptons, and gluons are just

1314
01:30:53,360 --> 01:31:00,640
irreducible representations of the symmetries of spacetime. So the whole framework on which

1315
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,840
consciousness research is being based right now is doomed. And for me, these are my friends and

1316
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:14,800
colleagues that are doing this, they're brilliant. They're absolute, they're brilliant. I, my feeling

1317
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:23,920
is, I'm so sad that they're stuck with this old framework, because if they weren't stuck,

1318
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,920
like with earth, air, fire, and water, you could actually make progress. So it doesn't matter how

1319
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,920
smart you are. If you start with earth, air, fire, and water, you're not going to get anywhere, right?

1320
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:37,440
Can I actually just, because the word doomed is so interesting. Let me give you some options,

1321
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:46,160
multiple choice quiz. It's spacetime, we could say is reality, the way we perceive it, doomed,

1322
01:31:49,840 --> 01:32:01,520
wrong, or fake. Because doomed just means it could still be right, and we're now ready to go deeper.

1323
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,280
It would be that.

1324
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,920
So it's not wrong. It's not a complete deviation from a journey toward the truth.

1325
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,600
Right. It's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong. There is earth, air, fire, and water.

1326
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,920
That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.

1327
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:24,320
Right. Well, there's also wrong, which is, they used to believe, as I recently learned,

1328
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,640
that George Washington was the president, the first president in the United States,

1329
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:33,040
was blood to death for something that could have been easily treated,

1330
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,000
because it was believed that you can get, actually, I need to look into this further,

1331
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,160
but I guess you get toxins out or demons out. I don't know what you're getting out with the

1332
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:50,080
bleeding of a person, but so that ended up being wrong, but widely believed as a medical tool.

1333
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:58,080
So it's also possible that our assumption of spacetime is not just doomed, but it's wrong.

1334
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:04,320
Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong. But if we believe it's a useful tool,

1335
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:09,840
that's right. But bleeding somebody to death was believed to be a useful tool.

1336
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:18,400
It wasn't just not fundamental. I'm sure there's cases in which bleeding somebody

1337
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:25,280
would work, but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases. So it could be that it's

1338
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:31,600
wrong, like it's a side road that's ultimately leading to a dead end, as opposed to a truck

1339
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,280
stop or something that you can get off of. My feeling is it's not the dead end kind of thing.

1340
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,040
I think that what the physicists are finding is that there are these structures beyond

1341
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:47,120
spacetime, but they project back into spacetime. And so spacetime, when they say

1342
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,640
spacetime is doomed, they're explicit. They're saying it's doomed in the sense that

1343
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,400
we thought it was fundamental. It's not fundamental. It's a useful,

1344
01:33:54,400 --> 01:34:00,400
absolutely useful and brilliant data structure, but there are deeper data structures like cosmological

1345
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:06,720
polytool. And spacetime is not fundamental. What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong

1346
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,880
is reductionism. Which is saying spacetime is fundamental.

1347
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,560
Essentially. Right, right. The idea that somehow

1348
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:26,800
being smaller in spacetime is a fundamental nature of reality, that's just wrong. It turned out to

1349
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,200
be a useful heuristic for thermodynamics and so forth, and several other places,

1350
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:37,760
reductionism has been very useful. But that's in some sense an artifact of how we use our interface.

1351
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:43,680
Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter. Okay, this is very important for me to write

1352
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:50,960
down ultimately. It's useful for theories like thermodynamics and also for understanding brain

1353
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:58,400
networks in terms of individual neurons and neurons in terms of chemical systems inside cells.

1354
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:03,840
That's all very, very useful. But the idea that we're getting to the more fundamental nature of

1355
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,120
reality, no. When you get all the way down in that direction, you get down to the quarks and

1356
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,760
gluons. What you realize is what you've gotten down to is not fundamental reality, just the

1357
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:18,720
irreducible representations of a data structure. That's all you've gotten down to. So you're always

1358
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:24,400
stuck inside the data structure. So you seem to be getting closer and closer. I went from neural

1359
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,560
networks to neurons, to neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles, particles to clerks and

1360
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:35,760
gluons. No, I'm getting closer and closer to the actual structure of the data structure of

1361
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,760
space and time, the irreducible representations. That's what you're getting closer to,

1362
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,040
not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space-time.

1363
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:49,040
We'll also refer, we'll return again to this question of dynamics, because you keep

1364
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,800
saying that space-time is doomed, but mostly focusing on the space part of that. It's very

1365
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:01,040
interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too, because how do you have dynamics without time is

1366
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:08,720
the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about. But let us return your brilliant whirlwind

1367
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:12,160
overview of the different theories of consciousness that are out there.

1368
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:20,240
What is consciousness if outside of space-time? If we think that we want to have a model of

1369
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:26,000
consciousness, we as scientists then have to say, what do we want to write down? What kind of

1370
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
mathematical model are we going to write down? And if you think about it, there's lots of things

1371
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,840
that you might want to write down about consciousness. It's a really complicated subject.

1372
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,560
So most of my colleagues are saying, let's start with matter or neurons and

1373
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,440
say what properties of matter could create consciousness. But I'm saying that that whole

1374
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:49,200
thing is out. Space-time is doomed, that whole thing is out. We need to look at consciousness,

1375
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:54,320
qua consciousness. In other words, not as something that arises in space and time,

1376
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,880
but perhaps as something that creates space and time as a data structure.

1377
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,880
So what do we want? And here again, there's no hard and fast rule, but what you as a

1378
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:10,240
scientist have to do is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions that are going to

1379
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:18,560
allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory. That is the trick. So what do I want? So what I

1380
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:24,880
chose to do was to have three things. I said that there are conscious experiences,

1381
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:33,920
feeling of headache, the smell of garlic, experiencing the color red. So that's a

1382
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,000
primitive of theory. And the reason I want few primitives, because those are the miracles of

1383
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,440
the theory, right? The primitives, the assumptions of the theory are the things you're not going

1384
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,080
to explain. Those are the things you assume. And those experiences you particularly mean

1385
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:52,480
there is a subjectiveness to them. That's the thing when people refer to the hard problem

1386
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:58,080
of consciousness is it feels like something to look at the color red. Okay.

1387
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,800
Exactly. It feels like something to have a headache or to feel upset to your stomach.

1388
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:10,560
It feels like something. And so I'm going to grant that in this theory, there are experiences

1389
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,040
and they're fundamental in some sense. So conscious experience. So they're not derived

1390
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:21,600
from physics. They're not functional properties of particles. They are sui generis. They exist.

1391
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,240
Just like we assume space time exists. I'm now saying space time is just a data structure. It

1392
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:31,520
doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences. Sorry to interrupt once again, but should we be

1393
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:41,280
focusing in your thinking on humans alone? Or is there something about in relation to other kinds

1394
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:47,760
of organisms that have a sufficiently high level of complexity? Or is there some kind of

1395
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:54,720
generalization of the panpsychist idea that all consciousness permeates all matter

1396
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:01,120
outside of the usual definition of what matter is inside space time?

1397
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:07,120
So it's beyond human consciousness. Human consciousness, from my point of view, would be

1398
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:12,400
one of a countless variety of consciousnesses. And even within human consciousness, there's

1399
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,200
countless variety of consciousnesses within us. You have your left and right hemisphere.

1400
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:22,880
And apparently, if you split the corpus callosum, the personality of the left hemisphere and the

1401
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,760
religious belief of the left hemisphere can be very different from the right hemisphere.

1402
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:32,400
And their conscious experiences can be disjoint. One could have one conscious experience.

1403
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,000
They can play 20 questions. The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind and the right

1404
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,160
hemisphere has to guess. And it might not get it. So even within you, there is more than just

1405
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:47,920
one consciousness. It's lots of consciousnesses. So the general theory of consciousness that I'm

1406
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,120
after is not just human consciousness. It's going to be just consciousness. And I presume human

1407
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:59,200
consciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.

1408
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:08,000
That said, I should clarify that the black hole of consciousness is the home cat. I'm pretty sure

1409
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:15,760
cat's lack is the embodiment of evil and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.

1410
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,560
So I just want to lay that out. But that's the theory I'm working on. I don't have any

1411
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:25,520
good evidence, but it's just a shout out. Sorry to distract. So that's the first assumption.

1412
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,000
The first assumption is right. The second assumption is that these experiences have

1413
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,640
consequences. So I'm going to say that conscious experiences can trigger other conscious experiences

1414
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:45,040
somehow. So really, in some sense, there's two basic assumptions. There's some kind of

1415
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,360
causality. Is there is a chain of causality? Does it relate to dynamics?

1416
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:55,680
I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship. So I'm trying to be

1417
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:02,720
as nonspecific to begin with and see where it leads me. So what I can write down are probability

1418
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:09,040
spaces. So probability space, which contains the conscious experiences that this consciousness

1419
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:18,400
can have. So I call this a conscious agent. This technical thing. Anika Harris and I've

1420
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:23,600
talked about this and she rightly cautions me that people will think that I'm bringing in a

1421
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,240
notion of a self or agency and so forth when I say conscious agent. So I just want to say that I

1422
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:35,040
use the term conscious agent merely as a technical term. There is no notion of self in my fundamental

1423
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:40,640
definition of a conscious agent. There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships

1424
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:45,200
that of how they trigger other experiences. So the agent is the generator of the conscious

1425
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:51,120
experience. The agent is a mathematical structure that includes a probability measure,

1426
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:57,520
the probability space of possible conscious experiences and what an Amarcovian kernel,

1427
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,720
which describes how if this agent has certain conscious experiences,

1428
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:07,360
how that will affect the experiences of other conscious agents, including itself.

1429
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:12,960
But you don't think of that as a self? No, there is no notion of a self here.

1430
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:21,120
There's no notion of really of an agent. But is there a locality? Is there an organism?

1431
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:29,040
So these are conscious units, conscious entities. But they're distinct

1432
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,920
in some way because they have to interact. Well, so here's the interesting thing. When we write

1433
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:40,800
down the mathematics, when you have two of these conscious agents interacting, the pair

1434
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,280
satisfy a definition of a conscious agent. So they are a single conscious agent.

1435
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:52,880
So there is one conscious agent. But it has a nice analytic decomposition into as many

1436
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:59,120
conscious agents. So that's a nice interface. It's a very useful scientific interface. It's

1437
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:05,200
a scale free or if you like a fractal like approach to it in which we can use the same

1438
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:11,520
unit of analysis at all scales in studying consciousness. But if I want to talk about

1439
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:19,920
so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence, self, agency.

1440
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:28,480
So none of that is fundamental. So and the reason I did that was because I want to assume

1441
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:32,880
as little as possible. Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory. It's not something you

1442
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,120
explain as something you assume. So I have to build networks of conscious agents.

1443
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:43,120
If I want to have a notion of a self, I have to build a self. I have to build learning, memory,

1444
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:47,200
problem solving, intelligence, and planning, all these different things. I have to build

1445
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:52,320
networks of conscious agents to do that. It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents

1446
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:56,720
are computationally universal. That's trivial. So anything that we can do with neural networks

1447
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:00,960
or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents. That's trivial.

1448
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:09,520
But you can also do more. The events in the probability space need not be computable. So

1449
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:15,920
the Markovian dynamics is not restricted to computable functions because the very events

1450
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:21,680
themselves need not be computable. So this can capture any computable theory. Anything we can

1451
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:27,280
do with neural networks, we can do with conscious agent networks. But it leaves open the door for

1452
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:33,760
the possibility of non computable interactions between conscious agents. So we have to, if we

1453
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:39,600
want a theory of memory, we have to build it. And there's lots of different ways you could build.

1454
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:44,160
We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead on this. And he, we have a paper called

1455
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:48,320
conscious agent networks where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use these networks of

1456
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:52,560
conscious agents to build memory and to build primitive kinds of learning.

1457
01:44:53,760 --> 01:45:01,520
But can you provide some intuition of what conscious networks, networks of conscious agents

1458
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:08,880
helps you? Well, first of all, what that looks like. And I don't just mean mathematically,

1459
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:13,600
of course, maybe that might help build up intuition, but how that helps us potentially

1460
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:21,200
solve the hard problem of consciousness. Right. Or is that baked in that that exists?

1461
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:29,600
Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness? Why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious

1462
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:36,000
ice cream with networks of conscious agents? Or is that taken as an assumption?

1463
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:44,480
So the standard way the hard problem is thought of is we're assuming space and time in particles

1464
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:50,240
or neurons, for example. These are just physical things that have no consciousness. And we have

1465
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:54,960
to explain how the conscious experience of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those. So

1466
01:45:54,960 --> 01:46:00,880
that's the typical hard problem of consciousness is that problem, right? How do you boot up the taste

1467
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:07,440
of chocolate, the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say, or the right kind

1468
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:13,440
of artificial intelligence circuitry? How do you boot that up? That's typically what the hard

1469
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:19,040
problem of consciousness means to researchers. Notice that I'm changing the problem. I'm not

1470
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:24,240
trying to boot up conscious experiences from the dynamics of neurons or silicon or something like

1471
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:29,840
that. I'm saying that that's the wrong problem. My hard problem would go in the other direction.

1472
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:35,520
If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time?

1473
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,280
How do I build up what I call the physical world? How do I build up what we call brains?

1474
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:44,560
Because I'm saying consciousness is not something that brains do.

1475
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:53,280
Brains are something that consciousness makes up. It's an ephemeral experience

1476
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:58,480
in consciousness. I look inside, so to be very, very clear, right now I have no neurons.

1477
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:05,200
If you looked, you would see neurons. That's a data structure that you would create on the fly,

1478
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:09,920
and it's a very useful one. As soon as you look away, you garbage collect that data structure,

1479
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,880
just like that Necker cube that I was talking about on the piece of paper.

1480
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:19,520
When you look, you see a 3D cube. You create it on the fly. As soon as you look away, that's gone.

1481
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,320
When you say you, you mean a human being scientist?

1482
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:28,320
Right now, that's right. More generally, it'll be conscious agents, because as you pointed out,

1483
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:34,320
asking for theory of consciousness only about humans, no, it's consciousness, which human

1484
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:41,840
consciousness is just a tiny sliver. But you are saying that there's a useful data structure.

1485
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:46,480
How many other data structures are there? That's why I said you human. If there's another earth,

1486
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,520
if there's another alien civilization and doing these kinds of investigations,

1487
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:54,800
would they come up with similar data structures? Probably not.

1488
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,600
What is the space of data structures, I guess, is what I'm asking.

1489
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:05,040
My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental, consciousness is all there is,

1490
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:12,800
then the only thing that mathematical structure can be about is possibilities of consciousness.

1491
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,920
And that suggests to me that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses,

1492
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:27,600
and a vanishingly small fraction of them use spacetime data structures,

1493
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:31,840
and the kinds of structures that we use. There's an infinite variety of data structures.

1494
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,920
Now, this is very similar to something that Max Tegmark has said, but I want to distinguish it.

1495
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:42,080
He has his level four multiverse idea. He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.

1496
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,480
And so that's the fundamental reality. And since there's an infinite variety of,

1497
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:50,960
endless variety of mathematical structures, there's an infinite variety of multiverses

1498
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:57,040
in his view. I'm saying something similar in spirit, but importantly different. There's

1499
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:02,240
an infinite variety of mathematical structures, absolutely. But mathematics isn't the fundamental

1500
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:08,480
reality in this framework. Consciousness is, and mathematics is to consciousness,

1501
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:15,280
like bones are to an organism. You need the bones. So mathematics is not divorced from

1502
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:21,040
consciousness, but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means. And so there's an

1503
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:29,200
infinite variety of consciousnesses and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.

1504
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:36,480
And therefore worlds, common worlds, data structures that they can use to communicate.

1505
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:43,600
So spacetime is just one of an infinite variety. And so I think that what we'll find is that as

1506
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:52,080
we go outside of our little spacetime bubble, we will encounter utterly alien forms of conscious

1507
01:49:52,080 --> 01:50:01,360
experience that we may not be able to really comprehend in the following sense. If I ask

1508
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:09,200
you to imagine a color that you've never seen before. Does anything happen? Nothing happens.

1509
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:16,080
No. Nothing happens. And that's just one color. I'm asking for just a color. We actually know,

1510
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:23,200
by the way, that apparently there are women called tetrafemes who have four color receptors,

1511
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,920
not just three. And Kimberly Jamison and others who've studied these women have good evidence

1512
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:36,080
that they apparently have a new dimension of color experience that the rest of us don't have.

1513
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:41,920
So these women are apparently living in a world of color that you and I can't even

1514
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:47,600
concretely imagine. No man can imagine them. And yet they're real color experiences. And so

1515
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:52,720
in that sense, I'm saying now take that little baby step. Oh, there are women who have color

1516
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:58,080
experiences that I could never have. Well, that's shocking. Now take that infinite. There are

1517
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:03,920
consciousnesses where every aspect of their experiences is like that new color. It's something

1518
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,920
utterly alien to you. You have nothing like that. And yet these are all possible varieties

1519
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:15,440
of conscious experience. When you say there's a lot of consciousnesses as a singular consciousness,

1520
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:20,880
basically the set of possible experiences you can have in that subjective way,

1521
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:28,960
as opposed to the underlying mechanism. Because you say that, you know, having an

1522
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:34,880
extra color receptor, you know, ability to have new experiences that somehow

1523
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:39,520
a different consciousness, is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,

1524
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:46,000
the subjectivity itself? Right. Because when we have two of these conscious agents interacting,

1525
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,920
the mathematics, they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent. So in fact,

1526
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,600
they are a single conscious agent. So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying, I'm

1527
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:00,080
postulating with my colleagues, Chaitanya and Chris and others, Robert Prettner and so forth.

1528
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:07,760
There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated. But fortunately, we can, for analytic

1529
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,080
purposes, break it down all the way to, in some sense, the simplest conscious agent, which has

1530
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:19,200
one conscious experience, one. This one agent can experience red 35. That's it. That's what

1531
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:26,320
experiences. You can get all the way down to that. So you think it's possible that consciousness,

1532
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:36,160
whatever that is, is much more, is fundamental, or at least much more in the direction of the

1533
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:44,320
fundamental than is space time as we perceive it. That's the proposal. And therefore, what I have

1534
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:51,040
to do in terms of the heart problem of consciousness is to show how dynamical systems of conscious

1535
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:57,120
agents could lead to what we call space and time and neurons and brain activity. In other words,

1536
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:05,440
we have to show how you get space time and physical objects entirely from a theory of

1537
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:12,320
conscious agents outside of space time with the dynamics outside of space time. So I can tell you

1538
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:18,560
how we plan to do that. But that's the idea. Okay. The magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.

1539
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:25,280
So there's a mathematical kind of thing that we could say here, how it can emerge within the system

1540
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,920
of networks of conscious agents. But

1541
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:38,960
is there going to be at the end of the proof why chocolate is so delicious? Or no? I guess I'm

1542
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,120
going to ask different kinds of dumb questions to try to sneak up.

1543
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:47,920
Oh, well, that's the right question. And when I say that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,

1544
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:54,000
what that means is in the current version of my theory, I'm not explaining conscious experiences

1545
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,560
where they came from. That's the miracle. That's one of the miracles. So I have two

1546
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,600
miracles in my theory. There are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate,

1547
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:08,560
and that there's a probabilistic relationship when certain conscious experiences occur,

1548
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:13,440
others are more likely to occur. Those are the two miracles that are possible to

1549
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:21,440
get beyond that and somehow start to chip away at the miracle-ness of that miracle.

1550
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:27,200
That chocolate is still delicious. I hope so. I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right

1551
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:33,040
now. But I can just say at top level how we would think about that. That would get at this

1552
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:47,040
consciousness without form. This is really tough because it's consciousness without form versus

1553
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:51,760
the various forms that consciousness takes for the experiences that it has.

1554
01:54:52,640 --> 01:55:02,880
Right. So when I write down a probability space for these conscious experiences,

1555
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,520
I say, here's a probability space for the possible conscious experiences.

1556
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,280
It's just like when I write down a probability space for an experiment. I'm going to flip a coin

1557
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:15,680
twice. I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes. So I have to write down a

1558
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,600
probability space. There could be heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails.

1559
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:25,520
Any class in probability, you're told, write down your probability space. If you don't

1560
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,440
write down your probability space, you can't get started. So here's my probability space for

1561
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,480
consciousness. How do I want to interpret that structure? The structure is just sitting there.

1562
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:39,520
There's going to be a dynamics that happens on it. Experiences appear and then they disappear.

1563
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:46,320
Just like heads appears and disappears. So one way to think about that fundamental

1564
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:50,960
probability space is that corresponds to consciousness without any content.

1565
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:58,080
The infinite consciousness that transcends any particular content.

1566
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:01,040
Well, do you think of that as a mechanism, as a thing,

1567
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:07,920
like the rules that govern the dynamics of the thing outside of space-time?

1568
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,640
If you think consciousness is fundamental, isn't it essentially getting like,

1569
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:19,760
if it is solving the hard problem, which is like, from where does this thing pop up?

1570
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:26,240
Which is the mechanism of the thing popping up. Whatever the consciousness is, the different

1571
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:34,640
kinds was so on. That mechanism. And also the question I want to ask is, how tricky do you think

1572
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:41,120
it is to solve that problem? You've solved a lot of difficult problems throughout the history of

1573
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:51,200
humanity. There's probably more problems to solve left than we've solved by an infinity.

1574
01:56:52,800 --> 01:57:00,880
But along that long journey of intelligent species, when will we solve this consciousness one?

1575
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,960
Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.

1576
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:09,760
So I'll give two answers. There's one problem I think we can solve, but we haven't solved yet.

1577
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:13,520
And that is the reverse of what my colleagues call the hard problem.

1578
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,240
The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences in the way that I've just described

1579
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:24,720
them and the dynamics, and build up space and time and brains. That I think is a tough technical

1580
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,640
problem, but some principle solvable. So I think we can solve that. So we would solve the hard

1581
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:32,480
problem, not by showing our brains create consciousness, but how networks of conscious

1582
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:35,760
agents create what we call the symbols that we call brains.

1583
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:43,440
But does that allow you to... So that's interesting. That's an interesting idea.

1584
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:47,360
Consciousness creates the brain, not the brain creates consciousness. But does that allow you

1585
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:55,200
to build the thing? My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies. And I'll tell

1586
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:59,920
you why. I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing. So this theory of consciousness

1587
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,480
will be even deeper than the structures that the physicists are finding, like the Amplitude

1588
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:12,160
Hadron. But the other answer to your question is less positive. As I said earlier, I think that

1589
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:20,320
there is no such thing as a theory of everything. So that I think that the theory that my team is

1590
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:28,320
working on, this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory. We're using probability

1591
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:32,960
spaces and Markovian kernels. I can easily see people now saying, well, we can do better if we

1592
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:39,520
go to category theory. And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting. And then someone will

1593
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:43,840
say, well, now I'll go to Topoi theory. And then there'll be... So I imagine that there'll be,

1594
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:52,800
you know, conscious agents 5, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0. But I think it will never end. I think ultimately,

1595
01:58:53,680 --> 01:59:01,680
this question that we sort of put our fingers on of, how does the formless give birth to form,

1596
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:10,080
to the wonderful taste of chocolate? I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,

1597
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:15,760
but we will never solve that. That in some sense, that will be a primitive. I hope I'm wrong.

1598
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:24,960
Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination. So I'll just say my imagination

1599
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:32,240
right now doesn't peer that deep. Hopefully... So by the way, I'm saying this, I don't want to

1600
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:38,880
discourage some brilliant 20-year-old who then later on proves me dead wrong. I hope to be proven

1601
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,720
dead wrong. But just like you said, essentially from now, everything we're saying now, everything

1602
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:50,400
you're saying, all your theories will be laughing stock. They will respect the puzzle-solving

1603
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:57,040
abilities and how much we were able to do with so little. But outside of that, it will all be just

1604
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:02,880
the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager. Especially the silliness when we

1605
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,400
thought that we were so smart and we knew it all. So it would be interesting to explore your ideas

1606
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:16,720
by contrasting, you mentioned Annika Harris, you mentioned Philip Goff. So outside of,

1607
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:22,480
if you're not allowed to say the fundamental disagreement is the fact that space-time is

1608
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:29,120
fundamental, what are interesting distinctions between ideas of consciousness between you and

1609
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:36,240
Annika, for example? You guys have been on a podcast together, I'm sure in private,

1610
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:41,600
you guys have some incredible conversations. So where are some interesting sticking points,

1611
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:47,520
some interesting disagreements, let's say with Annika first. Maybe there'll be a few other people.

1612
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:50,960
Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning where we were talking about

1613
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:56,000
our ideas. And what we discovered really in our conversation was that we're pretty much on the

1614
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,400
same page. It was really just- About consciousness. Yeah, our ideas about consciousness are pretty

1615
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:09,520
much on the same page. She rightly has cautioned me to, when I talk about conscious agents,

1616
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:16,480
to point out that the notion of agency is not fundamental in my theory. The notion of self

1617
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:21,360
is not fundamental. And that's absolutely true. I can use this network of conscious agents.

1618
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,440
As a technical term, conscious agent is a technical term for that probability space

1619
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:32,800
with the Markovian dynamics. I can use that to build models of a self and to build models of

1620
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:42,000
agency, but they're not fundamental. So she has really been very helpful in helping me to be a

1621
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,360
little bit clear about these ideas and not say things that are misleading. Sure. I mean,

1622
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:52,240
this is the interesting thing about language, actually, is that language, quite obviously,

1623
02:01:52,240 --> 02:02:05,040
is an interface to truth. It's so fascinating that individual words can have so much ambiguity

1624
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:12,880
and the slight, the specific choices of a word within a particular sentence, within the context

1625
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:19,120
of a sentence can have so much such a difference in meaning. It's quite fascinating, especially when

1626
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:24,480
you're talking about topics like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term. It means a lot

1627
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:30,080
of things to a lot of people. And the entire concept of shrouded in a mystery. So combination

1628
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:35,520
of the fact that it's a loaded term and that there's a lot of mystery, people can just interpret it

1629
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:44,160
in all kinds of ways. And so you have to be both precise and help them avoid getting stuck on some

1630
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:50,720
kind of side road of miscommunication, loss in translation, because you use the wrong word.

1631
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:58,080
That's interesting. I mean, because for, for a lot of people, consciousness is ultimately connected

1632
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:08,000
to a self. I mean, that's our experience of consciousness is very, it's connected to this

1633
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,720
ego. I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be? I can't even, how do you begin to

1634
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:20,960
comprehend, to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness that's not connected to like this

1635
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:26,720
particular organism? Well, I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now that's,

1636
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:33,280
that's, that comes out of this, this framework that's different. So we can imagine a dynamics of

1637
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:40,560
consciousness, not in space and time, just abstractly. It could be cooperative, for all we know, it

1638
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:47,120
could be very friendly, I don't know. And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics that is

1639
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:52,960
so-called stationary. And that's a technical term, which means that the entropy effectively is not

1640
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,040
increasing. There is some entropy, but it's constant. So there's no increasing entropy.

1641
02:03:57,040 --> 02:04:05,360
And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless. There is no entropic time. But it's a trivial theorem,

1642
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:13,760
three line proof, that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make

1643
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:18,000
of that dynamics by conditional probability, and if you want, I can state a little more,

1644
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,440
even more mathematically precisely for, for some readers or listeners. But if any projection you

1645
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:30,160
take by conditional probability, the induced image of that Markov chain will have increasing entropy.

1646
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:39,760
You will have entropic time. So, so I'll be very, very precise. I have a Markov chain x1 x2

1647
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:48,880
through xn, where xn, n goes to infinity, right? The entropy h, capital H of xn is equal to the

1648
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:59,840
entropy h of xn minus one for all n. So the entropy is the same. But it's a, it's a theorem that h

1649
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:09,200
of xn, say given x sub one is greater than or equal to h of xn minus one, given x1.

1650
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,520
Sure. Where does the grader come from? Because with the theorem, the three line proof,

1651
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:27,280
h of xn given x1 is greater than or equal to h of xn given x1 and x2, because conditioning reduces.

1652
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:37,040
But then h of xn minus one given x1 comma x2 is equal to h of xn

1653
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:46,160
given x2, xn minus one given x2 by the Markov property. And then because it's stationary,

1654
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:55,360
it's equal to h of x. I have to write it down. xn minus, I have to write it down. Anyway,

1655
02:05:55,360 --> 02:06:00,640
there's a three line proof. Sure. So, but the assumption of stationarity,

1656
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,040
we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand, doesn't matter.

1657
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:13,440
So there's some kind of, some Markovian dynamics is basically trying to model some kind of system

1658
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:17,600
with some probabilities and there's agents and they interact in some kind of way. And you could

1659
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:27,040
say something about that system as it evolves. Stationarity, so stationary system is one that

1660
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:32,960
has certain properties in terms of entropy very well. But we don't know if it's stationary or not.

1661
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:38,480
We don't know what the properties, right? You see, you have to kind of take assumptions and see,

1662
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:43,520
okay, well, what is, what does the systems behave like under these different properties?

1663
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:48,240
The more constraints, the more assumptions you take, the more predictive, the more

1664
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:51,040
interesting, powerful things you can say, but sometimes they're limiting.

1665
02:06:52,160 --> 02:07:00,080
That said, we're talking about consciousness here. How does that, you said cooperative,

1666
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:07,680
okay, competitive. It just, I like chocolate. I'm sitting here. I have a brain. I'm wearing a suit.

1667
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:15,680
It sure as hell feels like I'm a self. Right. Now, what am I tuning in? Am I plugging into

1668
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:22,880
something? Am I a projection, a simple trivial projection into space time from some much larger

1669
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,480
organism that I can't possibly comprehend? How the hell, you're saying some, you're building

1670
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:35,040
up mathematical intuitions. Fine. Great. But I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here,

1671
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:40,560
and I'm going to die soon. We'll all die pretty quickly. So I, I want to, I want to figure out

1672
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:46,080
why chocolate is so delicious. So help me out here. So let's just keep sneaking up to this.

1673
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:54,880
Right. So the whole technical, technical thing was to say this, even if the dynamics of consciousness

1674
02:07:54,880 --> 02:08:02,320
is stationary so that there is no entropic time, any projection of it, any view of it

1675
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:12,000
will have the artifact of entropic time. That's a limited resource, limited resources.

1676
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:18,400
So the fundamental dynamics may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever. Any projection

1677
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:24,000
will have certainly time as a limited resource and probably lots of other limited resources.

1678
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:31,600
Hence we could get competition and evolution and nature, red, and tooth, and claw as an artifact

1679
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:36,720
of a deeper system in which those aren't fundamental. And, and in fact, I take it as

1680
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:42,720
something that this theory must do at some point is to show how networks of conscious agents,

1681
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:48,400
even if they're not resource limited, give rise to evolution of a natural selection via a projection.

1682
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:53,840
Yeah. But you're saying, I'm trying to understand how the limited resources that give rise

1683
02:08:53,840 --> 02:09:00,640
to, so first the thing gives rise to time, it gives rise to limited resource, it gives rise to

1684
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:05,280
evolution by natural selection, how that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious.

1685
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:09,840
Well, it's not going to do that directly. It's going to get to this notion of self.

1686
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:12,800
Oh, it's going to give you the notion of self.

1687
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,800
Oh, the evolution gives you the notion of self.

1688
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:21,600
And also of a self separate from other selves. So the idea would be that competition has life

1689
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,200
and death, all those kinds of things.

1690
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:28,960
That's right. So it won't, I don't think, as I said, I don't think that I can tell you how

1691
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,520
the formless gives rise to the experience of chocolate. Right now, my current theory says

1692
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,920
that's, that's one of the miracles I'm assuming. Yeah.

1693
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,440
So my theory can't do it. And the reason my theory can't do it is because

1694
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:44,960
Hoffman's brain can't do it right now. But, but the notion of self, yes,

1695
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:53,520
the notion of self can be an artifact of the projection of it. So there's one conscious agent.

1696
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,320
Because anytime conscious agents interact, they form a new conscious agent. So there's one

1697
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:05,280
conscious agent. Any projection of that one conscious agent gives rise to time, even if

1698
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:10,320
there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent. And it gives rise, I want to, I haven't

1699
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:14,400
proven this. So this is, so now this is me guessing where the theory is going to go.

1700
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:17,840
Not, I haven't done this. There's no paper on this yet. So now I'm speculating.

1701
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,400
My guess is I'll be able to show, or the, or the, but my brighter colleagues working with me

1702
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:26,960
will be able to show that, that we will get evolution of a natural selection, the notion

1703
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:31,040
of individual selves, individual physical objects, and so forth coming out as a projection of this

1704
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:36,400
thing. And, and, and that the self, this thing will be, be really interesting in terms of how

1705
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:42,640
it starts to interact with certain spiritual traditions, right? Where they will say that

1706
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:47,360
there is a notion of self that needs to be let go, which is this finite self that's competing

1707
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:53,840
with other selves to, you know, get more money and prestige and so forth. That self in some sense

1708
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:57,760
has to die. But there's a deeper self, which is the timeless

1709
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:07,040
being that preclude, that precedes, not precludes, but precedes any particular

1710
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:12,480
conscious experiences, the ground of all experience, that there's that notion of a deep

1711
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:20,000
capital self. But our little capital, lowercase s selves could be artifacts of projection.

1712
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:27,920
And it may be that what consciousness is doing in this framework is, right? It's projected itself

1713
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:35,520
down into a self that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex. And through conversations

1714
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:42,320
like this, it's trying to find out about itself, and eventually transcend the limits of the Don

1715
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:50,480
and Lex little icons that it's using, and that little projection of itself through this conversation

1716
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:58,720
is somehow it's learning about itself. So that thing dressed me up today in order to understand

1717
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:03,200
itself. And in some sense, you and I are not separate from that thing, and we're not separate

1718
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:09,040
from each other. Yeah. Well, I have to question the fashion choices on my end. All right. So

1719
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:15,360
you mentioned you agree on in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Annika.

1720
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:25,440
Is there somebody friend or friendly foe that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way,

1721
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:32,080
or some major way about consciousness about these topics of reality that you return to

1722
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:43,360
often? It's like Christopher Hitchens with Rabbi David Walby have had interesting conversations

1723
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:49,040
through years that added to the complexity and the beauty of their friendship. Is there somebody

1724
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:55,360
like that, that over the years has been a source of disagreement with you that strengthened your

1725
02:12:55,360 --> 02:13:06,800
ideas? My ideas have been really shaped by several things. One is the physicalist framework that

1726
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:13,680
my scientific colleagues almost to a person have adopted, and that I adopted too, until the reason

1727
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:21,040
I walked away from it was because it became clear that we couldn't start with unconscious

1728
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:28,160
ingredients and boot up consciousness. Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?

1729
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:35,600
So a physicalist, I would say is someone who takes space time and the objects within space

1730
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:42,640
time as ontologically fundamental. Right. And then reductionist is saying the smaller,

1731
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:48,240
the more fundamental. That's a methodological thing. That's saying within space time as you go

1732
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:53,040
to smaller and smaller scales in space, you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental

1733
02:13:53,040 --> 02:14:01,200
laws. And the reduction of temperature to particle movement was an example of that,

1734
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:07,120
but I think that the reason that worked was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.

1735
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:12,320
That was for a long time, and your colleagues, including yourself or physicalist, and now

1736
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:17,040
you broke away. I broke away because I think you can't start with unconscious ingredients and boot

1737
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:22,720
up consciousness. And so even with Roger Penrose, where there's like a gray area.

1738
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:30,080
Right. And here's the challenge I would put to all of my friends and colleagues who are,

1739
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:38,960
give one specific conscious experience that you can boot up. So if you think that it's

1740
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:44,400
integrated information, and this I've asked this of Julia to know me a couple times back in the

1741
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:49,120
90s, and then just a couple of years ago, I asked Julia, okay, so great integrated information. So

1742
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:54,640
we're all interested in explaining some specific conscious experiences. So what, what is, you

1743
02:14:54,640 --> 02:15:00,720
know, pick one, the taste of chocolate? What is the integrated information, precise structure

1744
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:06,000
that we need for chocolate? And why does that structure have to be for chocolate? And why,

1745
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,440
why is it that it could not possibly be vanilla? Is there any, last time, is there any one specific

1746
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:17,360
conscious experience that you can account for? Because notice, they've set themselves the task

1747
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:22,320
of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems. That's the task they've set

1748
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:27,440
themselves. But that doesn't mean they're, I understand your intuition, but that doesn't mean

1749
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:32,080
they're wrong just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet. That's right. No, that doesn't

1750
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:38,240
mean that they're wrong. It just, it just means that they haven't done it. I think it's principled.

1751
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:44,160
The reason is principled, but, but I'm happy that they're exploring it. But the fact is, the

1752
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:49,840
remarkable fact is there's not one theory. So integrated information theory, orchestrated

1753
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:56,160
collapse of microtubules, global workspace theory. These are all theories of consciousness.

1754
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:01,840
These are all theories of consciousness. There's not a single theory that can give you a specific

1755
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:06,560
conscious experience that they say, here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure

1756
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:11,120
that must be the taste of chocolate or whatever one they want. So you're saying it's impossible,

1757
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:19,520
they're saying it's just hard. Yeah. My attitude is, okay, no one said you had to start with neurons

1758
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,640
or physical systems and boot up consciousness. You guys are just taking that. You chose that

1759
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:27,520
problem. So since you chose that problem, how much progress have you made? Well,

1760
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:32,080
when you've not been able to come up with a single specific conscious experience,

1761
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:35,680
and you've had these brilliant people working on it for decades now,

1762
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:42,480
that's not really good progress. Let me ask you to be, to play devil's advocate. Can you try to

1763
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:50,480
steal man, steal man, meaning argue the best possible case for reality, the opposite of your

1764
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:55,920
book title. So, or maybe just stick into consciousness. Can you take the physicalist view?

1765
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:01,760
Can you steal man, the physicalist view for a brief moment, playing devil's advocate too?

1766
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:05,760
Or steal man, the person you used to be. Right.

1767
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:10,960
She's a physicalist. What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now?

1768
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:21,360
What would be a convincing argument for that? Well, I think the argument I would give and

1769
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:27,360
that I believed was, look, when you have very simple physical systems, like a piece of dirt,

1770
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,360
there's not much evidence of life for consciousness. It's only when you get really

1771
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:36,320
complicated physical systems like that have brains and really the more complicated the brains,

1772
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:41,280
the more it looks like there's consciousness and the more complicated that consciousness is.

1773
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:47,280
Surely that means that simple physical systems don't create much consciousness,

1774
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:52,560
if maybe not any, or maybe panpsychists, they create the most elementary kinds of

1775
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:58,400
simple conscious experiences. But you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,

1776
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:03,920
to create more complicated consciousnesses. I think that's the intuition that drives most of my

1777
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:12,240
colleagues. And you're saying that this concept of complexity is ill-defined when you ground it to

1778
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:17,360
space-time. Well, I think it's well-defined within the framework of space-time, right?

1779
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:23,120
No, it's ill-defined relative to what you need to actually understand consciousness

1780
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:26,160
because you're grounding complexity in just in space-time.

1781
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:35,280
Oh, got you. Right. Yeah. What I'm saying is, if it were true that space-time was fundamental,

1782
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:41,040
then I would have to agree that if there is such a thing as consciousness, given the data that we've

1783
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:47,760
got, that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't, that somehow it's the complexity of

1784
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:53,040
the dynamics or organization, the function of the physical system that somehow is creating the

1785
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:59,920
consciousness. So under those assumptions, yes. But when the physicists themselves are telling us

1786
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:04,880
that space-time is not fundamental, then I can understand. See, then the whole picture starts

1787
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:11,920
to come into focus. Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right? These are really smart people.

1788
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:17,440
I mean, Francis Crick worked on this for the last 20 years of his life. These are not stupid

1789
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:21,600
people. These are brilliant, brilliant people. The fact that we've come up with not a single

1790
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:26,640
specific conscious experience that we can explain and no hope. There's no one that says,

1791
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:31,440
oh, I'm really close. I'll have it for you in a year. No, there's just like, there's this

1792
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:37,520
fundamental gap. So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says, look, he likes the

1793
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:42,480
global workspace theory. But he says the last dollop of the theory in which there's something

1794
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:51,280
it's like to, he says we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact. Pinker is brilliant,

1795
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:57,280
right? He understands the state of play on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,

1796
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:03,200
starting with physical assumptions and then trying to boot up consciousness. You've set

1797
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:09,120
yourself the problem. I'm starting with physical stuff that's not conscious. I'm trying to get

1798
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:14,080
the taste of chocolate out as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.

1799
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:18,160
We've not been able to do that. And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.

1800
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:24,800
We may have to just stipulate that last bit. He calls it the last dollop. And just say,

1801
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:28,560
stipulate it as a bare fact of nature that there is something it's like. Well,

1802
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:33,120
from my point of view as the physical, the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist was

1803
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:37,280
we wouldn't have to stipulate. I was going to start with the physical stuff and explain where

1804
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:41,680
the consciousness came from. If I'm going to stipulate consciousness, why don't I just stipulate

1805
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:47,440
consciousness and not stipulate all the physical stuff too? So I'm stipulating less. I'm saying,

1806
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:51,520
okay, I agree. The panpsychist perspective. Well, it's actually what I call the conscious

1807
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:56,880
realist perspective. Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right? They're saying there's physical

1808
02:20:56,880 --> 02:21:00,960
stuff that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff. So I would go with Pinker

1809
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:05,120
and say, look, let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff, but I'm not going to stipulate the

1810
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:09,600
physical stuff. I'm going to actually now show how to boot up the physical stuff from just the

1811
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:15,120
consciousness stuff. So I'll stipulate less. Is it possible? So if you stipulate less,

1812
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:25,520
is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?

1813
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:30,880
Is it possible to visualize somehow with the tools of math, with the tools of computers,

1814
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:37,280
with the tools of our mind? Are we hopelessly lost? You said there's ways to intuit

1815
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:49,920
what's true using mathematics and probability and sort of Markovian dynamics, all that kind

1816
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:56,480
of stuff, but that's not visualizing. That's what's the kind of building intuition, but is it possible

1817
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:03,680
to visualize in the way we visualize so nicely in space time, in four dimensions, in three dimensions?

1818
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:08,000
Sorry. Well, we really are looking through a two-dimensional screen until

1819
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:15,360
what we intuit to be a three-dimensional world and also inferring dynamic stuff,

1820
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:21,120
making it 4D. Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures that give us

1821
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:28,880
a deeper sense of the truth of reality? I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.

1822
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:36,560
I think that, for example, the picture that we have of electrons and photons interacting

1823
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:45,280
and scattering, it may have not been possible until Faraday did all of his experiments and

1824
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:50,800
then Maxwell wrote down his equations, and we were then sort of forced by his equations to think

1825
02:22:50,800 --> 02:23:01,120
in a new way. And then when Planck in 1900, desperate to try to solve the problem of black

1826
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:05,920
body radiation, what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe, where Newton was predicting infinite

1827
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:13,920
energies, there weren't infinite energies in black body radiation. And he, in desperation, proposed

1828
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:23,600
packets of energy. Then once you've done that, and then you have an Einstein come along five years

1829
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:31,600
later and show how that explains the photoelectric effect. And then eventually, in 1926, you get

1830
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:36,800
quantum theory. And then you get this whole new way of thinking that was, from the Newtonian point

1831
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:46,240
of view, completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly. And maybe if

1832
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:50,480
Giesen is right, not contradictory. Maybe if you use intuition as math, they're not contradictory.

1833
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:57,040
But still, certainly you wouldn't have gone there. And so here's a case where the experiments

1834
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:05,520
and then a desperate mathematical move, sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog,

1835
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:12,880
right? And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.

1836
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:20,000
I wonder if it's still possible to visualize in the, like we talk about consciousness in,

1837
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,960
from a self perspective, experience it. Hold that idea in our mind, the way you can experience

1838
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:34,480
things directly. We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world. And that's a very rich

1839
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:43,040
experience. When you're thinking mathematically, you still, in the end of the day, have to project

1840
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:50,720
it down to a low dimensional space to make, to make conclusions. Their conclusions will be a

1841
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:59,920
number or a line or a plot or a visual. So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth

1842
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:05,760
in a subjective way, like experience it, really feel the beauty of it, you know,

1843
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:11,680
in the way that humans feel beauty. Right. Are we screwed? I don't think we're screwed.

1844
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:18,240
I think that we get little hints of it from psychedelic drugs and so forth. We get hints

1845
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:22,640
that there are certain interventions that we can take on our interface. I apply this chemical,

1846
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:30,320
which is just some element of my interface, to this other, to a brain. I ingest it. And all of

1847
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:37,520
a sudden, I seem like I've opened new portals into conscious experiences. Well, that's very,

1848
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:42,400
very suggestive. That's like the black body radiation doing something that we didn't expect,

1849
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:46,480
right? It doesn't go to infinity when we thought it was going to go to infinity and we're forced to

1850
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:51,920
propose these quanta. So once we have a theory of conscious agents,

1851
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:57,760
and it's projection to space, I should sketch what I think that projection is.

1852
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:05,680
But then I think we can then start to ask specific questions. When you're taking DMT,

1853
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:13,120
or you're taking LSD or something like that. Now that we have this deep model that we've

1854
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,360
reverse engineered space and time and physical particles, we've pulled them back to this theory

1855
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:24,240
of conscious agents. Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future, what are we doing to

1856
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:31,120
conscious agents when we apply 5MEO DMT? What are we doing? Are we opening a new portal?

1857
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:37,440
So when I say that, I mean, I have a portal into consciousness that I call my body of

1858
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:42,880
Lex Friedman that I'm creating. And it's a genuine portal, not perfect, but it's a genuine portal

1859
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:46,800
I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness. And we know that we have

1860
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:53,280
one technology for building new portals. We know one technology and that is having kids.

1861
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:59,920
Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness. It takes a long time.

1862
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:07,040
Can you elaborate that? Oh, oh, oh, you mean like your son and your daughter didn't exist.

1863
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:11,840
That was a portal though. You're having contact with consciousness that you never would have had

1864
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:16,320
before. But now you've got a son or a daughter, you had, you went through this physical process,

1865
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:23,040
they were born, then you, there was all the training. But is that portal yours? So when you

1866
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:27,600
have kids, are you creating new portals that are completely distinct from the portals that you've

1867
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:32,720
created with other consciousness? Like, can you elaborate on that? To which degree are the

1868
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:41,440
consciousness of your kids a part of you? Well, so every person that I see, that symbol that I

1869
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:47,120
see, the body that I see is, is a portal potentially for me to interact with, with the

1870
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:54,560
consciousness. Yeah. And, and each consciousness has a unique character that we call a personality

1871
02:27:55,280 --> 02:28:02,560
and so forth. So with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that

1872
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:06,880
we've never seen before. And a version of consciousness that we've never seen before.

1873
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:12,000
At a deeper level, as I said, the theory says there's one agent. So this is a different projection

1874
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:20,880
of that one agent. But, but, so that's what I mean by a portal is within my own interface,

1875
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:31,200
my own projection, can I see other projections of that one consciousness? So can I get portals in,

1876
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:37,040
in that sense? And I, so and I think, I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a

1877
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:42,000
theory of portals. And then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting, are they actually

1878
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:48,400
creating new portals or not? If they're not, we should nevertheless, then understand how we could

1879
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:52,960
create a new portal, right? Maybe we have to just study what happens when we make, when we have kids.

1880
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:59,360
We know that that technology creates new portals. So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,

1881
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:06,640
okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo with that?

1882
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:11,280
With, with something like, like brain-computer interfaces, for example.

1883
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:14,560
Yeah, maybe just a chemical or something. So probably more complicated than a chemical. That's

1884
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:19,520
why I think that the psychedelics, the psychedelics may, because they might be affecting this portal

1885
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:24,880
in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up. Whereas it may be, once we understand what

1886
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:28,960
this thing is a portal, your body as a portal, understand all of its complexities, maybe we'll

1887
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:34,240
realize that that portal can be shifted and to different parts of the deeper consciousness

1888
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:41,040
and give new windows on it. And so in that way, maybe, yes, psychedelics could open up new portals

1889
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:44,320
in the sense that they're taking something that's already a complex portal and just

1890
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:50,000
tweaking it a bit. Well, but creating is a very powerful difference between morphing.

1891
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:57,840
Tweaking versus creating, I agree. But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space

1892
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:01,840
of the kinds of things that this particular system is capable of. I mean, you, I mean,

1893
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:07,680
the idea, your idea of the consciousness creates brains. I mean, that breaks my brain because

1894
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:13,440
there's a, you know, I'm, I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense, because that you could,

1895
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:22,240
it's just much easier to intuit the world. It's very, it's practical to think there's a neural

1896
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:31,920
network and what are the different ways fascinating capabilities can emerge from this neural network?

1897
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:38,720
I agree. It's easier. And so you start to, and then present to yourself the problem of, okay,

1898
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:45,360
well, how does consciousness arise? How does intelligence arise? How does emotion arise?

1899
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:53,840
How does memory arise in the, how do we filter within the system all the incoming

1900
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:59,040
sensory information we're able to allocate attention in different interesting ways? How do

1901
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:04,800
all those mechanisms arise to say that there's other fundamental things we don't understand

1902
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:11,920
outside of space time that are actually core to how this whole thing works is a bit paralyzing

1903
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:20,000
because it's like, oh, we're not, we're not 10% done. We're like 0.001% done.

1904
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:25,760
Well, it's the immediate feeling. I certainly understand that. My attitude about it is,

1905
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:32,000
if you look at the young physicists who are searching for these structures beyond space

1906
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:39,760
time, like the episode of Eden and so forth, they're having a ball. Space time, that's what

1907
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:45,760
the old folks did. That's what our, the older generation did. We're doing something that

1908
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:53,760
really is fun and new and they're having a blast and they're finding all these new structures.

1909
02:31:53,760 --> 02:32:04,160
So I think that we're going to succeed in getting a new deeper theory. I can just say what I'm

1910
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:09,680
hoping with the theory that I'm working on, I'm hoping to show that I could have this timeless

1911
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:15,440
dynamics of consciousness, no entropic time. I take a projection and I show how this timeless

1912
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:22,400
dynamics looks like the Big Bang and the entire evolution of space time. In other words, I see

1913
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:29,120
how my whole space time interface. So not just the projection, it just doesn't just look like

1914
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:34,080
space time. You can explain with it the whole from the origin of the universe.

1915
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:37,840
That's what we have to do and that's what the physicists understand. When they go beyond

1916
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:42,480
space time to the amplitude and the cosmological polytope, they ultimately know that they have

1917
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:48,640
to get back the Big Bang story and the whole evolution, that whole story where there were no

1918
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:55,520
living things. There was just a point and then the explosion and then just particles at high energy

1919
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,120
and then eventually the cooling down and the differentiation and finally

1920
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:05,040
matter, condenses and then life and then consciousness. That whole story has to come

1921
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:12,880
out of something that's deeper and without time and that's what we're up to. The whole story

1922
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:17,040
that we've been telling ourselves about Big Bang and how brains evolve in consciousness

1923
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:25,040
will come out of a much deeper theory. For someone like me, it's a lot. But for the

1924
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:31,360
younger generation, this is like, oh wow, all the low cherries aren't picked. This is really

1925
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:38,160
good stuff. This is really new, fundamental stuff that we can do. I can't wait to read the papers

1926
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:47,360
of the younger generation and I want to see them. Kids these days with their non-space time

1927
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:52,960
assumptions. It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition of the difficult ideas

1928
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:58,720
you struggle with. If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant, what are some interesting

1929
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:04,000
agreements and disagreements you have with a guy about the nature of reality?

1930
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:11,040
So there's a lot in agreement. So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist and

1931
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:20,880
he basically had the idea that we don't see nature as it is. We impose a structure on nature.

1932
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:31,120
So in some sense, I'm saying something similar. I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself

1933
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:35,840
an idealist. I call myself a conscious realist because idealism has a long history, a lot of

1934
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:40,400
different ideas come under idealism and there's a lot of debates and so forth. It

1935
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:46,960
tends to be identified with, in many cases, anti-science and anti-realism. And I don't

1936
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:52,080
want either connection with my ideas. And so I just called my conscious realism with an emphasis

1937
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:59,680
on realism and not anti-realism. But one place where I would, of course, disagree with Kant was

1938
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:06,960
that he thought that Euclidean space time was a priori. We just know that that's false.

1939
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:16,080
So he went too far on that. But in general, the idea that we don't start with space time,

1940
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:20,240
that space and time is, in some sense, the forms of our perceptions. Yes, absolutely.

1941
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:27,040
And I would say that there's a lot in common with Barclay in that regard.

1942
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:36,880
There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Barclay. Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly

1943
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:42,160
that the hard problem was not solvable. He posed a hard problem and basically dismissed it and

1944
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:47,520
just said, you can't do this. And so if he came here and saw where we are, he said,

1945
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:52,000
look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago. And he had his monodology. He was trying

1946
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:58,320
to do something like this. It's different from what I'm doing. But he had these things that

1947
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:04,080
were not in space and time, these monads. He was trying to build something. I'm trying to build

1948
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:10,160
a theory of consciousness. My guess is that if he came here, I could just, if he saw what I was

1949
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:16,480
doing, he would say, he would understand it and immediately take off with it and go places that

1950
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:23,440
I couldn't. He would have no problems. Right. There would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas.

1951
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:27,040
Absolutely. It would be totally overlapping. But his genus would then just run with it far

1952
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:31,840
faster than I could. I love the humility here. So let me ask you about sort of practical

1953
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:37,280
implications of your ideas to our world, our complicated world. When you look at the big

1954
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:50,240
questions of humanity of hate, war, what else is there, evil? Maybe there's the positive aspects

1955
02:36:50,240 --> 02:37:02,560
of that, of meaning, of love. What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived as? What is

1956
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:09,280
the conscious realism when applied to daily life? What kind of impact does it have?

1957
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:20,000
A lot. And it's sort of scary. We all know that life is ephemeral. And spiritual traditions have

1958
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,280
said, wake up to the fact that anything that you do here is going to disappear.

1959
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:30,400
But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought. I see this bottle because I create it

1960
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:36,560
right now. As soon as I look away, that data structure has been garbage collected. That bottle,

1961
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:40,960
I have to recreate it every time I look. So I spend all my money. I buy this fancy car.

1962
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:45,920
That car, I have to keep recreating it every time I look at it. It's that ephemeral.

1963
02:37:46,480 --> 02:37:52,160
So all the things that we invest ourselves in, we fight over, we kill each other over,

1964
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:58,080
and we have wars over, these are all, it's just like people in a virtual reality simulation.

1965
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:06,560
Right? And there's this Porsche. We all see the Porsche. Well, that Porsche exists when I look

1966
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:12,160
at it. I turn my headset and I look at it. And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,

1967
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:16,400
he'll see his Porsche. But it's not even the same Porsche that I see. He's creating his own Porsche.

1968
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:25,120
So these things are exceedingly ephemeral. And now, just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.

1969
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:31,360
Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche, but really, the Porsche only exists as long as you

1970
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:38,080
look. So this all of a sudden, what the spiritual traditions have been saying for a long, long time,

1971
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:43,840
this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science. It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact,

1972
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:48,000
it lasts for a few milliseconds, a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it, and then it's

1973
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:59,520
gone. So the whole idea, why are we fighting? Why do we hate? We fight over possessions

1974
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:08,080
because we think that we're small little objects inside this pre-existing space time. We assume

1975
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:15,920
that that mansion, that car exists independent of us and that somehow we, these little things,

1976
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:21,680
can have our sense of self and importance enhanced by having that special car or that special house

1977
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:28,480
or that special person. In fact, it's just the opposite. You create that mansion every time you

1978
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:35,200
look. You're something far deeper than that mansion. You're the entity which can create that

1979
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:41,520
mansion on the fly. And there's nothing to the mansion except what you create in this moment.

1980
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:50,240
So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view, it has all sorts of implications for how we

1981
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:59,520
interact with each other, how we treat each other. And again, a lot of things that spiritual

1982
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:04,240
traditions have said, it's a mixed bag. Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag. So let me just be

1983
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:08,320
right up front about that. I'm not promoting any particular, but they do have some insights.

1984
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:12,080
Yeah, they have wisdom. They have certain wisdom. They have, I can point to nonsense,

1985
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:16,560
I won't go into it, but I can also point to lots of nonsense. So the issue is to then

1986
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:24,240
to look for the key insights. And I think they have a lot of insights about the ephemeral nature of

1987
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:29,760
objects in space and time and not being attached to them, including our own bodies and reversing

1988
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:33,840
that I'm not this little thing, a little consciousness trapped in the body. And the

1989
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:37,440
consciousness itself is only a product of the body. So when the body dies, the consciousness

1990
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:42,880
disappears, it turns completely around, the consciousness is fundamental, the body,

1991
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:51,040
my hand exists right now because I'm looking at it. My hand is gone. I have no hand. I have,

1992
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:56,080
I have no brain. I have no heart. If you looked, you'll see a heart. Whatever I am

1993
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:04,080
is this really complicated thing in consciousness. That's what I am. All the stuff that I thought

1994
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:09,600
I was is something that I create on the fly and delete. So this whole, so this is completely

1995
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:18,400
a radical restructuring of how we think about possessions, about identity, about survival

1996
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:23,520
of death, and so forth. This is completely transformative. But the nice thing is that

1997
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:27,840
this whole approach of consciousness agents, unlike the spiritual traditions, which have

1998
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:34,000
said, in some cases, similar things, they've said it in precisely. This is mathematics.

1999
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:40,080
We can actually now begin to state precisely, here's the mathematical model of consciousness,

2000
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:44,400
conscious agents. Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly.

2001
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:53,280
And here's why things are ephemeral. And here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral

2002
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:58,320
nature of things, because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time,

2003
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,120
quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time.

2004
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:07,840
The I and the am and the I am is all kind of emerging through this whole process of evolution

2005
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:14,880
and so on. That's just surface waves. And there's a much deeper ocean that we're trying to figure

2006
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:19,520
out here. So how does you said, this said, some of the stuff you're thinking about maps the space

2007
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:24,240
time, how does it map the space? Right. So just a very, very high level, and I'll keep it brief.

2008
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:31,120
The structures that the physicists are finding, like the amplitude heat, it turns out they're

2009
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:37,840
just static structure, they're polytopes. But they remarkably, most of the information in them

2010
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:46,480
is contained in permutation matrices. So it's a matrix, like an n by n matrix that just has zeros

2011
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:53,680
and ones. That contains almost all of the information. And you can they have these plabbit

2012
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:57,840
graphs and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering, you can compute those scattering

2013
02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:06,320
amplitudes almost entirely from these permutation matrices. So that's just now from my point of

2014
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:12,240
view, I have this conscious agent dynamics, it turns out that the stationary dynamics that I was

2015
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:19,840
talking about, where the entropy is increasing, all the stationary dynamics are sketched out by

2016
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:29,280
permutation matrices. So if you there's so called Birkhoff polytope, all the vertices of this

2017
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:37,200
polytope, all the points are permutation matrices, all the internal points are Markovian kernels

2018
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:42,080
that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.

2019
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:48,400
I need to intuit a little better what the heck you're talking about. But so basically,

2020
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:54,960
there's some complicated thing going on with the network of conscious agents, and that's

2021
02:43:54,960 --> 02:44:01,920
mappable to this. You're saying it to dimensional matrix that scattering has to do with what,

2022
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:06,640
without the perception like that's like photon stuff. I mean, I don't know if it's useful to

2023
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:14,720
sort of dig into detail. I'll do just the high level thing. Yes. So the high level is the long

2024
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:18,640
term behavior of the conscious agent dynamics. So that's the projection of just looking at the

2025
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:26,400
long term behavior. I'm hoping we'll give rise to the amplitude, the amplitude, then gives rise to

2026
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:31,440
space time. So then I can just use their link to go all the way from consciousness through its

2027
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:37,360
asymptotics to through the amplitude and into space time and get the map all the way into our

2028
02:44:37,360 --> 02:44:40,400
interface. And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix because it gives you a nice

2029
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:45,040
thing to try to generate. That's right. It's the connection with the amplitude, the permutation

2030
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:49,760
matrices are the core of the amplitude, and it turns out they're the core of the asymptotic

2031
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:54,720
description of the conscious agents. So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,

2032
02:44:54,720 --> 02:45:01,040
but I like, first of all, I like video games and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.

2033
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:04,560
First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea, this thought experiment that will live in

2034
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:12,320
a simulation? And in general, do you think we'll live in a simulation? So the Nick Bostrom's idea

2035
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:19,760
about the simulation is typically couched in a physicalist framework. Yes. So there is the bottom

2036
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:25,200
level. There's some programmer in a physical space time, and they have a computer that they've

2037
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:31,600
programmed really cleverly, where they've created conscious entities. So you have the hard problem

2038
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:35,600
of consciousness, right? The standard hard problem, how could a computer simulation create a

2039
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:41,840
which isn't explained by that simulation theory. But then the idea is that the next level, the

2040
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:47,200
entities that are from the, that are created in the first level simulation, then can write

2041
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:54,160
their own simulations and you get this this nesting. So, so the idea that this is a simulation

2042
02:45:54,160 --> 02:46:00,720
is fine. But the idea that this starts with a physical space, I think is important. There's

2043
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:07,440
different properties here, the partial rendering. And to me, that's the interesting idea is not

2044
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:13,360
whether the entirety of the universe is simulated, but how efficiently can you

2045
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:23,360
create interfaces that are convincing to all other entities that can appreciate such interfaces?

2046
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,800
How little does it take? Because you said like partial rendering, or like temporal,

2047
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:34,800
ephemeral rendering of stuff, only render the tree falling in the forest when there's somebody

2048
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:40,240
there to see it. It's interesting to think how can you do that superficially without having

2049
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:45,040
to render everything. And that to me is one perspective on the simulation, just like it is

2050
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:49,760
with video games, where a video game doesn't have to render every single thing. It's just

2051
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:55,520
the thing that the observer is looking at. Right. There is actually, that's a very nice question.

2052
02:46:55,520 --> 02:47:00,960
And there's whole groups of researchers that are actually studying in virtual reality, what

2053
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:07,680
is the sort of minimal requirements on the system? What, how does it have to operate

2054
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:12,560
to give you an immersion experience, to give you the feeling that you have a body,

2055
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:16,480
to get you to take it real? And there's actually a lot of really good work on that right now.

2056
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:20,480
And it turns out it doesn't take that much. You do need to get the perception action loop

2057
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:26,880
tight. And you have to give them the perceptions that they're expecting, if you want them to.

2058
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:31,600
But if you, you can lead them along, if you give them perceptions that are close to what

2059
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:35,440
they're expecting, you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.

2060
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:38,480
Yeah, it's a trick engineering problem, especially when you're trying to create a product

2061
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:44,000
that costs little, but that's, it feels like an engineering problem, not a deeply scientific

2062
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:49,440
problem. Or meaning obviously it's a scientific problem, but as a scientific problem, it's not

2063
02:47:49,440 --> 02:47:56,400
that difficult to trick us descendants of apes. But here's, here's a case for just us in our own,

2064
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:59,840
if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now. So here's something you

2065
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:08,400
can try for yourself. If you just close your eyes and look at your experience in front of you,

2066
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:11,920
to be aware of your experience in front of you, what you experience is just like a modeled

2067
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:16,880
dark gray, where there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it, but it's just dark gray.

2068
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:24,160
But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward, put your attention backward,

2069
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:32,320
what is it like behind you with your eyes closed? And there, it's like nothing.

2070
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:41,120
It's real. So what is going on here? What, what am I experiencing back there?

2071
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:49,680
Right. Well, it's, I don't know if it's nothing. It's, it's like, I guess it's the absence of,

2072
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:55,760
it's not even like darkness or something. It's not even darkness. There's no, there's no

2073
02:48:56,480 --> 02:49:02,080
qualia to it. And yet there is a sense of being. And that's the interesting thing.

2074
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:06,640
There's a sense of being back. So I close my, I put my attention forward. I just,

2075
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:10,240
I have the quality of a gray model thing. But when I put my attention backward,

2076
02:49:10,240 --> 02:49:13,200
there's no quality at all, but there is a sense of being.

2077
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:19,920
I personally, you haven't been to that side of the room. I have been to that side of the room.

2078
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:26,960
So for me, memories, I start, I started playing the engine of memory replay,

2079
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:33,680
which is like, I take myself back in time and think about that place where I was hanging

2080
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:38,640
out in that part. That's when I see what I'm behind. So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,

2081
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:42,960
we're able to, we're collecting these experiences and we can replay them in interesting ways,

2082
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:48,160
whenever we feel like it. And it's almost like being there, but not really, but almost.

2083
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:54,000
That's right. And yet we can go our entire lives in this. You're talking about the minimal thing

2084
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:59,680
for VR. We can go our entire lives and not realize that all of my life, it's been like

2085
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:07,920
nothing behind me. We're not even aware that all of our lives, if you just, for the,

2086
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:10,960
just pay attention, close your eyes, pay attention to what's behind me, you're like,

2087
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:16,000
oh, holy smoke. It's sort of scary. I mean, it's like nothing. There's no quality there at all.

2088
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:21,280
How did I not notice that my entire life? We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.

2089
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:26,640
Yeah. I mean, you could see this with children, right? Though with persistence, you know, you

2090
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:32,320
could do the peek-a-boo game. You can hide from them and appear and they're fully tricked. And in

2091
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:36,560
the same way, we're fully tricked. There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.

2092
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:40,960
And that's really interesting. These theories are pretty heavy.

2093
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:49,840
You as a human being, as a mortal human being, how has these theories been to you personally?

2094
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:55,280
Like, are there good days and bad days when you wake up and look in the mirror and the fact that

2095
02:50:55,280 --> 02:51:00,240
you can't see anything behind you? The fact that it's rendered like, is there interesting quirks?

2096
02:51:01,360 --> 02:51:06,560
You know, Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

2097
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:11,760
How has these theories, these ideas changed you as a person?

2098
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:20,720
It's been very, very difficult. The stuff is not just abstract theory building because it's about us.

2099
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:26,160
Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me that my mind is doing all this

2100
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:30,400
science and coming with these conclusions. And the rest of me is not integrating. I was just like,

2101
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:35,440
I don't believe it. I just don't believe this. I mean, it seems. So as I start to take it seriously,

2102
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:44,080
I get scared myself. Then I read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying very,

2103
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:55,200
very similar things. There's a lot of convergence. So for me, the first time I thought it might be

2104
02:51:55,200 --> 02:52:01,440
possible that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986. It was from some mathematics we were doing.

2105
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:08,880
And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to sit down. It was, it really,

2106
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:17,280
it was scary. It was really a shock to the system. And then to realize that everything that has been

2107
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:25,040
important to me, like, you know, getting a house, getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.

2108
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:30,720
Well, that car is just like the car I see in the virtual reality. It's there when you

2109
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:34,720
perceive it and it's not there. So the whole question of, you know,

2110
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:41,040
what am I doing and why? What's worthwhile doing in life? Clearly,

2111
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:47,280
getting a big house and getting a big car. I mean, we all knew that we were going to die.

2112
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:53,280
So we tend not to know that. We tend to hide it, especially when we were young. Before age 30,

2113
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:58,560
we don't believe we're going to die. But we factually maybe know that you kind of are supposed

2114
02:52:58,640 --> 02:53:02,800
to, yeah. But they'll figure something out and probably the generation that is the first one

2115
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:07,520
that doesn't have to die. That's the kind of thing. But when you really face the fact that

2116
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:13,680
you're going to die, and then when I start to look at it from this point of view that, well,

2117
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:19,280
this thing was an interface to begin with. So what I'm really, is what I'm really going to be doing,

2118
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:24,080
just taking off a headset. So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day.

2119
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:30,160
And I got lost in the game when I was fighting over a Porsche. And I shot some guys up and I

2120
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:35,200
punctured their tires and I got the Porsche. Now I take the headset off. And what was that for?

2121
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:40,880
Nothing. It was just, it was a data structure and the data structure is gone. So all of the wars,

2122
02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:46,720
the fighting and the reputations and all this stuff, you know, where it's just a headset.

2123
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:58,880
So now, and so my theory says that intellectually, my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.

2124
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:02,880
This is like, you know, and so I have to meditate. I meditate a lot.

2125
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:10,960
Well, what percent of the day would you say you spend as a physicalist sort of living life,

2126
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:19,600
pretending your car matters, your reputation matters? Like, how much was that Tom Waits song?

2127
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:25,680
I like my town with a little drop of poison. How much poison do you allow yourself to have?

2128
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:31,280
I think my default mode is physicalist. I think that that's just the default. I, when I'm not

2129
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,760
being conscious, consciously attentive.

2130
02:54:36,480 --> 02:54:42,080
Then intellectually conscious, because if you're just, you're still, if you're tasting coffee and

2131
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:46,640
not thinking or drinking or just taking it in the sunset, you're not being intellectual,

2132
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:53,520
but you're still experiencing it. So it's when you turn on the like the introspective machine,

2133
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:58,800
that's when you can start and turn off the thinker. When I actually just start looking

2134
02:54:58,800 --> 02:55:05,600
without thinking. So that's when I feel like I, all of a sudden, I'm starting to see through.

2135
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:14,400
I'm sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface is all the stories I'm telling

2136
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:18,560
about it. It's really important for me to get that really important to do that. So I'm telling all

2137
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:24,320
these stories and so I'm all wrapped up. Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head

2138
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:35,600
is about attachment to the interface. And so what I found is that the essentially the only way to

2139
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:45,360
really detach from the interface is to literally let go of thoughts altogether. And then all of a

2140
02:55:45,360 --> 02:55:52,560
sudden, even my identity, you know, my whole history, my name, my education, all this stuff

2141
02:55:53,120 --> 02:56:02,160
is almost irrelevant because it's just now here is the present moment. And this is this is the

2142
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:08,880
reality right now. And all of that other stuff is an interface story. But this conscious experience

2143
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:14,880
right now, this is the only, this is the only reality as far as I can tell, the rest of it's a

2144
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:22,480
story. And, but that is, again, not my default, that is, I have to make a really

2145
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:29,600
conscious choice to say, okay, I know intellectually this is all an interface.

2146
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:36,640
I'm going to take the headset off and so forth. And then immediately sink back into the game and

2147
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:42,080
just be out there playing the game and get lost. And so I'm always lost in the game unless I

2148
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:50,880
literally consciously choose to stop thinking. Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge that

2149
02:56:53,520 --> 02:57:00,880
to look beyond the game? Isn't it scares the hell out of me? It's really a scary

2150
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,440
because I'm so attached. I'm attached to this body. I'm attached to the interface.

2151
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:11,920
Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit? Meaning like, it's,

2152
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:18,640
I mean, some of these ideas, when you think about reality, even with like Einstein,

2153
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:27,680
just realizing you said interface, just realizing that light, you know, that there's a speed of

2154
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:32,160
light and you can't go faster than the speed of light and like what kind of things black holes and

2155
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:39,840
can do with light, even that can mess with your head. Yes. But that's still space time.

2156
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:44,560
That's a big mess, but it's still just space time. It's still a property of our interface.

2157
02:57:44,560 --> 02:57:51,360
That's right. But it's still like even, even Einstein realized that this particular thing,

2158
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:58,080
some of the stories you tell ourselves is constructing interfaces that are oversimplifying

2159
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:04,320
the way things work because it's nice. The stories are nice. Stories are nice.

2160
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:06,800
That's what I mean. It's just like video games. They're nice.

2161
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:12,560
Right. But Einstein was a realist, right? He was a famous realist in the sense that he

2162
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:18,400
was very explicit in a 1935 paper with Podolski and Rosen, the EPR paper where he,

2163
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:27,680
they said, if without in any way disturbing a system, I can predict with probability one,

2164
02:58:28,480 --> 02:58:34,720
the outcome of a measurement, then there exists in reality that element,

2165
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:40,640
right? That value, that, and we now know from quantum theory that that's false.

2166
02:58:41,840 --> 02:58:46,320
That Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.

2167
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:52,800
Yeah. And so we can predict, we can set up, in quantum theory, you can set up,

2168
02:58:52,880 --> 02:58:58,560
and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism, where he, he scouts this out,

2169
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:01,360
it was done by the people, but he gives a good presentation of this,

2170
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:04,640
where they have a sequence of like something like nine different quantum measurements

2171
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:09,840
that you can make. And you can predict with probability one, what a particular outcome

2172
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:17,840
will be, but you can actually prove that it's impossible that the value existed before you

2173
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:20,640
made the measurement. So you know with probability one, what you're going to get,

2174
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:25,760
which you also know with certainty that that value was not there until you made the measurement.

2175
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:31,360
So the, so we know from quantum theory that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

2176
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:37,120
And that is built in to what I'm saying with this theory of consciousness.

2177
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:42,320
If consciousness is fundamental, space time itself is an act of fact creation. It's,

2178
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:46,480
it's an interface that we create, consciousness creates, plus all the objects in it. So local

2179
02:59:46,480 --> 02:59:53,360
realism is not true. Quantum theory is established that also non-contextual realism

2180
02:59:53,360 --> 02:59:58,400
is not true. And that, that fits in perfectly with this idea that consciousness is fundamental.

2181
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:02,480
These things are, these exist as data structures when we create them.

2182
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:08,640
As, as, as Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

2183
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:17,440
But I must say on a personal level, I'm having to spend, I spend a couple hours a day

2184
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:25,840
just sitting in meditation on this and facing the rebellion

2185
03:00:26,960 --> 03:00:30,320
in me that goes to the core, it feels like it goes to the core of my being,

2186
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:34,240
rebellion against these ideas. So, so here it's very, very interesting for me to look at this

2187
03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:38,400
because so here I'm a, I'm a scientist and I'm a person. The science is really clear.

2188
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:43,680
Local realism is false. Non-contextual realism is false. Spacetime is doomed. It's, it's very,

2189
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:50,720
very clear. It couldn't be clearer. And my, my emotions rebel left and right. When I sit there

2190
03:00:50,720 --> 03:00:57,600
and say, okay, I am not something in space and time. Something inside of me says, you're crazy.

2191
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:01,760
Of course you are. And I'm completely attached to it. I'm completely attached to all this stuff.

2192
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:05,840
I'm attached to my body. I'm attached to the headset. I'm attached to my car.

2193
03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:12,720
Attached to people. I'm attached to all of it. And, and yet I know as a absolute fact,

2194
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:20,640
I'm going to walk away from all of it. I'm going to die. It'll, you know, in fact, I almost died

2195
03:01:20,640 --> 03:01:28,160
last year. COVID almost killed me. I, I sent a goodbye text to my wife. So I was, I thought I

2196
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:34,880
was, I sent her a goodbye. I thought I was in the emergency room and it attacked my heart

2197
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:41,680
and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours. I, I couldn't last much longer. I knew

2198
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:48,880
I, they couldn't stop it. So that was, that was it. So that was it. So, so I texted her goodbye

2199
03:01:48,880 --> 03:01:54,960
from the emergency room. I love you. Goodbye kind of thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that was it.

2200
03:01:54,960 --> 03:02:00,240
So, so were you afraid? God, it scares the hell out of you, right? But there, there is,

2201
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:04,160
there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway, that, that all, you know, you,

2202
03:02:04,160 --> 03:02:07,680
that, that sort of, you're scared, but you're just feeling so bad that in some sense,

2203
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:16,240
you just want to stop anyway. So, so I've, I've, I've been there and faced it just, just a year ago.

2204
03:02:16,880 --> 03:02:22,240
How did that change you by the way? Having, having this intellectual reality that's so

2205
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:26,080
challenging that you meditate on a year, it's just an interface. And one of the,

2206
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:32,640
one of the hardest things to come to terms with is that, that means that, you know, it's going to end.

2207
03:02:35,440 --> 03:02:38,800
How did I change you having come, come so close to the reality of it? It's not just an

2208
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:45,920
intellectual reality. It's, it's a reality of death. It's, it's forced. I've, I've meditated for

2209
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:50,160
20 years now. And then I would say averaging three or four hours a day.

2210
03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:59,920
But it's put a new urgency, but urgency is not the right word because that, that

2211
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:07,120
it's, it's riveted my attention. I'll put it that way. It's really riveted my attention. And

2212
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:13,600
I've really paid, I spent a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say.

2213
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:20,480
I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with the, you know, take it all with a green

2214
03:03:20,480 --> 03:03:25,840
assault. But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me to ignore it. So I try to listen

2215
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:33,600
to the best ideas and, and to sort out nonsense from, and it's just, we all have to do it for

2216
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:39,200
ourselves, right? It's not easy. So what makes sense? And I have the advantage of some science,

2217
03:03:39,200 --> 03:03:42,960
so I can look at what science says and try to compare with spiritual tradition.

2218
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:48,880
I try to sort it out for myself. And, but then I also look and realize that there's another

2219
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:54,960
aspect to me, which is this whole emotional aspect. The, I seem to be wired up

2220
03:03:56,880 --> 03:04:03,280
as evolutionary psychology says, I'm wired up, right? All these defensive mechanisms. So, you

2221
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:10,880
I'm, I'm inclined to lie if I need to, I'm inclined to, to be angry, to protect myself,

2222
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:17,600
to have an in group and an out group, to try to, you know, make my reputation as big as possible,

2223
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:22,000
to try to demean the out group. There's all these things that evolutionary psychology

2224
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:27,440
is spot on. It's really brilliant about the human condition. And yet I think evolution,

2225
03:04:28,240 --> 03:04:32,720
as I said, evolutionary theory is a projection of a deeper theory where there may be no

2226
03:04:32,720 --> 03:04:41,040
competition. So how, so I'm in this very interesting position where I feel like, okay,

2227
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:45,440
according to my own theory, I'm consciousness. And maybe this is what it means for consciousness

2228
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:53,200
to wake up. It's not easy. It's, it's, it's almost like I have, I feel like I have real

2229
03:04:53,200 --> 03:05:00,080
skin in the game. It really is scary. I really was scared when I was about to die. It really was

2230
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:04,800
hard to say goodbye to my wife. It really, it really pained. And

2231
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:11,440
to then look at that, and then look at the fact that I'm going to walk away from this anyway,

2232
03:05:11,440 --> 03:05:16,880
and it's just an interface. How do I, so it's, it's trying to put all this stuff together and really

2233
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:22,560
grok it, so to speak, not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.

2234
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:28,480
Yeah. What are you afraid of? You silly evolved organism that's gotten way too attached to the

2235
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:35,760
interface. What are you really afraid of? That's right. Is there a very personal, you know, it's

2236
03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:42,720
very, very personal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, speaking of the text, what do you think is this whole love

2237
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:50,960
thing? What's the role of love in our human condition? This interface thing we have this,

2238
03:05:50,960 --> 03:05:55,760
is this somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness, this attachment we have to other

2239
03:05:55,760 --> 03:06:06,400
humans, and this deep, like some quality to it that seems very interesting, peculiar.

2240
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:13,120
Well, there are two levels I would think about that. There's love in the sexual sense, and there's

2241
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:19,520
love in a deeper sense. And in the sexual sense, we can give an evolutionary account of that and

2242
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:28,240
so forth. And I think that's pretty clear to people. In this deeper sense, right? So, of course,

2243
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:33,920
I married your, I love my wife in a sexual sense, but there was a deeper sense as well.

2244
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:38,080
When I was saying goodbye to her, there was a deeper, much deeper love that was really at play

2245
03:06:38,080 --> 03:06:43,600
there. That's one place where I think that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions has something

2246
03:06:43,600 --> 03:06:47,920
right. When they say, you know, love your neighbor as yourself, that some, in some sense, love is

2247
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:55,040
fundamental. I think that they're onto something, something very, very deep and profound. And

2248
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:59,680
every once in a while, I can get a personal glimpse of that, especially when I'm in the

2249
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:10,160
space with no thought. Like when I can really let go of thoughts, I get little glimpses of a love

2250
03:07:10,160 --> 03:07:16,560
in the sense that I'm not separate. It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that. I,

2251
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:22,080
you know, yeah, if you and I are separate, then there's, I can fight you. But if you and I are

2252
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:31,280
the same, if there's a union there, the togetherness of it, yeah. What, who's God? All those gods,

2253
03:07:31,280 --> 03:07:35,760
the stories that have been told throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions,

2254
03:07:36,560 --> 03:07:42,800
what do you think that is? Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?

2255
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:53,200
Oh, well, in many traditions, not all. The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister,

2256
03:07:54,720 --> 03:08:04,480
we tend to think of God as a being. But I think that that's not right. I think the closest way

2257
03:08:04,480 --> 03:08:12,240
to think about God is being, period, not a being, but being the very ground of being itself is God.

2258
03:08:12,320 --> 03:08:18,000
I think that's the deep, and from my point of view, that's the ground of consciousness. So the

2259
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:25,200
ground of conscious being is what we might call God. But the word God has always been, you know,

2260
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:29,920
for example, you don't believe the same God as my God, so I'm going to fight you. We'll have wars

2261
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:35,520
over, because the being, the specific being that you call God is different from the being that I

2262
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:42,800
call God, and so we fight. Whereas if it's not a being, but just being, and you and I share being,

2263
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:48,240
then you and I are not separate, and there's no reason to fight. We're both part of that one

2264
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:54,800
being, and loving you is loving myself, because we're all part of that one being. The spiritual

2265
03:08:54,800 --> 03:09:02,080
traditions that point to that, I think are pointing in a very interesting direction, and that does seem

2266
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:07,280
to match with the mathematics of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on as well,

2267
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:11,040
that it really fits with that, although that wasn't my goal.

2268
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:20,800
Is there, you mentioned, you mentioned that the young physicist that you talk to or whose work

2269
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:27,040
you follow have quite a lot of fun breaking with the traditions of the past, the assumptions of

2270
03:09:27,040 --> 03:09:33,360
the past. What advice would you give to young people today in high school, in college, not just

2271
03:09:33,360 --> 03:09:39,840
physicists, but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of, how they can have a life

2272
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:45,280
they can be proud of, how to make their way in the world from the lessons, from the wins and

2273
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:52,320
the losses in your own life. What little insights could you pull out? I would say the universe is

2274
03:09:52,320 --> 03:09:58,880
a lot more interesting than you might expect, and you are a lot more special and interesting

2275
03:09:58,880 --> 03:10:06,800
than you might expect. You might think that you're just a little tiny, irrelevant 100-pound,

2276
03:10:06,800 --> 03:10:14,960
200-pound person in a vast billions of light years across space, and that's not the case.

2277
03:10:16,080 --> 03:10:20,640
You are, in some sense, the being that's creating that space all the time, every time you look.

2278
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:29,200
So, waking up to who you really are outside of space and time, as the author of space and time,

2279
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:36,800
is the author of everything that you see. The author of space and time, you're the author of

2280
03:10:36,800 --> 03:10:41,680
space and time, and I'm the author of space and time. Space and time is just one little data

2281
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:47,120
structure. Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures. They're authors of various

2282
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:53,680
other things. So, realizing, and then realizing that I had this feeling that growing up and going

2283
03:10:53,680 --> 03:11:00,480
and reading all these textbooks, oh man, it's all been done. If I'd just been there 50 years ago,

2284
03:11:00,480 --> 03:11:05,760
I could have discovered this stuff, but it's all in the textbooks now. Well, believe me,

2285
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:10,560
the textbooks are going to look silly in 50 years, and it's your chance to write the new

2286
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:16,080
textbook. So, of course, study the current textbooks. You have to understand them. There's

2287
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:24,400
no way to progress until you understand what's been done. But then, the only limit is your

2288
03:11:24,400 --> 03:11:29,840
imagination, frankly. That's the only limit. The greatest books, the greatest textbooks ever written

2289
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:36,720
on earth are yet to be written. Exactly. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2290
03:11:36,720 --> 03:11:43,280
What's the meaning of life from your limited interface? Can you figure it all out? Why?

2291
03:11:43,280 --> 03:11:49,200
So, you said the universe is trying to figure itself out through us. Why?

2292
03:11:53,840 --> 03:12:02,000
Yeah, that's the closest I've come. So, I'll give you. So, I will say that I don't know, but here's

2293
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:06,160
my guess, right? That's a good first sentence. That's a good starting point. And maybe that's

2294
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:11,120
going to be a profound part of the final answer is to start with the I don't know. It's quite

2295
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:17,120
possible that that's really important to start with the I don't know. My guess is that if consciousness

2296
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:24,160
is fundamental and if girdle, girdle's incompleteness theorem holds here, and there's infinite variety

2297
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:37,120
of structures for consciousness to some sense explore, that maybe that's what it's about.

2298
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:40,160
This is something that Onika and I talked about a little bit, and she doesn't like this way of

2299
03:12:40,160 --> 03:12:43,760
talking about it. And so, I'm going to have to talk with her some more about this way of talking.

2300
03:12:43,760 --> 03:12:47,040
But right now, I'll just put it this way, and I'll have to talk with her more and see if I

2301
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:51,680
can say it more clearly. But the way I'm talking about it now is that

2302
03:12:55,600 --> 03:13:04,240
there's a sense in which there's being, and then there's experiences or forms that come out of

2303
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:13,760
being. That's one deep, deep mystery. And the question that you asked, what's it all about?

2304
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:19,600
Somehow it's related to that. Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms?

2305
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:26,640
Why does it, why do we have experiences? Why should, why not just have, when you close your eyes

2306
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:30,640
and pay attention to what's behind you, there's nothing. But there's being.

2307
03:13:31,440 --> 03:13:39,280
Why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there? Why did we create all tables and chairs

2308
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:48,240
on the sun and moon and people, all this really complicated stuff? Why? And all I can guess right

2309
03:13:48,240 --> 03:13:53,360
now, and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years and say that was dumb, but all I can

2310
03:13:53,360 --> 03:13:58,800
guess right now is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself by knowing what it's not.

2311
03:13:59,760 --> 03:14:06,560
So here I am, I'm not this body. And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face when I

2312
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:13,360
sent a text goodbye. But then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like, okay, I sort of don't want to

2313
03:14:13,360 --> 03:14:20,240
go there, right? Okay, so I just, so I am my body. I go back to the standard thing, I am my body,

2314
03:14:20,240 --> 03:14:25,920
and then I want to get that car. And even though I was just about to die a year ago, so that comes

2315
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:38,000
rushing back. So, so consciousness immerses itself fully into a particular headset, gets lost in it,

2316
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:43,600
and then slowly wakes up. Just so it can escape and that is the waking up, but it needs to have

2317
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:48,720
a negative. It needs to know what it's not. It needs to know what you are. You have to say,

2318
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:51,840
oh, I'm not that, I'm not that, that wasn't important, that wasn't important.

2319
03:14:52,000 --> 03:15:00,480
That's really powerful done. Let me just say that, because I've been a long-term fan of yours,

2320
03:15:00,480 --> 03:15:05,600
and we're supposed to have a conversation doing this very difficult moment in your life. Let me

2321
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:10,240
just say you're a truly special person. And I for one, I know there's a lot, a lot of others,

2322
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:15,440
they agree. I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth, if for a short time.

2323
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:25,600
So, whatever, whatever the universe, whatever plan it has for you that brought you close to

2324
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:33,920
death, to maybe enlighten you some kind of way, I think, I think has an interesting plan for you.

2325
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:38,000
You're one of the truly special humans, and it's a huge honor that you would sit and talk with me

2326
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:41,680
today. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lex. I really appreciate that. Thank you.

2327
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:46,720
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Donald Hoffman. To support this podcast,

2328
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:51,600
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from

2329
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:59,440
Albert Einstein, relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation. Time and space are modes by

2330
03:15:59,440 --> 03:16:06,320
which we think, and not conditions in which we live. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you

2331
03:16:06,320 --> 03:16:15,920
next time.
