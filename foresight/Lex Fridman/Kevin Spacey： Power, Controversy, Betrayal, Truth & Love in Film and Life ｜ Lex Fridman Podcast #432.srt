00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar-winning actor who

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,360
has starred in seven The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, and House of Cards.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,140
He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting performances of characters who often

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,920
embody the dark side of human nature.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,960
Seven years ago, he was cut from House of Cards and canceled by Hollywood in the world when

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,520
Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually abused him in 1986.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,920
Anthony Rapp then filed a civil lawsuit seeking $40 million.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,280
In this trial, and all civil and criminal trials that followed, Kevin was acquitted.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,280
He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,920
In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,320
I also encourage you to listen to Kevin's Dan Wooten and Allison Pearson interviews

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,360
for additional details and responses to the allegations.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,320
As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,520
is that I will talk with everyone, with empathy and with backbone.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,040
For each guest, I hope to explore their life's work, life's story, and what and how they

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,160
think, and do so honestly and fully, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance, and

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,840
the flaws.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,160
I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to a worse possible caricature

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,200
of their sins either.

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,480
The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too often does, often rushing to a final

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,120
judgment before the facts are in.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,560
I will try to do better than that, to respect due process, in service of the truth.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,320
And I hope to have the courage to always think independently and to speak honestly, from

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,360
the heart, even when the eyes of the outraged mob are on me.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Again, my goal is to understand human beings, at their best and at their worst.

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,280
And hope is such an understanding leads to more compassion and wisdom in the world.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,400
I will make mistakes, and when I do, I will work hard to improve.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,840
I love you all.

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
And now, dear friends, here's Kevin Spacey.

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
You played a serial killer in the movie Seven.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Your performance was one of, if not the greatest portrayal of a murderer on screen ever.

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,560
What was your process of becoming him?

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,080
John Doe, the serial killer.

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,960
The truth is, I didn't get the part.

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,600
I had been in Los Angeles making a couple of films, Swimming of Sharks and Usual Suspects.

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,160
And then I did a film called Outbreak that Morgan Freeman was in.

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:29,800
And I went in to audition for David Fincher in probably late November of 94.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,080
And I auditioned for this part and didn't get it.

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
And I went back to New York.

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,960
And I think they started shooting like December 12th.

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
And I'm in New York.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm back in my wonderful apartment on West 12th Street, and my mom has come to visit

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
for Christmas.

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,440
And it's December 23rd.

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,040
And it's like seven o'clock at night, and my phone rings.

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,880
And it's Arnold Copelson, who's the producer of Seven.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,840
And he's very jovial, and he's very friendly, and he says, how are you doing?

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
And I said, fine.

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,520
And he said, listen, do you remember that film you came in for, Seven?

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,040
And I said, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,280
He goes, well, it turns out that we hired an actor and we started shooting.

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,440
And then yesterday, David fired him.

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,360
And David would like you to get on a plane on Sunday and come to Los Angeles and start

56
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
shooting on Tuesday.

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,520
And I was like, OK, would it be imposing to say, can I read it again?

58
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,640
Because it's been a while now, and I'd like to.

59
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,040
So they sent a script over.

60
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
I read the script that night.

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,680
I thought about it.

62
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,040
And I had this feeling.

63
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:09,840
I can't even quite describe it, but I had this feeling that it would be really good

64
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,480
if I didn't take billing in the film.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,560
And the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the time this film would come out,

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,360
it would be the last one of the three movies that I just shot, the fourth one.

67
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,880
And if any of those films broke through or did well, if it was going to be Brad Pitt

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,280
and Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, and you don't show up for the first

69
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,560
25, 30, 40 minutes, people are going to figure out who you're playing.

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,600
So people should know that you play the serial killer in the movie and the serial killer

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
shows up more than halfway through the movie.

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Very late in the movie.

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,320
And when you say billing, it's like the posters, the VHS cover and everything.

74
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
You're gone.

75
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
You're not there.

76
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Not there.

77
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,480
The Green Line Cinema told me to go fuck myself, that they absolutely could use my picture

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,400
and my image and all that.

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,120
And this became a little bit of a, I'd say, 24-hour conversation.

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,840
And it was Fincher who said, I actually think this is a really cool idea.

81
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:24,840
So the compromise was, I'm the first credit at the end of the movie when the credits start.

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,800
So I got on a plane on that Sunday and I flew to Los Angeles and I went into where they

83
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,320
were shooting and I went into the makeup room and David Fincher was there and we were talking

84
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:44,360
about what should I do, how should I look and I just had my hair short for outbreak

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,520
because I was playing a military character and I just looked at the hairdresser and I

86
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,160
said, do you have a razor?

87
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,800
And Fincher went, are you kidding?

88
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,200
And I said, no.

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,440
He goes, if you shave your head, I'll shave mine.

90
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,160
So we both shaved our heads.

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,440
And then I started shooting the next day.

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,600
So my long-winded answer to your question is that I didn't have that much time to think

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,120
about how to build that character.

94
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:33,120
What I think in the end Fincher was able to do so brilliantly with such terror was to set

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,760
the audience up to meet this character.

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,400
I think the last scene, the ending scene and the car ride leading up to it where it's mostly

97
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,800
on you in conversation with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is one of the greatest scenes

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,680
in film history.

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
So people somehow didn't see the movie.

100
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,120
There's these five murders that happen that are inspired by five of the seven deadly sins

101
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,960
and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins.

102
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:16,200
And there's this calm subtlety about you and your performance is just terrifying.

103
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but in the contrast

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,280
is the terrifying sense that you get in the audience that builds up to the twist at the

105
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,720
end or the surprise at the end with the famous What's in the Box from Brad Pitt.

106
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,240
Brad Pitt's character's wife, her head.

107
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Yeah.

108
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,880
I can really only tell you that while we were shooting that scene in the car, while we were

109
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,640
out in the desert in that place where all those electrical wires were, David just kept

110
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,520
saying less, do less.

111
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:10,240
And I just tried to, I mean, I remember he kept saying to me, remember, you're in control.

112
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,800
Like you're going to win.

113
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,040
And knowing that should allow you to have tremendous confidence.

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:30,760
And I just followed that lead and I just think it's the kind of film that so many of

115
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,320
the elements that had been at work from the beginning of the movie, in terms of its style,

116
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,680
in terms of how he built this terror, in terms of how he built for the audience a sense of

117
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,360
this person being one of the scariest people they might ever encounter, it really allowed

118
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:58,760
me to be able to not have to do that much, just say the words and mean them.

119
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:13,000
And I think it also is, it's an example of what makes tragedy so difficult.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,960
I mean, very often tragedy is people operating without enough information.

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,000
They don't have all the facts, Romeo and Juliet.

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They don't have all the facts.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,520
They don't know what we know as an audience.

124
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:40,200
So in the end, whether Brad Pitt's character ends up shooting John Doe or turning the gun

125
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,400
on himself, which was a discussion, I mean, there were a number of alternative endings

126
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,360
that were discussed.

127
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,960
Nothing ends up being tied up in a nice little bow.

128
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:03,840
It is complicated and shows how nobody wins in the end when you're not operating with

129
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
all the information.

130
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:16,200
When you say, say the words and mean them, what does mean them mean?

131
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:25,840
I've been very fortunate to be directed by Fincher a couple of times and he would say

132
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,440
to me sometimes, I don't believe a thing that is coming out of your mouth.

133
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,320
Shall we try it again?

134
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,040
And you go, okay, yeah, we can try it again.

135
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:54,520
And sometimes he'll do take and then you'll look to see if he has any added genius to hand

136
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
you.

137
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,760
And he just goes, let's do it again and then let's do it again.

138
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,960
And sometimes I say this in all humility.

139
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,120
He's literally trying to beat the acting out of you.

140
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,920
And by continually saying, do it again, do it again, do it again, and not giving you

141
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:26,120
any specifics, he is systematically shredding you of all pretense of all, because look,

142
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,120
very often, you know, actors would come in on the set and we've thought about the scene

143
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,480
and we've worked out, you know, I've got this prop and I'm gonna do this thing with a can

144
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,800
and you know, all these things, all the tea, I'm gonna do a thing with that thing.

145
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,680
And David is the kind of director where he just wants you to stop adding all that crap

146
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,880
and just say the words and say them quickly and mean them.

147
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
And it takes a while to get to that place.

148
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,200
I'll tell you a story.

149
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,120
This is a story I just love because it's in the exactly the same wheelhouse.

150
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,800
So Jack Lemmon's first movie was a film called It Should Happen to You and it was directed

151
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,040
by George Kuecher.

152
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,120
And Jack tells the story and it was just an incredibly charming story to hear Jack tell.

153
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,760
He said, so I'm doing his picture and let me tell you, this is a terrific part for me

154
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
and I'm doing a scene.

155
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
It's on my first day.

156
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,080
It's in my first day and it's a terrific scene.

157
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,320
And he goes, we do the first take and George Kuecher comes up to me and he says, Jack,

158
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,120
I said, yeah, he said, could you do, let's do another one, but just do a little less

159
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
in this one.

160
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,040
And Jack said, a little less, a little less than what I just did.

161
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
He said, yeah, just a little less.

162
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
So he goes, we do another take and I think, boy, that was it.

163
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,400
I mean, let's just go home.

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,360
And Kuecher walked up to him and said, Jack, let's do another one.

165
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,000
This time just a little bit less.

166
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,280
And Jack said, less than what I just did now.

167
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,520
He said, yeah, just a little bit less.

168
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
He goes, oh, okay.

169
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,240
So he did another take and Kuecher came up and he said, Jack, just a little bit less.

170
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,200
And Jack said, a little less than what I just did.

171
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
He said, yes.

172
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
He said, well, if I do any less, I'm not going to be acting.

173
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,080
And Kuecher said, exactly, Jack, exactly.

174
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,520
I mean, I guess what you're saying is it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom

175
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:19,240
of a little less because the power, if we just stick even on seven of your

176
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,920
performance is in the tiniest of subtleties.

177
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,000
Like when you say, oh, you didn't know, and you turn your head a little bit and

178
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,280
a little bit like the little bit, maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face.

179
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,240
That's subtlety.

180
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,280
That's less.

181
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,840
That's hard to get to, I suppose.

182
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,360
Yeah.

183
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,560
And also because I so well remember, I think the work that Brad did and also

184
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Morgan did in that scene, but the work that Brad had to do, where he had to go.

185
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,480
I remember rehearsing with him as we were all staying at this little hotel

186
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,600
nearby that location.

187
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,440
And we rehearsed the night before we started shooting that sequence.

188
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:09,360
And I just, I mean, it was just incredible to see the levels of emotions he had to go

189
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,800
through and then the decision of what do I do?

190
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Because if I do what he wants me to do, then he wins.

191
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,160
But if I don't do it, then I'm, what kind of a man, husband am I?

192
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,840
I just thought he did really incredible work.

193
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:33,120
So it was also not easy to not react to the power of what he was throwing at me.

194
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,200
I just thought it was an extraordinary, a really extraordinary scene.

195
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,040
So what's it like being in that scene?

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,440
So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is going over the top, just having

197
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,800
a mental breakdown and is weighing these extremely difficult moral choices, as you're

198
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:01,480
saying, but he's like screaming and in pain and tormented while you're very subtly smiling.

199
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,680
In terms of the writing and in terms of what the characters had to do is it was an

200
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:15,520
incredible culmination of how this character could manipulate in the way that he did.

201
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,840
And, and in the end, succeed.

202
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,280
You mentioned Fincher likes to do a lot of takes.

203
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,720
That's the, the famous thing about David Fincher.

204
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,960
So what are the pros and cons of that?

205
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,400
I think I read that he does some crazy amount.

206
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,600
He averages 25 to 65 takes and most directors do less than 10.

207
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,080
So.

208
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah, sometimes it's timing.

209
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,040
Sometimes it's literally, he has a stopwatch and he's, he's timing it.

210
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,280
He's timing how long a scene is taking.

211
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,320
And then he'll say, you need to take a minute off this scene.

212
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
Like a minute, yeah, a minute off this scene.

213
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,920
I want it to move like this.

214
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,360
So let's pick it up.

215
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
Let's pick up the pace.

216
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,320
Let's take, let's see if we can take a minute off.

217
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,640
Why the speed?

218
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,600
Why, why say it fast is the important thing for him, you think?

219
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,960
I think because Fincher hates indulgence.

220
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,240
And he wants, he wants people to talk the way they do in life, which is, you know, we

221
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,560
don't take big dramatic pauses, you know, before we speak, we speak, we say what we want.

222
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,200
We, you know.

223
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,840
And I guess actors like the dramatic pauses and the, the, the indulge in the dramatic

224
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:40,880
pauses.

225
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,520
They didn't always like the dramatic pauses.

226
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,800
I mean, look, you didn't want to, you go back any student of acting, you go back to

227
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,320
the 30s and the 40s, 50s.

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,920
The speed at which actors spoke, not just in the comedies, which of course, you know,

229
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,520
you look at any Preston Sturges movie and it's incredible how fast people are talking

230
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,440
and how, and how funny things are when they happen that fast.

231
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,360
But then, you know, acting styles changed.

232
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:19,160
We got into a different kind of thing in the late fifties and sixties and, and, you know,

233
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,240
a lot of actors are feeling it, which is, I'm not saying it's, it's a, it's a bad thing.

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:34,360
It's just that if you want to keep an audience engaged as Fincher does, and I believe

235
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:47,520
successfully does in all of his work, pace, timing, movement, clarity, speed are admirable

236
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,840
to achieve.

237
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,920
And all of that, he wants the actor to be as natural as possible, to strip away all

238
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,920
the bullshit of acting and become human.

239
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,200
Look, I've been lucky with other directors.

240
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Sam Mendes is similar.

241
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
I remember when I walked in to maybe the first rehearsal for Richard, the third that

242
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,240
we were doing, I had brought with me a canopy of, of ailments that my Richard was

243
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,640
going to suffer from, and Sam, you know, eventually whittled it down to like three,

244
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,120
like maybe your arm and maybe thing, and maybe your leg.

245
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,480
But let's get rid of the other 10 things that you brought into the room because I was,

246
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,880
you know, I was so excited to, you know, capture this character.

247
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,480
So, you know, very often, Trevor, known as this way, a lot, a lot of wonderful directors

248
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,120
I've worked with, they're really good at helping you trim and edit.

249
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,440
David Fincher said about you, he's talking in general, I think, but also specifically

250
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,760
in the moment of House of Cards said that you have exceptional skill both as an actor

251
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,480
and as a performer, which he says are different things.

252
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,920
So he defines the former as dramatization of a text and the latter as the

253
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
seduction of an audience.

254
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,320
Do you see wisdom in that distinction?

255
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,840
And what does it take to do both the dramatization of a text and the seduction of an audience?

256
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,160
Those are two very interesting descriptions.

257
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,080
When I think, I guess when I think performer, I tend to think entertaining.

258
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,040
I tend to think, I tend to think comedy.

259
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
I tend to think winning over an audience.

260
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:48,160
I tend to think that there's something about that quality of wanting to have people enjoy

261
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
themselves.

262
00:20:51,360 --> 00:21:01,000
And when you saddle that against what maybe he means as an actor, which is more dramatic

263
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:13,080
or more text driven, more, look, I've always believed that my job, not every actor feels

264
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,120
this way, but my job, the way that I've looked at it is that my job is to serve the writing.

265
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,520
And that if I serve the writing, I will in a sense serve myself because I'll be in the

266
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,280
right world, I'll be in the right context, I'll be in the right style.

267
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,080
I'll have embraced what a director's, you know, it's not my painting.

268
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,240
It's someone else's painting.

269
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm a series of colors and someone else's painting.

270
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:52,440
And the barometer for me has always been that when people stop me and talk to me about a

271
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:00,360
character I've played and reference their name as if they actually exist, that's when I feel

272
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,120
like I've gotten close to doing my job.

273
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation is remembering that your name is

274
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,360
Kevin, not Frank or John or any of these characters because they live deeply in the psyche.

275
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:26,680
To me, that's the greatest compliment for me as an actor.

276
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,840
I love being able to go.

277
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:39,960
I mean, when I think about performers who inspire me and I remember when I was young

278
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,040
and I was introduced to Spencer Tracey, Henry Fonda, Catherine Hepburn,

279
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,680
I just, I believed who they were.

280
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,720
I knew nothing about them.

281
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,600
They were just these extraordinary characters doing this extraordinary stuff.

282
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:04,600
And then I think more recently contemporary when I think of the work that Philip Seymour

283
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,960
Hoffman did and Heath Ledger and people that when I think about what they could be doing,

284
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,200
what they could do, what they would have done had they stayed with us.

285
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,480
I'm so excited when I go into a cinema or I go into a play and I completely am taken

286
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,840
to some place that I believe exists and characters that become real.

287
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,920
And those characters become lifelong companions.

288
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,800
Like for me, they travel with you and even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature,

289
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,520
they're always there.

290
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,720
I feel like I almost met them and gotten to know them and gotten to become friends with them almost,

291
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,280
Hannibal Lecter or Forrest Gump.

292
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,080
I mean, I feel like I'm like best friends with Forrest Gump.

293
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I know the guy and I guess he's played by some guy named Tom,

294
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,400
but like Forrest Gump is the guy I'm friends with.

295
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,760
And I think everybody feels like that when they're in the audience with great characters.

296
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,680
They just kind of, they become part of you in some way, the good, the bad and the ugly of them.

297
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:27,000
One of the things that I feel that I try to do in my work is when I read something for the first

298
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:37,160
time, when I read a script or play, and I am absolutely devastated by it.

299
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,800
It is, it is the most extraordinary, the most beautiful, the most life affirming or terrifying.

300
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:54,440
It's then a process weirdly of working backwards because I want to work in such a way that

301
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,720
that's the experience I give to the audience when they first see it,

302
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,200
that they have the experience I had when I read it.

303
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,520
I remember that there's been times in the creative process when

304
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,960
something was pointed out to me or something was, I remember I was doing a play

305
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:19,080
and I was having this really tough time with one of the last scenes in the play and I just

306
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,720
couldn't figure it out. I was in rehearsal and although we had a director in that play,

307
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I called another friend of mine who was also a director and I had him come over and I said,

308
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,920
look, this scene, I'm just having the toughest. I cannot seem to crack this scene.

309
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,680
We read it through a couple of times and then this wonderful director named John Swanbeck

310
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,640
who would eventually direct me in a film called The Big Kahuna.

311
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,920
But this is before that, he said to me the most incredible thing he just said,

312
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,000
all right, what's the last line you have in this scene before you fall over and fall asleep?

313
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,040
And I said, the last line is that last drink, the old KO. And he went, okay,

314
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,720
I want you to think about what that line actually means and then work backwards.

315
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,440
And so he left and I sort of was left with this, what? Like, what does that mean? How am I supposed

316
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,760
to? And then like a couple of days went by, a couple of days went by and I thought,

317
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,120
okay, so I said, what does that line actually mean? Well, that last drink, the old KO. KO

318
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:39,400
is knockout, which is a boxing term. It's the only boxing term the writer uses in the play.

319
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:48,440
And then I went back and I realized my friend was so smart and so incredible to have said,

320
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,480
ask a question you haven't thought of asking yet. I realized that the playwright wrote

321
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,840
the last round, the eighth round between these two brothers, and it was a fight, physical as

322
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,320
well as emotional. And when I brought that into the rehearsal room to the directors doing that play,

323
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,040
he liked that idea. And we staged that scene as if it was the eighth round, although the audience

324
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:18,600
wouldn't have known that. But just what I loved about that was that somebody said to me,

325
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,200
ask yourself a question you haven't asked yourself yet. What does that line mean and

326
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,640
then work backwards? What is that like a catalyst for thinking deeply about what is

327
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,360
magical about this play, this story, this narrative? That's what that is, like thinking

328
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,400
backwards, that's what that does? Yeah. But also because it's this incredible,

329
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,320
why didn't I think to ask that question myself? That's what you have directors for, that's what

330
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,960
you have. So many places where ideas can come from. But that just illustrates that even though in

331
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,880
my brain I go, I always like to work backwards. I missed it in that one and I'm very grateful to

332
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,640
to my friend for having pushed me into being able to realize what that meant and

333
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:16,120
to ask the interesting question. I like the poetry and the humility of I'm just a series

334
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:23,800
of collars in someone else's painting. That was a good line. That said, you've talked about

335
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,920
improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again and

336
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,080
yet never make it the same. And you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text.

337
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,520
So where's the room for the improvisation? That it's never the same? Well, there's two

338
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:50,520
slightly different contexts, I think. One is in the rehearsal room, improvisation can be a wonderful

339
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,880
device. I mean, Sam Mendes, for example, will start, he'll start a scene and he does this wonderful

340
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,000
thing. He brings rugs and he brings chairs and sofas in and he says, well, let's put two chairs

341
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,480
here and here. You guys, let's start in these chairs far apart from each other. Let's see what

342
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,720
happens with the scene if you're that far apart. And so we'll do the scene that way and then he

343
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,560
goes, okay, let's bring a rug in and let's bring these chairs much closer and let's see what happens

344
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:27,160
if the space between you is. And so then you try it that way. And then it's a little harder in

345
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:36,680
Shakespeare to improv. But in any situation where you want to try and see where could a scene go,

346
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,440
where would the scene go if I didn't make that choice? Where would the scene go if I made this

347
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,640
choice? Where would the scene go if I didn't say that or I said something else? So that's how improv

348
00:29:45,640 --> 00:30:01,320
can be a valuable process to learn about limits and boundaries and what's going on with a character

349
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:09,000
that somehow you discover in trying something that isn't on the page. Then there's the different

350
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,680
thing which is the trying to make it fresh and trying to make it new. And that is really a

351
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:27,080
reference to theater. I'll put it to you this way. Anybody loves sports, right? So you go and you

352
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:34,280
watch on a pitch, you watch on a tennis game, you watch basketball, you watch football. Yeah,

353
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,320
the rules are the same. But it's a different game every time you're out on that court or on that field.

354
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:54,600
It's no different in theater. Yes, it's the same lines. Maybe even blocking is similar. But what's

355
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:04,600
different is attack, intention, how you are growing in a role and watching your fellow actors grow in

356
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,960
theirs and how every night it's a new audience and they're reacting differently. And you literally,

357
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:23,640
where you can go from week one of performances in a play to week 12 is extraordinary. And the

358
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,480
difference between theater and film is that no matter how good someone might think you are in a

359
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:40,120
movie, you'll never be any better. It's frozen. Whereas I can be better tomorrow night than I

360
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:49,880
was tonight. I can be better in a week than I was tonight. It is a living, breathing, shifting,

361
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:58,040
changing, growing thing every single day. But also in theater, there's no safety net. If you fuck it up,

362
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,480
everybody gets to see you do that. And if you start giggling on stage, everyone gets to see you

363
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:12,680
do that too, which I am very guilty of. I mean, there is something of a seduction of an audience

364
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:20,040
in theater even more intense than there is when you're talking about film. I got a chance to watch

365
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,280
the documentary now in the wings on a world stage, which is behind the scenes of you mentioned

366
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,880
you teaming up with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage Richard III,

367
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,080
a play by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn

368
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,960
you haven't really done much Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie. But there's

369
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,760
a lot of interesting behind the scenes stuff there. First of all, the camaraderie of everybody,

370
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,640
how like the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling.

371
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,840
But the another interesting thing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes trying different

372
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,120
stuff. It seemed like everybody was really open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves,

373
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:12,280
taking risks, all that. I suppose that's part of acting in general, but theater especially.

374
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Just take risks. It's okay to embarrass a shit out of yourself, including the director.

375
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:25,480
And it's also because you become a family. It's unlike a movie where I might have a scene with

376
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,240
so and so on this day and then another scene with them in a week and a half,

377
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,040
and then that's the only scenes we have in the whole movie together. Every single day

378
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,680
when you show up in the rehearsal room, it's the whole company. You're all up for it every day.

379
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:49,480
You're learning, you're growing, you're trying, and there is an incredible trust that happens.

380
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,720
And I was of course fortunate that some of the things I learned and observed about

381
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,880
being a part of that family, being included in that family and being a part of creating that

382
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:08,360
family, I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon who led many companies that I was

383
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:15,400
fortunate to work in and be a part of. There's also a sad moment where at the end,

384
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,280
everybody is really sad to say goodbye because you do form a family and then it's over.

385
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,000
I guess somebody said that that's just part of theater. It's like,

386
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,080
I mean, they should kind of assume goodbye and that this is it.

387
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, and also there are sometimes when like six months later, I'll wake up

388
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,160
middle of the night and I'll go, that's how to play that scene.

389
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,280
Oh God, I just finally figured it out.

390
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,040
So maybe you could speak a little bit more to that. What's the difference between film acting and

391
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,400
live theater acting? I don't really think there is any. I think there's just,

392
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,320
you eventually learn about yourself on film, you know, when I first did like my first

393
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,840
episode of The Equalizer, you know, it's just horrible. It's just so bad,

394
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,160
but I didn't know about myself. I didn't slowly begin to learn about yourself, but

395
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,960
I think good acting is good acting. And I think that, you know, if a camera's right here, you

396
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,200
know that your front row is also your back row. You just don't have to do so much.

397
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:39,000
There is in theater a particular kind of energy, almost like an athlete,

398
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,960
that you have to have vocally to be able to get up seven performances a week and never lose your

399
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,480
voice and always be there and always be alive and always be doing the best work you can,

400
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,880
that you just don't require in film. You know, you don't have to have the same,

401
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:03,640
it just doesn't require the same kind of stamina that doing a play does.

402
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,640
It just feels like also in theater, you have to become the character more intensely because

403
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,440
you can't take a break. You can't take a bathroom break. You're like on stage.

404
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,400
There's no, this is you. Yeah, but you have no idea what's going on on stage with the actors.

405
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,440
I mean, I have literally laughed through speeches that I had to give because

406
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,400
my fellow actors were putting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever

407
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,960
they were doing to make me laugh. So they're just having fun. They're having the time of their life.

408
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,640
And by the way, Judy Dench is the worst giggler of all. I mean, they had to bring the curtain down

409
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,160
on her and Maggie Smith because they were laughing so hard, they could not continue the play.

410
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,760
So even when you're doing like a dramatic monologue still, they're still fucking with you.

411
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,920
There's stuff. Okay, that's great. That's good to know. You also said an interesting line that

412
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:09,560
improvisation helps you learn about the character. Can you explain that? So like through maybe playing

413
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,480
with the different ways of saying the words or the different ways to bring the words to life,

414
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,640
you get to learn about yourself, about the character you're playing.

415
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:29,320
It can be helpful. But improv is, I'm such a big believer in the writing and in serving the writing

416
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:36,280
and doing the words the writer wrote. That improv for me, unless you're just doing like

417
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,600
comedy and you know, like, I mean, I love improv and in comedy, it's brilliant. So much fun to

418
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,760
watch people just come up with something right there. But that's where you're looking for laughs

419
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:56,920
and you're specifically in a little scene that's being created. But I think improv has had value.

420
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:09,720
But I have not experienced it as much in doing plays as I have sometimes in doing film where

421
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,320
you'll start off rehearsing and a director may say, let's just go off book and see what happens.

422
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,800
And I've had moments in film where someone went off book and it was terrifying.

423
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,480
There was a scene I had in Glen Gary Glen Ross

424
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:37,640
where the character I play has fucked something up, just screwed something up and Pacino is livid.

425
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,720
And so we had the scene where Al is walking like this and the camera is moving with him

426
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:56,120
and he is chewing me a new asshole. And in the middle of the take Al starts talking about me.

427
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Oh, Kevin, you don't think we know how you got this job? You don't think we know

428
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,080
who's dick you've been sucking on to get this part in this movie? And I'm now,

429
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm literally like, I don't know what the hell is happening, but I'm reacting.

430
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,760
We got to the end of that take. Al walked up to me and went, oh, that was so good. Oh my god,

431
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,360
that was so good. Just so you know, the sound, I asked them not to record. So you have no dialogue.

432
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:41,480
So it's just me. Oh, that was so good. You look like a car wreck. And I was like, yeah.

433
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,680
And it was actually an incredibly generous thing that he gave me so that I would react.

434
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:58,520
Oh, wow. Did they use that shot? Because you were in the shot. It was my close-up.

435
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that's the take. That was an intense, right? I mean,

436
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,520
what was it like if we can just linger on that, just that intense scene with Al Pacino?

437
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,920
Well, he's the reason I got the movie. A lot of people might think because Jack was in the film

438
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,480
that he had something to do with it. But actually, I was doing a play called Lost in Yonkers on

439
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,440
Broadway. And we had the same dresser who worked with him, a girl named Laura. It was wonderful.

440
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:33,160
Laura Beattie. And she told Al that he should come and see this play because she wanted to see

441
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:40,040
me in this play. I was playing this gangster's fun, fun, fun part. So I didn't know Pacino came

442
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,160
on some night and saw this play. And then like three days later, I got a call to come in and

443
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,120
auditioned for this Glenn Gray, Glenn Ross, which of course I knew is a play, David Mambis play.

444
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:59,400
And then I auditioned. Jamie Foley was the director who would eventually direct a bunch of House of

445
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,440
Cards. Wonderful, wonderful guy. And I got the part. Well, I didn't quite get the part. They were

446
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,880
going to bring together the actors that they thought they were going to give the parts to on a Saturday

447
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,000
at Al's office. And they asked me if I would come and do a read through. And I said, who's going to

448
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,280
be there? And they said, well, so-and-so-and-so-and-so-and-so. And Jack Lemon is flying in. And I said,

449
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,560
don't tell Mr. Lemon that I'm doing the read through. Is that possible? And I'm like, sure.

450
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:34,200
So I'll never forget this. Jack was sitting in the chair in Pacino's office doing the New

451
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,880
York Times crossword puzzle as he did every day. And I walked in the door and he went, oh, Jesus

452
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,640
Christ. Is it possible you could get a job without me? Jesus Christ. I'm so tired of holding up your

453
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:55,080
end of it. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. So I got the job because of Pacino. And it was really one of the

454
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:01,480
first major roles that I ever had in a film. And to be working with that group.

455
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:09,960
Yeah, that's one of the greatest ensemble casts ever. We got Al Pacino, Jack Lemon,

456
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:19,960
Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, you, Jonathan Price. It's just incredible. And I would have to

457
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,240
say, I mean, maybe you can comment. You've talked about how much of a mentor and a friend Jack

458
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,040
Lemon has been. That's one of his greatest performances ever. Ever. You have a scene at

459
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,400
the end of the movie with him. That was really powerful. Like firing on all cylinders. You're

460
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,520
playing the stain to perfection. And he's playing desperation to perfection.

461
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,360
What a scene. What was that like? Just like at the top of your game, the two of you. Well,

462
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,120
by that time, we had done Long Day's Journey Tonight in the theater. We'd done a mini series

463
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:01,000
called The Murder of Mary Fagan on NBC. We'd done a film called Dad, that Gary David Goldberg directed

464
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,360
with Ted Danson. So this was the fourth time we were working together and we knew each other.

465
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:15,160
We'd become, he'd become my father figure. And I don't know if you know that I originally met

466
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Jack Lemon when I was very, very young. He was doing a production at the Mark Taper

467
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,840
Forum of a Chateau Casey play called Juno and the Peacock with Walter Matthew and Maureen Stapleton.

468
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:36,360
And on a Saturday in December of 1974, my junior high school drama class went to a workshop. It was

469
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:43,080
called How to Audition. And we did this workshop. Many schools in Southern California were part

470
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,640
of this Drama Teachers Association. So we got these incredible experiences of being able to go

471
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,680
see professional productions and be involved in these workshops or festivals. So I had to get up

472
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,320
and do a monologue in front of Mr. Lemon when I was 13 years old. And he walked up to me at the

473
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,640
end of that and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, that was a touch of terrific. He said,

474
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,200
no, everything I've been talking about, you just did. What's your name? I said, Kevin, he said,

475
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,480
let me tell you something. When you get finished with high school, as I'm sure you're going to go

476
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,080
on and do theater, you should go to New York and you should study to be an actor because this is

477
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:24,920
what you're meant to do with your life. And he was like an idol. And 12 years later, I read in

478
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,760
the New York Times that he was coming to Broadway to do this production of A Long Day's Journey

479
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,880
tonight, a year and some months after I read this article, and I was like, I'm going to play Jamie in

480
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:44,600
that production. And I then, with a lot of opposition, the cast and director didn't want to

481
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:52,120
see me. They said that the director, Jonathan Miller, wanted movie actors to play the two sons.

482
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,280
And ultimately, I found out that Jonathan Miller, the director, was coming to New York to do a

483
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:08,680
series of lectures at Alice Tully Hall. And I went to try to figure out how I could maybe meet him.

484
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:16,760
And I was sitting in that theater listening to this incredible lecture he was doing, and sitting

485
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:25,160
next to me was an elderly woman. I mean, elderly, 80 something, and she was asleep.

486
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:35,400
But sticking out of her handbag, which was on the floor, was an invitation to a cocktail reception

487
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:44,600
on her, Dr. Jonathan Miller. And so I thought, you know, she's tired. She's probably going to go home.

488
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So I took that and walked into this cocktail reception, and ultimately went over to Dr. Miller,

489
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
who was incredibly kind, and said, sit down, always very curious, what brings young people

490
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,920
to my lectures? And I said to him, Eugene O'Neill brought me here. And he was like, what? I've always

491
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,640
wanted to meet him. Where is he? And I told him that I'd been trying for seven months to get

492
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:19,320
an audition for a long day's journey, and that his American cast directors were telling my agents

493
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,760
that he wanted big American movie stars. And at that moment, he turned and he saw

494
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,480
one of those cast directors who was there that night. So I knew he was going to be in New York

495
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:39,240
starting auditions that week. And she was staring daggers at me. And he just got it.

496
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,320
And he said, someone have a pen. And he took the paper and started writing. He said, listen,

497
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,040
Kevin, there are many situations in which casting directors have a lot of say and a lot of power

498
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,440
and a lot of leverage. And then there are other situations where they just take directors' messages.

499
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,960
And on this one, they're taking my messages. This is where I'm staying. Make sure you people get to

500
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:05,240
me. We start auditions on Thursday. And on Thursday, I had an opportunity to come in and audition

501
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:14,120
for this play that I've been working on and preparing. And at the end of it, I did four scenes

502
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,920
at the end of it. He said to me that unless someone else came in and blew him against the wall,

503
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,960
like I had just done, as far as he was concerned, I pretty much had the part, but I couldn't tell

504
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,320
my agents that yet because I had to come back and read with Mr. Lemon. And so three months later,

505
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:37,320
in August of 1985, I found myself in a room with Jack Lemon again at 890 Broadway, which is where

506
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:43,160
they rehearsed a lot of Broadway plays. And we did four scenes together and I was toppling over him.

507
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:49,640
I was pushing him. I was relentless. And I'll never forget at the end of that.

508
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,160
Lemon came over to me. He put his hand on my shoulder and he said, that would you touch it?

509
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,080
Terrific. I never thought we'd find the rotten kid, but he's it. Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?

510
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:11,480
And I ended up spending the next year of my life with that man. So it turns out he was right.

511
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:21,880
Yeah. This world works in mysterious ways. It also speaks to the fact of the power of somebody

512
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,960
you look up to giving words of encouragement, because those can just reverberate through your

513
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,920
whole life and just make the path clear. I've always, we used to joke that if every

514
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,440
contract came with a Jack Lemon clause, it would be a more beautiful world.

515
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:46,520
Beautifully said. Jack Lemon is one of the greatest actors ever. What do you think makes him so damn good?

516
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Wow.

517
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:05,480
I think he truly set out in his life to accomplish what his father said to him on his deathbed.

518
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,080
His father was died. His father was, by the way, called the Donut King in Boston.

519
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:18,600
And not in the entertainment business at all. He was literally owned a donut company. And

520
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,280
when he was passing away, Jack said, the last thing my father said to me was,

521
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:33,480
go out there and spread a little sunshine. And I truly think that's what Jack loved to do.

522
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:46,040
I remember this, and I don't know if this will answer your question, but I think it's revealing

523
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:53,640
about what he's able to do and what he was able to do and how that ultimately influenced what I

524
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:59,960
was able to do. Sam Endes had never directed a film before American Beauty.

525
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:09,640
And so what he did was he took the best elements of theater and applied them to the process. So we

526
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,160
rehearsed it like a play in a soundstage where everything was laid out like it would be in a

527
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:24,600
play and this couch will be here. And he'd sent me a couple of tapes. He'd sent me two cassette

528
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:31,560
tapes, one that he'd like to call pre-Lester before he begins to move in a new direction,

529
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:39,080
and then post-Lester. And they just were different songs. And then he said to me one day, and I

530
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,240
think always thought this was brilliant of Sam to use lemon, knowing what lemon meant to me.

531
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,640
He said, when was the last time you watched The Apartment? I said, I don't know. I mean,

532
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,880
I love that movie so much because I want you to watch it again and then let's talk.

533
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,480
So I went and I watched the movie again and we sat down and Sam said,

534
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:13,320
what lemon does in that film is incredible because there is never a moment in the movie

535
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:24,200
where we see him change. He just evolves. And he becomes the man he becomes because

536
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,720
of the experiences that he has through the course of the film. But there's this remarkable

537
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:36,680
consistency in who he becomes. And that's what I need you to do is Lester. I don't want the

538
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:45,000
audience to ever see him change. I want him to evolve. And so we did some, I mean, first of all,

539
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,320
it was just a great direction. And then second of all, we did some things that people don't know

540
00:51:51,320 --> 00:52:01,640
we did to aid that gradual shift of that man's character. First of all, I had to be in the

541
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,040
best shape from the beginning of the movie because we didn't shoot it in sequence. So

542
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:13,080
I was in this crazy shape. I had this wonderful trainer named Mike Torsche who just was incredible.

543
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:21,880
But so what we did was in order to then show this gradual shift was I had three different

544
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:30,120
hairpieces. I had three different kinds of costumes of different colors and sizes. And I had different

545
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:38,520
makeup. So in the beginning, I was wearing a kind of drab, dull, slightly, you know,

546
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:45,080
uninspired hairpiece. And my makeup was kind of gray and boring. And I was a little bit,

547
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,560
there were times when I was like too much like this and Sam would go, Kevin, you look like

548
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,640
Walter Mathau, would you please stand up a little bit? We're sort of midway through at this point.

549
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:02,760
And then at a certain point, the wig changed and it had little highlights in it, a little more

550
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,160
color, a little more, the makeup became a little, the suits got a little tighter. And then finally,

551
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,280
a third wig that was golden highlights and sunshine and, and, you know, rosy cheeks and tight fit.

552
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,680
And these are what we call theatrical tricks. You know, this is, this is how you,

553
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,720
an audience doesn't even know it's happening. But it is this gradual. And I just always felt that

554
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:37,480
that was such a brilliant way because he knew what I felt about Jack. And when you watch the

555
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:44,520
apartment, it is extraordinary that he doesn't ever change. He just, so I'm, I'm,

556
00:53:44,520 --> 00:54:02,120
and in fact, I, I thanked Jack when I won the Oscar. And I, I did my thank you speech and I

557
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,080
walked off stage and I remember I had to sit down for a moment because I didn't want to go,

558
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,840
I didn't want to go to the press room because I wanted to see if Sam was going to win.

559
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:18,840
And so I was waiting and my phone rang and it was lemon. He said, you're a son of a bitch.

560
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,720
I said, I said, what? He goes, do you, first of all, congratulations and thanks for thanking me

561
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,400
because, you know, God knows you couldn't have done it without me. He said, second of all,

562
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,400
he said, you know how long it took me to win from supporting actor. I won it for Mr. Roberts and

563
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,640
it took me like 10, 12 years to win Oscar. You did it in four, you son of a bitch.

564
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:48,920
Yeah. The apartment was, I mean, it's widely considered one of the greatest movies ever.

565
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,640
People sometimes refer to it as a comedy, which is an interesting kind of classification.

566
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,120
I suppose that's a lesson about comedy that the best, the best comedy is the one that's

567
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,440
basically a tragedy. Well, I mean, some people think Clockwork Orange is a comedy.

568
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,880
And I'm not saying there are some good laughs in Clockwork Orange, but yeah, you know, it's...

569
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,920
I mean, yeah. What's that line between comedy and tragedy for you?

570
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:31,640
Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time because I've tried always to find the humor

571
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:42,760
unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate sometimes, maybe shocking, but I've tried and

572
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:51,640
I think almost every dramatic role I've had to have a sense of humor and to be able to bring

573
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,760
that along with everything else that is serious. Because frankly,

574
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:06,200
that's how we deal with stuff in life, you know? I think Sam Mendes actually said in the

575
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:14,440
now documentary something like, with great theater, with great stories, you find humor

576
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:21,480
on the journey to the heart of darkness, something like this. Very poetic, it stood out to me.

577
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,120
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't be that poetic. I'm very sorry. But it's true. I mean,

578
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,440
the people I've interacted in this world have been to a war zone and

579
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:38,040
the ones who have lost the most and have suffered the most are usually the ones who are able to

580
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,880
make jokes the quickest and the jokes are often dark and absurd and cost every single line,

581
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,440
no political correctness, all of that. Sure. Well, I mean, you know, it's like

582
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,080
the Great Mary Tyler Moore show where they can't stop giggling at the clown's funeral. I mean,

583
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:03,640
it's just one of the great episodes ever. Giggling at a funeral is as bad as farting at a funeral

584
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:13,000
and I'm sure that there's some people who've done both. Oh, man. So you mentioned American beauty

585
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:22,280
and the idea of not changing but evolving. That's really interesting because that movie is about

586
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,320
like finding yourself. So it's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters

587
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:38,120
in their own ways, finding their own identity in a world where maybe a system, a materialistic

588
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:43,400
system that wants you to be like everyone else. And so, I mean, Lester just really transforms

589
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,840
himself throughout the movie and you're saying the challenge there is to still be the same human

590
00:57:48,840 --> 00:58:01,960
being fundamentally. Yeah, and I also think that the film was powerful because you had three

591
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:12,200
very honest and genuine portrayal of young people and then you had Lester behaving like a young

592
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:23,720
person, doing things that were unexpected. And I think that the honesty with which it dealt with

593
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,240
those issues that those teenagers were going through and the honesty with which it dealt with

594
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:37,720
what Lester was going through, I think are some of the reasons why the film had the response that

595
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:46,120
it did from so many people. I mean, I used to get stopped and someone would say to me,

596
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,920
when I first saw American beauty, I was married. And the second time I saw it, I wasn't.

597
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:59,720
And I was like, well, we weren't trying to increase the divorce rate. It wasn't our intention, but

598
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:11,960
it is interesting how so many people have those kinds of crazy fantasies. And what I

599
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,960
admired so much about who Lester was as a person, why I wanted to play him is because in the end,

600
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,680
he makes the right decision. I think a lot of people live lives of quiet desperation

601
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:36,280
in a job they don't like. In a marriage they're unhappy in and to see somebody

602
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:44,440
living that life and then saying, fuck it in every way possible. And not just in a cynical way,

603
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:51,640
but in a way that opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world. That's the beauty in American

604
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:58,280
beauty. Well, you may have to blackmail your boss to get there, but you know. And in that,

605
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:07,080
there's a bunch of humor also. In the anger and the absurdity of taking a stand against the

606
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:14,760
conformity of life, there's this humor. And I read somewhere that the scene, the dinner scene,

607
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:24,280
which is kind of play-like, where Lester slams the plate against the wall, was improvised by you,

608
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,400
the slamming of the plate against the wall. No. No. Absolutely. The internet lies once again.

609
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:40,600
Absolutely written and directed. Can't take credit for that.

610
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,880
The plate. Okay. Well, that was a genius interaction there. There's something about the

611
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,240
dinner table and losing your shit at the dinner table. Having a fight and losing your shit at the

612
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:59,720
dinner table. Where else? Yellowstone was another situation where there's a family

613
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,080
at the dinner table and then one of them says, fucking, I'm not eating this anymore and I'm

614
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,840
going to create a scene. Right. It's a beautiful kind of environment for dramatic scenes.

615
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:17,400
Or Nicholson in The Shining. There's some family scenes gone awry in that movie.

616
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,600
The contrast between you and Annette Benning in that scene

617
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:29,000
creates the genius of that scene. So how much of acting is the dance between two actors?

618
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:41,720
Well, with Annette, I just adored working with her. And we were the two actors that Sam wanted

619
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:48,680
from the very beginning, much against the will of the higher ups who wanted other actors to

620
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:59,320
play those roles. But I've known Annette since we did a screen test together from Milos Forman

621
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,640
for a film he did of the Les Léves-en-Dangerous movie. It was a different film from that one,

622
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:11,960
but it was the same story. And I've always thought she is just remarkable. And I think that

623
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:20,840
the work she did in that film, the relationship that we were able to build,

624
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:29,320
for me, the saddest part of that success was that she didn't win the Oscar,

625
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:37,240
and I felt she should have. What kind of interesting direction did you get from Sam

626
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:44,280
and how you approached playing Lester and how to take on the different scenes?

627
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,680
There's a lot of just brilliant scenes in that movie.

628
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:56,040
Well, I'll share with you a story that most people don't know, which is our first two days

629
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:03,480
of shooting were in Smiley's, the place where I get a job in a fast food place.

630
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,640
Yeah, it's a burger joint. And I guess it was like maybe

631
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:15,800
the third day or the fourth day of shooting, we'd now done that. And I said to Sam,

632
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:22,600
so how are the dailies? How do they look? He goes, which ones? I said, well, the first

633
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:30,280
Smiley's. He goes, oh, they're shit. And I went, yeah, no, how were they? He goes, no, they're

634
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:37,960
shit. I hate them. I hate everything about them. I hate the costumes. I hate the location.

635
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:46,360
I hate that you're inside. I hate the way you acted. I hate everything but the script.

636
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,760
So I've gone back to the studio and asked them if we can reshoot the first two days.

637
01:03:51,560 --> 01:04:01,480
And it was like, Sam, this is your very first movie. You're going back to Steven Spielberg

638
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:09,960
and saying, I need to reshoot the first two days entirely. Yeah. And that's exactly what we did.

639
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:16,600
A couple of weeks later, they decided that it was now a drive through because Annette and

640
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:23,160
Peter Galler used to come into the place and ordered from the counter. Now, Sam decided,

641
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,440
it has to be a drive through. You have to be in the window of the drive through,

642
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,160
change the costumes, and we reshot those first two days. And Sam said,

643
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:40,040
it was actually a moment of incredible confidence because he said the worst thing that could

644
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:47,160
possibly have happened happened in my first two days. And after that, I was like, I know what

645
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:52,200
I'm doing and I knew I had to reshoot it and it was absolutely right. And I guess that's what a

646
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:58,520
great director must do is have the guts in that moment to reshoot everything. That's a pretty

647
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:05,560
gutsy move. Two other little things to share with you about Sam, but the way he is, you wouldn't

648
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:16,840
know it, but the original script opened and closed with a trial. Ricky was accused of Lester's murder.

649
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,720
And the movie was bookended by this trial. It's a very different movie.

650
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:32,440
Which they shot the entire trial for weeks. And I used to fly in my dreams.

651
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,080
You know those opening shots over the neighborhood? I used to come into those shots in my bathrobe

652
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:46,360
flying. And then when I hit the ground and the newspaper was thrown at me by the newspaper guy

653
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:52,840
and I caught it, the alarm would go off and I'd wake up in bed. I spent five days being hung by

654
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:59,640
wires and filming these sequences of flying through my dreams. And Sam said to me,

655
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:06,760
yeah, the flying sequences are all gone and the trial is gone. And I was like, what?

656
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:14,920
What are you talking about? And here's my other little favorite story about Sam and that.

657
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:21,480
When we were shooting in the valley, one of those places I flew, this was an indoor set.

658
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:29,800
Sam said to me in the morning, hey, at lunch, I just want to record a guide track of all the

659
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:34,600
dialogue, all of your narration, because they just needed an editing as a guide. And I said, sure.

660
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,120
So I remember we came outside of this in this hallway where I had a dressing room in this

661
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:47,960
little studio we were in. And Sam had like a cassette tape recorder and like a little microphone.

662
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:56,600
And we put it on the floor and he pushed record. And I read the entire narration.

663
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:08,440
And I never did it again. That's the narration in the movie. Because Sam said, when he listened to it,

664
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,320
I wasn't trying to do anything. He said, you had no idea where these things were going,

665
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,480
where they were going to be placed, what they were going to mean. You just read it so

666
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:28,040
innocently, so purely, so directly that I knew if I brought you into a studio and put headphones

667
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:37,640
on you and had you do it again, it would change the ease with which you'd done it. And so they

668
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:45,000
just fixed all of the problems that they had with this little cassette. And that is the way I did

669
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,520
it. And the only time I did it was in this little hallway. And once again, a great performance lies

670
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:59,400
in being doing less. Yeah. Yeah. The innocence and the purity of less. He knew I would have

671
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:06,600
come into the studio and fucked it up. Yeah. What do you think about the notion of beauty that

672
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:12,120
permeates American beauty? What do you think that theme is with the roses, with the rose petals,

673
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:21,960
the characters that are living this mundane existence slowly opening their eyes up to what is

674
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,720
beautiful in life? See, it's funny. I don't think of the roses and I don't think of her body and

675
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:38,680
the poster and I don't think of those things as the beauty. I think of the bag. I think that

676
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:48,440
there are things we miss that are right in front of us that are truly beautiful.

677
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,240
The little things, the simple things. Yeah. And in fact, I'll even tell you something that I always

678
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:04,280
thought was so incredible. When we shot the scenes in the office where Lester worked,

679
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,120
the job he hated, there was a bulletin board behind me on a wall.

680
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:18,760
And someone who was watching a cut or early dailies who was in the marketing department

681
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:27,880
saw that someone had cut out a little piece of paper and stuck it and it said, look closer.

682
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:35,240
And they presented that to Sam as the idea of what that should, that could go on the poster.

683
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:43,880
The idea of looking closer was such a brilliant idea, but it wasn't, I mean, it wasn't like,

684
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,520
it wasn't in the script. It was just on a wall behind me and someone happened to

685
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:55,080
zoom in on it and see it and thought, that's what this movie's about. This movie's about

686
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:03,640
taking the time to look closer. And I think that in itself is just beautiful.

687
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:10,600
Mortality also permeates the film. It starts with acknowledging that death is on the way,

688
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:21,080
that Lester's time is finite. You ever think about your own death? Yeah. Scared of it?

689
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,640
When I was at my lowest point, yes, it scared me.

690
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:37,160
What does that fear look like? What's the nature of the fear? What are you afraid of?

691
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,280
That there's no way out.

692
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,280
That there's no answer.

693
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:54,600
That nothing makes sense.

694
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:05,320
See, the interesting thing about Lester is facing the same fear. He seemed to be somehow liberated

695
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,040
and accepted everything and then saw the beauty of it.

696
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:17,320
Because he got there. He was given the opportunity to reinvent himself and to

697
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:30,120
try things he'd never tried, to ask questions he'd never asked, to trust his instincts

698
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:40,440
and to become the best version of himself he could become. And so Dick Van Dyke, who has

699
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:49,000
become an extraordinary friend of mine, Dick is 98 years old. And he says, you know, if I'd known

700
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,400
I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself. When I spend time with him,

701
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:03,400
I'm just moved by every day, you know, he gets up and he goes, it's a good day, I woke up.

702
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:16,280
And I learn a lot about, I have a different feeling about death now than I did seven years ago.

703
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:29,000
And I'm on the path to being able to be in a place where

704
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,200
I've resolved the things I needed to resolve and won't probably get to all of it in my lifetime,

705
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:43,880
but I certainly would like to be at a place where if I were to drop dead tomorrow,

706
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:49,880
it would have been an amazing life. So Lester got there, it sounds like Dick Van Dyke got there,

707
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:57,480
he tried to get there. Sure. You said you feared death at your lowest point. What was the lowest

708
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:08,680
point? It was November 1st of 2017, and then Thanksgiving Day of that same year.

709
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:17,160
So let's talk about it. Let's talk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual allegations

710
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:24,120
against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world for the last seven years.

711
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,880
I would like to personally understand the sins, the bad things you did and the bad things you

712
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:37,560
didn't do. So I also should say that the thing I hope to do here is to

713
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:47,080
give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty that the mass hysteria machine of

714
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:54,600
the internet and clickbait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand.

715
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:59,640
There were criminal and civil trials brought against you,

716
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,840
including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued you for $40 million.

717
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:14,280
In these trials, you were acquitted, found not guilty and not liable. Is that right? Yes. I think

718
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:22,840
that's really important again in terms of due process. And I read a lot and I watched a lot

719
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:29,640
in preparation for this on this point, including, of course, the recently detailed interviews you

720
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:36,680
did with Dan Wooten and then Allison Pearson of the Telegraph. And those are all focused on this

721
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:42,040
topic and they go in detail where you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are

722
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:46,760
interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that and everything I looked at,

723
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:52,120
as I understand, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to.

724
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,520
Sort of in the sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right? That's correct.

725
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:04,440
You always respected the explicit no from people. Again, the sexual context. Is that right? That is

726
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:11,320
correct. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right? Never. And also,

727
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:17,880
as is sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this, you've never explicitly offered to exchange

728
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,960
sexual favors for career advancement, correct? Correct. In terms of bad behavior, what did you

729
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:31,640
do? What was the worst of it? And how often did you do it? I have heard now quite often that

730
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:37,320
everybody has a Kevin Spacey story. And what that tells me is that I hit on a lot of guys.

731
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:44,360
How often did you cross the line? And what does that mean to you? I did a lot of horsing around.

732
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:49,400
I had a lot of things that at the time I thought were sort of playful and fun. And I have learned

733
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:58,040
since we're not. And I have had to recognize that I crossed some boundaries and I did some

734
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:04,120
things that were wrong and I made some mistakes. And that's in my past. I mean, I've been working

735
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:11,640
so hard over these last seven years to have the conversations I needed to have, to listen to people,

736
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,400
to understand things from a different perspective than the one that I had,

737
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,840
and to say, I will never behave that way again for the rest of my life.

738
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,160
Just to clarify, I think you're often too pushy with the flirting.

739
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:37,800
And that manifests itself in multiple ways. But just to make clear, you never prevented anyone

740
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:46,280
from leaving if they wanted to. You always took the explicit no from people as an answer. No, stop.

741
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:52,840
You took that for the answer. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person.

742
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,280
And you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement.

743
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
These are some of the sort of accusations that have been made. And in the court of law, multiple

744
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,320
times have been shown not to be true. But I have had a sexual life and I've fallen in love.

745
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:20,280
And I've been so admiring of people that I, I mean, I'm so romantic. I'm such a romantic person

746
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:26,600
that there's this whole side of me that hasn't been talked about, isn't being discussed. But

747
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:34,040
that's who I know. That's the person I know. It's been very upsetting to hear that some people have

748
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:39,080
said I, I mean, I don't have a violent bone in my body, but to hear people describe things as

749
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:48,120
having been very aggressive is incredibly difficult for me. And I'm deeply sorry that

750
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:55,640
I ever offended anyone or hurt anyone in any way. It is, it is crushing to me. And I have to work

751
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:04,600
very hard to show and to prove that I have learned I got the memo and I will never,

752
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,520
ever, ever behave in those ways again. From everything I've seen in public

753
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:14,280
interactions with you, people love you. Colleagues love you, coworkers love you. They,

754
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:19,400
there's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between the

755
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:24,920
people you work with. And by the way, not to take anything away from my accountability for

756
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:30,200
things I did where I got it wrong, I crossed the line, I pushed some boundaries. I accept all of

757
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:40,840
that. But I live in an industry in which flirtation, attraction, people meeting in the workspace and

758
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:50,520
ending up marrying each other and having children. And so it is a, it is a, it is a space and a place

759
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:58,200
where these notions of family, these notions of attraction, these notions of, it's always

760
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:03,560
complicated if you meet someone in the workspace and find yourselves attracted to each other.

761
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:09,320
You have to be mindful of that. And you have to be very mindful that you don't ever want anyone to

762
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:18,120
feel that their job is in jeopardy. Or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted

763
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:26,200
to be with you. So those are important things to just acknowledge. Another complexity to this

764
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:32,920
as I've seen is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you. A huge number of

765
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:38,040
people in the industry that look up to you. So just and love you. I've seen just from this

766
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:43,320
documentary, just a lot of people just love being around you, learning from you what it means to

767
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:50,680
create great theater, great film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't

768
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:57,960
say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's a admiration dynamic that

769
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,000
is easy to miss and easy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand?

770
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:10,600
Yes. And I also understand that there are people who met me and spent a very brief period of time

771
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:20,200
with me, but presumed I was now going to be their mentor. And then behaved in a way that I was unaware

772
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:30,280
of that they were either participating or flirting along or encouraging me without me having any idea

773
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:41,080
that at the end of the day they were expecting something. So these are about relationships.

774
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:46,680
So these are about two people. These are about people making decisions, people making choices,

775
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:55,960
and I accept my accountability in that. But there are a number of things that I've been accused of

776
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:05,000
that just simply did not happen. And I can't say, and I don't think it would be right for me to say,

777
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,600
well, everything that's ever been I've been accused of is true because we've now proved

778
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:18,920
that it isn't and it wasn't. But I am perfectly willing to accept that I had behaviors that were

779
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:27,480
wrong and that I shouldn't have done and I am regretful for. I think that also speaks to

780
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:34,760
dark side of fame. The sense I got is that there are some people, potentially a lot of people,

781
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:39,960
trying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career.

782
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,200
So not you using them, but they trying to use you.

783
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:56,600
What's that like? How do you know if somebody likes you for you for Kevin or likes you for

784
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:03,480
like you said, you're romantic, you see a person and you're like, I like this person

785
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,520
and they seem to like you. How do you know if they like you for you?

786
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:17,000
Well, to some degree, I would say that I have been able to trust my instincts on that and that

787
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:23,720
most of the time been right. But obviously in the last number of years,

788
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,680
not just with people who've accused me, but just also people in my own industry,

789
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:33,800
to realize that, oh, I thought we had a friendship, but I guess that was about an inch thick and

790
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:43,800
not what I thought it was. But look, one shouldn't be surprised by that. I have to also say,

791
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,520
you know, you said a little while ago that the world had canceled me and I have to

792
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:56,360
disagree with you. I have to disagree because for seven years, I've been stopped by people

793
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:03,400
sometimes every day, sometimes multiple, multiple times a day. And the conversations that I have

794
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:10,760
with people, the generosity that they share, the kindness that they show, and how much they want

795
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:18,040
to know when I'm getting back to work tells me that while there may be a very loud minority,

796
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,640
there is a quieter majority. In the industry, have you been betrayed

797
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,560
in life and how do you not let that make you cynical?

798
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:41,240
I think betrayal is a really interesting word. But I think if you're going to be betrayed,

799
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:48,440
it has to be by those who truly know you. And I can tell you that I have not been betrayed.

800
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,760
What's the beautiful way to put it?

801
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,680
For the times you cross the line, do you take responsibility for the wrongs you've done?

802
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:05,400
Yes. Are you sorry to the people you may have hurt emotionally? Yes.

803
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:15,960
And I have spoken to many of them. Privately. Privately, which is where a man should be made.

804
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:25,000
Were they able to start finding forgiveness? Absolutely. Some of the most moving conversations

805
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:34,600
that I have had when I was determined to take accountability have been those people who said,

806
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:40,760
thank you so much, and I think I can forgive you now.

807
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,600
If you got a chance to talk to the Kevin Spacey of 30 to 40 years ago,

808
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:54,680
what would you tell him to change about his ways? How would you do it? What would be your approach?

809
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,560
Would you be nice about it? Would you smack him around?

810
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,840
I think if I were to go back that far, I probably would have found a way to

811
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:12,440
not have been as concerned about my revealing my sexuality and hiding that for as long as I did.

812
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:22,680
I think that had a lot to do with confusion and a lot to do with mistrust, both my own and other

813
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:29,480
peoples. For most of your life, you were not open with the public about being gay.

814
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,360
What was the hardest thing about keeping who you love a secret?

815
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:46,440
That I didn't find the right moment of celebration to be able to share that.

816
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,640
There must be a thing that weighs on you to not be able to fully

817
01:25:55,240 --> 01:26:04,440
celebrate your love. Ian McKellen said, he was 49 when he came out,

818
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:12,200
27 years he'd been a professional actor being in the closet. He said he felt it was like he was

819
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:20,680
living a part of his life not being truthful and that he felt that it affected his work

820
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:26,840
when he did come out because he no longer felt like he had anything to hide. I absolutely believe

821
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:37,400
that that is what my experience has been and will continue to be. I am sorry about the way I came out,

822
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:46,120
but Evan and I had already had the conversation. I had already decided to come out.

823
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:54,120
It wasn't like, oh, I was forced to come out, but it was something I decided to do. By the way,

824
01:26:54,120 --> 01:27:00,200
much against Evan's advice, I came out in that statement and he wishes that I had not done so.

825
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:09,240
Yeah, you made a statement when the initial accusation happened. It could be up there as

826
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:19,800
one of the worst social media posts of all time. It's like two for one.

827
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,800
Don't hold back. No, come on. Really tell me how you feel.

828
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:29,800
The first part, you kind of implicitly admitted to doing something bad, which was later shown

829
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,400
and proved completely to never have happened. It was a lie.

830
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:40,360
I basically said that I didn't remember what this person was that Anthony Rapp was claiming

831
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,680
from 31 years before. I had no memory of it, but if it had happened, if this embarrassing moment

832
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:53,000
had happened, then I would owe him an apology. That was what I said. Then I said, and while I'm

833
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,600
at it, I think I'll come out. It was definitely not the greatest coming-out party ever. I will admit

834
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:03,480
that. From the public perception, the first part of that, so first of all, the second part is a

835
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:08,920
horrible way to come out. Yes, we all agree. Then the first part, from the public viewpoint,

836
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:17,400
they see guilt in that, which also is tragic because at least that particular accusation is

837
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:23,000
a very dramatic one. It's a $40 million lawsuit. It's a big deal, and an underage person was shown

838
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:30,520
to be false. You're melding two things together. The lawsuit didn't happen until 2020, and then

839
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:36,120
it didn't get to court until 2022. We're back in 2017 when it was just an accusation he made

840
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:44,920
in BuzzFeed Magazine. Look, I was backed into a corner. When someone says, you were so drunk,

841
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:51,080
you won't remember this thing happened, what's your first instinct? Is your first instinct to

842
01:28:51,080 --> 01:29:00,280
say this person's a liar, or is your first instinct to go, what? 31 years at a party,

843
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:05,640
I don't even remember throwing? Obviously, a lot of investigation happened after that,

844
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:11,480
in which we were then able to prove in that court case that it had never occurred. But at the moment,

845
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:22,280
I was sort of being taught, I couldn't push back. You have to be kind. I think even to me now,

846
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,880
none of it sounds right, but I don't know that I could have said anything that would have been

847
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:35,720
satisfactory to anybody. Okay. That is an almost convincing explanation for the worst social

848
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:40,840
media post of all time. I almost accept it. I'm really surprised. I guess you haven't read a lot

849
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,720
of media posts because I can't believe that's the actual worst one. It's beautifully bad,

850
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:51,800
is how bad that social media post is. As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone came out

851
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:59,800
in support of you recently, speaking to your character. A lot of people who know you, and some

852
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:05,560
of whom I know, who have worked with you privately, show support for you, but are afraid to speak up

853
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:11,640
publicly. What do you make of that? I mean, to me personally, this just makes me sad because

854
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:19,080
perhaps that's the nature of the industry, that it's difficult to do that, but I just wish it

855
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,760
would be a little bit more courage in the world. I don't think it's about the industry. I think

856
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:28,200
it's about our time. I guess the time that we're in, and people are very afraid.

857
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:33,880
Just afraid, just a general fear. No, they're literally afraid that

858
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,560
they're going to get canceled if they stand up for someone who has been.

859
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,520
I think it's... I mean, we've seen this many times in history. This is not the first time it's

860
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:58,680
happened. So as you said, your darkest moment in 2017, when all of this went down, one of the

861
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:03,240
things that happened is you were no longer in the house of cards for the last season.

862
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:10,360
Let's go to the beginning of that show. Okay. One of the greatest TV series of all time,

863
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:16,520
a dark, fascinating character in Frank Underwood, a ruthless, cunning, borderline, evil politician.

864
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:24,280
What are some interesting aspects to the process you went through becoming Frank Underwood?

865
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:29,080
Maybe, Richard III, there's a lot of elements there in your performance that maybe

866
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:41,080
inspired that character. Is that fair or no? I'll give you one very interesting, specific

867
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:51,880
education that I got in doing Richard III and closing that show

868
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:59,480
at BAM in March of 2012, and two months later, started shooting house of cards.

869
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,200
There is something called direct address.

870
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:18,280
In Shakespeare, you have Hamlet talks to the world, but when Shakespeare wrote Richard III,

871
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,280
it was the first time he created something called direct address, which is the character looks

872
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:31,320
at each person close by. It is a different kind of

873
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,560
sharing than when a character is doing a monologue, an opening of Henry IV.

874
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,920
And while there are some people who believe that direct address was invented in Ferris

875
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:51,640
Bueller, it wasn't. It was Shakespeare who invented it. So I had just had this experience

876
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:59,400
every night in theaters all over the world, seeing how people reacted

877
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:05,880
to becoming a co-conspirator, because that's what it's about.

878
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:15,560
And what I tried to do and what Fincher really helped me with in those beginning days

879
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:23,880
was how to look in that camera and imagine I was talking to my best friend.

880
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:32,280
Because you're sharing the secret of the darkness of how this game is played

881
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:39,000
with that best friend. Yeah, and there were many times when I suppose the writers thought I was

882
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,720
crazy, where I would see a script and I would see like this moment where this direct address

883
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:48,680
would happen and say all this stuff and I'd go, when we do a read-through of the script, I go,

884
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:53,320
I don't think I need to say any of that. And they were like, what do you mean? I said,

885
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:59,880
well, the audience knows all of that. All I have to do is look. They know exactly what's going on.

886
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:07,480
I don't need to say a thing. So I was often cutting dialogue because it just wasn't needed,

887
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:12,840
because that relationship that I'd learned that I'd experienced doing Richard III,

888
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:21,560
was so extraordinary. Where I literally watched people, they were like, oh, I'm in on the thing

889
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:26,520
and this is so awesome. And then suddenly, wait, he killed the kids. He killed those kids in the

890
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:35,080
tower. Oh, maybe it's not so. And you literally would watch them start to reverse their having had

891
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:41,560
such a great time with Richard III in the first, you know, three acts. I thought this is going to

892
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:56,680
happen in this show. If this intimacy can actually land, and I think just think there was some

893
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:03,000
brilliant writing and we always attempted to do it in one take. No matter how long something was,

894
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,240
we would try to do it in one take, the direct addresses. So there was never a cut. When we

895
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:15,960
went out on locations, we started to then find ways to cut it and make it slightly broader.

896
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,520
But that's interesting because you're doing a bunch of with both Richard III and Frank Underwood,

897
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:28,040
a bunch of dark, borderline evil things. And then I guess the idea is you're going to be

898
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:32,280
losing the audience and then you win them back over with the addresses.

899
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:40,520
That's the remarkable thing is against their instincts and their better sense of what they

900
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,400
should and should not do, they still rallied around Frank Underwood.

901
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,520
And I saw even with the documentary, the glimmers of that with Richard III,

902
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:56,360
I mean, you were seducing the audience. Like there was such a chemistry between you and the

903
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:01,320
audience on stage. Yeah. Well, in that production, that's absolutely true.

904
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,640
Also, Richard is one of the weirder, weird, I mean by weird,

905
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:18,520
was an early play of Shakespeare's. And he's basically never offstage. I mean,

906
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,800
I remember when we did the first run through, I had no idea what the next scene was every time I

907
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,600
came offstage. I had no idea what was next. They literally had to drag me from one place to another

908
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,520
scene. Now it's the scene with Hastings. And now it's the scene. But I now understand these

909
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:41,160
wonderful stories that you can read in old books about Shakespeare's time that actors

910
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:47,960
grabbed Shakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him up against the wall. So you

911
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:52,360
ever write a part like this again, I'm going to kill you. And that's why in later plays,

912
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:57,640
he started to have a pageant happened and then a wedding happened. And the main character was

913
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:04,120
offstage resting because the actor had said, you can't do this to us. There's no breaks.

914
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:08,840
And it's true. There's very few breaks in Richard III. You're on stage most of the time.

915
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:15,640
The comedic aspect of Richard III and Frank Underwood. Is that a component that helps bring out

916
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:21,560
the full complexity of the darkness that is Frank Underwood?

917
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:29,240
I certainly can't take credit for Shakespeare having written something that is funny or

918
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:34,440
Bo Williman and his team to have written something that is funny, is fundamentally funny.

919
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:44,440
It just depends on how I interpret it. That's one of the great things why we love

920
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:51,800
you know, in a year's time, we can see five different Hamlets. We can see four Richard

921
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:58,440
the Thirds. We can see two Richard the Seconds. That's part of the thrill that we don't own these

922
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:06,760
parts. We borrow them and we interpret them. And what Ian McKellen might do with a role

923
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:12,200
could be completely different from what I might do because of the way we perceive it.

924
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:18,360
And also, very often in terms of going for humor, it's very often a director will say,

925
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:23,240
why don't you say that with a bit of irony? Why don't you try that with a bit of boba?

926
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:29,800
Yeah, there's often like that, like a wry smile. The line that jumps to me when you're talking about

927
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:40,520
Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, I love that woman more than sharks love blood.

928
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:50,120
I mean, I guess there's a lot of ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both

929
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:57,560
humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together.

930
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:02,120
I also think that one should just acknowledge that where he was from,

931
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:10,920
there is something that happens when you do an accent. And in fact, sometimes when I would say

932
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:16,600
to Bo or one of the other writers, this is really good and I love the idea,

933
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:23,480
but it rhythmically doesn't help. I need at least two more words to rhythmically make this work

934
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:32,280
in his accent because it just doesn't scan. And that's not iambic pentameter. I'm not talking

935
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:38,760
about that. There is that as well in Shakespeare, but there was sometimes when it's too many lines,

936
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,920
it's not enough lines in order for me to make this work for the way he speaks, the way he sounds,

937
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:53,560
and what that accent does to emphasis. How much of that character in terms of the musicality

938
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:01,160
of the way he speaks is Bill Clinton? Not really at all. I mean, Clinton, you know,

939
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:09,640
Bill Clinton, he had a way of talking, you know, that he was very slow and he felt your pain,

940
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:22,280
you know. But Frank Underwood was a deeper, more direct and less poetic in the way that

941
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,800
Clinton would talk. I'll tell you this Clinton story that you like.

942
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:34,280
So we decided to do a performance of the Iceman cometh for the Democratic Party

943
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:38,920
on Broadway and the president is going to come. He's going to see this four and a half hour play

944
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:43,640
and then we're going to do this event afterward. And a couple weeks before we're going to do this

945
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:49,160
event, someone at the White House calls and says, listen, it's very unusual to get the president

946
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:55,320
for like six and a half hours. So we're suggesting that the president come and see the first act

947
01:40:55,400 --> 01:41:02,440
and then he goes. And I knew what was happening. Now, first of all, Clinton knows this play.

948
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:09,400
He knows what this play is about. And I, you know, as gently as I could said, well,

949
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:15,080
if the president is thinking of leaving at intermission, then I'm afraid we're going to have

950
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:20,200
to cancel the event. There's just no way that, so anyway, then I don't know, it's fine. Now,

951
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:24,760
I know what was happening. What was happening was that someone had read the play and they were

952
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:31,800
quite concerned. And I'll tell you why. Because the play is about this character that I portrayed

953
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,480
named Hickey. And in the course of the play, as things get more and more revealed, you realize

954
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:43,160
that this man that I'm playing has been a philanderer. He's cheated on his wife quite a lot.

955
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:52,280
And by the end of the play, he is arrested and taken off because he ended up ending his wife's

956
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:58,840
life because she forgave him too much and he couldn't live with it. So now imagine this,

957
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:05,240
there's 2,000 people at the Brooks Acton's Theater watching President Clinton watching this play.

958
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:12,040
And at the end of the night, we take our curtain call. They bring out the presidential podium.

959
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,680
Bill Clinton stands up there and he says,

960
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:24,200
Well, I suppose we should all thank Kevin and this extraordinary company of actors

961
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:30,200
for giving us all way too much to think about.

962
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:40,360
And the audience fell over and laughed her and then he gave a great speech. And I thought

963
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,440
that was a pretty good way to handle that.

964
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:48,200
Well, in that way, him and Frank Arnold would share like a charisma. There's certain presidents that

965
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:53,160
just have politicians that just have this charisma. You can't stop listening to them.

966
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:58,040
Some of it is the accent, but some of it is some other magical thing.

967
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:07,000
When I was starting to do research, I wanted to meet with the whip, Kevin McCarthy.

968
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:13,320
And he wouldn't meet with me until I called his office back and said,

969
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:19,560
tell him I'm playing a Democrat, not a Republican. And then he met with me.

970
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:21,400
Nice.

971
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,040
And he was helpful. He took me to whip meetings.

972
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:31,720
Politicians. So you worked with David Fincher there. He was the executive producer, but

973
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,120
he also directed the first two episodes. Yeah.

974
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,440
High level. What was it like working with him again? In which ways do you think he

975
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:47,800
helped guide you and the show to become the great show that it was?

976
01:43:48,280 --> 01:44:02,840
I give him a huge amount of the credit and not just for what he established,

977
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:12,760
but the fact that every director after stayed within that world. I think that's why the series had

978
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:17,800
a very consistent feeling to it. It was like watching a very long movie.

979
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:25,640
The style, where the camera went, what it did, what it didn't do, how we used this,

980
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:30,520
how we used that, how we didn't do this. There were things that he laid the foundation for

981
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:39,800
that we managed to maintain pretty much until Bo Williman left the show.

982
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:46,280
They got rid of Fincher, and I was sort of the last man standing in terms of

983
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:52,920
fighting again. Netflix had never had any creative control at all. We had complete creative control,

984
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:59,080
but over time, they started to get themselves involved because, look, this is what happens

985
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:04,920
to networks. They'd never made a television show before ever, and then four years later,

986
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:11,080
they were the best. Then you're going to get suggestions about casting and about writing and

987
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:19,480
about whose music and scenes. There was a considerable amount of pushback that I had to do

988
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:24,520
when they started to get involved in ways that I thought was affecting the quality of the show.

989
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:31,960
What are those battles like? I heard that there was a battle of the execs, like you mentioned

990
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:37,640
early on about your name not being on the billing for Seven. I heard that there's battles about the

991
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:49,400
ending of Seven, which was pretty dark. What's that battle like? How often does that happen?

992
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:59,000
How do you win that battle? It feels like there's a line where the networks or the execs are really

993
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:07,160
afraid of crossing that line into this strange, uncomfortable place. Then the great directors

994
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:16,120
and great actors flirt with that line. It can happen in different ways. I remember one argument

995
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:23,000
we had was we had specifically shot a scene so that there would be no score in that scene,

996
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,120
so that there was no music. It was just two people talking. Then we end up seeing a cut where

997
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:36,280
they've decided to put music in. It is against everything that scene is supposed to be about.

998
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:41,800
You have to go and say, guys, this was intentional. We did not want score. Now you've

999
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:47,320
added score because you think it's too quiet. You think our audience can't listen to two people

1000
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:52,120
talk for two and a half minutes. This show has proved anything. It's proved that people have

1001
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:57,800
patience and they're willing to watch an entire season over a weekend. There are those kind of

1002
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:08,040
arguments that can happen. There are different arguments on different levels and they sometimes

1003
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:12,920
have to do with, I mean, look, go back to the godfather. They wanted to fire Pacino because

1004
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:18,200
they didn't see anything happening. They saw nothing happening, so they wanted to fire Pacino.

1005
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:23,960
And then finally, Coppola thought, I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner

1006
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:28,600
and they'll do that scene now. That was the first scene where they went, yeah, actually,

1007
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:32,040
there's something going on there. So Pacino kept the role.

1008
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:39,960
You think that godfathers when Pacino was like the Pacino we know was born? Or is that more like

1009
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:46,200
there's the character that really over the top, insensible woman? There's like stages, I suppose.

1010
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:52,360
Yeah, of course. Look, I think that we can't forget that Pacino is also an animal of the theater.

1011
01:47:53,480 --> 01:48:00,600
He does a lot of plays and he started off doing plays and movies where Panic and Needle Park was

1012
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:07,800
his first. And yeah, I think there's that period of time when he was doing some incredible parts

1013
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:14,520
and incredible movies. When I did a series called Wise Guy, I got cast on a Thursday

1014
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:19,240
and I flew up to Vancouver on a Saturday and I started shooting on Monday. And all I had time

1015
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:25,880
to do was watch The Godfather in Superco and then I went to work. Would you say,

1016
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,600
ridiculous question, Godfather's greatest film of all time?

1017
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:40,040
Well, certainly, yes, yes. But I also look, I'm allowed to change my opinion. I can next week

1018
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:46,120
say it's Lawrence of Arabia or a week after that, I can say Sullivan's Travels. I mean,

1019
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,840
that's the wonderful thing about movies and particularly great movies is when you see them

1020
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:56,680
again, it's like seeing them for the first time. And you pick up things that you didn't see the last

1021
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:03,320
time. And for that day, you fall in love with that movie. You might even say to a friend that

1022
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:09,160
that is the greatest movie of all time. And also I think it's the degree with which directors are

1023
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:20,200
daring. I mean, Kubrick decided to cast one actor to play three major roles in Dr. Strangelove.

1024
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:28,360
I mean, who has the balls to do that today? I was going to mention when we're talking about seven

1025
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:36,840
that just if you're looking at the greatest performances portrayals of murderers, so obviously

1026
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:41,640
like I mentioned, Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, that's up there. Seven to me is like

1027
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:46,520
competing for first place with Silence of the Lambs. But then there's a different one

1028
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:56,680
with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, right, with a shot. And there's, as opposed to a murderer

1029
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:03,000
who's always been a murderer, here's a person like an American beauty who becomes that,

1030
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:10,760
who descends into madness. I read also that Jack Nicholson improvised here's Johnny in that scene.

1031
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:16,760
I believe that. That's a very different performance than yours in Seven. What do you make of that

1032
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:25,000
performance? Nicholson's always been such an incredible actor because he has absolutely no

1033
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:32,200
shame about being demonstrative and over the top. And he also has no problem playing characters who

1034
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:37,320
were deeply flawed. And he interested in that. I have a pretty good Nicholson story though,

1035
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:42,040
nobody knows. You also have a pretty good Nicholson impression, but what's the story?

1036
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:50,280
Story is a story was told to me by a sound man, Dennis Maitland, who's a great, great, great guy.

1037
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:57,160
He said he was very excited because he got on Pritzze's Honor, which was Jack Nicholson,

1038
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:02,520
Angelica Houston, directed by John Houston. And he said, I was so excited. It was my first day

1039
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:08,360
on the movie and I get told to go into Mr. Nicholson's trailer and mic him up for the first scene.

1040
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:16,760
So I knock on the trailer door and I hear, yes. And come on in. I come inside and Mr. Nicholson

1041
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:22,360
is changing out of his regular clothes and he's putting, he's going to put on his costume. And

1042
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:28,440
so I'm setting up the mic and I'm getting ready. And I said, Mr. Nicholson, I just wanted to tell

1043
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:34,120
you, I'm extremely excited to be working with you again. It's a great pleasure. And Jack goes,

1044
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,640
did we work together before? And he says, yes, yes, we, we did. And he goes, what,

1045
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:46,920
what film did we do together? He says, well, we did Missouri Breaks. Nicholson goes, oh my God,

1046
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:53,000
Missouri Breaks. Jesus Christ, we were out of our minds on that film. Holy shit. Jesus Christ,

1047
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:58,680
wonder I'm alive. My God, there was so much drugs going on and we were stoned out of our minds.

1048
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:05,160
Holy shit. And just then he folds the pants that he's just taken off over his arm and an eighth

1049
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:16,280
of coke drops out on the floor. Dennis looks at it. Nicholson looks at it. Jack goes,

1050
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:25,480
have more in these pants since Missouri Breaks. Man, I love that guy unapologetically himself.

1051
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,800
Oh yeah. Your impression of him, look at the AFI was just, is just great.

1052
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:37,560
Well, that was for, that was for Mike Nichols. Oh yeah. He had a big impact in your career.

1053
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:43,000
He's really important. Can you talk about him? Like what, what role did he play in your life?

1054
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:51,560
I think it was, yeah, it was 1984. I went into audition for the national tour of a play called

1055
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:56,520
The Real Thing, which Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close were doing on Broadway that Mr. Nichols

1056
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:01,560
had directed. So I went in to read for this character Brody, who is a Scottish character.

1057
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:09,160
And I did the audition and Mike Nichols comes down the aisle of the theater and he's asking me

1058
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:12,680
questions about where'd you go to school and what have you been doing. And I just come back from

1059
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:17,400
doing a bunch of years of regional theater and different theaters. So I was in New York and

1060
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:24,600
meeting Mike Nichols was just incredible. So Mr. Nichols went, have you, have you seen the other

1061
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:29,320
play that I directed up the block called Hurley Burley? And I said, no, I haven't. He says, why

1062
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:35,400
not? I said, I can't afford a Broadway ticket. He said, we can arrange that. I'd like you to go

1063
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:40,840
see that play and then I'd like you to come in next week and audition for that. I was like, okay.

1064
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:50,040
So I went to see Hurley Burley, William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken, Candace Bergen,

1065
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:59,240
Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller. And I watched this play. David Ray played about Hollywood.

1066
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:07,560
This is crazy. I mean, Bill Hurt was like unbelievable. It was extraordinary. Chris Walken,

1067
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:13,320
so there's this Harvey Keitel. Walken came in later. Harvey Keitel's playing this part.

1068
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:19,480
And I come in and I audition for it and Nichols says, I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel,

1069
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:26,440
I want you to understudy Phil. And I'm like, Phil? I mean, Harvey Keitel is like in his 40s,

1070
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:31,240
he looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody on stage. I'm just like 24 year old.

1071
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,840
And Nichols said, it's just all about attitude. If you believe you can beat the shit out of

1072
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:42,920
everybody on stage, the audience will too. So I then started to learn Phil.

1073
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:49,320
Phil. And the way it works when you're in understudy, unless you're in name,

1074
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:53,800
they don't let you rehearse on the stage. You just rehearse in a rehearsal room.

1075
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:58,040
But I used to sneak onto the stage and rehearse and try to figure out where the props were.

1076
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:06,760
Anyway, one day I get a call, you're going on today, it's Phil. So I went on.

1077
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:12,120
Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence, who's the stage manager. Spacey's going on as Phil. So

1078
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:19,080
Nichols comes down and watches the second act, comes backstage. He says, that was really good.

1079
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:26,120
How soon could you learn Mickey? Mickey was the role that Ron Silver was playing,

1080
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:34,440
Chris Walken also played. I said, I don't know. Maybe a couple of weeks. He goes,

1081
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:44,440
learn Mickey too. So I learned Mickey. And then one day I'm told, you're going on tomorrow night

1082
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:53,480
is Mickey. Nichols comes, sees the second act, comes backstage, says, that was really good.

1083
01:55:53,480 --> 01:56:01,640
I mean, that was really funny. How soon could you learn Eddie? And so I became like the pinch

1084
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:05,400
hitter on Hurley Burley. I learned all the male parts, including Jerry Stiller's, although I

1085
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:14,840
never went on his Jerry Stiller's part. And then I left the play. I guess about two months later,

1086
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:20,360
I get this phone call from Mike Nichols. He's like, Kevin, how are you? And I'm like, I'm fine.

1087
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:26,520
What can I do for you? He says, well, I'm going to make a film this summer with Mandy and Meryl.

1088
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:35,560
And there's a role I'd like you to come in and audition for. So I went in, auditioned, cast me

1089
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:42,120
as this mugger on a subway. Then there's this whole upheaval that happens because he then

1090
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:49,160
doesn't continue with Mandy Pitemkin. Mandy leaves the movie and he asks Jack Nicholson to come in

1091
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:56,840
and replace Mandy Pitemkin. So now I had no scenes with him, but I'm in a movie with Jack

1092
01:56:56,840 --> 01:57:03,800
Nicholson and Meryl Streep. And my first scene in this movie, which I shot on my birthday, July 26th

1093
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:12,280
of 85, I got to wink at Meryl Streep in this scene. And I was so nervous. I literally couldn't

1094
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:20,600
wink. Nichols had to like, calm me down and help me wink. But that became my first, my very first

1095
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:27,480
film. And he was incredible. And he let me come and watch when they were shooting scenes. I wasn't in.

1096
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:33,880
And I remember ending up one day in the makeup trailer on the same day we were working. Jack and

1097
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,680
me, we had no scene together. But I remember him coming in and they put him down in the chair and

1098
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:45,000
they put cucumbers, frozen cucumbers on his eyes and did his neck. And then they raised him up and

1099
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,440
did his face. And then I remember Nicholson went like this, looked in the mirror and he went,

1100
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:59,880
another day, another $50,000. And walked out of the trailer.

1101
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:08,280
What was Christopher Walker like? Oh, so he's a theater guy too. Oh, yeah. He started out as a

1102
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:16,440
course boy, dancer. Oh, I can see that. Yeah. I know I'm walking a long time and I did a

1103
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:25,000
Saturday Live where I did, we did these Star Wars auditions. I did Chris Walken as Hans.

1104
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:32,200
So good. And I'll never forget this. I was in Los Angeles about two weeks after and I was at

1105
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:36,520
Chateau Marmal. There's some party happening at Chateau Marmal. And I saw Chris Walken come

1106
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:43,160
out of onto the balcony and I was like, Oh, it's Chris Walken. And he walked up to me and he went,

1107
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,680
Kevin, I saw you little sketch. It was funny. Haha.

1108
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:00,920
Oh, man, it was a really good sketch. And that guy, there's certain people that are truly unique

1109
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:08,840
and unapologetic, continue being that throughout their whole career, the way they talk, the

1110
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:15,400
musicality of how they talk, how they are, their way of being, he's that. And it somehow works.

1111
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:24,360
His watch. Yeah. I mean, it works in so many different contexts. He plays like a mobster in

1112
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:30,760
true romance. And it's like genius. That's genius. But he could be anything. He could be soft. He

1113
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:36,200
could be a badass, all of it. And he's always Christopher Walken, but somehow works for all

1114
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:42,920
these different characters. So I guess we were talking about House of Cards like two hours ago

1115
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:50,120
before we took a tangent upon a tangent, but there's a moment in episode one where President

1116
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:54,760
Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him a Secretary of State.

1117
01:59:56,360 --> 02:00:01,880
Was this when the monster in Frank was born? Or was the monster always there? The sort of,

1118
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,480
for you looking at that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there's loyalty

1119
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:16,040
and that broke him? Or did he always know that there is, this whole world is about manipulation

1120
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:22,200
and do anything to get power? Well, I mean, it might have been the first moment an audience saw

1121
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:28,280
him be betrayed, but it certainly was not the first betrayal he'd experienced. And once you start

1122
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:33,160
to get to know him and learn about his life and learn about his father and learn about his, you

1123
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:39,400
know, friends and learn about their relationship and learn what he was like even as a cadet,

1124
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:43,560
I think you start to realize that this is a man who has

1125
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:54,600
very strong beliefs about loyalty. And so it wasn't the first, it was just the first moment that

1126
02:00:56,040 --> 02:01:02,440
in terms of the storyline that's being built, Night Takes King was the name of our production

1127
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:09,960
company. Yeah. What do you think motivated him at that moment and throughout the show?

1128
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:16,680
Was it all about power and also legacy? Or was there some small part underneath it all where he

1129
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:26,360
wanted to actually do good in the world? No, I think power is a afterthought.

1130
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:33,240
What he loved more than anything was being able to predict how human beings would react.

1131
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:45,000
He was a behavioral psychologist and he could know like he was 17 moves ahead in the chess game.

1132
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:51,880
He could know if he did this at this moment that eventually this would happen.

1133
02:01:52,840 --> 02:02:03,560
He was able to be predictive and was usually right. He knew just how far he needed to push someone

1134
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:08,280
to get them to do what he needed them to do in order to make the next step work.

1135
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:16,760
You've played a bunch of evil characters. Well, you call them evil. But you don't,

1136
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:20,680
but the reason I say that, I don't mean to be snarky about it, but the reason I say it that way

1137
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:29,560
is because I never judge the people I play. And the people that I have played or that any actor

1138
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:40,120
has played don't necessarily view themselves as this label. It's easy to say, but that's not

1139
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:48,920
the way I can think. I cannot judge a character I play and then play them well. I have to be

1140
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:55,400
free of judgment. I have to just play them and let the cards drop where they may

1141
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:00,520
and let an audience judge. I mean, the fact that you use that word is perfectly fine.

1142
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:07,320
But it's like people asking me, was I really from K-Pax or not? It just entirely depends on

1143
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:15,640
your perspective. Do roles like that, like seven, like Frank Underwood,

1144
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:26,440
like a lesser from American beauty, did they change you psychologically as a person? So walking

1145
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:35,400
around in the skin of these characters, these complex characters with very different moral

1146
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:50,920
systems. I absolutely believe that wandering around in someone else's ideas, in someone else's clothes,

1147
02:03:52,440 --> 02:04:02,920
in someone else's shoes, teaches you enormous empathy and that goes to the heart of not judging

1148
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:13,160
and I have found that I have been so moved by, I mean, look, yes, you've identified the darker

1149
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:21,160
characters, but I put Clarence Darrow three times. I've played a play called National Anthems. I've

1150
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:29,320
done movies like Recount. I've done films like The Ref. I've done films in which that doesn't

1151
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:36,440
exist in any of those characters, those qualities, paid forward. And so it is

1152
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:48,200
incredible to be able to embrace those things that I admire and that are like me and those

1153
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:55,800
things that I don't admire and aren't like me, but I have to put them on an equal footing and say,

1154
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:05,480
I have to just play them as best I can and not decide to wield judgment over them.

1155
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:07,560
Without judgment.

1156
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,000
Without judgment.

1157
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:15,960
In Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn famously writes about the line between good

1158
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:24,440
and evil and that it runs to the heart of every man. So the full paragraph there when he talks

1159
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:31,400
about the line. During the life of any heart, this line keeps changing place. Sometimes it is

1160
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:37,480
squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish.

1161
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:44,920
One and the same human being is at various ages under various circumstances a totally different

1162
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:52,600
human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't

1163
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:59,560
change. And to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil. What do you think about this note

1164
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:07,640
that we're all capable of good and evil and throughout life that line moves and shifts

1165
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:09,400
throughout the day, throughout every hour?

1166
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:16,840
Yeah, I mean one of the things that I've been focused on

1167
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:23,240
very succinctly is the idea that every day is an opportunity.

1168
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:36,520
It's an opportunity to make better decisions, to learn and to grow.

1169
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:51,400
And I also think that, look, I grew up not knowing if my parents loved me, particularly my father.

1170
02:06:55,320 --> 02:07:02,040
I never had a sense that I was loved and that stayed with me my whole life.

1171
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:15,720
And when I think back at who my father was and more succinctly who he became,

1172
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:28,040
it was a gradual and slow and sad development.

1173
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:37,720
When I've gone back and now I've looked at diaries my father kept and albums he kept, particularly

1174
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:44,920
when he was a medic in the U.S. Army, served our country with distinction.

1175
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:54,120
When the war was over and they went to Germany, the things my father said, the things that he

1176
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:59,160
wrote, the things that he believed were as patriotic as any American soldier who had ever served.

1177
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:07,240
But then when he came back to America and he had a dream of being a journalist

1178
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:13,320
or his big hope was that he was going to be the great American novelist.

1179
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:18,120
He wanted to be a creative novelist and so he sat in this office and he wrote

1180
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:24,600
for 45 years and never published anything.

1181
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:30,120
And somewhere along the way in order to make money he

1182
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:38,680
became what they call a technical procedure writer, which the best way to describe that is

1183
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:45,000
that if you built the F-16 aircraft, my father would have written the manual to tell you how to do it.

1184
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,960
I mean as boring, as technical, as tedious as you can imagine.

1185
02:08:52,040 --> 02:09:02,280
And so somewhere in the 60s and into the 70s my father fell in with groups of people and individuals

1186
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:10,520
pretend intellectuals who started to give him reasons why he was not successful as a white

1187
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:21,000
Aryan man in the United States. And over time my father became a white supremacist.

1188
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:34,680
And I cannot tell you the amount of times as a young boy that my father would sit me down

1189
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:42,920
and lecture me for hours and hours and hours about his

1190
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:54,120
fucked up ideas of America, of prejudice, of white supremacy. And thank God for my sister

1191
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:57,720
who said don't listen to a thing he says he's out of his mind.

1192
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:06,200
And even though I was young I knew everything he was saying was against people and I loved people.

1193
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:19,240
I had so many wonderful friends. My best friend Mike, who's still my close friend to this day,

1194
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:26,360
I was afraid to bring him to my house because I was afraid that my father would find out he was

1195
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:33,960
Jewish or that my father would leave his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag

1196
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:46,360
or his pictures of Hitler or Nazi books or what he might say. So when I found theater

1197
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:57,400
in the eighth grade and debate club and choir and festivals and plays and

1198
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:06,760
everything I could do to participate in that wouldn't make me have to come back home, I did.

1199
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:24,280
And I had to reconcile who he became because the gap between that man who was in the U.S.

1200
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:37,480
army as a medic and the man he became I could never fill that gap but I've forgiven him.

1201
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:44,280
But then at the same time I've had to look at my mother and say

1202
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:51,800
she made excuses for him. Oh he just needs to get it off his chest or it doesn't matter just let him

1203
02:11:51,800 --> 02:12:02,200
say. So while on the outside I would say oh yeah my mother loved me but she didn't protect me.

1204
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:15,960
So was the was all the stuff that she expressed and all of the attention and all the love that I

1205
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:22,600
felt was that because I became successful and I was able to fulfill an emptiness that she'd

1206
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:30,440
lived with her whole life with him? I don't know but I've had to ask myself

1207
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:39,080
those questions over these last years to try to reconcile that for myself.

1208
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:46,040
And the thing you wanted from them and for them is less hate and more love.

1209
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:55,960
Did your dad say he loves you? I don't have any memory of that. I was in a program and they were

1210
02:12:55,960 --> 02:13:03,960
showing us an experiment that they'd done with psychologists and mothers and fathers and their

1211
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:08,440
children and the children were anywhere between six months and a year sitting in a little crib.

1212
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:15,160
And the exercise was this parents are playing with the baby right there toys yada yada babies

1213
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:19,880
laughing at and then the psychologists would say stop and the parent would go like this.

1214
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:29,800
And you would then watch for the next two and a half three minutes this child trying to get their

1215
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:38,120
parents attention in any possible way and I remember when I was sitting in this theater watching this

1216
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:48,520
baby I saw myself that was me screaming and reaching out and trying to get my parents

1217
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:55,560
attention that was me and that was not something I'd I'd ever remembered before

1218
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:59,320
but I I knew that what that baby was going through.

1219
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:12,120
Is there some elements of politics and maybe the private sector that are captured by the by

1220
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:18,520
house of cards like how true to life do you think that is from everything you've seen about politics

1221
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:25,080
for maybe everything you've seen about the politicians of this particular elections.

1222
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:33,240
I heard so many different reactions from politicians about house of cards some would say

1223
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:38,840
oh it's not like that at all and then others would say it's closer to the truth than anyone

1224
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:44,360
wants to admit and I think I fall down in the side of that idea.

1225
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:54,600
I have to interview some world leaders some big politicians

1226
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:03,400
in your understanding of trying to become Frank Underwood what advice would you give

1227
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:11,400
in interviewing Frank Underwood. How to how to get it to say anything that's at all honest.

1228
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:15,720
Well in Frank's case all you have to do is tell him to look into the camera and he'll tell

1229
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:20,600
he'll tell you what you want to hear. Unfortunately we don't get that look

1230
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:26,520
into the the mind of a person the way we do with Frank Underwood in real life sadly.

1231
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:32,040
Well but you could say to somebody you like the series house of cards you know I'd love

1232
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:37,240
for you to just look into the camera and tell us what's really going on what you really feel about

1233
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:43,880
blah blah blah. That's a good technique I'll try that with Zelensky with Putin.

1234
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:53,160
What do you hope your legacy as an actor is and as a human being. People ask me now

1235
02:15:54,600 --> 02:16:02,280
what's your favorite performance you've ever given and my answer is I haven't given it yet.

1236
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:13,080
So there's a lot more that I want to be challenged by be inspired by.

1237
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:23,480
There's a lot that I don't know there's a lot I have to learn

1238
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:31,560
and that is a very exciting place to feel that I'm in.

1239
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:38,360
You know it's been interesting because you know we're we're going back we're talking

1240
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:47,880
and you know it's it's nice to go back every now and then but I'm focused on on what's next.

1241
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,640
Do you hope the world forgives you.

1242
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:01,320
People go to church every week to be forgiven

1243
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:09,240
and I believe that forgiveness and I believe that redemption are beautiful things. I mean look

1244
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:16,440
don't forget I live in an industry in which there is a tremendous amount of conversation about

1245
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:22,280
redemption from a lot of people who are very serious people in very serious positions

1246
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:31,240
who believe in it. I mean that guy who finally got out of prison he was wrongly accused that guy

1247
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:38,200
who served his time and got out of prison. We see so many people saying let's find a path for that

1248
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:47,800
person let's help that person rejoin society but there is an odd situation if you're in the

1249
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:56,440
entertainment industry you're not offered that kind of a path and I hope that the fear that

1250
02:17:56,440 --> 02:18:03,240
people are experiencing will eventually subside and common sense will get back to the table.

1251
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:09,720
If it does do you think you have another Oscar worthy performance in you.

1252
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:16,280
Listen if it would piss off Jack Lemmon again for me to win a third time I absolutely think so yeah.

1253
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:22,600
Well you have to mention him again you know Ernest Hemingway once said that the world is

1254
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:29,960
a fine place and worth fighting for and I agree with him on both counts. Kevin thank you so much

1255
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:35,960
for talking to me thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kevin Spacey to support

1256
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:41,160
this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some

1257
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:49,560
words from Meryl Streep acting is not about being someone different it's finding the similarity

1258
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:57,480
in what is apparently different and then finding myself in there thank you for listening and hope

1259
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:07,480
to see you next time.
