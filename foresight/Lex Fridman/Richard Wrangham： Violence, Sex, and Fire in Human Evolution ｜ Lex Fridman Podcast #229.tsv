0	3240	The following is a conversation with Richard Rangham,
3240	5720	a biological anthropologist at Harvard,
5720	8240	specializing in the study of primates
8240	12200	and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,
12200	15160	and other aspects of ape and human behavior
15160	18360	at the individual and societal level.
18360	20960	He began his career over four decades ago
20960	22320	working with Jane Goodall
22320	24560	and studying the behavior of chimps.
24560	27320	And since then, has done a lot of seminal work
27320	28640	on human evolution
28800	30840	and has proposed several theories
30840	33480	for the roles of fire and violence
33480	36680	in the evolution of us, hairless apes,
36680	39560	otherwise known as homo sapiens.

43600	44960	in the description.
44960	49040	And now, here's my conversation with Richard Rangham.
50080	53160	You've said that we are much less violent
53160	57080	than our close living relatives, the chimps.
57080	61040	Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are
61040	64560	and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?
64560	66040	Well, I haven't said exactly
66040	68000	that we're less violent than chimps.
68000	71320	What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.
71320	73320	One stems from proactive aggression
73320	75640	and the other stems from reactive aggression.
75640	77880	Proactive aggression is planned aggression.
77880	80800	Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.
80800	84600	It's reactive because it takes place
84600	86880	in seconds after the threat.
88000	90920	And the thing that is really striking about humans
90920	93840	compared to our close relatives
93840	98840	is the great reduction in the degree of reactive aggression.
100280	103240	So we are far less violent than chimps
103240	106760	when prompted by some relatively minor threat
106760	108680	within our own society.
108680	113680	And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data,
114520	119520	but the study which is particularly striking
119520	124520	is one of people living as hunter-gatherers
125240	129760	in a really upsetting kind of environment,
129760	134760	namely people in Australia living in a place
135360	139200	where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.
139200	141560	There's a lot of domestic violence.
141800	146800	It's all a sort of a society that is as bad
149240	150560	from the point of view of violence
150560	153160	as an ordinary society can get.
154200	156960	There's excellent data on the frequency
156960	159240	with which people actually have physical violence
159240	160440	and hit each other.
160440	165080	And we can compare that to data from several different sites
165080	170080	comparing, we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence
170440	174040	and the difference is between two and three orders
174040	177560	of magnitude, the frequency with which chimps and bonobos
177560	180760	hit each other, chase each other, charge each other,
180760	185760	physically engage is some day between 500 and 1,000 times
186400	188440	higher than in humans.
188440	189960	So there's something just amazing about us
189960	193680	and this has been recognized for centuries.
193680	196040	Aristotle drew attention to the fact
196040	199080	that we behave in many ways like domesticated animals
199080	201360	because we're so unviolent.
201360	206360	But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements
206840	211000	of this 20th century, the First and Second World War
211000	213680	and much else besides.
213680	217160	And that is all proactive violence.
217160	222160	All of that is gangs of people making deliberate decisions
223480	226080	to go off and attack in circumstances
226080	229640	which ideally the attackers are going to be able
229640	232440	to make their kills and then get out of there.
233360	235960	In other words, not face confrontation.
235960	238800	That's the ordinary way that arm is trying to work.
238800	243800	And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees
244920	247160	are in a very similar kind of state.
247160	251000	That is to say, if you look at the rate of death
251000	253800	from chimpanzees conducting proactive
253840	257200	co-editionary violence, it's very similar
257200	260320	in many ways to what you see in humans.
260320	263600	So when not downregulated with proactive violence,
263600	265760	it's just this reactive violence
265760	269200	that is strikingly reduced in humans.
269200	273240	So chimpanzees also practice kind of tribal warfare.
274080	276080	Indeed they do, yeah.
276080	278960	So this was discovered first in 1974.
278960	281000	It was observed first in 1974,
281960	283640	which was about the time
283640	288640	that the first major study of chimpanzees in the wild
289480	294480	by Jane Goodall had been going for something like five years
295480	300480	during, of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.
302760	307000	Until then they'd been observed at a feeding station
307000	311040	where Jane was luring them in to be observed
311040	312920	by seeing bananas, which is great.
312920	315320	She learned a lot, but she didn't learn
315320	317920	what was happening at the edges of their ranges.
317920	322480	So five years later, it became very obvious
322480	325640	that there was hostile relationships between groups.
325640	330560	And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form
330560	332600	of the kind of hostile relationships
332600	333720	that you see in many animals,
333720	338720	which is a bunch of chimps in this case shouting
340360	343920	at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.
344960	347560	But dramatically, in addition to that,
347560	349320	there is a second kind of interaction.
349320	354320	And that is when a party of chimpanzees
355960	359600	makes a deliberate venture
359600	362240	to the edge of their territory,
362240	367240	silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.
368200	371760	And what they're searching for is a lone individual.
371760	373160	So I've been with chimps
373160	377960	when they've heard a lone individual under these circumstances
377960	379960	or what they think is a lone one
379960	383040	and they touch each other and look at each other
383040	386120	and then charge forward, very excited.
387520	390880	And then while they're charging,
390920	395560	all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call
395560	397560	erupts with a volley of calls.
397560	400880	It was just one calling out of a larger party.
400880	403520	And our chimps put on the brakes
403520	406720	and scoot back for safety into their own territory.
406720	409720	But if in fact they do find a lone individual
409720	412480	and they can sneak up to them,
412480	415040	then they make a deliberate attack.
415040	417560	They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting
417560	420680	and then they impose terrible damage,
420680	423080	which typically ends in a kill straight away,
423080	428080	but it might end up with the victim so damaged
428360	433360	that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.
433560	435400	So that was a very dramatic discovery
435400	440400	because it really made people realize for the first time
440520	442800	that Conrad Lorenz had been wrong
442800	446920	when in the 1960s, in his famous book On Aggression,
446920	450800	he said warfare is restricted to humans.
450800	453080	Animals do not deliberately kill each other.
453080	455160	Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals
455160	456400	that deliberately kill each other
456400	459680	and they always do so under essentially the same circumstances
459680	464200	which is when they feel safe doing it.
464200	466880	So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.
468280	472400	Animals feel safe when they have a coalition,
472400	474840	a coalition that has overwhelming power
474840	476720	compared to the victim.
476760	479440	And so wolves will do that and lions will do that
479440	480880	and hyenas will do that
480880	484320	and chimpanzees will do it and humans do it too.
485360	488480	Can they pull themselves into something
488480	490600	that looks more like a symmetric war
490600	492680	as opposed to an asymmetric one?
492680	495320	So accidentally engaging on the lone individual
495320	497240	and getting the cells into trouble?
497240	501400	Are they more aggressive in avoiding these kinds of battles?
501400	504080	No, they're very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,
504120	507720	but occasionally they can make a mistake.
508880	512360	But so far there have been no observations
512360	514760	of anything like a battle in which
514760	517320	both sides maintain themselves.
517320	520320	And I think you can very confidently say
520320	522800	that overwhelmingly what happens is that
522800	525120	if they discover that there's several individuals
525120	528320	on the other side, then both sides retreat.
528320	530360	Nobody wants to get hurt.
530360	532080	What they want to do is to hurt others.
532760	536680	So you mentioned Jane Goodall, you've worked with her.
536680	538160	What was it like working with her?
538160	539760	What have you learned from her?
541120	544960	Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person
544960	549720	who she famously began her studies
549720	554720	not as a qualified person in terms of education,
556320	559640	but qualified only by enthusiasm
559640	564320	and considerable experience even in her early 20s with nature.
566320	568720	So she's courageous in the sense of being able
568720	572080	to take on challenges.
572080	574400	The thing that is very impressive about her
574400	579880	is her total fidelity to the observations,
580920	585920	very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,
586800	588520	waiting until they mount up
588520	590600	and you've really got a confident picture,
592160	596920	and tremendous attention to individuals.
596920	600480	So that was an interesting problem from her point of view
600480	605480	because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,
605680	609480	this particular community of Casa Calo, about 60 individuals,
610960	614760	so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.
614760	616600	She was there initially with her mother
616600	620520	and then alone for two or three years
620520	622760	of really intense observation
622760	624920	and then slowly joined by other people.
626360	631360	What she discovered was that there were obvious differences
631760	634680	in individual personality.
634680	639160	And the difficulty about that was that when she reported this
639160	643160	to the larger scientific world,
643160	646000	initially her advisors at Cambridge,
647560	649960	they said, well, we don't know how to handle that
649960	653200	because you've got to treat all these animals
653200	655040	as the same basically because
657560	660560	there is no research tradition
660560	663320	of thinking about personalities.
663320	666800	Well, now, whatever it is, 60 years later,
667920	671600	the study of personalities is a very rich part
671600	673320	of the study of animal behavior.
674720	678040	At any rate, the important point in terms of what was she like
678040	680360	is that she stuck to her guns and she absolutely insisted
680360	685360	that we have to show, describe in great detail,
685360	688440	the differences in personality among these individuals
688440	690480	and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologist
690480	692720	to think about what it means.
692720	697720	So what is the process of observation like this like?
697960	699280	Observing the personality,
699280	703920	but also observing in a way that's not projecting your beliefs
703920	708840	about human nature or animal nature onto chimps,
708840	712600	which is probably really tempting to project.
712600	715960	So your understanding of the way the human world works,
715960	719440	projecting that onto the chimp world.
719440	721640	Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps
721640	725240	because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior
725240	729000	that it's very easy to make those projections.
729000	732240	As you say, the process involves
733440	737000	making very clear definitions of what a behavior is.
738520	743520	Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,
744320	745680	a bite and so on.
746800	750360	And writing down every time these things happen
750360	752720	and then slowly totting up the numbers of times
752720	756680	that they happen from individual A towards individuals,
756680	761640	B, C, D and E, so that you build up a very concrete picture
761640	763800	rather than interpreting at any point
763800	765640	and stopping and saying, well,
765640	767400	they seem to be rather aggressive.
768440	773360	So the formal system is that you build up a pattern
773360	777440	of the relationships based on a description
777440	779520	of the different types of interactions,
779520	782040	the aggressive and the friendly interactions.
783040	786040	And all of these are defined in concrete.
787600	792280	And so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships.
792280	796280	And the relationships can be defined as
798600	803760	relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive,
803760	807440	based on the frequency of these types of interactions.
807440	811000	And so one can talk in terms of individuals
811040	815040	having a relationship which on the scores of friendliness
815040	818160	is two standard deviations outside the mean.
819360	821040	I mean, you know, it's-
821040	824680	In which direction, sorry, both directions?
825720	828920	Well, I mean, there will be obviously the friendly ones
828920	832040	would be the ones who have exceptionally high rates
832040	834480	of spending time close to each other,
834480	836600	of touching each other in a gentle way,
836600	839120	of grooming each other.
839120	841120	And by the way, finding that those things
841120	843440	are correlated with each other.
843440	848360	So it's possible to define a friendship with a capital F
848360	850160	in a very systematic way.
850160	854800	And to compare that between individuals,
854800	858800	but also between communities of chimpanzees
858800	861120	and between different species.
861120	863480	So that, you know, we can say that in some species,
863480	866880	individuals have friends and others, they don't at all.
866880	869720	What about just because there's different personalities
869720	871920	and because they're so fascinating,
871920	873640	what about sort of falling in love
873640	877240	or forming friendships with chimps, you know?
877240	882240	Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer.
883920	886360	What role does that play?
886360	888000	Is you're tracking these individuals
888000	890800	that are full of life and intelligence
890800	895640	for long periods of time, plus as a human,
895680	898160	especially in those days for Jane,
898160	900320	she's alone observing it.
900320	902120	It gets lonely as a human.
902120	904800	I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human
904800	907760	being observed these other intelligent species.
907760	908920	It's a very reasonable question.
908920	911640	And of course, Jane in those early years,
911640	915320	I think she's willing now to talk about the fact
915320	919880	that she regrets to some extent how close she became.
921480	923680	And the problem is not just from the humans,
923680	925480	the problem is from the chimpanzees as well,
925480	930320	because they do things that are extremely affectionate,
931640	935040	if you like, you know, at one point,
935040	940040	Jane offered a ripe fruit to a chimpanzee
940720	942280	called David Greybeard.
942280	946400	David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand
947720	948840	as if to say thank you.
948840	951200	And then I think he gave it back if I remember rightly.
951200	952040	Yeah.
953520	955080	No, thank you.
955080	955920	All right.
957400	959440	Oh, it's almost like thank you
959440	962920	and returning the affection by giving the fruit
962920	964240	if they did something like that.
964240	966080	You know, it was a gentle squeeze.
966080	968200	I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard
968200	970280	as that occasionally has happened.
971440	973520	Some chimps are aggressive to people
974720	976480	and others are friendly.
976480	979000	And the ones that are friendly tend to be
979000	980320	rather sympathetic characters
980320	984240	because they might be ones who are having problems
984280	986440	in their own society.
986440	990160	So Joe Mio in Gombe used to come and sit next to me
990160	993840	quite often and he was having a hard time
993840	995840	making it in that society,
995840	996880	which I can describe to you
996880	999760	in terms of the number of aggressive interactions if you want,
999760	1003360	but just to be informed about it.
1003360	1008360	So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.
1009200	1011720	And in the community that I've been working with
1011720	1013360	in Uganda for the last 30 years,
1013400	1016120	we try extremely hard to impress
1016120	1018440	on all of the research students who come with us
1018440	1020160	that it is absolutely vital
1020160	1022800	that you do not fall into that temptation.
1022800	1025920	Now, you know, we heard a story of one person
1025920	1029360	who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.
1029360	1032240	It's a very, very bad idea.
1032240	1036400	Not because the chimp is going to do anything violent
1036400	1041200	at the time, but because if they learn
1041200	1044440	that humans are as weak physically
1044440	1046080	as we are compared to them,
1046080	1048800	then they can take advantage of it, us.
1048800	1050800	And that's what happened in Gombe.
1050800	1055400	So after Jane had done the very obvious thing
1055400	1058840	when you're first engaged in this game
1058840	1061600	of allowing the infants to approach her
1061600	1063840	and then tickling them and playing with them,
1065560	1069200	some of those infants had the personality
1069200	1073360	of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.
1073360	1076120	And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,
1076120	1079280	who was violent on a regular basis
1079280	1080760	towards humans when he was an adult
1080760	1081720	and he was quite dangerous.
1081720	1082960	I mean, he could easily have killed someone.
1082960	1085120	In fact, he did kill one person.
1085120	1089760	He killed a baby that he took from a mother,
1089760	1092040	a human baby that he took off her hip
1092040	1093880	when he met her on the path.
1094840	1098720	So, you know, it's a reminder that we're dealing with
1098720	1102080	a species that are rather human-like
1102080	1104040	in the range of emotions they have,
1104040	1105960	in the capacities they have,
1105960	1108560	and even in the strength they have,
1108560	1112720	they are, you know, in many ways stronger than humans.
1112720	1114840	So it's a...
1114840	1116800	You've got to be careful.
1116800	1119600	So in the full range of friendliness and violence,
1119600	1123480	the capacity for these very human things.
1124120	1127360	Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,
1127360	1130280	as we talked about, you know, that they will kill,
1130280	1132120	they will kill not just strangers.
1133320	1137680	They can kill other adults within their own group.
1137680	1139720	They can kill babies that are strangers.
1139720	1141280	They can kill babies in their own group.
1141280	1144480	So, you know, this is a long-lived individual.
1144480	1146720	Obviously, these killings can't have very often
1146720	1149400	because otherwise they'd all be dead.
1149400	1153440	And we're now finding that they can live to 50 or 60 years
1153440	1156240	in the wild at relatively low population density
1156240	1157360	because they're big animals,
1157360	1160520	eating a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.
1162440	1163960	So it doesn't happen all the time.
1163960	1168840	With friendliness, they are very strong to support each other.
1168840	1173840	They very much depend on their close friendships,
1174680	1178960	which they express through physical contact.
1179000	1181680	And particularly through grooming.
1181680	1185760	So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another
1185760	1188320	and might present for grooming,
1188320	1192120	a very common way of starting, turning their back
1192120	1193880	or presenting an arm or something like that.
1193880	1197880	And the other just riffles their fingers through the hair.
1197880	1200520	And that's partly just soothing.
1200520	1204400	And it's partly looking for parasites,
1204400	1205800	but mostly it's just soothing.
1205800	1206640	Yes.
1207280	1212080	The point about this is it can go on for half an hour.
1212080	1215480	It can go on for sometimes even an hour.
1215480	1220080	So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.
1221360	1225760	When did your interest in this one particular aspect
1225760	1229000	of chimp come to be, which is violence?
1229000	1232320	When did the study of violence in chimps
1232320	1234520	become something you're deeply interested in?
1235520	1240520	Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,
1241520	1243040	I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall
1243040	1246200	and was studying feeding behavior.
1246200	1249080	But during that time, we were seeing,
1249080	1252440	and I say we because there were half a dozen
1252440	1255840	research students all in her camp,
1258440	1262360	we were discovering that chimps had this capacity
1262400	1265080	for violence.
1265080	1267520	The first kill happened during that time,
1267520	1270040	which was of an infant and a neighboring group.
1271720	1275280	And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.
1276160	1278880	And this was the start of my interest
1278880	1281840	because it was such chilling evidence
1281840	1286840	of an extraordinary similarity between chimps and humans.
1287840	1291800	Now, at that time, we didn't know very much
1291800	1295560	about how chimpanzees and humans were related.
1295560	1301040	Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three big black hairy things
1301040	1305040	that live in the African forests and eat fruits
1305040	1309760	and leaves when they can't find fruits and walk on their knuckles.
1309760	1311320	And they all look rather similar to each other.
1311320	1314320	So they seem as though those three species,
1314840	1316720	chimps and gorillas and bonobos,
1316720	1319400	should all be each other's closest relatives.
1319400	1321520	And humans are something rather separate.
1321520	1324640	And so any of them would be of interest to us.
1324640	1328520	Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true
1328520	1330440	and that there's a special relationship
1330440	1333400	between humans and chimpanzees.
1333400	1335920	But at the time, even without knowing that,
1335920	1338440	it was obvious that there was something very odd
1338440	1342760	about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered
1342840	1345440	they were making tools.
1345440	1349080	She had seen that they were hunting meat.
1349080	1353200	She had seen that they were sharing the meat among each other.
1353200	1355200	She had seen that the societies
1355200	1357320	were dominated politically by males,
1357320	1358680	coalitions of males.
1358680	1360480	All of these things, of course, resonate
1360480	1363200	so closely with humans.
1363200	1367440	And then it turns out that in contrast
1367440	1370120	to conventional wisdom at the time,
1370120	1373240	the chimpanzees were capable of hunting
1373240	1375320	and killing members of neighboring groups.
1376680	1380440	Well, at that point, the similarities
1380440	1384640	between chimps and humans become less a matter
1384640	1389200	of sort of sheer intellectual fascination
1389200	1391560	than something that has a really deep meaning
1391560	1394600	about our understanding of ourselves.
1395640	1399760	I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans
1399760	1402960	as a species apart from the rest of nature
1402960	1404800	because we are so peculiar.
1404800	1408480	But when it turns out that, as it turns out,
1408480	1410000	one of our two closest relatives
1411800	1414840	has got these features that we share
1414840	1417720	and that one of the features is something
1417720	1422640	that is the most horrendous, as well as fascinating,
1422640	1426440	aspect of human behavior, then how can you resist
1426440	1429320	just trying to find out what's going on?
1430000	1431640	So I have to say this.
1431640	1434480	I'm not sure if you're familiar with the man,
1434480	1436360	but fans of this podcast are.
1436360	1439960	So we're talking about chimps, we're talking about violence.
1439960	1444320	My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan, is a big fan of those things.
1444320	1446160	I'm a big fan of these topics.
1446160	1450160	I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.
1450160	1455160	So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration
1456640	1459600	of violence and the relations between chimps
1459600	1460920	so interesting?
1460920	1464000	What can they teach us about ourselves?
1466200	1469800	Until we had this information about chimpanzees,
1469800	1474800	it was possible to believe that the psychology
1477560	1482560	behind warfare was totally the result
1483640	1488640	of some kind of cultural, recent cultural innovation.
1489600	1491600	It had nothing to do with our biology.
1492600	1496240	Or if you like, that it's got something to do with sin
1496240	1499480	and God and the devil and that sort of thing.
1501000	1506000	But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully about it
1508200	1511720	is that it seems undoubtedly the case
1511720	1516720	that our evolutionary psychology has given us
1517720	1522720	the same kind of attitude towards violence
1522720	1525440	as occurred in chimpanzees.
1526480	1529400	And in both species, it has evolved
1529400	1532120	because of its evolutionary significance.
1532120	1534640	In other words, because it's been helpful
1534640	1537920	to the individuals who have practiced it.
1537920	1541920	And now we know that, as I mentioned,
1541920	1544160	other species do this as well.
1544160	1549160	In fact, wolves, which this is a really
1549240	1554240	kind of ironical observation, Conrad Lorenz,
1554240	1556440	who I mentioned had been the person who thought
1556440	1560720	that human aggression in the form of killing
1560720	1564120	members of our own species was unique to our species.
1564120	1565640	He was a great fan of wolves.
1565640	1567040	He studied wolves.
1567040	1571040	And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely
1571040	1575840	to harm each other in spats among members
1575840	1577480	of the same group.
1577480	1579200	What happens is that one of them will roll over
1579200	1580680	and present their neck, much as you see
1580680	1582440	in a dog park nowadays.
1582440	1585720	And the other might put their jaws on the neck
1585720	1586640	but will not bite.
1587840	1590320	Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves
1590320	1594080	in the wild, then neighboring packs
1594080	1596800	often go hunting for each other.
1596800	1599360	They are in fierce competition.
1599360	1603760	And as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves
1603760	1607600	is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.
1607600	1608440	Wow.
1608440	1610280	So it's a really serious business.
1611360	1615540	The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern
1615540	1617920	of understanding animals in which
1619800	1622080	you don't have an instinct for violence.
1622080	1625160	What you have is an instinct, if you like,
1625160	1627840	to use violence adaptively.
1627880	1631760	And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive.
1631760	1634800	If the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.
1634800	1638440	So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent
1638440	1642240	than others because of things like the frequency
1642240	1645880	with which a large party of males is likely
1645880	1648120	to meet a lone victim.
1648120	1650560	And that's going to depend on the local ecology.
1651960	1655760	But so the overall answer to the question
1655840	1659360	what a chimps teach us is that we have to take
1659360	1663360	very seriously the notion that in humans,
1664280	1669040	the tendency to make war is a consequence
1669040	1672440	of a long-term evolutionary adaptation
1672440	1675120	and not just a military ideology
1675120	1679360	or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.
1680440	1683080	And of course, a reading of history,
1683080	1687200	a judicious reading of history fits that very easily
1687200	1689920	because war is so commonplace.
1690880	1691800	It's not an accident.
1691800	1694640	So it's not a construction of human civilization.
1694640	1697600	It's deeply within us, violence.
1697600	1700480	So what's the difference between violence
1700480	1703000	on the individual level versus group?
1704720	1706960	It seems like with chimps and with wolves,
1706960	1710840	there's something about the dynamic of multiple
1711840	1716320	chimps together that increase the chance of violence.
1716320	1721040	Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?
1721040	1725040	Like would an individual be as violent
1725040	1728000	as they might be as part of a group?
1728000	1731240	If we're talking about killing,
1731240	1734240	then violence in the sense of killing
1734240	1739000	is very much associated with a group.
1739040	1743960	And the reason is that individuals don't benefit
1743960	1745600	by getting into a fight
1745600	1748680	in which they risk being hurt themselves.
1748680	1752680	So it's only when you have overwhelming power
1752680	1756800	that the temptation to try and kill another victim
1756800	1760640	rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.
1763400	1767880	The average number of chimpanzee males
1767920	1770520	that attack a single male
1770520	1773200	in something like 50 observations
1773200	1776040	that have accumulated in the last 50 years
1776040	1781040	from various different study sites is eight, eight to one.
1781960	1786840	Now sometimes it can go as low as three to one,
1786840	1789520	but that's getting risky.
1789520	1791680	But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.
1791680	1795960	I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,
1795960	1797120	another male on another foot,
1797120	1799680	another male on an arm, another male on another arm.
1799680	1802520	Now you have an immobilized victim
1802520	1806360	with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.
1806360	1808720	And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax
1808720	1810200	and tear off his testicles
1810200	1812560	and twist an arm until it breaks
1812560	1816760	and do this, you know, appalling damage with no weapons.
1818480	1823480	What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?
1823680	1824880	Is there something to be said
1824880	1827840	about like the actual process of it?
1827840	1829400	Is there an artistry to it?
1829400	1832400	So if you look at human warfare,
1832400	1834240	there's different parts in history,
1834240	1837840	preferred different kind of approaches to violence.
1837840	1841280	It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.
1841280	1844880	But just the nature of violence itself,
1844880	1847560	sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,
1847560	1849120	is it basically the same?
1849120	1853440	You improvise, you immobilize the victim
1853440	1855000	and they just rip off different parts
1855000	1856800	of their body kind of thing.
1856800	1859880	Yeah, you have to understand that these things
1859880	1864880	are happening at high speed in thick vegetation, mostly.
1866160	1869800	So they have not been filmed carefully.
1869800	1873720	You know, we have a few little glimpses of them
1873720	1876440	from one or two people like David Watts,
1876440	1877960	who's got some great video,
1877960	1881360	but we don't know enough to be able to say that.
1881360	1883920	It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles
1883920	1888480	that vary between communities, you know, cultural styles,
1888480	1892880	but it is possible and one thing that is striking
1892880	1895920	is that the number of times
1895920	1899280	that an individual victim has been killed immediately
1900240	1905240	has been higher in Kibali Forest in Uganda
1905240	1908640	than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.
1908640	1910200	It's conceivable, that's just chance.
1910200	1914360	We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?
1914360	1915440	I can't remember exact numbers,
1915440	1918240	but you know, 10 versus 15 or something.
1920160	1925160	So maybe they damage to the point of expecting a death
1926480	1929160	in one place and they just finish it off in the other,
1929160	1932120	but most likely that sort of difference
1932120	1937120	will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.
1937200	1939920	You know, human beings are able to conceive
1939920	1943400	of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.
1943400	1947520	Is there any of that for chimps
1948560	1950520	when they're thinking about violence?
1950520	1953560	Is violence, like what is the nature
1953560	1956560	of their conception of violence, do you think?
1956560	1961640	Do they realize they're taking another conscious being's life,
1961640	1965960	or is it some kind of like optimization
1965960	1968560	over the use of resources or something like that?
1970440	1973840	I don't think it's, I can't think of any way to get it
1973840	1976760	in answer to the question of what they know about that.
1978120	1983120	I think that the way to think about the motivation
1983320	1988320	is rather like the motivation in sex.
1989880	1994640	So when males are interested in having sex with a female,
1994640	1997080	whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,
1998880	2002040	they don't think about the fact that what this is going to do
2002040	2003320	is to lead to a baby.
2004160	2005280	Mostly.
2005280	2006120	You're right.
2006120	2007600	Mostly what they're thinking about is,
2007600	2008960	I want to get my end away.
2009920	2014520	And I think that it's a similar kind of process
2014520	2015800	with the chimps.
2015800	2017720	What they are thinking about is,
2018720	2021720	I want to kill this individual.
2021760	2023560	And it's hard to imagine that
2025200	2027640	taking the other individual's perspective
2027640	2030240	and thinking about what it means for them to die
2030240	2031800	is going to be an important part of that.
2031800	2033800	In fact, there's reasons to think
2033800	2035160	it should not be an important part of it
2035160	2036120	because it might inhibit them.
2036120	2038000	And they don't want to be inhibited.
2038000	2041720	They're more efficient they are in doing this the better.
2041720	2043640	But I think it's interesting to think about this
2043640	2044760	whole motivational question
2044760	2049760	because it does produce the sort of rather haunting thought
2049840	2051800	that there has been selection
2051800	2055640	in favor of enthusiasm about killing.
2057080	2062080	And in our relatively gentle
2062080	2066640	and deliberately moral society that we have today,
2066640	2069080	it's very difficult for us to face the thought
2069080	2072560	that in all of us,
2072560	2077320	there might have been a residue
2077320	2078800	and more than that,
2078800	2083640	sort of an active potential for that thought
2083640	2086640	of really enjoying killing someone else.
2087680	2092680	But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously
2092680	2096960	by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true
2098000	2103000	that the ordinary human male would be delighted
2103640	2106680	to be part of a group that was killing someone.
2106680	2110440	What you've got to do is to be in a position
2110440	2114320	where you're regarding the victim as dangerous
2114320	2116440	and thoroughly hostile.
2117640	2121080	But the pure enjoyment of violence.
2121080	2123960	There's, I don't know if you know this historian,
2123960	2126040	Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.
2126040	2131040	He has an episode three, four hour episode
2132120	2134960	that I recommend to others, it's quite haunting.
2134960	2138400	But he takes us through an entire history.
2138400	2140800	It's called painful tainment.
2140800	2145800	The history of humans enjoying the murder of others
2147720	2148920	in a large group.
2148920	2151840	So like public executions were part of,
2151840	2153640	long part of human history.
2153640	2158280	And there's something that for some reason,
2158280	2163400	humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.
2163400	2166840	And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.
2166840	2171440	For example, he said if it was possible to televise,
2171440	2174480	to stream online, for example, the execution
2174480	2178040	and the murder of somebody or even the torture of somebody
2178040	2183040	that a very large fraction of the population on earth
2183280	2185040	would not be able to look away.
2185040	2186800	They'd be drawn to that somehow.
2186800	2191800	As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.
2191800	2194080	So you think that's part of us in there somewhere,
2194080	2199080	that selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing
2199400	2204400	and the enjoyment of observing those in our tribe
2206440	2207520	doing the killing.
2208400	2211240	Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end
2211240	2216240	is critical, I think, because it would be a little bit weird,
2216360	2220840	I think, to imagine a lot of enjoyment
2220840	2223760	about people in your own tribe being killed.
2223760	2224600	Right.
2224600	2226320	I don't think we're interested in violence
2226320	2228440	for violence's sake that much.
2229920	2234920	It's when you get these social boundaries set up.
2235440	2239480	And in today's world, happily,
2240880	2244080	we kind of are already one world.
2245720	2249240	You have to dehumanise someone to get to the point
2249240	2254240	where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe
2254240	2257400	at some level, which is the whole human species.
2257400	2261160	But in ancient times, that would not have been true,
2261160	2262680	because in ancient times,
2263920	2267320	there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers
2267320	2270440	in which the appearance of a stranger
2271960	2276960	would lead to an immediate response of shooting on site.
2277440	2280640	Because what was human was the people
2280640	2283280	that were in your society.
2283280	2286160	And the other things that actually looked like us,
2286160	2289760	and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.
2290760	2293680	So there was a kind of automatic dehumanisation
2293680	2296200	of everybody that didn't speak our language
2296200	2300680	or hadn't already somehow become recognised
2300680	2305680	as sufficiently like us to escape the dehumanisation
2307040	2307880	of the human population.
2307880	2310000	And so hopefully the story of human history
2310000	2315000	is that we are, that tribalism fades away,
2315280	2319160	that our dehumanisation, the natural desire to dehumanise,
2319160	2322320	or tendency to dehumanise groups
2322320	2325840	that are not within this tribe decreases over time.
2325840	2329800	And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.
2329800	2332560	Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.
2332560	2336280	And the great sort of concern, of course,
2336280	2340440	is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts
2340440	2342160	and then dehumanisation happens
2342160	2343720	and then violence is released.
2344840	2349600	As Hannah Arendt says, there currently is no known alternative
2349600	2354400	to war as a means of settling really important conflicts.
2356560	2358800	So if we look at the big picture,
2358800	2362040	what role has violence or do you think violence
2362040	2365040	has played in the evolution of homo sapiens?
2365040	2369680	So we are quite an intelligent, got a beautiful,
2369680	2372960	particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.
2374080	2379080	What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?
2381840	2383960	Well, I think that violence was responsible
2383960	2386240	for creating your homo sapiens.
2389360	2394360	And that raises the question of what homo sapiens is.
2395040	2395880	Yes.
2397240	2398720	Yeah, exactly.
2398720	2403720	So nowadays people begin the sort of concept
2406640	2410800	of what homo sapiens is by thinking about features
2410800	2412360	that are very obviously different
2412360	2414800	from all of the other species of homo.
2415680	2420680	And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,
2421160	2424240	our relatively small face, these are characteristics
2424240	2427720	which are developed in a relatively modern way
2427720	2431160	by about 170,000 years ago.
2431160	2433960	Say, it's one of the earliest skulls in Africa
2433960	2436560	that really captures that.
2436560	2441560	But it has been argued that that is an episode
2444280	2449280	in a process that has been started substantially earlier.
2450280	2452240	And there's no doubt that that's true.
2452320	2455200	Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing
2455200	2460200	pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.
2460360	2463480	And it goes back to 300,000 years ago.
2463480	2468480	315, naturally, is the time, the best estimate of a date
2468680	2473680	for a series of bones from Morocco that have been dated
2474880	2476960	three or four years ago at that time
2476960	2481480	and have been characterized as earliest homo sapiens.
2481480	2485680	Now, at that point, they are only beginning
2485680	2487840	the trend of sapienization.
2487840	2491840	And that trend consists basically of grassinization,
2491840	2496840	of making our ancestors less robust, shorter faces,
2497920	2500720	smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,
2500720	2505520	narrower face, thinner cranium,
2505520	2508440	all these things that are associated
2508440	2510960	with reduced violence.
2511880	2516200	Okay, so that's saying, well, that's homo sapiens beginning.
2516200	2519640	So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago
2519640	2521640	because by 315,000 years ago,
2521640	2523400	you've already got something recognizable.
2523400	2525200	So you're more on that side of things
2525200	2526760	that those are this gradual process.
2526760	2529240	It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.
2529240	2533600	It started like 400,000 years ago.
2533600	2534440	And it's just-
2534440	2536400	It started three to 400,000 years ago.
2536400	2539960	And if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.
2539960	2543600	And then if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.
2543600	2545440	And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.
2545440	2546360	It's all the way.
2546360	2549160	It's just getting more and more like the moderns.
2549160	2550800	So the question is, what happened
2550800	2552600	between three and 400,000 years ago
2552600	2554720	to produce homo sapiens?
2554720	2558120	And I think we have a pretty good answer now.
2558120	2560160	And the answer comes from violence.
2560160	2564120	And the story begins by focusing on this question.
2564120	2569120	Why is it that in the human species,
2569120	2571560	we are unique among all primates
2571560	2575560	in not having an alpha male in any group
2576960	2579640	in the sense that what we don't have
2579640	2583840	is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?
2585280	2590280	And the answer that has been portrayed
2591560	2595960	most richly by Christopher Boehm
2595960	2598760	and whose work I've elaborated on
2598800	2603800	is that only in humans do you have a system
2604680	2608640	by which any male who tries to bully others
2609840	2613280	and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla
2613280	2615280	or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo
2615280	2617600	or an alpha baboon or anything like that,
2617600	2619640	any male who tries to do that in humans
2620640	2624520	gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.
2626800	2627960	That coalition?
2628160	2631560	I guess it's a really good picture of human society.
2631560	2632880	Yes, I like it.
2632880	2635680	Okay, so and that's the way all our societies work now.
2635680	2636520	Yes.
2636520	2638720	Because individuals try and be alpha
2638720	2640080	and then they get taken out.
2640080	2642040	Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves
2642040	2646520	as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.
2646520	2648440	Exactly, yes, exactly.
2649880	2654600	Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.
2654600	2656840	Well, what alpha males are are males
2656840	2660640	who respond with high reactive violence
2660640	2662760	to any challenge to their status.
2662760	2665120	You see it all the time in primates.
2665120	2668080	Some beta male thinks he's getting strong
2668080	2671720	and maturing in wisdom and so on
2671720	2675920	and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male
2675920	2679400	and the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.
2679400	2681680	Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes
2681680	2684360	or over and then take an opportunity to attack him.
2685200	2690200	All of these primates have got a high tendency
2691320	2693200	for reactive aggression
2693200	2696400	and that enables the possibility of alpha males.
2696400	2698600	We don't, we have this great reduction
2698600	2700400	as I talked about earlier.
2700400	2704000	And the question is when did that reduction happen?
2704000	2708520	Well, cut to the famous experiments
2708520	2712280	by the Russian biologist Dmitry Believ
2712320	2716320	who tried domesticating wild animals.
2717600	2719920	When you domesticate wild animals,
2719920	2723760	what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.
2724680	2728240	You are selecting those individuals to breed
2728240	2731960	who are most willing to be approached by a human
2731960	2734360	or by another member of their own species
2734360	2739360	and are least likely to erupt in a reactive aggression.
2740040	2742960	And you only have to do that for a few generations
2742960	2747120	to discover that there are changes in the skull
2747120	2750720	and those changes consist of
2753280	2756400	shorter face, smaller teeth,
2756400	2759360	a reduced maleness,
2759360	2761840	the males become increasingly female-like
2763160	2764920	and reduced brain size.
2766400	2768440	Well, the changes that are characteristic
2768480	2770440	of domesticated animals in general,
2770440	2771920	compared to wild animals,
2771920	2773920	are all found in homo sapiens
2773920	2776680	compared to our early ancestors.
2776680	2778440	So it's a very strong signal
2778440	2781080	that when we first see homo sapiens,
2781080	2782960	what we're seeing is evidence
2782960	2786280	of a reduction in reactive aggression.
2786280	2789400	And that suggests that what's happening with homo sapiens
2789400	2792080	is that that is the point
2792080	2795520	at which there is selection against the alpha males.
2795520	2799320	And therefore, the way in which the selection happened
2799320	2801480	would have been the way it happens today.
2801480	2802920	The beta males take them out.
2804200	2807520	So I think that homo sapiens is a species
2807520	2812520	characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression
2813320	2815400	as a kind of incidental consequence
2815400	2818520	of the suppression of the alpha male.
2818520	2820800	And the story of our species
2820800	2824160	is the story of how the beta males took charge.
2825760	2827920	And have been responsible
2827920	2832000	for the generation of a new kind of human.
2833400	2835040	And incidentally,
2836400	2841160	for imposing on the society
2841160	2844240	a new set of values.
2844240	2846720	Because when those beta males discovered
2846720	2849920	that they could take out the previous alpha male
2849920	2851040	and continue to do so,
2851040	2852200	because in every generation,
2852200	2853440	there'll always be some male who says,
2854080	2856200	maybe I'll become the alpha male.
2856200	2858280	So they just keep chopping them down.
2859600	2860600	In discovering that,
2860600	2862400	they also obviously discovered
2862400	2864400	that they could kill anybody in the group.
2865400	2867480	Females, young males,
2868440	2872000	anybody who didn't follow their values.
2872960	2875280	And so this story is one of,
2876160	2879560	one in which the males of our species,
2879560	2881480	and these would be the breeding males,
2882480	2886800	have been able to impose their values on everybody else.
2886800	2888120	And there was two kind of values.
2888120	2890040	There's one kind of value is things that are good
2890040	2892400	for the group, like thou shalt not murder.
2893920	2896120	And the other kind of value is things
2896120	2898120	that are good for the males.
2899480	2901240	Such as, hey, guess what?
2901240	2903440	When good food comes in, males get it first.
2903440	2904280	Yes.
2905320	2908520	So I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals
2908520	2911960	could outcompete the others.
2913000	2915400	Do you have a sense of why,
2915400	2917480	or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals
2917480	2919240	and all the other early humans.
2919240	2924240	Why did homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish
2924360	2925680	and all the other ones,
2925680	2929120	all the other branches of evolution died out?
2930600	2931720	Or got murdered out?
2931720	2936040	Nowadays when homo sapiens, meets homo sapiens,
2936040	2939200	and we don't know each other initially,
2939200	2940640	then conflict breaks out
2940640	2945640	and the more militarily able group wins.
2946760	2949120	You know, we've seen that everywhere
2949120	2953280	throughout the age of exploration and throughout history.
2954320	2956160	So I'm rather surprised, you know,
2956160	2960480	the conventional wisdom that you see nowadays
2960480	2964400	in contemporary anthropology is very reluctant
2964400	2968120	to point to success in warfare
2968120	2972480	as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals
2972480	2975560	within about 3,000 years of the sapiens
2975560	2978720	coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.
2979760	2982280	And people are much more inclined to say,
2982280	2985240	well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,
2985240	2990240	so they just couldn't survive the demographic sweep
2991240	2994040	or the disease came in.
2994040	2996600	You know, maybe those things might have been important,
2996600	3000040	but far and away, the most obvious possibility
3000040	3005040	is that sapiens were just powerful.
3006760	3009360	They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.
3010400	3011640	They had better weapons.
3012600	3015880	They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows
3015880	3020240	to judge from the little microlyth, bits of flake,
3022040	3023560	which the Neanderthals didn't.
3024840	3029040	You know, nowadays there's evidence of interbreeding,
3029040	3030440	quite extensive interbreeding
3030440	3033160	between sapiens and Neanderthals,
3033160	3035200	as well as with some other groups.
3035200	3037280	And sometimes people say, well, you know,
3037280	3038560	so they loved each other.
3038560	3040480	They made love, not war.
3040480	3042480	I think they made love and war.
3042760	3046520	And, you know, it wouldn't necessarily mean too loving.
3046520	3049240	I mean, if you just follow through
3049240	3051680	from typical ethnographies nowadays
3051680	3055400	of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,
3055400	3056840	they didn't know each other,
3056840	3060520	then you can imagine that Neanderthal females
3060520	3062400	would essentially be captured
3062400	3065360	and taken into sapiens groups.
3067120	3071200	Maybe you can comment on this cautiously
3072200	3076200	and eloquently, what's the role of sexual violence
3076200	3078000	in human evolution?
3078000	3081320	Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.
3081320	3083760	You've also mentioned that some of these rules
3083760	3088640	are defined by the male side of the society.
3088640	3091440	What's the role of sexual violence in this story?
3092960	3094680	I think you've got to distinguish between groups
3094680	3095680	and within groups.
3096680	3101680	And, you know, I think the world has been slowly waking up
3103280	3106040	over the last several decades
3106040	3111040	to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.
3112680	3117680	And that to me says that it's just another example
3118760	3121400	of power corrupts because, you know,
3121400	3126400	when frustrated, scared, elated soldiers
3129320	3132840	come upon females in a group
3132840	3136400	that there's been essential dehumanization of,
3137440	3140600	then they get carried away by opportunity.
3141760	3145160	It is not always possible to argue
3145160	3148600	that this is adaptive nowadays
3148600	3151200	because, you know, you get lots and lots of stories
3151200	3156200	of women being abused to the point of being killed.
3158760	3161200	She'll be gang raped and then killed.
3161200	3166200	There's lots of terrible cases of that reported
3166200	3167800	from all sorts of different wars.
3169600	3174600	But you can see that that could build on a pattern
3174920	3178160	that would have been adaptive if happening
3178160	3181560	in under sort of much less extreme circumstances.
3182360	3185240	You know, the war is very extreme nowadays
3185240	3187520	in the sense that you get battles
3187520	3191320	in which people are sent by a military hierarchy
3191320	3194200	into a war situation in which they do not feel
3194200	3196520	what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt
3196520	3198680	which would have been that if we attack,
3198680	3202000	we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.
3202000	3205280	Nowadays, you know, you're sent in across the Somme
3205280	3207840	or whatever it is and there's a very high chance
3207840	3210360	you will be killed and that's totally unnatural
3210360	3213160	and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.
3214880	3217600	Then there's sexual coercion within groups
3217600	3222600	and so that takes various kinds of forms, you know,
3223360	3224800	but nowadays, of course,
3224800	3227040	I think people recognize increasingly
3227040	3232040	that the principal form of sexual intimidation
3233040	3237120	and rape occurs within relationships.
3238440	3243440	It's not stranger rape that is really statistically important.
3243440	3244680	There's much more.
3245720	3250720	What happens behind the walls of a bedroom
3252080	3254960	where people have been living for some time
3254960	3259960	and just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.
3260960	3265960	One is that it may seem odd that males should be,
3272160	3274920	should think it a good idea, as it were,
3274920	3277840	to impose themselves sexually
3277840	3280200	on someone with whom they have a relationship.
3281560	3286040	But what they're doing is intimidating someone
3286040	3289400	in a relationship in which the relative power
3289400	3292880	in the relationship has continuing significance
3292880	3294400	for a long time.
3294400	3298880	And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.
3298880	3301960	You know, it's to do with domestic relationships,
3301960	3306240	it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.
3306240	3309880	It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression
3309880	3313240	is one of the tools to regain power or gain power
3313240	3314920	or gain more power and that kind of thing.
3314920	3316720	Yeah, exactly.
3316720	3321720	And in that respect, it's worth noting that
3322360	3325720	although this wasn't appreciated for some time,
3325720	3328360	it's emerging that in a bunch of primates
3328360	3333360	you have somewhat parallel kinds of sexual intimidation
3335040	3337840	where males will target particular females
3337840	3341320	even in a group in which the norm is for females
3341320	3343520	to mate with multiple males.
3343520	3345960	But each male will target a particular female
3346000	3349640	and the more he is aggressive towards her
3349640	3353240	then the more she conforms to his wishes
3353240	3355320	when he wants to mate.
3355320	3358000	So a long-term pattern of sexual intimidation.
3358920	3360400	So there's that aspect.
3360400	3364800	The other aspect I would just note is that males
3366720	3370240	get away with a lot compared to females
3370240	3373720	in any kind of intersexual conflict.
3374560	3379560	So the punishment, here's one example of this,
3379960	3383480	the punishment for a husband killing a wife
3383480	3385640	has always been much less than the punishment
3385640	3387160	for a wife killing a husband.
3389960	3392200	And you see similar sorts of things
3392200	3397200	in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.
3398760	3403000	I bring this up in the context of males
3403000	3406840	sexually intimidating their partners,
3406840	3409240	be it wives or whoever,
3410720	3414400	because it's a reminder that it's basically
3414400	3417840	a patriarchal world that we have come from,
3417840	3422120	a patriarchal world in which male alliances
3422120	3426280	tend to support males and take advantage of the fact
3426280	3429800	that they have political power at the expense of females.
3429800	3432040	And I would say that that all goes back
3432080	3434880	to what happened three to 400,000 years ago
3434880	3436760	when the beta males took charge
3436760	3439240	and they started imposing their own norms
3439240	3442600	on society as a whole and they've continued to do so.
3442600	3446200	And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,
3446200	3448840	we are not a patriarchal society.
3448840	3453080	Well, it's true that the laws try and make it even-handed
3453080	3455480	nowadays between males and females.
3455480	3458920	But obviously we are patriarchal de facto
3458920	3463920	because society still in many ways supports men
3465360	3468120	better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.
3468120	3470600	So beta male patriarchal.
3471960	3472800	Yeah.
3472800	3475400	If we're looking at the evolutionary history.
3475400	3478960	Okay, is there maybe sticking on Jordan for a second.
3478960	3483960	Is there, so he's a psychologist, right?
3484440	3489440	And what part of the picture do you think he's missing
3489960	3494800	in analyzing the human relations?
3496160	3500160	Like what does he need to understand
3500160	3502400	about our origins and violence
3502400	3504960	and the way the society has been constructed?
3504960	3509960	Oh, I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives.
3510400	3514600	But I just think that what he's doing
3514600	3517880	in that particular example is focusing
3517880	3520280	on the legalistic position.
3521120	3525240	And that's great that you do not find
3526160	3528240	formal patriarchy in the law,
3528240	3529800	anything like to the extent
3529800	3533840	that you could find it a hundred years ago and so on.
3533840	3536120	Women have got the vote now, hooray,
3536120	3538720	but it took a long time for women to get the vote.
3538720	3542840	And it remains the case that
3544920	3548840	the women suffer in various kinds of ways.
3548840	3553840	I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners
3555520	3557960	is treated much more rudely
3557960	3561320	than a male who has lots of sexual partners.
3561320	3563160	There are all sorts of informal ways
3563160	3567240	in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.
3567240	3572240	And if we look at the surface layer of the law,
3572600	3576320	we may miss the deeper human nature,
3578040	3581240	like the origins of our human nature that still operates
3581240	3582640	no matter what the law says.
3582640	3587160	Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward
3587160	3591000	because it includes some unpleasant features
3591000	3594240	that when we sit back and reflect about them,
3594240	3597960	we would like them to go away.
3597960	3602960	But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned
3605040	3610040	to try and have sex with at least one woman
3611880	3614080	and often lots of women.
3614080	3617320	And so women, men are constantly putting pressure on women
3617320	3619920	in ways that women find unpleasant.
3619920	3621720	And if men sit back and reflect about it,
3621720	3622920	they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this,
3622920	3626280	but actually it just goes on because of human nature.
3626280	3630920	So maybe looking at particular humans in history,
3630920	3632880	let's talk about Genghis Khan.
3632880	3635720	So is this particular human
3635720	3639240	who was one of the most famous examples
3639240	3642280	of large-scale violence,
3642280	3645800	is he a deep representative of human nature
3645800	3647960	or is he a rare exception?
3647960	3652960	Well, I think that it's easy to imagine
3653520	3657480	that most men could have become Genghis Khan.
3659440	3663320	It's possible that he had a particular streak of psychopathy.
3666440	3671440	You know, it's striking that by the time you become
3672440	3677440	immensely powerful, then you're a willingness
3678680	3682080	to do terrible things for the interest
3682080	3687080	of yourself and your group becomes very high.
3690880	3695880	Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, these sorts of people have histories
3696800	3699760	in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.
3699760	3701600	But by the time they are big leaders,
3701600	3704280	they are really psychopathic in the sense that
3704280	3708080	they do not follow the ordinary morality
3708080	3713080	of considering the harm that they are doing to their victims.
3721760	3723520	What kind of experiment would we need
3723520	3726720	whether or not anybody could fall into this position?
3726720	3731720	I don't know, but Lord Acton's famous dictum
3731840	3736840	was power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
3736840	3739160	And then the point that people often forget
3739160	3740640	is the next sentence that he said,
3740640	3744880	which is great men are almost always bad men.
3744880	3746480	And that is right.
3746480	3749960	It is very difficult to find a great man in history
3749960	3753080	who was not responsible for terrible things.
3754080	3757920	I think there's some aspect of it that it's not just power.
3758920	3763360	I think men who have been the most destructive
3763360	3767360	in human history are not psychopathic completely.
3770240	3773000	They have convinced themselves of an idea.
3773000	3775600	It's like the idea of psychopathic.
3775600	3778280	Stalin, for example, Hitler's a complicated one.
3778280	3780520	I think he was legitimately insane,
3780520	3783080	but I think Stalin has convinced himself
3783080	3786040	that he's doing good.
3786040	3789320	So the idea of communism is the thing that's psychopathic
3789320	3791560	in his mind, like a bread.
3791560	3795720	You construct a worldview in which the violence is justified,
3795720	3797560	the cruelty is justified.
3797560	3801440	So in that sense, first of all,
3801440	3803280	you can construct experiments,
3803280	3805200	unethical experiments that could test this,
3805200	3808600	but in that sense, anybody else
3808600	3810880	could have been in Stalin's position.
3810880	3815880	It's the idea that could overtake the mind of a human being
3815960	3818360	and in so doing justify cruel acts.
3818360	3822160	And that seems to be at least in part unique to humans
3822160	3825600	is the ability to hold ideas in our minds
3825600	3829440	and share those ideas and use those ideas
3829440	3833800	to convince ourselves that proactive violence
3833800	3836160	on a large scale is a good idea.
3837480	3839080	So that, I don't know if you have a comment.
3839080	3842000	I suppose so, I mean, but it seems to me
3842000	3844600	what really motivated Stalin
3844600	3849600	was not so much communism as the retention of power.
3852760	3856560	So once he became leader
3856560	3859120	and in the process of becoming leader,
3859120	3861720	he was absolutely desperate to get rid
3861720	3864200	of anybody who was a challenger.
3864200	3866120	He was deeply suspicious,
3866120	3870800	suspicious of anybody, even on his side,
3870800	3873280	who might possibly be showing a glimmerings
3873280	3876080	of willingness to challenge him.
3876080	3881080	So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,
3883000	3885440	Kirov was a great communist,
3885440	3889600	Trotsky was a great communist, all his rivals.
3889760	3892360	And I mean, when he went into the towns
3892360	3895240	and murdered people by the tens of thousands.
3895240	3896240	They were all communists.
3896240	3899680	A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.
3899680	3903360	But what he was worried about was that they were rivals to him.
3905040	3907120	I suppose the thought is,
3907120	3910440	I am the best person to bring about
3910440	3915000	a global sort of embrace of communism
3915000	3917640	and others are not.
3917680	3919760	And so we have to get rid of those others.
3919760	3921720	Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,
3921720	3926720	but I mean, maybe you know enough about Stalin to really...
3926720	3931000	Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,
3931000	3934440	is from my understanding and sense,
3934440	3936240	of course we can't know for sure,
3936240	3938720	is he believed in communism.
3938720	3942840	This wasn't purely a game of power.
3942840	3946320	Now he got drunk with power pretty quickly,
3946360	3949360	but he really believed for,
3949360	3954120	I believe his whole life that communism is good for the world.
3954120	3956960	And that I don't know what role
3958160	3963160	that belief plays with the more natural human desire for power.
3963880	3966200	I don't know, but it just seems like...
3966200	3968440	As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists
3968440	3970520	on his journey.
3972680	3973840	But it's not that doesn't,
3973840	3975600	that calculus doesn't work that way.
3975600	3978440	There's humans who are communists,
3978440	3980920	and then there's the idea of communism.
3980920	3985760	So for him, in his delusional worldview,
3985760	3990320	killing a few people is worth the final result
3990320	3992760	of bringing communism to the whole world.
3992760	3993760	But it was more than that again,
3993760	3997640	because I mean, he really wanted power for the Soviet Union.
3997640	4002640	And so surely the reason that he orchestrated
4003600	4008600	the export of wheat from Ukraine,
4009560	4013600	and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation,
4013600	4015720	was because he wanted to sell it on the market
4015720	4020720	in order to be able to build up the power of the Soviet Union.
4020720	4023320	You know, alternative view of communism might have been,
4023320	4026920	well, let's just make sure everybody survives
4026920	4029320	and make sure everybody has enough to eat.
4029600	4032000	And we'll all be musically supportive
4032000	4033680	in a communal network.
4033680	4036200	But no, but he wanted the power for the country.
4036200	4037360	Well, I guess exactly.
4037360	4039360	So that it's not even communism,
4039360	4041840	the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that.
4041840	4043120	It's the country.
4043120	4047520	I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power
4047520	4049840	for the individual.
4049840	4053440	It's power for a vision for this great nation,
4053440	4054840	the Soviet Union.
4054840	4057200	And similar with Hitler,
4057320	4062320	the guy believed that this is a great nation, Germany.
4062320	4066560	And like they, it's a nation that's been wronged
4066560	4069960	throughout history and needs to be righted.
4069960	4074440	And there's some dance between the individual human
4074440	4075560	and the tribe.
4075560	4077000	Yes, absolutely.
4077000	4079800	Yes, and so just like chimpanzees,
4079800	4082200	you know, we are fiercely tribal.
4082200	4086200	And the tribalism resides particularly in male psychology.
4087200	4092200	And it's very scary because once you assemble
4092200	4097200	a set of males who share tribal identity,
4097200	4100520	then they have power that they can exert
4102280	4105840	with very little concern
4105840	4108080	about what they're doing to damage other people.
4109200	4114000	Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,
4114000	4116200	we talked about the corrupting nature of power.
4116200	4118720	Do you think that's a manifestation
4118720	4122880	of those early origins of violence?
4122880	4126080	What's the connection of this desire for power
4126080	4129040	and our proclivity for violence?
4130160	4134520	You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?
4134520	4136960	Power on behalf of a group.
4136960	4137800	Yes.
4137800	4140080	And yeah, that seems to me to go right back
4140080	4144560	to a deep evolutionary origin
4144560	4147240	because you see essentially the same thing
4147240	4149880	in a whole bunch of animals.
4151040	4156040	That most of the sort of cognitively complex animals
4156760	4160240	live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.
4162040	4165560	And so what you see in chimpanzees
4165560	4168840	is echoed in almost all of the primates.
4168840	4173400	The difference between us and chimpanzees
4173400	4176560	and humans on the one hand and other primates on the other
4177600	4179320	is that we kill and they don't.
4179320	4182920	And the reason they don't is because they never meet
4182920	4186920	in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.
4186920	4190840	So two groups of baboons, you know, there's 30 on this side
4190840	4192600	and 50 on this side, fine.
4192600	4194680	Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else
4194680	4197600	because there's serious risks involved.
4199600	4202200	But nevertheless, they are tribal.
4202200	4206160	So, you know, they will have fairly intense
4206160	4209680	intergroup interactions in which everybody knows
4209680	4212600	whose side is on, who is on whose side.
4212600	4217600	And the long-term consequences of winning those battles,
4218800	4223360	non-lethal battles is that the dominance
4223360	4227320	get access to larger areas of land,
4227320	4230560	more safety and so on with chances are.
4232560	4237560	Better record of reproductive success, subsequently.
4240280	4242800	Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,
4242800	4244320	is a feature or a bug,
4244320	4249320	our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?
4250840	4252080	So what's a bug?
4253000	4256640	Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,
4257640	4262640	meaning like it would be more beneficial.
4263240	4267720	Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes
4267720	4269160	from an evolutionary perspective?
4269160	4270920	Yeah, yeah, but...
4270920	4272040	What does it mean?
4272040	4273160	What does a bug mean?
4273160	4275200	Yes, right, I mean...
4275200	4277400	Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?
4277400	4279080	It's beneficial from, you know,
4279080	4280800	it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved
4280800	4285360	by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.
4285440	4288840	But if by bug you mean something that,
4288840	4290280	from the point of view of the species,
4290280	4292600	it'd be great if you could just wipe this out,
4292600	4296080	because the species would somehow do better as a result.
4296080	4298480	Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.
4301200	4306200	Come on now, there's some nice things to males,
4306320	4308120	speaking as a male.
4308120	4310200	The fact that there are some nice things to males
4310200	4312000	doesn't mean that they're not bugs.
4312000	4313920	You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,
4313920	4316400	but it would be much better for the species as a whole
4316400	4318480	not to have to have males
4318480	4321840	who impose this violence on the species as a whole.
4321840	4323080	Yeah.
4323080	4325160	As somebody who practiced controlled violence
4325160	4330000	and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.
4330000	4332040	It does seem kind of fun
4332040	4335280	to have this kind of controlled violence, also sports.
4335280	4338440	Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,
4338440	4340560	I guess that's the deeper question.
4340600	4344240	Don't you think there's some value to conflict
4344240	4347760	for the improvement of society for progress,
4347760	4351120	that this tension between tribes,
4351120	4355280	isn't this like experiment,
4355280	4357680	a continued experiment we conduct with each other
4357680	4360240	and to figure out what is a better world to build?
4360240	4365000	Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas
4365000	4367520	to go to war with each other.
4367560	4370680	It's like the United States with the 50 states
4370680	4373720	and it's the laboratory of ideas.
4373720	4377240	Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?
4379520	4383040	This kind of conflict when it doesn't get out of hand
4383040	4385040	is actually ultimately progressive,
4385040	4386760	productive for a better world.
4388160	4390160	Well, what do you mean by conflict?
4390160	4392960	I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of
4392960	4397040	people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.
4397040	4399000	So their ideas are in conflict,
4399000	4403560	they can sit down on a log and chat about it
4403560	4405760	and then decide, okay, you're right,
4405760	4407200	or I'm wrong or whatever.
4409120	4413160	But if my conflict, you mean a great idea
4413160	4415600	to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,
4416560	4419720	then no, I don't see why it's a good idea
4419720	4421080	to have all this violence.
4422080	4423480	Yeah, there's...
4425680	4428680	I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,
4428680	4430960	but I wonder if human history would evolve
4430960	4433520	the way it did without the violence.
4433520	4435160	Oh, I'm sure you're right.
4435160	4439160	Probably humans were not evolved in the sense that we have,
4439160	4444160	but I would hope that the course of violence
4445760	4449640	in evolution will continue in the way it has.
4450640	4454040	So, there's all sorts of indications
4455240	4460240	that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.
4461480	4465400	And this is made famous in Stephen Pinker's book,
4465400	4467080	but others have written about it too,
4468680	4473160	that the frequency of death from violence
4473160	4477080	in every country you look at has been declining.
4478080	4478880	That's just great.
4479240	4481480	And so, the amazing thing about this is that
4481480	4484600	even when you take the death due to the First World War
4484600	4486080	and the Second World War,
4486080	4490320	the 20th century appears to have been statistically,
4490320	4492960	meaning rates of death per individual,
4494120	4497400	the least violent in history.
4499680	4503280	So, we haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence,
4503280	4505760	but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.
4505760	4507760	I think it's ridiculous, frankly.
4508880	4513200	Excuse my frankness, to say that violence is a good thing.
4514320	4516840	I think that it would be a wonderful concept
4516840	4519720	if we could evolve somehow to a world
4519720	4522080	3,000 years from now,
4522080	4526800	where violence is really regarded as simply appalling
4526800	4529920	and that they look back on our time
4529920	4532560	and can't believe what we were doing.
4532560	4535760	Yeah, but of course violence takes a lot of different shapes
4535760	4537360	as we start to think deeper and deeper
4537360	4540280	about living beings on Earth.
4540280	4541920	For example, the violence we commit
4541920	4543960	and the torture we commit to animals.
4543960	4545240	And then perhaps down the line,
4545240	4548560	as we talked offline about, is with robots
4548560	4549360	and that kind of thing.
4549360	4552640	So, there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.
4552640	4556040	And some people now talk about violence in the space of ideas,
4556040	4558000	which of course, to me at least,
4558000	4560280	is a bit of a silly notion relative
4560280	4564040	to use that same V word for the space of ideas
4564040	4566440	versus actual physical violence.
4566480	4569000	But it may be that long time from now,
4569000	4572000	we see that even violence in the space of ideas
4572000	4576760	is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.
4576760	4579520	And so, it is interesting where this is headed.
4580400	4583080	And I think you're absolutely right.
4583080	4587640	A world, a nonviolent world does seem like a better world.
4587640	4590680	I wonder if the constraints on resources
4590680	4594440	somehow make that world more and more difficult,
4594440	4596200	especially as we run out of resources.
4596240	4597480	It's got to be very, very different
4597480	4599120	from what we're doing nowadays.
4599120	4600920	And it's unimaginably different.
4600920	4601840	If we could imagine it,
4601840	4603680	then maybe we could work towards it at the moment.
4603680	4605520	Nobody knows how to work towards it.
4605520	4607000	Well, that's kind of the stories of humans
4607000	4608680	as we don't really know the future.
4608680	4613240	We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go
4613240	4617080	and sometimes get into trouble as to violence.
4617080	4622080	But George Orwell's vision in 1984 was of two or three
4623080	4624680	world powers, each so powerful
4624680	4629680	that nobody could diminish the, could destroy the other.
4631720	4636000	But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship
4636000	4641000	among heavily armed world powers just does not seem,
4643760	4647280	as though it's reasonable at all.
4647400	4652400	There's to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations in the world,
4656240	4660560	dominated by a few big ones, all with arms
4660560	4662240	pointing at each other.
4662240	4665360	And the notion that we could just carry on
4665360	4669280	having peace talks and making sure that these arms
4669280	4674120	don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration
4674120	4677000	seems incredibly optimistic.
4677040	4680240	Some kind of major change has to happen,
4680240	4683200	whereby, and some people wouldn't like to see
4683200	4685160	all the weapons go, that'd be great.
4685160	4687920	I'm a member of that sort of group
4687920	4690680	that tries to see that happen.
4690680	4693160	It's gonna be very difficult to see it happen.
4693160	4696120	Another kind of concept is the nations themselves
4696120	4701120	will dissolve and will become one government.
4701880	4703760	That itself is a terrifying vision
4703800	4708120	because the capacity for abuse by a single world power
4708120	4710800	would be so problematic.
4710800	4712520	And in addition, how do you get there
4712520	4714200	without a war in the first place?
4715280	4719120	So at the moment, we have no reasonable kind
4719120	4722080	of future in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.
4722080	4723640	It's just that we haven't yet to find it.
4723640	4726080	And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space
4726080	4729680	argue that you can create decentralized societies
4729680	4732360	if you take away the power from states
4732360	4734120	to define the monetary system.
4734120	4738720	So they argue like, if you make the monetary system
4738720	4741280	such that it's disjoint from the control
4741280	4743960	of any one individual, any one government,
4743960	4746680	then that might be a way to form sort of ad hoc,
4746680	4748000	decentralized societies.
4748000	4750840	They just pop up all over the place.
4750840	4753920	That's a really interesting technological solution
4753920	4757240	to how to remove the overreach of power
4757240	4758080	from governments.
4758080	4760040	Yes, right, absolutely.
4760040	4764520	And it may well be that the future will emerge
4764520	4768680	out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.
4768680	4771200	Is it nevertheless surprising to you
4771200	4774320	that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?
4774320	4776520	So the mutually assured destruction
4776520	4778480	that we've had for many decades
4778480	4780800	from somebody who studies violence,
4781880	4783280	how does that make sense to you?
4783280	4785480	Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense
4785480	4790000	that accidental, the fact that we have not had
4790000	4794520	an accident yet has been quite remarkable.
4794520	4796080	Because all the accounts are
4796080	4799320	that we've come very close to having very serious accidents
4799320	4803160	where people are either side of misread intentions
4803160	4805320	or apparent launches and so on.
4806960	4808680	So yes, I think it is remarkable.
4808680	4813680	There is a nasty generalization that can be made
4814160	4819160	that the longer that powerful states go
4819160	4823500	without having wars, then the worse the war is afterwards.
4825400	4828520	And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense
4828520	4832120	because basically what's happening with these tribal groups
4832120	4837120	that the nations are at the moment is that after a big war
4837320	4839120	like the Second World War,
4839120	4842200	they established new kinds of dominance relationships.
4842200	4845800	And then during the periods of peace,
4845800	4850800	what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships
4851720	4854560	change because some nations become poorer,
4854560	4856000	some become richer,
4856000	4858600	some become more militarily powerful and so on.
4858600	4862320	Generally economy and military goes hand in hand.
4862320	4865560	So right now China emerged from the war
4865560	4869560	as a relatively low status state and is now high status.
4869560	4871040	So if this was chimpanzees,
4871040	4873160	what would happen is that you would predict a conflict
4873200	4876200	because you need to have a readjustment
4876200	4878320	of the formal dominance relationships
4878320	4882360	to recognize the new in-practice dominance relationships
4882360	4884800	recognized by the economy and the military.
4886080	4889280	So the longer that you have of a period of peace
4889280	4890520	following a war,
4890520	4893880	then the more these tensions of unresolved,
4893880	4897200	changed dominance relationships build up.
4897200	4899600	And the longer they take to occur,
4899600	4904600	then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.
4906320	4907480	That's a terrifying view
4907480	4910520	because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.
4910520	4911360	That's right.
4911360	4912680	Maybe it's building up.
4912680	4913560	So it's a scary view.
4913560	4915080	But on the other hand,
4915080	4919800	things have changed hugely with the advent of nuclear weapons
4919800	4924800	because at least that conforms to this psychology
4925120	4926800	that is very clear in other animals,
4926800	4928880	which is you don't want to get into a fight
4928920	4931160	if you are going to get hurt.
4931160	4935760	So that's the whole principle of MAD, Mutual Assured Destruction.
4935760	4938680	And it's doubtless being why powerful nations
4938680	4941960	like America and Russia
4941960	4945600	have not used their nuclear weapons since 1945.
4947480	4952240	So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,
4953200	4957360	then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology
4957400	4961480	in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions
4961480	4962600	without using them.
4962600	4967520	But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.
4967520	4969760	I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed
4969760	4972240	because of the poor economy,
4972240	4977240	but with China desperate to take back Taiwan
4978560	4983560	and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,
4984200	4985920	the potential for something going wrong
4986040	4987200	is clearly very high.
4988080	4991440	So what's the hopeful case that you can make
4991440	4995840	for a long-term surviving and thriving human civilization
4995840	4998120	given all the dangers that we face?
4999760	5002200	Well, I can't really exactly make one.
5002200	5007200	I would just say that we're talking about the dangers.
5007520	5009920	Obviously the dangers are there.
5009920	5014560	But what I would sort of think about is the notion
5014560	5019560	that surprises come from all sorts of different directions.
5020640	5024920	And I mean, you work in robotics
5024920	5029760	and I can well imagine that there will be advances
5029760	5032920	in robotics that in some way I can't even conceive
5032920	5037920	will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.
5038080	5041760	Something about, by the time chips have been planted
5041760	5045600	in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information
5045600	5047600	in a way that we never did before,
5048480	5052040	will this change the nature of human existence
5052040	5055120	in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?
5055120	5057760	So remove the conflicts but keep some of the magic,
5057760	5059640	the beauty of what it means to be human.
5059640	5061560	So like still be able to enjoy life,
5061560	5064720	the richness of life, the full complexity of life.
5064720	5068360	Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill
5068360	5070480	and then they go to sleep, right?
5070480	5075480	You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.
5077200	5079960	And so that's where you have to find the balance.
5079960	5083000	Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff
5083000	5087760	and so how it's gonna work out totally unclear.
5090760	5095080	I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.
5095080	5097920	I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.
5097920	5100080	I think you really need to get rid of males
5100080	5105080	cause males are the source of a major problem,
5105680	5110680	which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.
5111000	5114400	But you don't think the males are also source of beauty
5114400	5115240	and creation?
5115240	5118160	No, no, I mean, I don't have anything against males
5118160	5120880	as individuals and that sort of thing.
5120880	5122840	And males have clearly done a lot.
5122840	5127080	I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative
5127080	5130960	and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful
5130960	5132160	and that sort of thing.
5132160	5135320	On the other hand, I'm not sure there's anything
5135320	5137880	particularly special and I think that probably females
5137880	5139840	could do the same thing just as well
5139840	5140960	when given the chance.
5142240	5144320	Yes, including the dark stuff.
5144320	5148000	I mean, a part of me is not understanding the,
5148000	5152640	so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,
5152640	5155760	but I tend to believe both men and women,
5155800	5158680	if you look out into the future, it can be destructive,
5158680	5160120	it can be evil, it can be greedy,
5160120	5162040	it can be corrupted by power.
5162040	5163680	So if you move males from the picture,
5163680	5166520	which are historically connected to this evolution
5166520	5168720	of that we've been talking about,
5168720	5171960	that women are gonna fill that role quite nicely
5171960	5175120	and then it'll be just the same kind of process,
5175120	5180120	not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.
5180600	5185440	There's a sense that the will to power, craving power,
5185440	5188280	committing violence is somehow coupled
5188280	5192640	with all the things that are beautiful about life,
5192640	5195160	that if you remove conflict completely,
5195160	5197800	if you remove all the evil in the world,
5198800	5203800	it seems like you're not going to have a stable place
5207600	5209520	for the beauty for the goodness.
5209520	5214520	Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight for the way,
5215000	5216200	if you look at human history,
5216200	5218880	now you can say the reason I'm nervous
5218880	5222400	about a sort of utopia where everything is great
5222400	5224680	is every time you look through human history
5224680	5226760	when the utopia has been chased,
5226760	5229880	you run into a lot of trouble where again,
5229880	5233720	sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.
5233720	5236680	Now you can say that's a male problem,
5236680	5238960	but I just think it's a human problem
5238960	5242160	and it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too.
5242200	5244600	It's life on earth problem, intelligent life
5244600	5245600	on earth problem.
5245600	5250600	So like it's better to not necessarily get rid
5250800	5254640	of the sources of the darkest sides of human nature,
5254640	5258160	but more create mechanisms that the kindness,
5258160	5261840	the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,
5261840	5266840	that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.
5267760	5272760	Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia
5274280	5276480	if you got rid of the males.
5276480	5277320	Right.
5278240	5280560	And certainly females capable of conflict.
5281600	5283280	I just think it's a gamble worth taking
5283280	5284880	if you could actually do it.
5284880	5287120	You can certainly find females in history
5287120	5291280	who've done unpleasant things, but nevertheless,
5291280	5293480	we have a very strong evolutionary theory
5293520	5297000	which explains why males benefit more
5297000	5301560	by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.
5302520	5307520	And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,
5308200	5309040	yes.
5309040	5311960	Then it would reduce it to get rid of males.
5311960	5314120	Now I understand this is a fantasy.
5314120	5317160	And I think it's a fantasy that people would be able
5317160	5320560	to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology
5320560	5324320	is getting to the point where it's quite likely
5324320	5329320	that human females could breed without the use of males.
5330560	5335560	And so there would be a sort of potential dynamic
5335680	5340680	if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.
5341800	5343760	It's a really interesting thought experiment.
5343760	5347440	I will agree with you that if given two buttons,
5347440	5349640	one is get rid of all women
5349640	5351800	and the other buttons get rid of all men.
5354000	5358680	Realizing that I have a stake in this choice,
5358680	5360800	you're probably getting rid of all men.
5360800	5365680	If I wanted to preserve earth
5365680	5368440	and the richness of life on earth,
5368440	5370280	I would probably get rid of all men.
5370280	5371120	I don't know.
5371120	5372680	I don't think you have a stake in it.
5372680	5375960	I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.
5375960	5378560	But I don't see why being a man
5378560	5380400	should make you any more interested
5380400	5383880	in having a male future for the world than a female future.
5383880	5386640	You've got just as many ancestors who were male
5386640	5388440	as were female.
5388440	5390520	Well, my problem is I'll have to die.
5391520	5393800	Well, that's gonna happen anyway.
5393800	5397120	I know, but I prefer to die tomorrow and not today.
5398400	5400560	I prefer to hit the snooze button
5400560	5402840	on the whole mortality thing.
5402840	5403800	But it's interesting.
5403800	5405640	But this is not suggesting that males have to die
5405640	5406880	in order to make room for females.
5407880	5411480	All you have to do is just say,
5411480	5413920	don't let's have any more males born.
5413920	5414760	Interesting.
5414760	5418240	Of course, the difficulty is that because we're tribal,
5418240	5420080	some country, somewhere would say,
5420080	5421680	well, we're not gonna do that.
5421680	5422640	And then guess what?
5422640	5424760	They'd take over because they're males.
5424760	5427640	So that's why it's impossible to imagine actually happening.
5428720	5429560	You know what?
5429560	5432200	I'm gonna take that and actually think about it.
5432200	5433040	I don't know.
5433040	5434880	I'm uncomfortable.
5434920	5439320	There's a certain kind of woke culture
5439320	5441640	that I've been kind of uncomfortable with
5441640	5444560	because it's not women necessarily.
5444560	5447920	It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.
5447920	5450920	There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness
5450920	5453480	towards others that's created by that culture.
5453480	5455240	So, but you're speaking about something else.
5455240	5460240	You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world
5460280	5464480	and looking at the basics of our human nature
5464480	5469480	and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens
5470120	5474520	and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature
5474520	5478240	if we get rid of them, we'll make for a better world.
5478240	5480240	It's an interesting thought experiment.
5480240	5481720	But it is only a thought experiment.
5481720	5485040	I mean, you know, it's got no practical meaning right now.
5485040	5488360	And I take your point that, you know,
5488360	5492520	males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways
5492560	5497560	because the balance of social power
5498680	5503680	is moving against, I mean, quite rightly
5505600	5507160	in a strong sense, of course,
5507160	5510080	against all the nasty things that males do.
5511640	5515760	But what people sometimes fail to remember
5515760	5520680	is that life is very hard for males
5520720	5525720	who don't have the power, who don't have money,
5526360	5528960	who don't have access to women.
5530760	5533760	You know, I'm sympathetic to in cells.
5535120	5538480	I'm not sympathetic to them using violence
5538480	5540280	to solve their problems.
5540280	5545280	But I am very sympathetic to the fact that it's not easy,
5545360	5550360	simply to be told by well-off women
5551520	5556520	and feminist middle-class people
5556560	5558160	that you shouldn't behave like this
5558160	5560400	or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.
5560400	5562440	Yes, that's who you are.
5562440	5566000	I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,
5567000	5572000	male or female, I believe will be the thing
5573000	5574440	that builds a better world.
5574440	5577400	And that's practiced in different ways
5577400	5578720	from different backgrounds.
5578720	5581600	But ultimately, you should listen to others
5581600	5584160	and empathize with the experience of others
5584160	5586520	and put more love out there in the world.
5586520	5589400	Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,
5590320	5595320	reduce violence and reduce that whole psychological
5597480	5599880	experience of being powerless in this world,
5599880	5602560	powerless to become the best version of yourself.
5602560	5603400	And that, you know-
5603400	5604480	Well, no one's gonna disagree
5604480	5607200	with all those fine sentiments, right?
5607200	5612040	But that, yes, but that's an actionable thing,
5612040	5615160	is actually practice empathy, right?
5615160	5620120	Like saying that somebody should be silenced
5620120	5623840	or just like, this group is bad and this group is good.
5623840	5625400	I just feel like that's not empathy.
5625400	5630400	Empathy is understanding the experience of others
5631000	5633000	and respecting it.
5633200	5637280	I mean, that's what a better world looks like.
5637280	5639760	That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.
5639760	5643720	It's like, as opposed to saying, my tribe is right,
5643720	5647160	your tribe is wrong, forget the violence
5647160	5648760	or non-violence part.
5648760	5651200	That just that act of saying, my tribe is right,
5651200	5653640	that tribe is wrong, removing that from the picture,
5653640	5655760	that's the way to make a better world.
5655760	5658360	Like that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.
5659880	5661800	Not necessarily removing the people
5661800	5664200	who are causing the violence.
5664200	5666000	You have to get to the source of the problem.
5666000	5667280	I don't mean the evolutionary source,
5667280	5672280	but just the mindset that creates the violence
5672840	5676000	is usually just a lack of empathy for others.
5677840	5680520	Yeah, but, you know, I mean, you can't just teach that
5680520	5683600	because our evolutionary psychology
5683600	5685600	puts us in particular directions.
5685600	5688680	So you don't think, do you think it's possible
5688680	5692080	to learn through practice
5692080	5695760	to resist the basics of our evolutionary psychology,
5695760	5696960	the basic forces?
5698600	5701840	Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training,
5701840	5704960	you know, lots and lots of education can do it.
5704960	5709240	The famously most peaceful society
5709240	5711880	that anthropologists have recorded
5711880	5716880	involves a tremendous amount of teaching,
5716880	5718960	including some punishment.
5718960	5721000	You know, it's a society in Thailand.
5722000	5726000	You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.
5726000	5727840	So it's carrot and steak.
5727840	5731360	You know, the point is that you do not find societies
5731360	5736360	in which people are spontaneously showing the kinds of behaviors
5739240	5742080	that we would all love them to show.
5742080	5743360	It requires work.
5743360	5745160	It requires work.
5745160	5748000	What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?
5748000	5750360	What are the main ideas in this book?
5750360	5755360	Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes
5755760	5760480	in both in relationship to both violence and non-violence.
5760480	5764240	And the violence is that we are one of these few animals
5764240	5768920	in which we use coalitionary proactive violence
5768920	5770720	to kill members of our own species.
5770720	5772240	And we do it in large numbers,
5772240	5774760	just like a few other species.
5774760	5778960	And the non-violence is we're particularly extreme
5778960	5783920	in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.
5783920	5786760	And I told you the story of how we get there.
5786760	5788680	You know, so what's so extraordinary about us
5788680	5793000	is that most animals are either high on both
5793000	5795480	or relatively low on both.
5795480	5798400	So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence
5798400	5800080	and reactive violence.
5800080	5804280	Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,
5804280	5806440	but still hundreds of times more
5807680	5809960	reactively aggressive than humans are.
5811000	5815000	What we've done is retain proactive violence being high
5815000	5819280	and got reactive violence really being low.
5819280	5821240	And so we have these wonderful societies
5821240	5823840	in which we're also incredibly nice to each other
5823840	5827120	and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers
5827120	5832120	and have no problem about leading to any kind of conflict
5834840	5838320	at the same time as we are one of the worst
5838320	5841920	killing machine species that's ever existed.
5841920	5844320	So what's so extraordinary about this is that
5844320	5846960	if you look at the political philosophers
5846960	5849000	of the last few hundred years,
5849880	5853960	you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes
5853960	5855320	and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
5855320	5858280	or literally you got the fight between their followers.
5858280	5860840	You know, so the followers of Hobbes say,
5860840	5862920	well, Hobbes was right because he says
5862920	5866440	that we are naturally violent and you need a Leviathan
5866440	5869360	or sort of central government or a king
5869360	5871760	to be able to suppress the violence.
5871760	5875920	So we're naturally horrid and we can learn to be good.
5875920	5878280	Whereas Jean-Jacques Rousseau is interpreted
5878280	5881400	as saying the opposite, that we are naturally good
5881400	5883480	and it's only when culture intervenes
5883480	5888400	and horrid ideologies come in that we become uncivilized.
5888400	5890960	And so people have had this endless fight
5890960	5893760	between are we naturally corrupt
5893760	5896560	or are we naturally kind?
5897400	5899760	And that has gone on for years
5899760	5903080	and it's only in the last two or three decades
5903080	5905280	that anthropologists like Christopher Bohm
5905280	5907400	and Bruce Naft have said, look, you know,
5907400	5908720	it's obvious what the answer is,
5908720	5910440	we are both of these things.
5910440	5913440	And what is so exciting now is I think we can understand
5913440	5914920	why we are both.
5914920	5918280	And the answer is we come from ancestors
5918280	5920760	that were elevated on proactive aggression,
5920760	5923760	that were hunters and killers,
5923760	5926560	both of animals and of each other.
5927400	5929120	And you've got to include that
5929120	5932920	as almost certain from the past.
5932920	5937920	And then now we've taken our reactive aggression
5937960	5942560	and we've down-regulated it and that's given us power.
5942560	5945840	It's given us power because once you get rid
5945840	5948600	of the alpha male, once the beta males take over
5948600	5953400	and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,
5953400	5957120	less reactively aggressive individual,
5957120	5962040	the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable
5962040	5965000	of focusing on things other than conflict.
5965000	5968920	And so we have social groups in which individuals,
5968920	5971000	instead of constantly being on edge
5971000	5973400	in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,
5974560	5977560	are able to interact in ways
5977560	5981800	that enable them to share looking at a tool together
5981800	5984080	or share their food together
5984080	5987280	or pass ideas from one to the other
5987280	5989600	or support each other when they're ill
5989600	5991720	or whatever the issue is,
5991720	5996160	cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.
5996160	5998440	So you asked earlier, what did I think about
5998440	6001720	why sapiens were able to expand
6001720	6004280	at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically
6004280	6006720	around 40,000 years ago?
6006720	6011280	And the answer is that whatever it was,
6011280	6014480	it had something to do with the sapiens' ability
6014480	6016120	to cooperate.
6016120	6018280	That was what gave them bigger groups.
6018280	6023280	That's what enabled them to have a far more effective way
6023440	6026240	of living and I suspect it was to do with the weapons
6026240	6029960	and military aspects, but even if it wasn't that,
6029960	6035040	that the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing
6035160	6036920	would have been hugely important.
6036920	6040480	So sapiens then had groups of,
6040480	6042120	who knows exactly how big they were,
6042120	6047120	but scores of people to judge from their remains,
6048440	6052880	whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated
6052880	6057880	small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,
6058840	6060840	where they saw others so rarely
6060840	6063960	that they were in breeding at high levels.
6064000	6067240	Fathers having babies with their daughters.
6068320	6069800	Very different world.
6069800	6070640	Very different world.
6070640	6072320	And that's probably what our world was like
6072320	6073680	before we got sapiens.
6073680	6075040	Before we got sapiens.
6075040	6078360	And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence
6078360	6083360	against, once you get rid of the alpha males,
6084440	6089440	you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta,
6089920	6092320	the beta males, not kindness,
6092320	6094520	but collaboration as the better word.
6094520	6096560	Yes, much more cooperation,
6096560	6098960	not just among the males, among the beta males,
6098960	6102800	but also among the gamma males and the females.
6102800	6103640	Yeah.
6103640	6104920	I don't know what a gamma male is,
6104920	6107560	but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.
6107560	6108800	Well, I don't know about hell alphabet,
6108800	6112440	but I think the big layers of the married men
6112440	6115040	and the unmarried men,
6115040	6119000	because the married men had a problem with the unmarried men.
6119000	6121240	I mean, you see it in ethnographies
6121280	6123320	of hunters and gatherers recently,
6123320	6127160	where the unmarried men would be given rules, such as,
6127160	6130840	I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia was,
6130840	6133760	you cannot come to the camp for months.
6133760	6137320	You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush,
6137320	6140040	because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.
6140040	6143000	And then another kind of rule is,
6143920	6145080	if you are in the camp,
6145080	6147760	you must be in the firelight all the time.
6147760	6150840	Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.
6151840	6153960	So you really have us to control them,
6153960	6156960	because the men who had lots of wives
6156960	6160360	did not want those horrid bachelors sneaking around the place.
6160360	6161200	I love this.
6162280	6163960	You also wrote the book titled,
6163960	6166600	Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human.
6167880	6170720	What's the central idea in this book?
6170720	6172560	There's some title, How Cooking Made Us Human,
6172560	6176360	refers not to homo sapiens, but to homo erectus.
6176360	6179000	So human there means the genus Homo.
6180000	6185000	And homo erectus is the first full member of the genus Homo
6185000	6188760	in the sense that it looked like us,
6188760	6192200	just with a sort of slightly more robust build
6192200	6194160	and a smaller brain.
6195200	6197400	And the central idea of catching fire
6197400	6202120	is that it was the control of fire
6202120	6207240	that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus
6207240	6210800	and therefore the genus Homo,
6210800	6213040	which happened two million years ago.
6213040	6218040	And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.
6222720	6226400	And Australopithecines are the creatures
6226400	6229360	from whom we evolved.
6229400	6232880	They were present in Africa
6232880	6237080	from something like six or seven million years ago
6237080	6241560	up to, actually up to one million years ago.
6241560	6246400	And then a branch led off to Homo around two million years ago.
6247480	6250120	And the way to think of Australopithecines
6250120	6254080	is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.
6254080	6257080	So they were erect bipedal walkers.
6258080	6261320	They were like chimpanzees in the sense that
6261320	6264840	they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.
6264840	6267840	They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,
6267840	6269840	a little bit smaller actually.
6269840	6276840	And they had big jaws because they were still eating raw food.
6276840	6279320	They had big teeth and big jaws.
6279320	6282320	And then around two million years ago,
6282320	6284320	the line of Australopithecines,
6284320	6287160	which ended with an intermediate species,
6287160	6288440	a kind of missing link area,
6288440	6293080	because it is not missing, called habilis,
6293080	6294600	sometimes called Homo habilis,
6294600	6296160	but more properly, in my view,
6296160	6298160	called Australopithecus habilis.
6299400	6302520	That gave rise to Homo erectus.
6302520	6306080	And Homo erectus, here's how different it was.
6306080	6311080	It had a smaller mouth, a smaller jaw,
6311600	6316600	smaller teeth, and to judge from its ribs and pelvis,
6316600	6318080	smaller gut.
6318080	6323080	In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had,
6323080	6327080	which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.
6327080	6331080	And that meant that Homo erectus must have slept on the ground.
6331080	6334080	And since it slept on the ground,
6334080	6336080	it should have been able to defend itself somehow
6336080	6337080	against predators.
6337080	6339080	And I can't think of any way they could have done that,
6339080	6341080	unless they had fire.
6342080	6350080	So there are two major clues to why it was with Homo erectus
6350080	6354080	that our ancestors first acquired the control of fire.
6354080	6358080	One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees
6358080	6361080	in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos
6361080	6364080	and all the other primates do.
6365080	6371080	And the other is that there was this striking reduction
6371080	6375080	throughout the gut, reduction in size of the mouth
6375080	6379080	and the chewing apparatus and in the gut itself.
6379080	6384080	And that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,
6384080	6388080	which is that our guts are about two-thirds of the size
6388080	6391080	of what they would be if we ate raw food
6391080	6395080	to judge by the great apes.
6395080	6399080	So at some point in our evolution,
6399080	6405080	we acquired the skill of cooking and skill of controlling fire.
6405080	6410080	At no time between two million years ago and the present
6410080	6413080	do we see any changes in our anatomy
6413080	6419080	that can, as it were, justify the enormous change
6419080	6423080	that happens when you are an animal that learns to control fire.
6423080	6427080	But at two million years ago, we have exactly what you'd expect.
6427080	6431080	Namely, the gut's becoming smaller because the food is becoming softer
6431080	6433080	and much more easy to digest,
6433080	6437080	so you don't have to work so hard in your body to digest it.
6437080	6441080	And, as I say, commitment to sleeping on the ground,
6441080	6445080	which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays
6445080	6449080	on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti
6449080	6451080	unless you had fire.
6451080	6455080	I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa in the bush
6455080	6460080	and you will not catch me just lying on the ground
6460080	6464080	in an area with lots of predators unless I got a fire with me.
6464080	6466080	You're going to get eaten.
6466080	6469080	You're going to get terrified and you're going to get eaten.
6469080	6472080	Okay, so there's a million questions I want to ask.
6472080	6476080	The one, is it very naturally coupled,
6476080	6479080	the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?
6479080	6481080	Is that an obvious leap?
6481080	6483080	Well, here's what we know.
6483080	6486080	We know that all the animals that we've tested
6486080	6490080	like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.
6490080	6493080	So this is true for all the great apes.
6493080	6495080	We've tested them.
6495080	6497080	That's fascinating, by the way.
6497080	6498080	Why is that?
6498080	6501080	That's just like a property of food, I suppose.
6501080	6504080	Yes, I think what it is is that
6504080	6508080	animals are always looking for any kind of way
6508080	6511080	to get food that is easier to digest.
6511080	6514080	And there are various signals in the food,
6514080	6516080	such as the amount of sugar there,
6516080	6518080	the amount of free amino acids,
6518080	6522080	because the amino acids can be tasted.
6522080	6526080	And the physical qualities of the food be particularly important,
6526080	6528080	how tough their food is.
6528080	6534080	They prefer softer food, provided it feels safe, tastes safe.
6534080	6541080	And these kinds of sensory cues are all there in cooked food.
6541080	6545080	It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins,
6545080	6549080	it's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.
6549080	6552080	So everyone loves it spontaneously.
6552080	6555080	Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or raw food.
6555080	6557080	Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence of domestication.
6557080	6560080	But even, as I say, all of the great apes,
6560080	6565080	you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked, if they can.
6565080	6568080	So then, obviously, once you have fire,
6568080	6571080	you're going to accidentally discover that food changes
6571080	6573080	when you apply fire to it,
6573080	6577080	and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad.
6577080	6579080	You took the words out of my mouth.
6579080	6583080	If they have fire at all and their food rolls into it,
6583080	6586080	five minutes later, it tastes better than before.
6586080	6590080	How big of an invention, from an engineering perspective,
6590080	6593080	do you think is the discovery of fire?
6593080	6600080	Do you think for the, for Homo erectus, Homo sapiens,
6600080	6603080	do you think it's the greatest invention ever?
6603080	6605080	Yeah.
6605080	6612080	I think that the control of fire has been ultimately responsible
6612080	6617080	for essentially how grandiose do I want to be here?
6617080	6621080	You know, the entire human story going back to Homo
6621080	6626080	is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.
6626080	6631080	And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely to have changed us
6631080	6637080	is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain.
6638080	6647080	So, you know, the story here is that the constraints on brain size are energetic.
6647080	6657080	You and I have brains that are something like 2.5% of our body weight.
6657080	6663080	It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.
6663080	6665080	So it's disproportionate.
6665080	6671080	There are other expensive organs in our body as well, such as the heart.
6671080	6678080	And what's different about the brain is that in addition to us being able to fuel it
6678080	6684080	in a way that other animals can't, we also have reasons for wanting to have an even bigger brain,
6684080	6688080	whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.
6688080	6691080	So what those reasons are is unclear.
6691080	6696080	But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,
6696080	6702080	cooking makes it possible because it's supplying more calories
6702080	6708080	and it is enormously reducing the amount of time that it takes to chew your food.
6708080	6713080	So if you were a gorilla and you wanted to have a bigger brain,
6713080	6716080	you might say, OK, well, let's just eat some more.
6716080	6722080	But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day
6722080	6729080	in the sense that they're eating for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.
6729080	6731080	That's just chewing.
6731080	6733080	And then they've got to sit around and digest their food
6733080	6735080	because they can't just eat all the time.
6735080	6741080	They've got to take a break while the food is digested in the stomach
6741080	6743080	and then passed into the gut.
6743080	6746080	So the stomach is already full.
6746080	6750080	So basically gorillas are eating about the maximum rate already.
6750080	6753080	So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?
6753080	6754080	It doesn't.
6754080	6758080	It's actually got a smaller brain relative to its body size than chimpanzee does.
6758080	6764080	And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.
6764080	6766080	Then you come along and cook.
6766080	6771080	And all of a sudden you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.
6771080	6776080	You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.
6776080	6783080	There are 25 bodily processes or more that are involved in digesting your food,
6783080	6787080	making the acid that takes the proteins apart,
6787080	6794080	maintaining the brush border where the molecules are taken across the gut wall and so on.
6794080	6796080	That all costs.
6796080	6798080	It costs you to digest your food.
6798080	6800080	It costs less if you cook your food.
6800080	6803080	That's the net gain in the amount of energy.
6803080	6809080	And you are reducing the amount of time from, in our case of our ancestors,
6809080	6816080	probably around 50% of the day chewing to nowadays one hour a day chewing.
6816080	6820080	So all of a sudden you've got hours a day in which to do other things,
6820080	6824080	to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow.
6824080	6828080	So with Homo erectus, you start the process of getting a bigger brain
6828080	6832080	and famously throughout the whole period of the evolution of the genus Homo,
6832080	6837080	you have a steadily increasing size of brain.
6837080	6842080	Until right at the end when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story.
6842080	6844080	Which end is this?
6844080	6846080	Are we talking about Homo sapiens?
6846080	6851080	Yeah, with Homo sapiens you've got a smaller brain from,
6851080	6857080	people haven't got it exactly down, but at least 30,000 years ago it starts declining.
6857080	6862080	And so the fascinating thing about that is that all domesticated animals
6862080	6865080	have smaller brains than their wild ancestors.
6870080	6874080	The domestication is intricately connected to this brain size, you think.
6874080	6875080	Exactly.
6875080	6880080	So I think what we're seeing in humans is that same manifestation.
6880080	6883080	And then the fascinating question is why.
6883080	6888080	And the only point I would want to make about this is that there's no evidence
6888080	6895080	that in the small brain domesticates, they're losing say an average of about 15% of brain size,
6895080	6898080	in the small brain domesticates compared to their wild ancestors,
6898080	6903080	there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability.
6903080	6908080	So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain,
6908080	6913080	it's a more pedomorphic brain looking like the juveniles of the ancestor,
6913080	6919080	but just as our kids are very smart and can learn amazing things compared to adults,
6919080	6925080	all they lack is wisdom and maturity, but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.
6925080	6929080	And I think that's the same with domesticated animals compared to their wild ancestors,
6929080	6936080	and probably therefore with Homo sapiens say 30,000 years ago compared to their ancestors.
6936080	6939080	So we have smaller brains than the underdogs.
6939080	6943080	Size, Richard, isn't everything.
6943080	6944080	Exactly.
6944080	6949080	What's the connection between fire, cooking, and the eating of meat?
6949080	6956080	Which came first, do you think, humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat
6956080	6961080	or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?
6961080	6964080	I think that fire increased the use of meat.
6964080	6973080	But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt and kill meat, as do bonobos,
6973080	6975080	certainly puts us in...
6975080	6980080	So those two species have a common ancestor with us going six, seven million years ago,
6980080	6984080	and it was from that common ancestor that you get the Australopithecine line.
6984080	6988080	It's very likely therefore Australopithecines were eating meat when they could get it,
6988080	6992080	which wouldn't be very often because they wouldn't be very good sprinters,
6992080	6995080	but nevertheless they would occasionally be able to get some meat,
6995080	6997080	and I bet they loved it all the time.
6997080	7001080	And basically all primates like meat if they can get it, almost all of them.
7001080	7008080	But I think fire would have been very important for a couple of reasons.
7008080	7015080	One is that once you eat your food cooked, then you're saving yourself time.
7015080	7023080	By saving yourself time, you can free up the opportunity to go and hunt more
7023080	7027080	because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.
7027080	7033080	There's every risk that you will get nothing on one particular afternoon that you go off
7033080	7036080	looking for opportunities to kill.
7036080	7042080	But it's high gain because when you do get something, you bring down a kudu,
7042080	7046080	and you've got a serious amount of meat.
7046080	7052080	What did males and females do with the time they were saving from not having to chew their food?
7052080	7056080	I think that in the case of males, it's very reasonable to think,
7056080	7059080	they spent a greatly increased amount of time hunting.
7059080	7064080	So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,
7064080	7067080	and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.
7067080	7073080	With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,
7073080	7075080	and the average hunt length is six hours.
7075080	7077080	So it's a huge difference.
7077080	7081080	And that's possible because the time was available because they were cooking.
7081080	7083080	Less chewing, more hunting.
7083080	7085080	You got it.
7085080	7091080	The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.
7091080	7094080	So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,
7094080	7097080	and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.
7097080	7100080	They are so excited about going into the hunt,
7100080	7104080	and when they make the kill, then there's screams everywhere,
7104080	7109080	and some try to seize it and capture it and take it away from the others,
7109080	7112080	and eventually the strongest one has it,
7112080	7116080	and the others sit around begging and trying to get some and tear it off,
7116080	7118080	and so they all love it.
7118080	7121080	There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree
7121080	7124080	in order to be able to get away from all of these beggars and scavengers,
7124080	7130080	and while he's there, he drops of blood or little scraps full time to the bottom,
7130080	7135080	and the junior members of society, you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,
7135080	7140080	they are racing through to find a particular leaf that's got to drop a blood on it
7140080	7141080	so they can lick it.
7141080	7143080	I mean, they love it.
7143080	7148080	But it takes them a lot of time to chew it.
7148080	7151080	I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.
7151080	7156080	So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,
7156080	7159080	and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,
7159080	7162080	I've had enough of this, I need real food,
7162080	7166080	and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again,
7166080	7172080	because they can get fruit into their bodies so much faster than they can get meat.
7172080	7175080	So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,
7175080	7177080	and they can eat the meat so just much more readily.
7177080	7182080	So I think that mediating would become important for two reasons with cooking.
7182080	7188080	So the key, not to oversimplify, but the key moments in human history
7188080	7195080	are with the Homo erectus, the discovery of fire and the use of fire for cooking,
7195080	7202080	and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males killing off the alpha males
7202080	7207080	so that the cooperation can exist and cooperation leads to communication
7207080	7211080	and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas, that kind of thing.
7211080	7216080	Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that is that you have to ask,
7216080	7221080	how is it that the beta males were able to kill the alpha male?
7221080	7228080	And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males within their own group sometimes,
7228080	7231080	it's not a process of killing the alpha male.
7231080	7236080	It's taking advantage of opportunity when some male gets into a bad position,
7236080	7239080	but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.
7239080	7242080	And you can see why, because they don't have language.
7242080	7248080	And without language, it's very difficult to know how confident you can be
7248080	7253080	of the support of others against a particular individual within your own group.
7253080	7257080	When you're attacking someone from another group, that problem is solved.
7257080	7261080	We all hate those guys.
7261080	7266080	But the alpha male has got alliances within his group.
7266080	7271080	Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.
7271080	7275080	Some of them might be harboring deep feelings of resentment.
7275080	7278080	But how does anyone else know that?
7278080	7283080	So in other words, I think that you have to have some kind of language that is pretty good
7283080	7291080	to solve the problems of gaining confidence that five of you say,
7291080	7298080	or some number, can trust each other in this final attack.
7298080	7302080	And even nowadays, it's difficult.
7302080	7304080	You mentioned Stalin.
7304080	7308080	It's like, why was everybody terrified?
7308080	7310080	Any dictator that takes control?
7310080	7315080	Why is all of us as individuals terrified when you know there's millions of us?
7315080	7317080	That's right.
7317080	7324080	And so like that, we lack the language because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.
7324080	7326080	Like, who can we talk to?
7326080	7328080	Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?
7328080	7329080	Exactly.
7329080	7330080	That's right.
7330080	7336080	But do you have this intuition that some kind of language was developing
7336080	7340080	along with this process of beta males taking over?
7340080	7341080	Yes.
7341080	7347080	Once you have sufficient language to be able to have the beta males conspiring to kill the alpha male,
7347080	7354080	then you have selection in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.
7354080	7359080	And at that point, there will be increased ability to communicate
7359080	7362080	and the language will get richer and better and better.
7362080	7363080	So yes, absolutely.
7363080	7368080	Positive feedback loop once you get the situation started.
7368080	7376080	Can you maybe comment on the full complexity and richness of the human mind through this process?
7376080	7386080	Casually saying cooking fire and beta males leading to cooperation.
7386080	7390080	But how does the beauty of the human mind emerge from all of this?
7390080	7393080	Is there other further steps we need to understand?
7393080	7401080	Or is it as simple as this language emerging from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?
7401080	7405080	Or am I also over romanticizing how amazing the human mind is?
7405080	7413080	Is it just like one small step in a long journey of evolution?
7413080	7428080	Well, if the beauty of the human mind is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore,
7428080	7430080	that's one kind of beauty.
7430080	7436080	Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.
7436080	7443080	And we think of that as beautiful because it is a kind of rare and special ability
7443080	7454080	compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness that can commonly predominate.
7454080	7462080	I suppose we have to think of different sources for those two types.
7462080	7469080	I suppose a general answer is that there has been selection in favor of bigger brains
7469080	7474080	which probably in general has been associated with increasing cognitive ability.
7474080	7481080	And as that has happened, the complexity of life has increased
7481080	7488080	because people have more and more complex, highly differentiated strategies
7488080	7493080	in response to each other's more complex, highly differentiated strategies.
7493080	7497080	We get to a point where there is deception and self-deception.
7497080	7507080	There is a manipulation of ideas through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.
7508080	7522080	I guess all I'm wanting to say is that there is a world of the mind that evolves in response
7522080	7528080	to these platforms that are put there, the platform of increasing brain size
7528080	7533080	and therefore cognitive ability made possible by increased energy supply.
7533080	7542080	The platform of cooperation and tolerance in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict
7542080	7549080	and therefore a need to respond to the conflict and manipulate your eyes appropriately.
7549080	7555080	I don't see either kind of beauty as coming totally independently of these things.
7555080	7562080	I don't think there is a selection for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.
7563080	7570080	But I guess sexual selection, males wanting to impress females in different ways
7570080	7578080	will lead to them wanting to show off in all the different ways.
7578080	7583080	All of these are natural consequences of just coming up with strategies
7583080	7587080	of how to cooperate and how to achieve certain ends.
7588080	7595080	We haven't spoken about sexual selection, but that is a really important part of it.
7595080	7603080	They are trying to out-compete each other normally without any physical conflict
7603080	7607080	just in order to be able to be chosen by mates of the opposite sex.
7607080	7613080	That is certainly a major source of creativity.
7613080	7619080	You've studied chimps, you also all the other relatives, gorillas.
7619080	7623080	What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps, about gorillas, about humans?
7623080	7630080	Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary, that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.
7630080	7635080	How are we related? What is the common ancestor? What are the interesting differences?
7635080	7642080	I know I'm asking a million questions, but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,
7642080	7649080	and humans like how we're related and what you find fascinating about each?
7649080	7660080	In Africa, straddling the equator, there is a strip of rainforest that relies on the combination
7660080	7666080	of high temperatures and rainfall that you get around the equator.
7666080	7675080	That rainforest goes into about 22 countries, and throughout those countries you have chimpanzees,
7675080	7678080	although they've gone extinct in two of them.
7678080	7690080	In just a fraction of them, five countries, you've got gorillas, where there are mountains,
7690080	7697080	and in one country, on the left bank of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.
7697080	7703080	In the African forest, you've got these three African apes, the only African apes,
7703080	7710080	all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.
7710080	7719080	They walk on their knuckles through the forest looking for fruit trees and eating herbs when they can't find fruits.
7720080	7731080	Gorillas represent the oldest chain, so about 10 million years ago, maybe as recently as 8 million years ago,
7731080	7737080	the ancestor of gorillas broke off from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.
7737080	7744080	They've probably remained very similar now to what they were then.
7744080	7758080	They were probably the largest apes living in montane areas and spending more time eating just herbs, stems,
7758080	7762080	not so vitally dependent on fruit.
7762080	7776080	And living in, if it was like the present, groups up to about 50 stable groups with one alpha male who was in charge.
7776080	7787080	Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive compared to chimps and bonobos.
7787080	7800080	I had the privilege of spending a week or two with gorillas at Diane Fossey's camp before she was murdered.
7800080	7809080	And I went out with two women, Kelly and Barb, to a particular group.
7809080	7818080	And there was a young female in the group called Simba, and Simba approached us and stared at the two women.
7818080	7830080	And then she came towards me and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles and touched me on the forehead.
7830080	7838080	She was watched in doing this by a young male who was quite keen on her and he was called Digit.
7838080	7844080	And about five minutes later Digit stood in front of us on the path.
7844080	7850080	And Kelly was in front of me and then there was Barb and then there was me.
7850080	7856080	And he came charging down the path and he sidestepped around Kelly and he sidestepped around Barb.
7856080	7865080	And me, he just knocked with his arm and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.
7865080	7869080	And I loved the way that that was a very deliberate response.
7869080	7874080	And I loved the way that Simba had been so interested in me and held my eye.
7874080	7877080	Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye.
7877080	7884080	But gorillas really look as though they're trying to sort of figure out, what are you thinking about?
7884080	7890080	That was a species that goes back for something like 10 million years.
7890080	7895080	In that situation, was there a game being played?
7895080	7900080	Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me, I don't want you messing with Simba.
7900080	7903080	But was Simba using you?
7903080	7906080	Oh, I see. Well, that's a fun idea.
7906080	7913080	I don't see why she should be using me, but you mean testing how strongly Digit was prepared to interview?
7913080	7914080	Yeah, exactly.
7914080	7918080	Oh, that's come straight out of a sort of adolescent to high school playbook.
7918080	7920080	All right. Well, that's all.
7920080	7922080	No, there's nothing wrong with it for that.
7922080	7927080	I never thought of that and you never know.
7927080	7929080	It's possible.
7929080	7937080	So, yeah, okay, so this is an ancient branch of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla that led to gorillas.
7937080	7938080	Gorillas.
7938080	7947080	So then the next thing that happened on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago when you have the line
7948080	7954080	between chimps and bonobos on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.
7954080	7961080	And basically what happened is that at that point, a chimplike ancestor leaves the forest,
7961080	7967080	gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts and that becomes the Australopithecines.
7967080	7973080	And meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor continues in the forest.
7973080	7981080	And later what happens is that one branch of that crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.
7981080	7985080	That was only about two million years ago, maybe one million years ago.
7985080	7993080	Now, the chimps that remained in the forest for this time and occupied all the countries across from West to East Africa now.
7993080	8001080	Again, we assume that they're pretty similar to the ones that live nowadays where there's some variation from West to East.
8001080	8009080	And these are animals that live in social communities of between say 20 and 200.
8009080	8015080	They have a lot of them in one group, but they never come together in a single unit.
8015080	8025080	These are, they share an area, a community territory and that area is defended by males and within it females wander and bring up their young independently.
8025080	8035080	And the females are very scared about the possibility that males will be mean to their infants.
8035080	8044080	And in order to avoid them doing that, they do their best to mate with every single male in the group multiple times.
8044080	8050080	As if to give a memory in that male of, yeah, yeah, I reminded you, so I'm not going to be mean to your baby.
8050080	8052080	So what's wonderful about chimps?
8052080	8059080	Well, you know, as we've spoken about them, you know, they are creative and sort of amazingly human like.
8059080	8065080	But I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments and here's one.
8065080	8073080	I've got two chimps who are grooming each other on a day when they are utterly exhausted.
8073080	8079080	They've walked 11 kilometers the day before up and down hills.
8079080	8085080	And on this particular day, all they do is they get to one tree and they eat from that tree.
8085080	8092080	And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.
8092080	8094080	So they're utterly exhausted.
8094080	8099080	And they're just eating nonstop because they're trying to recover their energy.
8099080	8102080	And this is Hugh and Charlie.
8102080	8108080	And we think they were probably brothers that we never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.
8108080	8122080	Well, I never remember now who it is, but let's say that they both come down from the tree and they're both carrying branches of the food.
8122080	8124080	Everything actually seeds from these branches.
8124080	8133080	They're both engaged even in the midday sun when they want to come down and shade themselves for a bit on the ground.
8133080	8135080	They're still eating.
8135080	8142080	Then Charlie finishes his branch and he starts grooming Hugh.
8142080	8149080	And Hugh continues eating from his branch.
8149080	8161080	Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes and he reaches out and he lifts the branch from which Hugh is still taking seeds
8161080	8168080	and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back as far as possible away from Hugh.
8168080	8170080	Hugh doesn't do anything.
8170080	8175080	He just finishes his mouthful and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.
8175080	8179080	So this very polite way of saying, will you groom me please has worked.
8180080	8193080	Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back and around to the right side and then down his arm to what point where he can reach the branch again.
8193080	8196080	And then he picks up the branch and continues.
8196080	8197080	Not sure, aren't they?
8197080	8198080	Right.
8198080	8199080	Yeah.
8199080	8207080	So in other words, they have a very sort of simple little strategy, but it just shows the courtesy with which they can treat each other.
8207080	8218080	And the days I love with chimps are when you see that sort of thing or when you see mothers just lying in a sunlit patch in the forest with their babies bouncing on top of them,
8218080	8221080	just having a wonderful, peaceful time.
8221080	8226080	And that's what most of their lives are like.
8226080	8236080	So chimpanzees are the species that kind of unites the rest of the apes because a gorilla is in many ways just a big version of a chimpanzee.
8236080	8242080	If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.
8242080	8255080	And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee, but obviously humans didn't domesticate them, so they're self-domesticated.
8255080	8264080	They are less aggressive and they show all the marks of domestication that domesticated animals do compared to wild animals in their bones.
8264080	8269080	So they have reduced differences between males and females in which the males are more like females.
8269080	8270080	They have smaller brains.
8270080	8275080	They have shorter faces, smaller teeth and smaller bodies.
8275080	8277080	All the things that domesticated animals show.
8278080	8285080	And bonobos live in this environment in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.
8285080	8296080	There's no indication that they will have these aggressive kills and enough data now to show that there's a statistical difference in the frequency in which it would happen.
8296080	8301080	And bonobos are famously erotic.
8301080	8313080	The females have enlarged sexual parts which swell to a particularly large size compared to the female chimpanzees.
8313080	8325080	And the females have a lot of interactions with each other in which they excitedly rubbed their clitorises together and appeared to have orgasms.
8326080	8332080	These occur in the context of some kind of social tension.
8332080	8345080	And they sometimes happen before, sometimes after the social tension, and they seem to be devices, these interactions, for ensuring that everyone's friends and reducing the chances that they're actually going to get into a fight.
8345080	8353080	There's a kind of conflict resolution through sex or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.
8353080	8356080	Well, it's often characterized as make love not war.
8356080	8358080	Make love not war.
8358080	8361080	Okay.
8361080	8366080	You mentioned to me offline that you have a deep love for nature.
8366080	8378080	If we look at the world today, how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature remain a big part of our lives?
8378080	8391080	Assuming beings, in the way we think about it, in the way we also keep it around, preserve it, you know, we keep it part of our minds and part of our world.
8391080	8413080	It's a very difficult question because every time there is a conflict between conservation of a natural habitat and allowing people to get a little bit of extra food for their babies, then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.
8413080	8422080	And so we have this steady erosion in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.
8422080	8431080	We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats and all the species, and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.
8431080	8440080	Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples of something being saved, but the overall trend is clear.
8440080	8446080	And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that because it's not human.
8446080	8457080	Now that we are essentially a single tribe to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.
8457080	8474080	So I think the only way in which we can really conserve is if we put tremendous effort into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.
8475080	8489080	Often this will be the national parks that already exist, and what we have to do is to make them so valuable that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival to be able to keep those sorts of places.
8490080	8503080	And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I have taken in Uganda where we want to keep the Kibali National Park alive, which has got the largest population in chimpanzees in Uganda,
8503080	8512080	and it's got elephants and wonderful birds and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on, and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.
8512080	8523080	It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism, and you need to make sure ecotourism is done right.
8523080	8535080	In other places you will keep nature there because it's useful for maintaining the climate, bringing rain.
8536080	8561080	Maybe you can in some places convince people of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature that even over the long term, presidents whose job it is to look for the future of the country will be persuaded that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.
8561080	8582080	But overall, what is required is for people in the rich countries to do much more investment than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places in their own countries and in the tropics.
8583080	8596080	And if you look at Africa, the population trends are that Nigeria may become the most populous country in the world, I think, within a century.
8596080	8603080	The future of African habitats, it's clear what's going to happen in general.
8603080	8607080	There's going to be a huge conversion towards agricultural land.
8608080	8622080	I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago about the prospect of the entire globe being turned into a single human feedlot.
8622080	8625080	It's going to take a lot to avoid that.
8625080	8633080	He is out there calling for half the earth to be devoted to nature.
8634080	8637080	It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.
8637080	8643080	But unless you have really exciting goals, probably nothing will be achieved.
8643080	8657080	Yeah, I mean, there's something to me like when I visit New York and I see Central Park and somehow constructed a situation where you preserve this park in the middle, probably some of the most expensive land in the world.
8657080	8675080	The fact that that's possible gives me hope that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale, perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons of just valuing the beauty and disrespecting our origins of having come from the earth.
8675080	8684080	We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas as our close relatives still living on the earth.
8684080	8694080	We're unlucky that we don't have Australopithecines and other species of homo, but we're still lucky to have those because they are incredibly closely related to us compared to what most animals have.
8694080	8704080	There are many animals that don't have any close relatives to them on the earth, but not only are they relatively close, but they teach us so much about ourselves.
8705080	8719080	The similarities between them and ourselves raise questions that we can then test about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities are derived from the same evolutionary stock as in those great apes.
8719080	8721080	Well, how much is that worth?
8721080	8730080	I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars to find evidence of bacteria there, and that's fascinating too.
8730080	8745080	But we should be spending billions on this earth in order to make sure that we have, I don't know how to say it, substantial representative populations of these close relatives.
8745080	8753080	Yeah, that we can meet. There's something like space tourism when you go out into space and you look back down on earth.
8753080	8758080	That's to a lot of people, including myself is worth a lot.
8758080	8773080	But why is that worth a lot is because it's humbling and beautiful in the same way that meeting our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.
8773080	8779080	Just to know that this is what we come from. This is who we are.
8779080	8785080	Not just for the understanding or the science of it, but just like something about just the beauty of witnessing this.
8785080	8795080	And again, it's both humbling and empowering that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.
8796080	8802080	Yes, unfortunately, the problems are incredibly difficult to solve and there is no one solver.
8802080	8807080	It has to happen from a network of potentially cooperating people.
8807080	8812080	But I mean, you're so right about it being daunting to think about what it looks like from space.
8812080	8824080	And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed of being able to go out from space and he said the whole of life would look like a kind of rust on the planet.
8825080	8830080	Yeah, so the aliens were to visit. I'm not sure they would notice the life.
8830080	8837080	They would probably notice the trees or ocean. It's a kind of rust.
8837080	8843080	But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question. What is the meaning of this rust?
8843080	8849080	What do you think is the meaning of life on earth? What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?
8850080	8860080	Well, I think it's very clear that we have an evolutionary story that is only getting challenged around the edges.
8860080	8864080	We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.
8864080	8882080	And the meaning is we are here as a consequence of materialistic processes that began in our sense with the establishment of the Earth
8882080	8889080	four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was, and then water and oxygen and so on.
8890080	8902080	And we are the astonishing consequence of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.
8904080	8909080	The word random is the wrong word to use unless you understand what it means.
8911080	8917080	It didn't happen by chance, but a lot of random events had to happen to make this possible.
8917080	8922080	And those random events, of course, are the production of appropriate mutations.
8922080	8934080	But the meaning of life is there is no meaning. The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?
8934080	8941080	And that's saying why propagates itself through the whole process of it.
8941080	8954080	For the emergence of planets, the virgins, first of all, galaxies of star systems, of planets, of the proteins required to construct the single cell organisms
8954080	8963080	and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land and the whole of it.
8963080	8968080	And then there's fire, some clever guy or lady invented fire.
8968080	8977080	And then now here we are. It just does seem, speaking as a human, kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole thing.
8977080	8982080	Wonderful story. So much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.
8982080	8993080	It is beautiful, but it just seems special that us humans are able to write religions and construct stories and also do science.
8993080	9011080	That seems kind of amazing. It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us that are able to investigate it.
9012080	9023080	And that's why there's this longing for why. It's just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity created by the universe.
9023080	9035080	It seems like there should be a why, but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.
9035080	9039080	Even without an infinite number of universes, I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.
9040080	9047080	Now that we know how many planets have the right sort of conditions, which is what, I can't remember, a lot.
9047080	9060080	It's some significant percentage of all planets. Then there are apparently billions of planets and things happen so quickly on Earth.
9060080	9069080	Once you've got water, then you've got life and it did not take long for life to evolve in the big scheme of things.
9069080	9081080	And if you think you look out there, say there's a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations, one dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.
9081080	9090080	And it's interesting to think what level of violence is useful for extending the life of a civilization.
9090080	9097080	So we have a particular set of violence in our history, maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.
9097080	9101080	Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.
9101080	9106080	So you look at viruses. What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?
9106080	9112080	If you're too deadly, that's a big problem. If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.
9112080	9115080	So that is a fascinating exploration of...
9115080	9121080	I don't see any evidence. There's no way you're coming from when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.
9121080	9132080	Well, because, I'll say it this way, death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.
9133080	9136080	But there's lots of ways to die without violence.
9136080	9139080	Right. To me, death in itself is violence.
9139080	9151080	And a lot of people that talk about, for example, longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff, they see death is the way they talk about it.
9151080	9157080	And it's interesting to think of it that way. Death is like mass murder that's happening.
9158080	9167080	People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life, they see that you're helping...
9167080	9178080	The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization, from their perspective, is not allocating all our resources to solving death.
9178080	9186080	Right. Because death is a kind of violence. It is a kind of murder that we're allowing to be committed on us by nature.
9187080	9194080	So the flip side of that is death makes way for new life, for new ideas.
9194080	9204080	Yes, but that's got nothing to do with peace versus war. You have animals that are very, very peaceful, but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.
9204080	9208080	They just don't do it with death caused by violence.
9208080	9214080	And violent death is premature death, surely. I mean, I don't mind about people dying.
9214080	9220080	What I mind about is people dying in their youth.
9220080	9226080	Prematurely, but some people would say all death is premature. It certainly feels that way.
9226080	9232080	It's died too soon. Anyone who's ever died died too soon.
9232080	9240080	Yeah. Well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years, that would be great.
9240080	9244080	Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?
9244080	9250080	I don't think I'm afraid of it. You know, I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.
9250080	9259080	I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life, you know, and I don't want to, to leave the party.
9259080	9265080	Yeah, it's kind of a fun party. I don't want to leave the party either.
9265080	9270080	So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party and you're right.
9270080	9275080	Having a party with a little bit less violence than it is an even more fun party.
9275080	9280080	Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time with me today. Your work is amazing.
9280080	9288080	It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history and the nature of human civilization.
9288080	9291080	So again, thank you so much for talking today. It's an honor.
9291080	9294080	Thanks for your great questions. It's a really fun conversation.
9294080	9298080	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Rangham.

9302080	9305080	And now let me leave you some words from Jane Goodall.
9305080	9309080	The greatest danger to our future is apathy.
9309080	9313080	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
