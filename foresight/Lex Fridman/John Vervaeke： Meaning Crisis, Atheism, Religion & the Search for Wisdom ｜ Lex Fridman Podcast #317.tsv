0	4280	The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.
4480	9240	You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.
9440	13640	It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.
13960	17320	And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.
18200	19160	That's mortality.
19400	22520	Mortality isn't just some far flung event.
22760	28880	It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.
29320	36280	So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects
36280	41160	and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.
43560	47360	The following is a conversation with John Rovaki, a psychologist and
47360	49640	cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto.
50200	55400	I highly recommend his lecture series called Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,
55760	60160	which covers the history and future of humanity's search for meaning.
60840	62560	This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
62720	65840	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
66240	69400	And now, dear friends, here's John Rovaki.
70440	75360	You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the Meaning Crisis.
75960	81880	And I think you describe in the modern times an increase in depression, loneliness,
81920	86080	cynicism and wait for it bullshit.
86640	90680	The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you.
90680	93160	So let me ask, what is meaning?
93800	100000	What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning?
100200	103440	So when I'm talking about meaning, I'm talking about what's called meaning in life,
103560	105040	not the meaning of life.
105080	106760	That's some sort of metaphysical claim.
107400	111960	Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate their lives as more
111960	115080	meaningful, worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure.
115880	121880	And when you study that, what you see is it's a sense of connectedness,
123160	127880	connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world and a particular
127880	129280	kind of connectedness.
129880	134960	You want to be connected to things that have a value and an existence
134960	139080	independent of your egocentric sort of preferences and concerns.
139120	142240	This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful because
142240	146040	you're connecting to something that's going to have a life and a value
146040	147880	independent of you.
148960	153360	Now, the question that comes up for me, well, there's two questions.
153360	155960	One is, why is that at risk right now?
156520	161080	And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first,
161080	164040	which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?
164040	166600	Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings?
166600	171040	Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression,
171040	174520	potentially mental illness, addiction, self-destructive behavior?
175040	179200	And so the first answer I give you is, well, it's that sense of connectedness.
179440	181200	And people often express it metaphorically.
181200	183760	They want to be connected to something larger than themselves.
183760	184600	They want to matter.
185040	186200	They don't mean it literally.
186600	190240	I mean, if I chained you to a mountain, you wouldn't thereby say, oh, now my life
190240	191560	is so fulfilling, right?
192000	195040	So what they're trying to convey, they're using this metaphor to try and say,
195560	196600	they want to be connected.
197240	198760	They want to be connected to something real.
199080	201480	They want to make a difference and matter to it.
202160	207920	And one way of asking them, well, you know, what's meaningful is tell me what
207920	211600	you would like to continue to exist, even if you weren't around anymore.
212520	215080	And how are you connected to it and how do you matter to it?
216080	224360	That's one way of trying to get at what is the source of meaning for you is if
224360	227720	you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing.
228560	232520	That's not the only part of the definition, probably, because there's
232520	238480	probably many things that aren't a source of meaning for me that maybe I find
238480	241800	beautiful, that I would like to continue existing.
241800	242320	Yes.
242760	247400	If it contributes to your life being meaningful, you're connected to it in
247400	254560	some way, and it matters to you, and you matter to it in that you make some
254560	255280	difference to it.
255560	259240	That's when it goes from being just sort of true, good, and beautiful to being
259240	260960	a source of meaning for you in your life.
261920	266080	Is the meaning crisis a new thing, or has it always been with us?
266080	268280	Is it part of the human condition in general?
268920	270240	That's an excellent question.
270600	273920	And part of the argument I made in Awakening for the Meaning Crisis is there's
273920	275200	two aspects to it.
276040	281040	One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning.
282400	286240	And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair.
286240	290160	You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is, it's all vanity, it's all meaningless.
291600	297440	But there's also historical forces that have made those perennial problems
298000	303200	more pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with.
303200	308200	And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems,
308200	312960	finding existing, existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety,
312960	317680	feeling alienated, and then pressing historical factors, which have to do
317680	322320	with the loss of the resources that human beings have typically crossed
322320	324880	historically and cross-culturally made use of.
325200	330960	Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning
330960	335360	that speaks to the fact that we're vulnerable to despair?
335360	340240	You know, Ernest Becker talked about the, in his book, The Nile of Death,
340240	344880	about the fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.
344880	348640	As William James said, death is the warm at the heart of life.
348640	351120	Death is the warm at the heart of life.
351120	356880	In our life, as William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition.
356880	366240	Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen
366240	373920	from the perspective of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one's own mortality?
375440	379040	Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it.
379040	384000	There's been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.
386560	387920	Some of the work, not so good.
388880	391280	So which aspects do you find convincing?
391280	394400	Can you steelman that case and then can you argue against it?
395040	401840	So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite,
402560	406720	being inherently limited is very problematic for us.
409360	414000	Given the extensive use of the word problematic, I like that you use that word
414000	417200	to describe one's own mortality as problematic.
417200	421760	Because people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody.
421760	426320	But this to me seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human condition
426320	428480	is that we die and it ends.
428480	434320	I think I'm not just agreeing with you, but I'm trying to get you to consider
434320	436800	that your mortality is not an event in the future.
436800	438240	It's a state you're in right now.
439360	442000	That's what I'm trying to shift.
443360	449120	So your mortality is just a, we talk about something that causes mortality fatal.
450160	453440	But what we actually mean is it's full of fate.
453440	456480	And I don't mean in the sense of things that are pre-written.
456480	464320	What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.
464320	469280	You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.
469280	473840	It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.
473840	477120	And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.
478080	479280	That's mortality.
479280	482640	Mortality isn't just some far flung event.
482640	488640	It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.
489200	494480	So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever
495360	499120	all the projects and the plans you make come up against the fact
499120	501040	that the universe can just roll over them.
502240	508640	The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence.
508640	511120	And so in that sense, it is always here with us.
511920	516880	Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life.
517840	523520	Because it's interesting if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one.
523520	526400	They often put public speaking as number one.
527120	534080	Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings.
534080	535280	You can drive them into despair.
536320	540560	So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say that
541680	545920	a self-report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually
546000	550640	at the core of the motivation of a human being, that we could be terrified of death.
550640	558480	And from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends,
558480	562400	we've learned to really try to forget about it.
562400	568000	Try to construct illusions that allow us to escape momentarily
568000	572080	over prolonged periods of time the realization that we die.
572400	577840	So first, I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there's some empirical work
577840	579680	that makes me want to reconsider.
579680	585680	So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read,
585680	590880	and in those words, in those lists are words associated with death, cough and funeral.
590880	592560	And then you see what happens to people.
592560	595600	And generally, they start to become more rigid in their thinking.
595600	597600	They tend to identify with their worldview.
598800	600320	They lose cognitive flexibility.
600560	603440	That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective.
603440	609040	But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they're dying
609600	616320	and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don't show those responses.
616320	621760	In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness.
621760	625840	See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse.
625840	630160	The cart before the horse, it might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that
630160	632400	is present or absent in depth.
632400	633840	That is the crucial thing for us.
634560	637360	By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously.
637360	643120	I don't think you truly steelman the case because you're saying that death is always
643120	643920	present with us.
643920	649280	Yes, but isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?
649280	653680	Nietzsche, Will to Power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother,
654480	658560	all the different explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings.
658560	664880	Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good,
666320	671280	if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?
672000	678320	I'm not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings, but I'm
678320	684480	proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths
684480	686720	meaningful and certain deaths meaningless.
688400	693280	We have lots of evidence that people are willing to sacrifice their biological existence
693840	696000	for a death they consider meaningful.
696000	698400	Are you personally afraid of your death?
698400	699760	Do you think about it?
699760	706000	As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down,
706800	712400	is a deep thinker, admired thinker, and as the years go on, become more and more admired.
713600	716400	Does it scare you that the ride ends?
718080	720480	No, I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.
720480	725120	I'm a biological organism, so something's thrown at my head all duck and things like that.
725920	730880	But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever?
731760	732080	No.
733040	736880	In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you
737440	741920	aware of simultaneously the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.
742640	747280	The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.
749040	750400	Are those the only two options?
754080	760800	When you're sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or a book you really
760800	762320	love, you don't want it to end.
763280	768480	You don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect, the complete opposite of the
768480	769440	thought experiment.
769440	771600	What happens if the book lasts forever?
772400	774800	There's got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button.
774800	779520	Sure, you don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra 15 minutes.
780800	783280	There's surely some kind of balance.
783520	791680	That fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation of the moment, in part.
792480	797360	That's what the Stoics talked about, to meditate on once mortality.
797360	797600	Sure.
797600	806480	It seems to be a nice wake-up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful,
806480	808480	and then you don't get an infinite number of them.
809200	815440	Right, and the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of your life,
815440	824160	but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that when death comes,
824160	826640	it does not strike you as any kind of calamity.
826640	829520	Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?
830720	831760	I think so.
831760	833600	Do you think about your mortality?
833600	834480	I used to.
834480	835760	I don't so much anymore.
839280	845280	Part of it, as I'm older, and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s,
845280	848240	you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death.
848880	850400	That's such a beautiful phrase.
850400	852400	The temporal horizon flips.
852960	853760	That's so true.
854640	855360	That's so true.
855920	865120	At what point is that, the point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite
865120	865680	before you?
865680	867200	Yeah, it's like Peter Pan.
867200	871520	There's all these golden possibilities, and you fly around between them.
871520	872480	Yes, very much.
873040	877280	And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model.
878480	883760	The Socratic, the Stoic model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about,
884480	890000	wait, when I look at my desires, I seem to have two meta-desires.
890560	896480	In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be real.
897600	903920	And whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict, but bring something
903920	904800	like peace of mind.
905360	911440	And so, I more and more move towards how can I live such that those two meta-desires
912000	917680	are a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires.
919680	921360	What do you think happens after we die?
922080	926480	I think mind and life go away completely.
927200	934960	When we die, and I think that's actually significantly important for the kind of
934960	935920	beings that we are.
937440	942880	We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness, and then we have a responsibility
944080	946880	to decide how we're going to comport ourselves towards it.
948160	950000	Can you linger on what that means?
950000	951040	The mind goes away.
952000	958560	Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over.
960160	961920	It doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful.
961920	964080	It doesn't mean the song wasn't complex.
964080	969200	It doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value of the universe in its existence,
969200	970320	but it came to an end.
970880	976720	Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human
977680	979120	and remains after?
979680	985200	Something like panpsychism, or is it too much for us limited cognitive beings to understand?
985920	989360	Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously.
989360	994800	I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that make me doubt it.
996800	1002160	Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has,
1002720	1006320	for me, just devastating problems.
1006320	1010080	Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose
1010960	1013840	in order to support some kind of idea of immortality.
1013840	1015280	I find both very problematic.
1016240	1020720	The fact that we participate in distributed cognition,
1020720	1023360	that most of our problem solving is not done as individuals,
1023360	1025760	but in groups, this is something I've worked on.
1025760	1027040	I've published on that.
1027040	1028000	I think that's important.
1029280	1035680	But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while there's
1035680	1041280	such a thing as collective intelligence, there's no good evidence that there's collective consciousness.
1041280	1044640	In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason.
1047040	1050560	While I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline,
1051360	1053840	and there's a collective intelligence that solves that problem,
1053840	1057840	I do not think that collective intelligence supports any kind of consciousness.
1059040	1062400	Therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate,
1062400	1065360	which I regularly and reliably do in distributed cognition,
1065920	1070800	gives me any reason to believe that that participation grounds some kind of consciousness.
1072160	1074400	Okay, there's so many things to mention there.
1074400	1079600	First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence,
1079600	1086720	so that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines,
1087680	1092240	and are somehow able to interact with a process of dialogue, as you talk about,
1093120	1099280	to morph different ideas together, like this idea landscape together.
1100080	1105520	It's so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating
1106320	1114480	distributed cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence.
1115440	1119920	But isn't there a case, if we just look at intelligence,
1119920	1124480	if we look at us humans as a collection of smaller organisms, which we are,
1125920	1133200	and so there's like a hierarchy of organisms, tiny ones work together to form
1134320	1140320	tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual organisms that are then also forming
1140880	1145920	bigger villages and interacting different ways, and function becomes more and more complex,
1145920	1150240	and eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we're an individual,
1150240	1156720	but really we're not. There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign.
1158400	1167600	So isn't that building up consciousnesses, like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness?
1167600	1173680	Why does it have to stop with us humans? Is this the face transition when it becomes
1174400	1183840	a zombie-like giant hierarchical village that first, there's like singing angels and
1183840	1190080	it's consciousness is born in just us humans? Do bacteria have consciousness? Not bacteria,
1190080	1195600	but maybe you could say bacteria does, but the interesting complicated organisms that are within
1195600	1202640	us have consciousness. I think it's proper to argue, and I have, that like a paramecium or
1202640	1210080	bacteria has a kind of agency and even a kind of intelligence, kind of sense-making ability,
1210080	1215040	but I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by
1215040	1220880	consciousness, this kind of self-awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera,
1221600	1228320	to bacteria. Now, the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness, I think
1228320	1237360	is a little bit more tricky. And I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a
1237360	1244960	consciousness for distributed cognition, collective intelligence. In fact, many philosophers would
1244960	1250720	agree with me on that point. I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts,
1251440	1259440	bandwidth, density of connections, speed of information transfer, et cetera. It's conceivable
1259440	1265600	that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked our brains and we had
1265600	1272480	the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed, that a group consciousness could take shape.
1272560	1277680	I don't have any argument in principle against that. I'm just saying those contingent facts do
1277680	1283760	not yet exist, and therefore, it is implausible that consciousness exists at the level of collective
1283760	1288960	intelligence. So you talk about consciousness quite a bit, so let's step back and try to sneak up
1289520	1298480	to a definition. What is consciousness? For me, there are two aspects to answering that question.
1298480	1302960	One is, what's the nature of consciousness? How does something like consciousness exist
1302960	1308160	in an otherwise apparently non-conscious universe? And then there's a function question, which is
1308160	1313280	equally important, which is, what does consciousness do? The first one is obviously
1315120	1319360	problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different from
1319360	1324480	the rest of the non-conscious universe. But I put it to you that the function question is also very
1324480	1333920	hard because you are clearly capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without
1333920	1340880	consciousness. You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind and
1340880	1348800	you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring. So why do we have consciousness
1348800	1355040	at all? Now, here's the thing. There's an extra question you need to ask. Should we attempt to
1355040	1360080	answer those questions separately or should we attempt to answer them in an integrated fashion?
1361120	1365440	I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion,
1366560	1372560	what consciousness does and what it is. We should be able to give a unified answer to
1372560	1380400	both of those. Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what
1380400	1389360	it does, both of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action? Can you try to explain the
1389360	1394480	difference that's interesting, that that's useful, that's important to understand? So that's putting
1394480	1399600	me in a bit of a difficult position because I actually argue that trying to answer them separately
1399600	1407840	is ultimately incoherent. But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of
1407840	1412720	these problems is addressed and the other is left unaddressed. So people will try and explain what
1412720	1419040	qualia are, how they potentially emerge without saying, what do they do? What problems do they
1419040	1423840	help to solve? How do they make the organism more adaptive? And then you'll have other people who
1423840	1428800	say, no, no, this is what the function of consciousness is. But I can't tell you, I can't
1428880	1435120	solve the hard problem. I don't know how qualia exist. So what I'm saying is many people treat
1435120	1440880	these problems separately, although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem.
1442000	1449040	So the hard problem is focusing on what it is? Yes. So the qualia, that it feels like something
1449040	1454640	to experience a thing, that's what consciousness is, and does is more about the functional usefulness
1454640	1462960	of the thing. Yes. Yes. To the whole beautiful mix of cognition and just function in everyday life.
1463680	1470560	Okay. You've also said that you can do very intelligent things
1472320	1477200	without consciousness. Yes. Clearly. Is that obvious to you? Yes.
1477440	1486480	Yes. I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory. It just comes up. And it comes up really
1486480	1494960	intelligently. But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with
1494960	1503360	whatever is doing the memory access that's doing the cognition. Oh, I think so. Yes. Yes. So I guess
1503360	1509920	what I'm trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a few times, which is
1509920	1518560	whether we can build machines that are conscious or machines that are intelligent, human level
1518560	1523120	intelligence or beyond without building the consciousness. I mean, ultimately, that's one
1523120	1529360	of the ways to understand what consciousness is, is to is to build the thing. We can either sort of
1529360	1534880	from the Chomsky way, try to construct models like he thinks about language in this way,
1534880	1539120	try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing.
1539840	1546800	Exactly. And that's a methodological principle in cognitive science. In fact, one of the things
1546800	1554400	that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing with the nature of
1554400	1561440	cognition in the mind is that cognitive science takes the design stance. It asks, well, could we
1561440	1568720	build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomena?
1570080	1574320	Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?
1575200	1580080	In terms of how far we are, there's there's on the computational side of things,
1581040	1584560	something called cognitive modeling. There's all these kinds of packages that you can
1585360	1591200	construct simplified models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge.
1592480	1596880	Do you find any efforts in cognitive or what efforts in cognitive science do you find
1597600	1604800	most inspiring and productive? I think the project of trying to create AGI,
1604880	1610880	artificial general intelligence, is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence
1610880	1616640	being of scientific significance. This is independent of technological socioeconomic
1616640	1623680	significance, which is already well, well established. But being able to say because
1623680	1630400	of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence, perhaps consciousness.
1630400	1634800	I think that's where I place my bets is in the current endeavors around
1635520	1641760	artificial general intelligence. And so tackling that problem head on, which has now
1643280	1648320	become central, at least to a group of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done.
1651360	1656000	And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness?
1656800	1662400	Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence.
1663920	1669280	So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver.
1669280	1674080	You can solve a wide variety of problems and a wide variety of domains. And some of our best
1674080	1678320	machines have a little bit of transfer. They can learn this game and play a few other
1678320	1681760	well designed rule bound games, but they couldn't learn how to swim,
1682720	1690960	ride or et cetera, things like that. And so what's interesting is what seems to come up,
1690960	1694960	and this is some of my published work, in all these different domains of cognition
1696000	1703200	across all these different problem types is a central problem. And since we do have good
1703200	1708000	sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability that's a significant component
1708000	1713760	of our intelligence, I made an argument as to what I think that general ability is.
1715280	1722000	And so it's happening right now. The amount of information in this room that you could actually
1722000	1728160	pay attention to is combinatorial explosive. The amount of information you have in your memory,
1728160	1734400	long term memory and all the ways you could combine it, combinatorial explosive. The number
1734400	1739600	of possibilities you can consider also combinatorial explosive. The sequences of behavior you can
1739600	1747280	generate also combinatorial explosive. And yet somehow you're zeroing in. The right memories
1747280	1750960	are coming up. The right possibilities are opening up. The right sequences of behavior,
1750960	1757680	you're paying attention to the right thing, not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably
1757680	1763360	find obvious what you should interact with in order to solve the problem at hand. That's an
1763360	1774640	ability that is still not well understood within AGI. It's a filtering out the gigantic waterfall
1774640	1781600	of data. Right. It's almost like a Zen Cohen. What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore
1782240	1789440	so much information and do it in such a way that it's somewhere between arbitrary guessing
1789520	1797920	and algorithmic search. And to a fault sometimes, of course, that you, based on the models you
1797920	1804560	construct, you forget. You ignore things that you should probably not ignore. And that hopefully we
1804560	1812080	can circle back to it, Lex, is related to the meaning issue because the very processes that
1812080	1818080	make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible to self-deceptive,
1818080	1823920	self-destructive behavior because of the way we miss frame the environment in fundamental ways.
1824720	1828880	So to you, meaning is also
1831680	1839440	connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and understand
1839520	1846080	and interact intellectually with the environment. Yes. So what is wisdom? Why do we long for it?
1846720	1851840	How do we, and where do we find it? What is it? Intelligence is what you use to solve your problems
1851840	1860080	as I was just describing. Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems
1860880	1865280	of self-deception that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems. So it's that matter problem.
1866240	1873600	And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing? I think you have multiple ways of
1873600	1879920	knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities. And so wisdom is to coordinate
1879920	1885600	those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and affording each other. So in
1885600	1894160	that way, wisdom is rationally self-transcending rationality. Right. So life is a kind of process
1894160	1901760	where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up a village of rationalities along
1901760	1907600	the way that then turns into wisdom. Yes, it's properly coordinated. You mentioned framing.
1907600	1915120	Yes. So what is framing? Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in
1916000	1922880	how you see the world, how you reason about the world, how you understand the world?
1923520	1928080	So it depends what you mean by assumptions. If it by assumption you mean a proposition,
1928640	1934560	representational, or rule, I think that's much more downstream from relevance realization.
1934560	1944320	I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention.
1945040	1952960	And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing right now of
1952960	1960720	salience landscaping. What's salient to you? And how is what salient constantly shifting
1960720	1970080	in a sort of a dynamic tapestry? And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salience
1970080	1975760	landscaping is aspectualizing the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?
1975760	1983120	For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of belief we have. And here's why.
1984640	1992560	If we mean by beliefs, you know, representational proposition, then we're in this very problematic
1992560	1998400	position because then we're trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how
1998400	2004720	we do relevance realization. And that's problematic because representations presuppose
2004720	2012720	relevance realization. So I represent this as a cup. The number of properties it actually has
2012720	2018240	and that I even have epistemic access to is combinatorial explosive. I select from those a
2018240	2023840	subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar as they are relevant for me. This doesn't
2023840	2028240	have to be a cup. I could be using it as a hat. I can use it to stand for the letter V.
2029360	2034560	All kinds of different things. I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America.
2036320	2043680	Representations presuppose relevance realization. They are therefore dependent on it,
2043680	2049440	which means relevance realization isn't bound to our representational structures. It can be
2049520	2054400	influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on relevance realization.
2054400	2058960	Let's define stuff. Relevance realization. Yes.
2058960	2062960	What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing? What is it? What are we talking about?
2063840	2070560	What we're talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution.
2071680	2077600	So if you think about that adaptivity isn't in the organism or in the environment,
2077600	2083680	but in a dynamical relation and then what does evolution do? It creates variation and then it
2083680	2088400	puts selective pressure and what that does is that changes the niche constructions that are
2088400	2095040	available to a species. It changes the morphology. You also have a loop. It's your sensory motor loop
2095680	2101760	and what's constantly happening is there are processes within you that are opening up variation
2101760	2106160	and also processes that are putting selection on it and you're constantly evolving that
2106160	2112320	sensory motor loop. So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you're framing
2112320	2117120	the world is constantly evolving and changing. I can give you two clear examples of that.
2117120	2124320	One, your autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic and sympathetic. The sympathetic system is biased
2124960	2131440	to trying to interpret as much of reality as threat or opportunity. The parasympathetic is
2132320	2138560	biased to trying to interpret as much of the environment as safe and relaxing and they are
2138560	2146720	constantly doing opponent processing. There's no little man in you calculating your level of arousal.
2146720	2151760	There's this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is constantly evolving your
2151760	2157680	arousal. Similarly, your attention, you have the default mode network, task network. The default
2157680	2164240	mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind wander, to go off, to drift and then
2164240	2170640	the task focus network is selecting out of those possibilities the ones that will survive and go
2170640	2175920	into and so you're constantly evolving your attention. Okay, so there's a natural selection
2175920	2182240	of ideas that a bunch of systems within you are generating and then you use the natural selection.
2182240	2187600	What is the selector, the object that you're interacting with, the glass? Relevance realization
2188320	2194000	once again, you just describe how it happens. Yes. You can describe what the hell it is.
2194640	2201440	So what are we talking about? So relevance realization is how you interact with things
2201440	2208080	in the world to make sense of why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life.
2208080	2211600	Yes, and notice the language you just used. You're starting to use the meaning in life language.
2212560	2220160	That's good. Okay. That's good. So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?
2222640	2229360	It gives you, and here I'll use the term for Marla Ponty, it gives you an optimal grip on
2229360	2238240	the world. So let's use your visual attention again. Okay, here's an object. How close should I be to
2238240	2246880	it? Is there a right? That's what you want to do with it. Exactly. Exactly. So you have to evolve
2247520	2253200	your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal grip that actually creates the affordance
2253200	2258240	of you getting to a goal that you're trying to get to. Yeah, but you're describing physical goals
2259040	2267040	of manipulating objects. So this applies, the task, the process of relevance realization
2267040	2273840	is not just about getting a glass of water and taking a drink. No. It's about falling in love.
2274720	2282400	Yeah, of course. What else is there? Well, there's obvious between those two options. I can show you
2282400	2289680	how you're optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain. Okay, so a mammal goes by
2289680	2296480	and most people will say there's a dog. Now, why don't they say they might, but typically,
2296960	2301040	probabilistically, they'll say there's a dog. They could say there's a German Shepherd,
2301040	2307120	there's a mammal, there's a living organism, there's a police dog. Why that, why there?
2307120	2312320	Why did they stop Eleanor Rush called these basic level? Well, what you find is that's an
2312320	2317920	optimal grip because it's getting you the best overall balance between similarity within your
2317920	2323920	category and difference between the other categories. It's allowing you to properly fit
2323920	2329600	to that object insofar as you're setting yourself up to, well, I'm getting so, as many of the
2329600	2334400	similarities and differences I can on balance because they're in a trade-off relationship
2334400	2341200	that I need in order to probably interact with this mammal. That's optimal grip, not right?
2341200	2349760	It's at the level of your categorization. You evolve these models of the world around you
2350480	2355120	and on top of them, you do stuff like you build representations, like you said.
2355120	2362080	Yes. What's the salience landscape? Salience meaning attention landscape.
2362800	2370000	So, salience is what grabs your attention or what results from you directing your attention.
2370000	2375600	So, I clap my hands that salient, it grabs your attention, your attention is drawn to it,
2375600	2381200	that's bottom up, but I can also say you left big toe and now it's salient to you because you
2381200	2386800	directed your attention towards it, that's top down. And again, opponent processing going on there.
2386800	2392240	So, whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what arouses you, what triggers at
2392240	2398160	least momentarily some affect towards it, that's how things are salient. What salience, I would
2398160	2404320	argue, is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization makes information relevant to
2405600	2413040	working memory. That's when it now becomes online for direct sensory motor interaction with the
2413040	2419440	world. So, you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious
2419440	2426400	mind? I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively processed,
2426400	2434320	relevance realization such that it passes through sort of this higher filter of working memory and
2434320	2440560	has these properties of being globally accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing
2440560	2445280	we call salience. Look, that's really good evidence, there's really good evidence from my
2445280	2450880	colleague at U of T, University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher, that that's what working memory is. It's
2450880	2456480	a higher order relevance filter. That's why things like chunking will get way more information
2456480	2463360	through working memory because it's basically basically monitoring how much relevance realization
2463360	2469040	has gone into this information. Usually, you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing
2469040	2474160	and that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness? When do you need
2475200	2480960	that working memory and that salience landscaping? It's when you're facing situations that are highly
2480960	2487280	novel, highly complex and very old defined, that require you to engage working memory.
2488240	2494080	Okay, got it. So, relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that basic level
2494080	2499840	thing of a dog. When you see it, when you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German Shepherd,
2499840	2508480	not a mammal, not a biological meat bag, it's a dog. Wisdom. So, what is wisdom?
2508800	2514480	If we return, I think it's part of that, we got to relevance realization.
2515360	2526160	And then wisdom is a accumulation of rationalities. He described the rationality as a kind of
2526960	2531440	starting from intelligence, much of puzzle solving. And then rationality is like the
2531440	2536720	meta problem of puzzle solving. And then what wisdom is the meta-meta problem of puzzle solving?
2536720	2543360	Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have when you're solving your puzzles is that you can
2543920	2547760	often fall into self-deception. You can mis-freind. Self-deception, right.
2547760	2555360	So, whereas knowledge overcomes ignorance, wisdom is about overcoming foolishness. If what we mean
2555360	2560720	by foolishness is self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition
2560720	2569520	of foolishness. And so, what you're doing is you're doing this recursive relevance realization.
2569520	2573920	You're using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence. And then you're using
2573920	2578480	your rationality to improve the use of your rationality. That's that recursive relevance
2578480	2584240	realization I was talking about a few minutes ago. Think about a wise person. They come into highly
2585120	2591440	often messy, ill-defined, complex situations, usually where there's some significant novelty.
2591440	2597360	And what can they do? They can zero in on what really matters, what's relevant, and then they
2597360	2604720	can shape themselves, salience landscaping, to intervene most appropriately to that situation
2604720	2610000	as they have framed it. That's what we mean by a wise person. And that's how it follows out of
2610080	2613520	the model I've been presenting to you. So, when you say self-deception, I mean,
2613520	2618640	part of that implies that it's intentional. Part of the mechanism of cognition,
2619920	2628080	you're modifying what you should know for some purpose. Is that how you see the word self-deception?
2628080	2633840	No, because I belong to a group of people that think the model of self-deception as lying to
2633840	2640560	oneself ultimately makes no sense. Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you
2640560	2645840	don't, and I have to depend on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior.
2646560	2651680	I don't think that's what we do to ourselves. I think, and I'm going to use it in the technical
2651680	2656400	term, and thank you for making space for that earlier on, I think we can bullshit ourselves,
2656400	2658480	which is a very different thing than lying.
2659360	2667040	So, what is bullshit? And how do we bullshit ourselves, technically speaking?
2667040	2670960	Yeah, Frankfurt, and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people's work
2671600	2673520	based on Frankfurt's work. On bullshit.
2673520	2677280	Yeah, classic essay. It's a pretty good title.
2677280	2680400	I think it's one of the best things he wrote. He wrote a lot of good things.
2680400	2687120	The title or the essay? The essay. Title's good too. It's always an icebreaker in certain academic
2687120	2696720	settings. So, let's contrast the bullshit artist from the liar. The liar depends on your commitment
2696720	2704640	to the truth. The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you indifferent to the question of truth
2704640	2711600	and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so that they are catchy to you.
2712560	2720320	So, a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial, a television commercial.
2721200	2727920	You watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of alcohol, and they're
2727920	2732320	gorgeous, and they're laughing, and they're smiling, and they're clear-eyed.
2734080	2738880	You know that's not true, and they know you know it's not true, but here's the point.
2739600	2745760	You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling, and they're happy, and that's salient to
2745760	2751280	you, and that catches your attention. And so, you know, go into a bar. You know that won't happen
2751280	2758560	when you drink this alcohol. You know it, but you buy the product because it was made salient to you.
2759600	2765680	Now, you can't lie to yourself, Lex. Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive
2765680	2772320	salience. So, this is what I can do. I can make something salient by paying attention to it,
2772880	2778400	and then that will tend to draw me back to it again, which, and you see what happens, which
2778400	2783680	means it tends to catch my attention more so that when I go into the store, that bottle of liquor
2783680	2790480	catches my attention, and I buy it. And that's, why is that bullshit?
2791360	2798320	Because what you're doing is being caught up in the salience of things
2798880	2803360	independent from whether or not that salience is tracking reality.
2804320	2810480	Is it independent or is it loosely connected? Because it's not so obvious to me when I see
2810480	2817120	happy people at a bar that I don't in part believe that, well, my experience has been
2817120	2822640	may be different. Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there
2824080	2829200	where it's all happy people dancing. In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas
2829200	2834960	is pretty, lots of happy people. I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation,
2834960	2840240	although I think it's very, the truth-seeking in there. Let's say the intent is at least to try
2840240	2845520	and shut off your truth-seeking. It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent.
2845600	2852240	At times, it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much gibberish and you
2852240	2857360	never let it will motivate your behavior. There's an episode from the classic Simpsons,
2857360	2862080	not the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons, where there's aliens and they're running for
2862720	2866240	office in the United States. Now, I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me,
2867280	2872000	and this speech goes like this. My fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being a
2872000	2878320	baseball, but we must move forward, not backward, upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards
2878320	2886400	freedom, and people go, and there's a rush. There's nothing there, and yet it's great satire
2886400	2891040	because a lot of political speech is exactly like that. There's nothing there.
2894320	2896400	I'm not saying all political speech, I said a lot.
2896880	2900640	No, but there is a fundamental difference between, and it's so hilarious, I remember
2900640	2907520	that episode, there is a fundamental difference between that absurd sort of non-secular speech
2907520	2914880	and political speech because one of the things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.
2915440	2924160	And so, if that requires you talking about alternative facts and weird self-destructive
2924240	2929840	oxymoronic phrases, isn't that approaching pure bullshit?
2931520	2941600	No, I think pure bullshit like the vacuum is very difficult to get to, but I get the point.
2941600	2948640	So, what exactly is truth? Is it possible to know?
2949280	2954480	I think Spinoza is right about truth, that truth is only known by its own standard,
2954480	2958400	which sounds circular. There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly,
2958400	2962880	and I think this is also converges with Plato. These are two huge influences on me.
2964400	2972080	I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we go through some process of self-transcendence,
2972080	2977760	when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and
2977760	2982800	the distortions of the earlier frame. You have this when you have a moment of insight.
2982800	2992960	Insight is you doing, you are realising what is relevant. You go, oh, oh, I thought she was
2992960	3001840	aggressive and angry. She's actually really afraid. I was misframing this. And you change
3001920	3006880	what you find relevant. You have those aha moments. So, do you think it's possible
3008480	3018560	to get a sense of objective reality? So, is it possible to have to get to the ground level of
3018560	3024320	what something that you can call objective truth? Or is it, are we always on shaky ground?
3024320	3033120	I think those moments of transcendence can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere.
3035040	3040160	So, this is Drew Highland's notion of finite transcendence. We are capable of self-transcendence,
3040720	3045840	and therefore we are creatures who can actually raise the question of truth or goodness or beauty,
3045840	3051840	because I think they all share this feature. But that doesn't mean we can transcend to a
3051840	3058000	godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere that takes in all information
3058800	3064640	and organizes it in a comprehensive whole. But that doesn't mean that truth is thereby
3064640	3078400	rendered valueless. I think a better term is real. And real and illusory are comparative terms.
3078400	3084960	You only know that something's an illusion by taking something else to be real. And so,
3084960	3090800	we're always in a comparative task. But that doesn't mean that we can somehow jump outside
3091440	3098960	of our framing in some final manner and say, this is how it is from a god's eye point of view.
3098960	3105840	So, what do you think, if I may ask, of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism?
3106800	3111200	So, where the core principle is that reality exists independently of consciousness and that
3111840	3117440	human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception. So, you do have that
3117440	3123680	ability to know reality. There's two things. Knowing that there's an independent reality
3123680	3128400	is not knowing that independent reality. Those are not the same thing.
3128400	3135680	Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is able to have contact
3135680	3144240	with that. Then I would respond and say, I believe, in fact, ultimately, in a conformity
3144240	3152640	theory of knowing that the deepest kind of knowing is when there's a contact, a conformity
3152640	3159520	between the mind, with the embodied mind and reality. And here's where I guess I'd push back
3160240	3166800	on Rand. I would say, you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge,
3166800	3169760	because if you don't, you're going to fall prey to Mino's paradox.
3170480	3178640	Mino's paradox is, you know, this is in Plato, right? To know P. Well, if I don't know P,
3178640	3183360	I'm going to go looking for it. But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I
3183360	3188080	found it? I have no way of recognizing it. I have no way of knowing that I found it.
3188960	3194240	So I must know P. But if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it. I don't need to go searching.
3195920	3201760	So learning doesn't exist. Knowledge is impossible. The way you break out of that paradox is saying,
3201760	3207680	no, no, no, it is partial. It is possible to partially know something. I can know it enough
3208400	3213280	that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that's not the same as having a complete grasp of it,
3213280	3217600	because I still have to search and find what I don't yet possess in my knowledge.
3220480	3225200	Partial knowledge has to be real knowledge. Right. Partial knowledge is still knowledge.
3225200	3232000	Yes. What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman, who thinks the reality is an illusion,
3232640	3239760	so complete illusion, that we're given this actually really nice definition or idea that
3239760	3244400	you talked about, that there's a tension between the illusory and the, and what is real.
3245280	3253360	He says that basically we taken that and we ran with the real to the point where the real is
3254320	3257760	not at all connected to some kind of physical reality.
3258480	3261360	Well, I hope to talk to him at some point. We were supposed to talk at one point,
3261360	3268560	and so I have to talk in his absence. I think that, first of all, I think
3268560	3272560	saying that everything in his illusion is saying everything is tall. It doesn't make any sense.
3272560	3280880	It's a comparative term. You have to say, against this standard of realness, this is an illusion.
3284720	3291280	He uses arguments from evolution, which are problematic to me, because it's like, well,
3292240	3302480	you seem to be saying that evolution is true, that it really exists, and then some of our
3302480	3309200	cognition and a perception has access to reality, math, and presumably some science has access to
3309200	3318080	reality. Then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory,
3318080	3325200	but we do have some contact with reality whereby we can make the arguments as to why most of your
3325200	3330960	experience, most of your everyday experience is an illusion. To me, that's not a novel thing.
3332000	3336640	That's Descartes. That's the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy,
3336640	3341920	but the math is what connects us to reality. That's how he interpreted the Copernican revolution.
3341920	3346480	Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over and set, and it's all an illusion,
3346480	3352800	but the math, the math gets us to the reality. Well, I think he makes a deeper point that most
3352800	3360480	of cognition is just evolved and operates in the illusory world. How does he know that things
3360480	3367200	like cognition and evolution exist? I think there's an important distinction between evolution
3367760	3373520	and cognition. That's not the point I'm making. I'm making a point that he's claiming that there
3373520	3383120	are two things that really exist. Why are they privileged? He basically says that, look, the
3383120	3389360	process of evolution makes sense. Yes. It makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple
3389360	3394560	organisms through the natural selection process. Here's how you get to transfer information from
3394560	3402560	generation to generation. It makes sense. Then he says that there's no requirement for the cognition
3402560	3408960	to evolve in a way that it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the physical reality.
3409520	3414240	Accept that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of evolution,
3414240	3420320	and you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing. Evolution depends on Darwinian theory,
3420320	3425120	genetics. It depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes.
3425120	3430160	It depends on how chromosomes are structured. Actually, that's an interesting question to him
3430880	3437520	where I don't know if he actually would push back on this, is how do you know evolution is real?
3437520	3445600	Yes. I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we constructed,
3445600	3453600	that in some sense it is connected to reality, but we don't have a clear picture of it.
3454480	3463520	That's an intellectually honest statement then. If most of our cognition as thinking beings is
3463520	3471840	operating at every level in an illusory world, then it makes sense that one of the main theories
3471840	3478240	of science that's evolution is also a complete part of this illusory world.
3478240	3483360	Right. But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion
3483360	3488160	that cognition is illusory? I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an
3488160	3495600	explanation of why the world is of our cognition operating in an illusory world, but that's just
3495600	3502160	one of the explanations. I think the deeper question is why do we think we have contact with
3502160	3511440	reality, with physical reality? We could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by
3512400	3518320	our minds in a way that makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it's somebody
3518320	3524720	playing a video game or we're trying to, through the process of distributed cognition, construct
3525920	3531440	more and more complex objects. Why does it have to be connected to
3533040	3538320	physics and planets and all that kind of stuff? If we're going to say we're now
3538320	3542560	considering it as a possibility rather than it's a conclusion based on arguments,
3542560	3547840	because the arguments, again, will always rely on stipulating that there is something that is known.
3548480	3553600	These are the features of cognition. Cognition is capable of illusion. That's a true statement.
3553600	3558000	You're somehow in contact with the mind. Why does the mind have this privileged contact
3558000	3564240	and other aspects like my body do not? Let's put that aside and now let's just consider it.
3565200	3570400	Now, when we put it that way, it's not an epistemic question anymore. It's an existential question,
3570400	3577680	and here's my reply to you. There's two possibilities. Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover,
3578320	3585360	sort of the matrix on steroids or something. There's no way, no matter what I do, I can't find out
3585360	3592160	that it's an illusion. Or it's an illusion, but I can find out that it's an illusion.
3594560	3599040	Those are the two possibilities. Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities,
3599040	3605360	because if I could not possibly find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention
3605360	3613040	to that possibility. I should keep doing the science as I'm doing it. If there's a way of
3613040	3620240	finding out, science is my best bet, I believe, for finding out what's true and what's an illusion.
3620240	3623920	So I keep doing what I'm doing. So it's an argument, if you move it to that,
3623920	3631200	that makes no existential difference to me. Oh, man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument.
3631200	3640160	No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody's saying science doesn't work. It's an interesting question,
3640160	3646000	just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a question, can we build a machine
3646000	3651120	that makes us fly? In that same way, we're asking a question to which we don't know an answer,
3651120	3658960	but we may know in the future how much of this whole thing is an illusion. And I think in a
3658960	3663760	second category, the first guy, I forgot which one, yes, science will be able to help us discover
3663760	3670000	this. Otherwise, yes, for sure, it doesn't matter. If we're living in a simulation and we can't find
3670000	3675440	out at all, then it doesn't matter. But yes, the whole point is, as we get deeper and deeper
3675440	3683440	understanding of our mind of cognition, we might be able to discover like how much of this is a
3683440	3689280	big charade constructed by our mind to keep us fed or something like that. Some weird,
3690720	3695360	some weird, very simplistic explanation that will ultimately in its simplicity be beautiful.
3696640	3704640	Or as we try to build robots and instill them, instill them with consciousness,
3704640	3714560	with ability to feel those kinds of things. We'll discover, well, let's just trick them
3714560	3719520	into thinking they feel and have consciousness and they'll believe it. And then they'll have a
3719520	3724480	deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives. And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way
3724480	3728800	they'll make our lives more meaningful. And then all of a sudden, it's like at the end of Animal
3728800	3734080	Farm, you look at pigs and humans, you look at robots and humans, you can't tell the difference
3734080	3740800	between either. And we in that way start to understand that that so much of this existence
3740800	3747200	could be an illusion. Okay, well, I have two responses to that. First is the progress that's
3747200	3758560	being made on like AGI is about making whatever the system is that's going to be the source of
3758560	3765760	intelligent, more and more dynamically and recursively self-correcting. That's part of what's
3765760	3772320	happening. Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and better at self-correcting,
3772320	3776560	but that's exactly what I was describing before as the transformative theory of truth.
3779440	3787280	The other response to that is science, like people think of science just as, right,
3787360	3791520	sort of end proposition. Let me just use the evolutionary example again.
3795600	3800480	If I'm gathering the evidence, I need to know a lot of geology. I need to know plate tectonics.
3800480	3805680	I need to know about radioactive decay. I need to know about genetics. And then in order to
3805680	3810240	measure all those things, I need to know how microscopes work. I need to know how pencils
3810240	3817200	and paper work. I need to know how rulers work. I need to know how English, like you can't isolate
3817280	3822800	knowledge that way. And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion, then you're in a weird position
3822800	3830400	of saying somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim. I think it goes in reverse.
3830400	3835920	If you think this is the truth claim, right, the measuring and all the things that scientists
3835920	3841840	would do to gather on all the ways the theories are converging together, that also has to be
3841840	3847600	fundamentally right. Because it's not like Lego. It is an interwoven whole.
3848160	3853040	Yes, it definitely is interwoven. But I love how I play that. I'm playing the devil advocate for
3853040	3860800	the illusion world. But there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply consistent
3860800	3868240	across an entire system. But inside a video game, that's some kind of consistency evolves.
3868240	3873920	There's rules about interactions. There's game theoretic patterns about what's good and bad and
3873920	3880160	so on. And there's sources of joy and fear and anger and then understanding about a world,
3880160	3884800	what happens in different dynamics of a video game, even simple video games. So there's no,
3885520	3892640	you know, even inside an illusion, you can have consistency and develop truths inside
3892640	3899440	that illusion and iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion.
3899440	3904720	Okay, but that comes back. Is that process genuinely self-correcting or are you in the
3904720	3910880	simulation in which there is no possible doorway out? Because if my argument is, if you find one
3910880	3916480	or two doorways, that feeds back. In fact, you can't just say, this is the little tiny island
3916480	3918720	where we have the truth. That's the point I'm making.
3918720	3925440	Right. But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that's the case. And what if you
3925440	3931600	find a doorway and you step out, but you're yet in another simulation. I mean, that's the point.
3931600	3938720	That's so self-correcting. When you fix the self-deception, you don't know if there's other
3939360	3943920	bigger self-deceptions you're operating on. Of course, in one sense, that's right. But again,
3943920	3949920	we're back to, when I step into the second simulation, is it, can I get the doorway out of
3949920	3954960	that or right? Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you've basically said,
3954960	3959040	I have a simulation that I can never get out of. Yeah, I think there's always a bigger pile
3959040	3969200	of bullshit is the claim I'm trying to make here. Okay. Let me dance around meaning once more.
3969520	3976720	I often ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I talk to in a room when
3976720	3984720	I'm all by myself, the question of the meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful question?
3984720	3990960	You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful
3990960	3995840	question? No, I think it's like the question, what's north of the North Pole or what time is it on
3995840	4000560	the sun? It sounds like a question, but it's actually not really a question because it has a
4000560	4007520	presupposition in it that I think is fundamentally flawed. If I understand what people mean by it,
4007520	4011680	and it's actually often not that clear, but when they talk about the meaning of life,
4011680	4018480	they are talking about there are some feature of the universe in and of itself that I have to
4018480	4024560	discover and enter into a relationship with. And there's, in that sense, a plan for me or
4024560	4030480	something. And so that's a property of the universe. That's a very deep,
4032160	4036800	serious metaphysical ontological claim. You're claiming to know something fundamental
4036800	4041440	about the structure of reality. There were times when people thought they had a worldview that
4041440	4046400	legitimated it, like God is running the universe and therefore, and God cares about you and there's
4046400	4053360	a plan, et cetera. But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not,
4055680	4059200	meaning is like the graspability. I remember I talked about optimal grip. It's like the
4059200	4066880	graspability of that cup. Is that in me? No. Is it in the cup? No, because the fly can't grasp it.
4068560	4074240	Well, graspability is in my hand. Well, I can't grasp Africa. No, no. There is a real relation
4075200	4080240	fittedness between me and this cup. Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism.
4080240	4084640	Is the adaptivity of a great white shark in the great white shark? Drop it in the sohara, dies.
4086800	4095280	Meaning isn't in me. I think that's romantic bullshit. And it isn't in the universe. It is
4095280	4100800	a proper relationship. I've coined the phrase transjective. It is the binding relationship
4100880	4107120	between this objective and the objective. And therefore, when you're asking the question
4107120	4113680	about the meaning of life, you are, I think, misrepresenting the nature of meaning. Just
4113680	4119520	like when you ask what time is it on the sun, you're misrepresenting how we derive clock time.
4120560	4125200	At the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis,
4125200	4130400	let me hard disagree. But I think we'll probably agree. But it's just like a dance,
4130400	4138720	like any dialogue. I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and
4138720	4151600	the glass of water, between whatever the forces of the universe that created the planets, the proteins,
4152560	4161760	the multicell organisms, the intelligent early humans, the beautiful human civilizations and
4161760	4173680	the technologies that will overtake them. It's trying to understand the relevance realization
4175040	4180480	of the big bang to the feeling of love you have for another human being.
4181840	4187440	It's reaching for that even though it's hopeless to understand. It's the question,
4187440	4196000	the asking of the question is the reaching. Now, it is, in fact, romantic bullshit, technically
4196000	4207840	speaking. But it could be that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life and the source of
4207840	4215440	its deepest meaning. Well, I hope not. But technically speaking, romantic bullshit, meaning
4216320	4224640	romantic. In the philosophical sense, yes. So I mean, what is poetry? What is music? What is the
4224640	4229760	magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music? What is that? Oh, but that's exactly to my
4229760	4237040	point. Is music inside you? Or is it outside you? It's both and neither. And that's precisely why
4237040	4242080	you find it so meaningful. In fact, it can be so meaningful, you can regard it as sacred.
4243280	4247760	What you said, I don't think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement,
4247760	4254560	right? What you said is, no, no, no, there is a way in which reality is realizing itself.
4255760	4264400	And I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship that, the sort of
4264400	4270000	meta-optimal grip to what is most real. I totally agree. I totally think that's one of the things
4270000	4275360	I said this earlier. One of our meta-desires is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.
4276880	4282160	I do this with my students. I'll say, you know, because romantic relationships sort of take the
4282160	4286320	role of God and religion and history and culture for us right now. We put everything on them,
4286320	4293200	and that's why they break. But, right? Strong words. Got it. But I'll say to them,
4293200	4297200	okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic relationships? Put up your hands. Then
4297200	4302160	I'll say, okay, I'm not only talking to these people. Of those people, how many of you would
4302160	4306080	want to know your partner's cheating on you even if it means the destruction of the relationship?
4306080	4313120	95% of them put up their hands. And I say, but why? And here's my students who are usually all
4313120	4317680	sort of bitten with cynicism and postmodernism, and they'll just say spontaneously, well,
4317680	4325920	because it's not real. Because it's not real. Right? So I think what you're pointing to is actually
4328160	4335200	you're pointing not to an objective or a subjective thing. Romanticism says it's subjective.
4335200	4339920	There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean empiricism says it's objective,
4339920	4344560	but you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality realization. And can I get relevance realization
4344560	4350640	to be optimally gripping in the best right relationship with it? And there's good reason
4350640	4356080	you can because think about it. Your relevance realization isn't just representing properties
4356080	4360880	of the world. It's instantiating it. There's something very similar to biological evolution,
4360880	4365840	which is that the guts of life, if I'm right, running your cognition is not just that you
4366800	4372480	have ideas, you actually instantiate. That's what I mean by conformity. The same principles,
4372480	4376400	they're within and without. They don't belong to you subjectively. They're not just out there.
4376400	4382240	They're both at the same time. And they help to explain how you're actually bound to the
4382240	4388400	evolutionary world. Yeah, so it comes from both inside and from the outside. But that's still
4388400	4395600	the question of the meaning of life. First of all, the big benefit of that question is that it shakes
4395600	4403360	you out of your hamster in a wheel that is daily life, the mundane process of daily life,
4403360	4407920	where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids, you have to take them to school,
4407920	4412400	then you go to work and repeats over and over and over and over, and then you get
4413120	4416480	increased salary, and then you upgrade the home and that whole process.
4417360	4425360	Meaning, asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit
4426640	4430960	that if you take it, if you just allow yourself to take it seriously for a second,
4431920	4439360	it forces you to pause and think, like, what's going on here? And then it ultimately,
4439360	4444560	I think, does return to the question of meaning in those mundane things. What gives
4445200	4453760	what gives my life joy? What gives it lasting deliciousness? Where do I notice the magic and
4453760	4460000	how can I have that magic return again and again? Beauty. And that ultimately what it returns to.
4460000	4464480	But it's the same thing you do when you look up to the sky. You spend most of your day hurrying
4464480	4469040	around looking at things on the surface. But when you look up to the sky and you see the stars,
4469920	4477120	it fills you with the feeling of awe that forces you to pause and think in full context of, like,
4477760	4482880	what the hell is going on here? That, but also I think there is a,
4486000	4492960	when you think too much about the meaning of a glass and a relevance realization of a glass,
4493520	4497440	you don't necessarily get at the core of what makes music beautiful.
4498560	4503680	So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first. And I think meaning of life forces
4503680	4511120	you to really go to the big bang and go, go, go to the, go to the universe and the whole thing,
4511120	4517520	the origin of life. And I think sometimes you have to start there to discover the meaning in
4517600	4522960	the day to day, I think. But perhaps you would disagree.
4524400	4531760	Insofar as the question makes you ask about the, the, the whole of your life and how much
4531760	4538400	meaning is in the whole of your life. And insofar as it asks how much that is connected to reality,
4538400	4545360	it's a good question. But it's a bad question in that it also makes you look for the answers
4545360	4551200	in the wrong way. Now you said, and I agree with what you said, what, how we really answer
4551200	4555760	this question is we come back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning in life
4555760	4564560	is connected to reality. We pursue wisdom. And so for me, the, I don't need that question in
4564560	4571120	order to provoke me into that stance. So let's return to the meaning crisis. Yes.
4571520	4578480	What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times? What's its origin? What's the
4578480	4583360	explanation? Well, remember what I said, what I argued that the very processes that make us
4583360	4588560	adaptively intelligent subject us to perennial problems of self deception, self destruction,
4588560	4593360	creating bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that. And that can cause all,
4593680	4603360	you know, anxiety, existential anxiety. It can cause despair. It can cause a sense of absurdity.
4604960	4611760	These are perennial problems. And across cultures and across historical periods,
4612880	4616560	human beings have come up with ecologies of practices. There's no one practice. There's
4616560	4621520	no panacea practice. They've come up with ecologies of practices for ameliorating
4621520	4627360	that self deception and enhancing that fittedness, that connectedness that's at the core of meaning
4627360	4637040	in life. That's prototypically what we call wisdom. And here's how I can show you one clear instance
4637040	4645280	of the meaning crisis is it's a wisdom famine. I can, I do this regularly with my students
4646560	4649680	in the classroom. I'll say, where do you go for information? They hold up their phone.
4651520	4654640	Where do you go for knowledge? They're a little bit slower and probably because they're in my
4654640	4659040	class, they'll say, well, science, the university. I'll say, where do you go for wisdom?
4662000	4668960	There's a silence. Wisdom isn't optional. That's why it is perennial, cross-cultural,
4668960	4676560	cross-historical, because of the perennial problems. But we do not have homes for ecologies of
4676560	4681840	practices that fit into our scientific technological worldview so that they are
4681840	4686960	considered legitimate. The fastest growing demographic group are the nuns, NONESs. They
4686960	4694000	have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic. They most frequently describe
4694000	4699680	themselves with this very, this has become almost everybody now describe, I'm spiritual,
4699680	4706960	but not religious, which means they are trying to find a way of reducing the bullshit
4706960	4712880	and enhancing the connectedness, but they don't want to turn to any of the legacy established
4712880	4723920	religions by and large. Well, isn't both religion and the nuns, isn't wisdom a process, not a
4723920	4731120	destination? So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful religious person, you're also
4731120	4739440	trying to find. So just because you have a place where you're looking or a set of traditions around
4739440	4746880	which you're constructing the search, it's nevertheless a search. So I guess, is there a
4746880	4753360	case to be made that this is just the usual human condition? How do you answer? If you asked
4754080	4760000	five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom? I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to
4760000	4767840	answer while the Bible or a religious text. Right. And they had a worldview that was considered
4767840	4774160	not just religious, but also rational. So we now have these two things,
4774480	4780480	orthogonal or often oppositional, spirituality and rationality. But if you go before a particular
4780480	4784560	historical period, you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition, like before the
4784560	4789920	the scientific revolution, those two are not in opposition. They are deeply interwoven
4790480	4797680	so that you can have a sense of legitimacy and deep realness and grounding in your practices.
4798480	4803360	We don't have that anymore. And I'm not advocating for religion. Neither am I an enemy of religion.
4804320	4811840	I'll strengthen your case, by the way. So one of my RAs did research and you get people who are,
4811840	4817120	have committed themselves to cultivating wisdom and you can look at people within religious
4817120	4822960	traditions and people who are doing it in a purely secular framework. By many of the measures we
4822960	4829920	used to try to study wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious paths do better
4830560	4836560	than the secular. But here's the important point. There's no significant difference between
4836560	4842080	the religious paths. So it's not like if you're, you know, following the path of Judaism, you're
4842080	4846640	more likely to end up wiser than if you follow Buddhism. By the way, I don't know if that's
4846640	4850880	my case. I was making the case that you don't need to have a religious affiliation to search for
4850880	4857920	wisdom. It's that I thought along to the point you just made that it doesn't matter which religious
4857920	4863440	affiliation or none. But that's what I'm saying. Okay, so this is the tricky thing we're in.
4863440	4869520	Yeah. It does matter if you're in one, but it doesn't matter sort of the propositional creeds
4869520	4874080	of that. There's something else at work. There's a, if you allow me this, there's a
4874080	4880640	functionality to religion that we lost when we rejected all the propositional dogma. But there's
4880640	4886080	a functionality there that we don't know how to recreate. Yeah, what is that? Can you try to
4886080	4892080	speak to that? What is that functionality? What is that? Why is that so useful? A bunch of stories,
4892080	4900240	a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are drenched in like deep lessons about morality and
4900240	4904960	all those kinds of things. What is the, what's the, what's the functional thing there that can't be
4904960	4911920	replaced without a religious text by non religious text? This is for me the golden question. So thank
4911920	4919360	you. Do you have an answer? Yeah, I have, I think I have a significant answer. I don't think it's
4919360	4927200	complete, but I think it's important. And this is to step before the Cartesian revolution and
4928080	4933280	think about many different kinds of knowing. And this is now something that is prominent within
4933280	4937600	what's called 4e cognitive science, the kind of cognitive science I practice. And there's a lot
4937680	4943280	of converging evidence for, okay, these different ways of knowing. There's propositional knowing.
4943280	4948640	This is what we are most familiar with. In fact, it's almost, it's almost has a tyrannical status,
4948640	4953760	right? So this is knowing that something is the case, like the cats or mammals and it's stored
4953760	4959200	in semantic memory. And we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction, right?
4960240	4963440	There's procedural knowing. This is knowing how to do something.
4964400	4970960	This is, skills are not theories. They're not beliefs. They're not true or false. They engage
4970960	4976640	the world or they don't. And they are stored in a different kind of memory, procedural memory.
4978000	4983040	Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory. That's why, you know, you
4983040	4987600	have the prototypical story of somebody suffering Alzheimer's and they're losing all kinds of facts,
4987600	4992640	but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly. Same kind of argument.
4992640	4998880	There's perspectival knowing. This is knowing what it's like to be you here now in this situation,
4998880	5003600	in this state of mind, the whole field of your salience landscaping, what it's like to be you
5003600	5010000	here now. And you have a specific kind of memory around that episodic memory. And you have a different
5010000	5016800	sense, you have a different criterion of realness. So you can, you can get this by, well, my friend
5016800	5021280	Dan Chiapia and I, we studied the, the scientists using moving the rovers around, or you can take
5021280	5026720	a look at people who are doing VR. People talk about, you know, they want, they want to really
5026720	5033440	be in the game. That makes it real. They don't mean verisimilitude. You can get that, right?
5033440	5038320	Sense of being in the game with something like Tetris, which has, isn't like, it doesn't look
5038320	5044400	like the real world. And you can fail to have it in a video game that is, has a lot of verisimilitude.
5044400	5049200	It's something else. It's about, again, this, this kind of connectedness that we're talking about.
5049200	5053280	If I may interrupt, is that connected to the heart problem of consciousness,
5053280	5058160	the subject, the qualia, or is that a different, that kind of knowing is that different from the
5058160	5061760	qualia of consciousness? I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the
5061760	5066080	adjuctival and the adverbial qualia. So I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia much more
5066080	5071440	with the, than with the adjuctival. So the adjuctival qualia are like the greenness of green and
5071520	5080080	the loonness of bloom. The adverbial qualia are the hereness, the nowness, the togetherness.
5081280	5084720	And I think the perspective of knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.
5085280	5090400	Adjuctival qualia and adverbial qualia. I'm learning so many new things today.
5090400	5095600	Okay. So that's another way of knowing. Right. The perspective. And then there's a deeper one.
5096320	5100480	And this is a philosophical point. I don't want to, we can go through the argument.
5101200	5105360	But you don't have to know that you know in order to know, because if you start doing that,
5105360	5108880	you get an infinite regress. There has to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean you know that you
5108880	5117440	know that. Yeah. Okay. Of course. Okay. Great. Okay. Good. Well, there was a lot of ink spilled
5117440	5122160	over that over a 40-year period. So by philosophers, they spilled, this is what they do. They spill
5122160	5129120	ink. Yeah. But I want to talk about. I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing.
5129200	5136400	This is the idea that you and the world are co-participating in things and such that real
5136400	5142880	affordances exist between you. So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity. So the
5142880	5150240	affordance of walking becomes available to me. Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped
5150240	5158240	by my biology. And so affordances for that are here. Look at this cup. Shared physics.
5159200	5165840	Shared sort of biological factors. Look at my hand. I'm bipedal. Yeah. Also, culture is shaping
5165840	5172480	me and shaping this. I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup. So this is an agent
5172480	5179840	arena relationship, right? There's identities being created in your agency. Identities being
5179840	5186160	created in the world as an arena. So you and the world fit together. You know when that's missing
5186240	5192160	when you're really lonely or you're homesick or you're suffering culture shock. So this is
5192160	5197200	participatory knowing and it's the sense of, it comes with a sense of belonging.
5198640	5206320	At every level. So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing. Yes. Yes. Yes. That there's a dance
5206320	5213440	between the physics that enables this process and just participating in the process is the
5213440	5218640	act of knowing. Right. And there's a really weird form of memory you have for this kind
5218640	5227520	of knowing. It's called yourself. What? Can you elaborate? So we talked about how all the
5227520	5232160	different other kinds of knowing had specific kinds of memory, semantic memory for propositional
5232160	5239920	procedural, right? Episodic for perspectival. What's the kind of memory that is the coordinated
5239920	5245040	storehouse of all of your agent arena relationships, all the roles you can take,
5245040	5249600	all the identities you can assume, all the identities you can assign. What's the self?
5249600	5255920	Do you mean like consciousness or like? No, I mean your sense of self. Sense of self in this world
5255920	5263120	that's not consciousness. That's like an agency or something. Right. It's an agent arena relationship.
5263120	5267760	And so in an agent arena relationship, it's the sense of the agent.
5269120	5274720	And that the agent belongs in that arena. Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is,
5274720	5281600	because it's probably a bunch of different framings of how you experience that.
5281600	5287680	Yeah. And you do. Within your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles
5287680	5292160	that are somehow contributing to that identity, but are not equivalent to that identity.
5292960	5296320	Yeah. I wonder if like my two hands have different,
5298480	5301680	because there's a different experience of me picking up something with my right hand
5302240	5309920	and then my left hand. So are those like? That's a really cool question, Lex.
5309920	5312320	Are they certainly feel like their own things?
5314400	5319360	And that could be just anthropomorphization based on cultural narratives and so on.
5319920	5323200	It could, but I think it's a legitimate empirical question, because it also could be
5323200	5327920	sort of Ian McGilchrist stuff. It could be you're using different hemispheres
5327920	5331840	and they sort of have different agent arena relationships to the environment.
5331840	5336480	This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self. Does that hemispheric
5336480	5340080	difference mean you're multiple or you actually have a singular self?
5340080	5343760	Oh, so it's important to understand how many cells are there.
5343760	5345120	Yes, I think so.
5345120	5351840	But that's just like a quirk of evolution. It surely can't be fundamental to cognition,
5351840	5353760	having multiple cells or a singular self.
5354400	5362800	It depends, again, because we're getting far from the answer to the question you originally asked
5362800	5365040	me. Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one?
5365040	5366800	Which question? I already forgot everything.
5366800	5368640	What's the functionality of religion?
5368640	5371120	Yes, let us return.
5371120	5377040	Okay, and then we can return to the self. Okay, so you said you have all these propositions
5377040	5380240	and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ from the religions and they're not,
5380880	5384160	they don't seem to be considered legitimate by many people.
5386240	5390160	But yet there's something functioning in the religions that is transforming people
5391120	5396640	and making them wiser. I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring at
5396640	5403840	those non-propositional levels, the procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory.
5403840	5408480	And those are the ones, by the way, that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making,
5408480	5412640	because remember, the propositions are representational and they're dependent on the
5412640	5417600	non-propositional, non-representational processes of connectedness and relevance
5417600	5422160	realization. So religion goes down deep to the non-propositional and works there.
5422160	5424000	That's the functionality we need to grasp.
5424560	5431040	Well, you talk about tools, essentially, that humans are able to incorporate into their cognition.
5431040	5433600	Psycho technologies, like language is one, I suppose.
5436640	5439680	Isn't religion then a psychotechnology?
5439680	5443280	It would be a, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies, yes.
5443280	5448160	And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead.
5449120	5455120	Do we have to invent the new thing? Go from the old phone, create the iPhone,
5455120	5458880	invent the new psychotechnology. It takes place of religion.
5458880	5464480	And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text goes into the marketplace, who's he talking to?
5464480	5468960	He's not talking to the believers. He's talking to the atheists. And he says,
5468960	5474880	do you not realize what we have done? We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.
5474880	5479920	We are now forever falling. We are unchained from the sun. We have to become worthy of this.
5480560	5483280	Yeah. Well, Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit.
5483280	5488800	No, no, no. But there's a point there. The point is, right, there's one thing to
5488800	5496400	rejecting the proposition. There's another project of replacing the functionality that we lost
5496400	5497760	when we reject the religion.
5497760	5505200	So his worry that as nihilism takes hold, you don't ever replace the thing that religion,
5507200	5509280	the role that religion played in our world.
5509280	5515840	Maybe it's hard to tell what he actually, because he's so multi-vocal. I'll speak for me,
5515840	5523520	rather than for Nietzsche. I think it is possible to using the best cognitive science and respectfully
5523520	5530000	exapting what we can from the best religion and philosophical traditions, because there's
5530000	5534720	things like stoicism that are in the gray line between philosophy and religion. Buddhism is the
5534720	5544320	same. Doing that best cocci, that best exaptation, we can come up with that functionality without
5544320	5551600	having to buy into the particular propositional sets of the legacy religions. That's my proposal.
5551600	5556640	I call that the religion that's not a religion. So things like stoicism or modern stoicism,
5556640	5564960	those things, don't you think in some sense they naturally emerge? Don't you think there's a longing
5564960	5572240	for meaning? So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a significant
5572240	5579120	meaning crisis in the ancient world because of what had happened after the breakup of Alexander
5579120	5586880	the Great's empire. So if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after Alexander, so
5586880	5592960	Aristotle grows up in a place where everybody speaks the same language, has the same religion,
5592960	5599040	his ancestors have been there for years, he knows everybody. After Alexander the Great's empire is
5599040	5605040	broken up, people are now thousands of miles away from the government. They're surrounded by people
5605040	5610080	because of the dysporas, the diasporas I should say. They're surrounded by people that don't speak
5610080	5614240	their language, don't share their religion. That's why you get all these mother religions emerging,
5614880	5621520	universal mother religions like ISIS, etc. So there is what's called domicite. There's the
5621520	5627040	killing of home. There's a loss of a sense of home and belonging and fittedness during the
5627040	5634240	Hellenistic period and stoicism arose specifically to address that. And because it was designed to
5634240	5639840	address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence that it is coming back into prominence right now.
5640480	5647040	Well, there could be a lot of other variations and it feels like I think when you speak of the
5647040	5653920	meaning crisis, you're in part describing, not prescribing, you're describing something that
5653920	5662480	is happening. But I would venture to say that if we just leave things be, the meaning crisis
5662480	5670480	dissipates because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas of this distributed
5670480	5676400	cognition process that give us meaning. So if religion loses power, we'll find other
5677760	5683360	institutions that are sources of meaning. Is that your intuition as well?
5684240	5692080	I think we are already doing that. I am involved with and do participant observation
5692640	5697600	of many of these emerging communities that are creating ecologies of practice that are
5697600	5704480	specifically about trying to address the meaning crisis. I just, in late July, I went to Washington
5704480	5710560	State and did Rafe Kelly's Evolve Move Play return to the source and wow, one of the most
5710560	5714480	challenging things I've ever done. That guy is awesome, by the way. I've gotten to interact with
5714480	5720000	him a long, long time ago. He said to say hi to you, by the way. Yeah, it's from another world.
5720000	5727360	I feel like a different world because I interacted with him, not directly. This is somebody,
5727360	5735360	maybe you can speak to what he works on, but he makes movement and play. He encourages people to
5735360	5740400	make that a part of their life. How you move about the world, whether that's as part of
5740400	5748960	sort of athletic endeavors or actually just walking around a city. I think the reason I ran
5748960	5754080	into him is because there was a lot of interest in that, in the athletic world, in the grappling
5754080	5758400	world, in the Brazilian jiu-jitsu world, people who study movement, who make movement part of
5758400	5766560	their lives to see how can we do great play and fun and just the basic humanness that's natural
5767520	5774560	to our movement. How do we integrate that into our daily practice? This is yet another way to find
5774560	5779440	meaning. I think it's actually an exemplar of what I was talking about because what's going on
5779440	5788480	with Rafe's integration of parkour in nature and martial arts and mindfulness practices
5788480	5796000	and dialogical practices is exactly and explicitly so, by the way. He will tell you he's been very
5796000	5802240	influenced by my work. He's trying to get at the non-propositional kinds of knowing that make meaning
5802240	5807920	by evolving our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance realization because that gives people
5807920	5814400	profound, improved sense of connectedness to themselves, to each other and the world. I'll
5814400	5821200	tell you, Lex, I don't want to say too specifically the final thing that people did because it's part
5821200	5827840	of his secret sauce. What I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said,
5827840	5833120	as far as I can tell, none of you are religious, right? And they go, yeah, yeah. But what you just
5833120	5840240	did was a religious act, wasn't it? And they all went, yeah, it was. Yeah. So that same magic was
5840240	5853360	there. Yes. Bathroom break? Sure. What's your take on atheism in general? Is it closer to truth
5853440	5858640	than maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a person who believes in God?
5859840	5865440	So I'm a non-theist, which means I think the shared set of presuppositions between the
5865440	5868560	theist and the atheist are actually what needs to be rejected.
5870720	5877600	Can you explain that further? Yes, I can. And I want to point out, by the way, that there
5878560	5887520	are lots of non-theistic religious traditions. So I'm not coming up with a sort of airy fairy
5887520	5893840	category. Yeah. And what's the difference in non-theism, agnosticism, and atheism?
5893840	5901760	So non-theists think that the theist and the atheist share a bunch of presuppositions. For
5901760	5911440	example, it's that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a personal being that is, in some
5911440	5917280	sense, the supreme being, and that the right relationship to that being is to have a correct
5917280	5923360	set of beliefs. I reject all of those claims. So both the theist and the atheist?
5924240	5931520	In their modern version. Yes. In which do you reject it in the sense that you don't know
5931600	5940800	or do you reject it in the sense that you believe that each one of those presuppositions is likely
5940800	5949600	to be not true? The latter. Both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and
5950560	5956240	experience, I've come to the conclusion that those shared propositions are probably not true.
5956240	5963440	Which one is the most troublesome to you? The personal being, the kind of accumulation of
5963440	5968800	everything into one being that ultimately created stuff? So for me, there's two and
5968800	5973520	they're interlocked together. I'm not trying to dodge your question. It's that the idea that
5974640	5980560	the ground of being is some kind of being, I think, is a fundamental mistake.
5980640	5986960	It's void of being? No, no, no. The ground of being is some kind of being.
5986960	5990640	No, no, no. The turtle's all the way down. The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.
5990640	5998800	Being is not a being. It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being.
6000080	6004800	Are humans beings? We are beings. This glass is a being. This table is a being.
6005520	6012480	But when I ask you, how are they all in being, you don't say by being a glass,
6012480	6018880	or by being a table, or by being a human. You want to say, no, no, there's something underneath
6018880	6023920	it all. And then you realize it can't be anything. This is why many mystical traditions converge on
6023920	6032480	the idea that the ground of being is no thingness, which is normally pronounced as nothingness.
6032560	6037040	But if you put the hyphen back in, you get the original intent, no thingness.
6037920	6046160	And that is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship with,
6046160	6052400	so it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a supreme being, which is a category mistake to my
6052400	6058400	mind, and then that my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief.
6058400	6062880	And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion that meaning
6062880	6070320	is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions. And so that is a misunderstanding of sacredness,
6070320	6076480	because I take sacredness to be that which is most meaningful and connected to what is most real.
6077760	6082880	And theists think of what? Of sacredness as what?
6082880	6093600	They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God, and that the way that
6094320	6100960	is meaningful to them is by asserting a set of propositions or beliefs. Now, I want to point
6100960	6109200	out that this is what I would now call modern or common theism. You go back into the classical
6109200	6113760	periods of Christianity, you get a view that's really radically different from how most people
6113760	6120240	understand theism today. Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question that I usually think about
6120240	6126720	in the form of mathematics, but so in that case, if meaning is sacred in your nontheist view,
6129200	6136720	is meaning created or is it discovered? There's a Latin word that doesn't separate
6136720	6143840	them called inventio. And I would say that, and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance,
6143840	6150320	because you participate in it. You've experienced an insight, yes? Did you make it happen?
6152720	6159920	The insight? Did you make it happen? Or did you do, like, can you do that? I need an insight.
6160560	6166480	This is what I do to make an insight. Oh, I see. Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere.
6166480	6170800	Right, but you didn't just passively receive it either. You're engaged and involved in it.
6170800	6175360	That's why you get, right? So that's what I mean by you participate in it. You participate in
6175360	6181360	meaning. So you do think that it's both? Yes. You do think it's both. I mean, that's not a trivial
6181360	6190320	thing to understand, because a lot of time we think, when you think about a search for meaning,
6191200	6197600	you think it's like you're going through a big house and you open each door and look if it's
6197600	6205360	there and so on, as if there is going to be a glowing orb that you discover. But at the same time,
6207040	6215280	I'm somebody that, based on the chemistry of my brain, have been extremely fortunate to be able
6215280	6221760	to discover beauty in everything in the most mundane and boring of things. I am, as David
6221760	6230480	Foster Wallace said, unboreable. I could just sit in a room, just like playing with a tennis ball
6230480	6238160	or something and be excited. Basically, like a dog, I think, endlessly. So to me, meaning is
6238560	6247280	created, because I could create meaning out of everything. But of course, it doesn't require a
6247280	6254240	partner. It does require dance partners, whatever. It does require the tennis ball. But honestly,
6254240	6259680	that's what a lot of people that I don't necessarily, we'll talk about. I don't practice
6259680	6267200	meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like the entire days for months kind of thing.
6267200	6276400	They talk about being able to discover meaning in just the wind or something. The breath and
6276400	6285920	everything, just subtle sensory experiences give you deep fulfillment. So that's again,
6285920	6290320	this interaction. Actually, I do want to say because the interesting
6291280	6296000	difference that you've drawn between nontheism, theism and atheism,
6297040	6302400	where's the agreement or disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson on this? I just talked to
6302400	6309440	Jordan about this, because you're very clear. It's kind of beautiful in the clarity in which
6309440	6316400	you laid this out. I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity. Have you been able
6316880	6322000	to draw any kind of lies between the way the two of you see religion?
6322000	6328720	Yeah. So there was a video released, I think like two or three weeks ago, with Jordan and myself and
6328720	6333040	Jonathan Peugeot. Oh, I haven't watched that one yet. Yeah. And it's around this question, Lux.
6333040	6339920	He's basically sort of making, he's putting together an argument for God. I mean, I think
6339920	6346320	that's a fair way. I don't think he would object to me saying that. And Jonathan Peugeot is also
6347040	6351040	a, well, Jonathan is a Christian. It's unclear what Jordan is.
6352240	6356960	And Jonathan's work is on symbolism and different mythologies and Christianity.
6356960	6362640	Yes, especially Neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important. I have a lot of respect,
6362640	6365760	well, I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a lot of respect for Jonathan.
6365760	6373440	But in my participation in that dialogue, you can see me, well, repeatedly,
6374000	6379840	but I think everybody, including Jordan thought constructively, challenging sort of the attempt
6379840	6384640	to build a theistic model. And I was challenging it from a non-theistic perspective. So I think
6384640	6395520	we don't agree on certain sets of propositions, but there was a lot of, there was also a lot of
6395520	6401920	acknowledgement. And I think genuine appreciation on his part and Jonathan's part of the arguments I
6401920	6409200	was making. So they believe in maybe the presupposition of like a supreme being. Not believe,
6409200	6417520	but not believe, but they see the power of that particular presupposition in being a source of
6417520	6422480	meaning. I think that's relatively clear for me with Jordan. Jordan's a really complex guy,
6422480	6430160	so it's very hard to just like pin. To my best sort of understanding, yes, I think that's clearly
6430160	6435920	the case for Jordan. It's not the case for Jonathan. Jonathan is, remember I said,
6435920	6443600	I was talking about modern atheism and theism? Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon
6443600	6449360	carving and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern Orthodoxy and has come out of it the other end
6449360	6457120	as a fifth century church father that is nevertheless being rightfully so, to be increasingly relevant
6457120	6463680	to many people. So he's deeply old school. Yeah, I think he has, he and I, especially because
6463680	6468800	Neoplatonism is a non-theistic philosophical spirituality and it's a big part of Eastern
6468800	6476720	Orthodoxy, he and I, I think he would say things like, God doesn't exist. What? You're a Christian,
6476720	6482160	right? And then, and he's being quite, but he'll say, well, God doesn't exist the way the cup exists
6482160	6487120	or the table exists, the same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago. He'll say things like
6487120	6493840	that. He will emphasize the no-thingness of ultimate reality, the no-thingness of God,
6493840	6500800	because he is, he's from that version of Christianity, what you might call classical
6500800	6506240	theism. But classical theism looks a lot more like non-theism than it looks like modern theism.
6506800	6513360	That's so interesting. Yeah, that's really interesting. What about, is there a line to be
6513360	6521040	drawn between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness in man's search for meaning?
6521840	6526480	So here's where Jordan and I are much more, actually all three of us are in significant
6526480	6534800	agreement. I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here. Myths aren't stories about
6534800	6540640	things that happened in the deep past that are largely irrelevant. Myths are stories about perennial
6540640	6547040	or pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness. And they need to be brought into an
6547040	6553840	awareness not just or primarily at the propositional level, but at those non-propositional levels.
6553840	6559680	And I think that is what good mythos does. I prefer to use the Greek word because we've now
6559680	6566560	turned the English word into a synonym for a widely believed falsehood. And I don't think,
6566560	6571920	again, if you go back even to the church fathers, I'm not a Christian, I'm not advocating for
6571920	6579840	Christianity, but neither am I here to attack it. But when they talk about reading these stories,
6581520	6587760	they think the literal interpretation is the weakest and the least important. You move to the
6587760	6596160	allegorical or the symbolic to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical, and that's where, right?
6596160	6603680	So they would say to you, oh, you know, but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you
6604400	6609360	now? And I don't mean true for you in that relativistic sense, I mean, how is it pointing to
6609360	6614960	a pattern in your life right now? So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos
6615680	6623760	becomes real in connecting to the patterns that kind of captivate the public today.
6624880	6628640	So you just keep telling the story. I mean, there's something about some of these stories,
6629360	6636080	they're just really good at being sticky to the patterns of each generation. And they'll stick
6636080	6641280	to different patterns throughout time. They're just sticky in powerful ways.
6641280	6650800	Yes. And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again. And it's important to see
6650800	6658800	that some of these stories are recursive. They're myths about one particular set of patterns.
6659760	6666560	They're myths about, right, not just the important pattern. Like you get Jordan's stuff about
6667360	6675840	there's heroes and myths are trying to make us understand the need for being heroic in our own
6675840	6680320	lives. One of the things I like to put in counterbalance that is the Greek also have myths of
6680320	6691280	hubris, right? The counterbalance, the heroic, right? But then there are myths that are not about
6691280	6698400	those deeply important patterns, but they're myths about religio itself, that the way we're,
6699040	6703440	religio means to bind, to connect, the way relevance realization connects us. And so the
6703440	6707840	point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that pattern and notice that pattern. It's
6709520	6717280	notice how all of these patterns are emerging. And what does that say about us and reality?
6717280	6723440	And those myths, I think, are genuinely profound.
6724320	6731360	And how much of the myths, how much of the power of those myths is about the dialogues? You talk
6731360	6736240	about this quite a bit. I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys, I'm not sure
6736240	6741920	you've gotten really into it. You scratched the surface a little bit. But the role of, as you say,
6742000	6748080	dialogue in distributed cognition. What is that? The thing we're doing right now, talking
6748080	6753440	with our mouth holes. What is that? And actually, can I ask you this question?
6754640	6761440	If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans, would they notice our
6762400	6769040	distributed cognition first or our individual cognition first? What is the most notable thing
6769040	6774400	about us humans? Is it our ability to individually do well in IQ tests or whatever?
6775680	6778880	Or puzzle solve? Or is it this thing we're doing together?
6779520	6783040	I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition.
6785200	6789120	Like look around. You didn't make this equipment. You didn't build this place. You didn't invent
6789120	6795440	this language that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera. And now there's more specific and precise
6795440	6801840	experimental evidence coming out. Let's take a standard task that people,
6802800	6806640	reasoning task. I wanted to do the details. It's called the Wayson Selection Task.
6807280	6812000	And you give it to people, highly educated psychology students,
6812000	6816800	premier universities across the world. We've been doing it since the 60s. It's
6816800	6820400	replicates and replicates. And only 10% of the people get it right.
6820960	6826960	You put them in a group of four and you allow them to talk to each other.
6828160	6834880	The success rate goes to 80%. That's just one example of a phenomenon that's coming to the four.
6835760	6839600	By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of engineering students
6839600	6844480	for psychology students? Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two?
6844560	6851520	Just kidding. Let's move on. There is a lot of evidence that there's power to this
6851520	6855840	distributed cognition. Now, what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism
6855840	6858880	of the ants interacting with each other, the dialogue?
6860000	6863520	I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation.
6865040	6871920	And this is deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato, especially the Platonic dialogues.
6872880	6877040	And I'm sure we've all had this. And so give me a moment because I want to build on to something here.
6877600	6883760	We've participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us both in
6883760	6889040	directions we did not anticipate, afforded us insights that we could not have had on our own.
6889040	6894240	And we don't have to have come to an agreement, but we were both moved and we both drawn into
6894240	6899600	insight and we feel like, wow, that was one of the best moments of my life because we feel
6900160	6908480	how that introduced us to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed cognition
6909120	6915360	that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person, and potentially
6915360	6922240	with the world. That's what I mean by Deologos. And so for me, I think Deologos is
6923120	6931840	more important. Boy, I can just hear, I'm sorry, I can hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head right
6931840	6936800	now, but I think it's more... I hear them all the time. I just wish they would shut up in my head
6937840	6943520	sometimes. So what are they saying to you in your head? What they're saying, well, see,
6943520	6947040	that's what the most recent conversation was about. I was trying to say
6947440	6956000	that I don't think mythos is... I think mythos is really important. I think these kinds of narratives
6956000	6963840	are really important, but I think this ability to connect together in distributed cognition,
6963840	6970320	collective intelligence, and cultivate a shared flow state within that collective
6970320	6976000	intelligence so it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective wisdom. I think that's
6976560	6982080	more important because I think that's the basin within which the myths and the rituals are
6982080	6988800	ultimately created and when they function. A myth is like a public dream. It depends
6988800	6994640	on distributed cognition and it depends on people enacting it and getting into mutual flow states.
6995920	7003680	So the highest form of dialogue of conversation is this flow state and that it forms the
7004480	7010640	foundation for myth building. I think so. I think so. So that communitas, that's Victor Turner's
7010640	7017680	phrase, specifically linked it to flow and I study flow scientifically, that within distributed
7017680	7026640	cognition as the home, as the generator of mythos and ritual and those are bound together as well,
7026640	7031040	I think that's fundamentally correct. You know what's the cool thing here? Because I'm a huge
7031040	7037200	fan of podcasts and audiobooks, but podcasts in particular is relevant here is there's a
7037200	7046480	third person in this room listening now and they're also in the flow state. Yes, yes. I'm close
7046480	7052080	friends with a lot of podcasts. They don't know I exist. I just listen to them because I've been
7052080	7057840	in so many flow states with them. I was like, yes, yes, this is good, but they don't know I exist,
7057840	7064560	but they are in conversation with me ultimately. And think of what that's doing. You've got dialogues
7064560	7070400	and then you've got this meta dialogue like you're describing and think about how things like podcasts
7070400	7077200	and YouTube, they break down old boundaries between the private and the public, between writing
7077200	7082880	and oral speech. So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency
7082960	7092240	of writing. We're in the midst of creating a vehicle and a medium for distributed cognition
7092240	7098000	that breaks down a lot of the categories by which we organized our cognition.
7098000	7104400	I mean, because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the network, the graph of how quickly
7104400	7109040	the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful. You just a huge amount of people have
7109040	7114480	listened to your lectures. I've listened to your lectures, but I've experienced them, at least in
7114480	7121360	your style, there's something about your style. It felt like a conversation. It felt like at
7121360	7125760	any point moment I could interrupt you and say something. And I was just listening.
7125760	7133120	Thank you for saying that because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can when I'm
7133120	7138320	doing this. Yeah, there was that sense actually as I'm saying it now. Why was that? It didn't feel
7138400	7145680	like sometimes lectures, you come down with the commandments and you just want to listen.
7145680	7150160	But there was a sense like, I mean, I think it was the excitement that you have to understand.
7150160	7155920	And also the fact that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the top of your head sometimes.
7157600	7162320	You were interrupting yourself with thoughts. You're playing with thoughts. You're reasoning
7162320	7169920	through things often. You referenced a lot of books, so surely you're extremely well prepared
7169920	7173440	and you're referencing a lot of ideas, but then you're also struggling in the way to present
7173440	7181040	those ideas. Yes. And so the jazz, the jazz and getting into the flow state and trying to
7182160	7186960	share in a participatory and perspectival fashion the learning with the people
7186960	7191200	rather than just pronouncing at them. Yes. What's mindfulness?
7192720	7198400	So published on that as well. And I practice. I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness
7198400	7204960	and ecology of practices since 1991. So I both have practitioners' knowledge and I also study
7204960	7210960	it scientifically. I think I'm pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about
7210960	7215520	mindfulness at the University of Toronto within a classroom setting, like lecturing on it.
7216480	7221040	So this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in, think about.
7221840	7226560	So from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is?
7227280	7233280	I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions being aware of the present moment without judgment
7233280	7238400	because I think they're flawed. And if you want to get into the detail of why we can,
7238400	7244240	but this is how I want to explain it to you. And it also points to the fact of why you need
7244240	7249680	an ecology of mindfulness practices. You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation. I think that's
7249680	7253920	a primary mistake. When you say ecology, what do you mean by the way? So lots of many different
7254640	7258480	variants? No, so what I mean by an ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology. You have a
7258480	7264240	dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each other. And I'll get to that
7264240	7269040	with this about mindfulness. I'll make that connection if you allow me. So we're always
7269120	7274160	framing. We've been talking about that. And for those of you who are not on YouTube,
7274160	7280880	this podcast, I wear glasses and I'm now sort of putting my fingers and thumb around the
7280880	7288400	frames of my glasses. So this is my frame. And my lenses and that frame, the frame holds a lens
7288400	7294560	and I'm seeing through it in both senses, beyond and by means of it. So right now,
7294560	7300000	my glasses are transparent to me. I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing.
7300880	7307280	Now, this is what you do in meditation, I would argue. You step back from looking through your
7307280	7312080	frame and you look at it. I'm taking my glasses off right now and I'm looking at them. Why might I
7312080	7319440	do that? To see if there's something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to, right?
7319440	7325600	Now, if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I've actually corrected
7326560	7332880	the change I made to my lenses? What do I need to do? I need to put my glasses on and see if I
7332880	7339040	can now see more clearly and deeply than I could before. Meditation is this, stepping back and
7339040	7346000	looking at. Contemplation is that looking through and there are different kinds of practices. The
7346000	7350960	fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake. The word contemplation has temple in it,
7350960	7357600	in Latin. Contemplario means to look up to the sky. It's a translation of the Greek word theoria,
7357600	7362400	which we get our word theory from. It's to look deeply into things. Meditation is more about
7363280	7369680	having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and looking at. Mindfulness includes both.
7370400	7374400	It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame
7375760	7382160	and the ability to make a new frame. That's what actually happens in insight. You have to both break
7382160	7390000	an inappropriate frame and make, see, realize a new frame. This is why mindfulness enhances insight.
7390000	7395680	Both ways, by the way. Meditative practices and also contemplative practices.
7396480	7404800	So, mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your
7404800	7411840	capacities for insight and self-regulation. Now, I am inexperienced with meditation,
7412800	7418640	the rigorous practice and the science of meditation. I've talked to people who
7418640	7427120	seriously as a science study psychedelics, and they often talk about the really important thing
7427120	7435040	is the integration back, so the contemplation step. It's not just the actual things you see
7435040	7440320	on psychedelics or the actual journey of where your mind goes on psychedelics. It's also the
7440320	7448080	integrating that into the new perspective that you take on life. You really nicely describe
7448160	7455280	so meditation in that metaphor is the psychedelic journey to a different mind state. Contemplation
7455280	7461840	is the return back to reality, how you integrate that into a new world view. Mindfulness is the
7461840	7469680	whole process. So, if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from inflation and projective
7469680	7475440	fantasy. If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual bypassing,
7475440	7481280	avoiding reality. They act. They need each other. You have to cycle between them. It's like
7481280	7485920	what I talked about earlier when I talked about the opponent processing within the autonomic
7485920	7490720	nervous system or the opponent processing at work and attention, and that's what I mean by an
7490720	7496800	ecology of practices. You need both. Neither one is a panacea. You need them in this opponent
7496800	7502720	processing acting as checks and balance on each other. Is there sort of practical advice you can
7502720	7510880	give to people on how to meditate or how to be mindful in this full way? Yes. I would tell them
7510880	7519120	to do at least three things, and I was, I lucked into this. When I started meditation, I went down
7519120	7524480	the street and there was a place that taught vipassana meditation, metacontemplation and tai chi
7524480	7529840	chuan for flow induction, and you should get, you should have a meditative practice.
7530800	7535920	You should find a contemplative practice, and you should find a moving mindfulness practice,
7535920	7540480	especially one that is conducive to the flow state and practice them in an integrated fashion.
7541760	7547920	Can you elaborate what those practices might look like? Generally speaking.
7548480	7556560	Meditative practice like vipassana. What's the primary thing I look through rather than look
7556720	7562240	at? It's my sensations. What I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my sensations rather than
7562240	7568960	focusing on the world through my sensations. I'm going to follow, for example, the sensations in
7568960	7576160	this area of my abdomen, where my breathing is. I can feel as my abdomen is expanding,
7576160	7581200	I can feel those sensations, and then I can feel the sensations as it's contracting.
7581280	7588400	What will happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at the world again.
7589120	7593760	I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry, or what was that noise? What do I do?
7593760	7599120	I don't get involved with the content. I step back and label the process with an
7599120	7606240	ING word, listening, imagining, planning, and then I return my attention to the breath. I have to
7606240	7611200	return my attention in the correct way. Part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist
7611200	7615040	tradition, this is called your monkey mind. It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering.
7616640	7622640	If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay, or as Jack Hornfield said, train a puppy dog,
7624400	7629840	stay puppy dog, and if it goes and I get really angry, and I bring it back and I'm yelling at it,
7629840	7635760	I'm going to train it to fight and fear me. But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its
7635760	7641600	whims, oh, look, the puppy dog went there. Oh, now it's there. The puppy dog never learns to stay.
7641600	7646560	What do I need to do? I have to neither fight it nor feed it. I have to have this centered
7646560	7654480	attitude. I have to befriend it. You step back and look at your sensations. You step back and look
7654480	7659840	at your distracting processes. You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the
7659840	7663680	right attitude. That's the core of a good meditative practice.
7664400	7666800	Okay, then what's a good contemplative practice?
7667360	7676560	A good contemplative practice is to try and meta. It's actually apropos, because we talked about
7676560	7682560	that participatory knowing the way you're situated in the world. This is a long thing,
7682560	7686960	because there's different interpretations of meta. I go for what's called an existential
7687040	7693760	interpretation over an emotional one. What I'm doing in meta is I'm trying to
7695680	7703200	awaken in two ways. I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an identity
7703200	7710000	and assigning an identity. I'm looking at that. I'm trying to awaken to that. Then I'm trying
7710000	7718720	to awake from the modal confusion that I can get into around that. I'm looking out onto the world
7718720	7726160	and I'm trying to see you in a fundamentally different way than I have before.
7728160	7732160	You go to the gym and you do bicep curls. Yes, yes.
7732160	7736400	Is it possible to reduce it to those things? I mean, you don't need to speak to the specifics,
7736400	7740480	but is there actual practice you can do or is it really personal?
7741040	7744880	No, I teach people how to do the meta practice. I also teach them how to do a neoplatonic
7744880	7749760	contemplative practice, how to do a stoic. Another one you can do is the view from above.
7749760	7754800	This is classic stoicism. I get you to imagine that you're in this room and then imagine that
7754800	7761040	you're floating above the room, then above Austin, then above Texas, then above the United States,
7761040	7766160	then the earth. You have to really imagine it. Don't just think it, but really imagine it.
7766160	7772960	What you notice is as you're pulling out to a wider and wider contemplation of reality,
7772960	7778000	your sense of self and what you find relevant and important also changes. For all of these,
7778000	7783120	there is a specific step-by-step methodology. In that one, you could just literally imagine
7783120	7788560	yourself floating farther and farther out. You have to go through the steps because the
7788560	7792320	stepping matters because if you just jump, it doesn't work.
7792320	7794160	Do you have any of the stuff online, by the way?
7794720	7803760	I do because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a daily course.
7803760	7807760	I taught meditating with John Rovaki. I did all the way through meditation,
7807760	7812000	contemplation, even some of the movement practices. That's all there. It's all available.
7812000	7817440	That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism. Then I went into the Western tradition and went
7817440	7821760	through things like stoicism and neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Rovaki. That's
7821840	7826320	all there. All free. On your website. Yeah, it's on my YouTube channel.
7826320	7833680	On your YouTube channel? Okay. That's exciting. I mean, your meaning crisis lectures are just
7833680	7837200	incredible. Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people talk.
7838400	7843440	It created this tree of conversations that's really, really, really well done.
7845120	7849760	What about flow induction? You want to flow wisely. First of all,
7850720	7855280	you need to understand what flow is, and then you need to confront a particular
7855280	7859680	issue around a practical problem around flow. Let's go there because a lot of those words
7859680	7867200	seem like synonyms to people sometimes. The state of flow, what is it?
7867200	7871440	All right. He just died last year. Chik Samp Mahai.
7871440	7877200	I admire him very much. We've exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years.
7877440	7881440	He wanted to do the podcast several times. That would have been wonderful.
7882400	7890480	But he said he struggled with his health. I never knew in those situations. I deeply regret
7892560	7902080	several cases like this that I had with Conway that I should have pushed him on it.
7903040	7908640	Because, yeah, as you get later in life, the simple things become more difficult,
7908640	7913600	but a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard, is important to hear.
7914960	7920480	Anyway, I apologize. I share that. I can tell you that within
7921920	7928800	my area, he is important, and he's famous in an academics sense. The flow state,
7929520	7933680	two important sets of conditions, and very often people only talk about one, and that's
7933680	7940080	a little bit of a misrepresentation. The flow state is in situations in which
7940640	7947200	the demand of the situation is slightly beyond your skills. You both have to apply all the
7947200	7954000	skills you can with as much attention and concentration as you possibly can, and you
7954000	7961520	have to actually be stretching your skills. In this circumstance, people report optimal
7961520	7966240	experience, optimal in two ways, optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I've
7966240	7970960	had in my life. It's distinct from pleasure, and yet it explains why people do very bizarre
7970960	7976320	things like rock climbing because it's a good flow induction. But they also mean optimal in a
7976320	7981520	second sense, my best performance. It's both the best experience and the best performance.
7984240	7988160	Chicksat Mahay also talked about the information flow conditions you need
7989440	7993280	in order for there to be this state of flow, and then I'll talk about what it's like to be in
7993280	7997840	flow in a sec. What you need is three things. You need the information that you're getting
7997840	8002640	to be clear. It can't be ambiguous or vague. Think about a rock climber. It's ambiguous and vague.
8006080	8010320	There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the environment responds.
8011040	8015040	So when you act, there's an immediate response. There isn't a big time lag
8015040	8019520	between your action and your ability to detect the response from the environment.
8021040	8024160	Third, failure has to matter. Error really matters.
8024800	8029360	So there should be some anxiety about failure. And failure matters.
8031280	8036480	Like to you, the person that persists. Yes, yes, yes. Now when you're in the flow state,
8036480	8042240	and notice how this sits on the boundary between the secular and the sacred,
8042800	8049840	when you're in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of at one mit with the environment.
8050560	8055520	They report a loss of a particular kind of self-consciousness, that narrative,
8055520	8060640	nurturing nanny in your head that, how do I look? Do people like me? How do I look?
8060640	8064080	How's my hair? Do people like me? Should I have said that? That all goes away.
8065040	8069520	You're free from that. You're free from the most sadistic, super ego self-critic you could
8069520	8075920	possibly have, at least for a while. The world is vivid. It's super salient to you. There's
8075920	8082240	an ongoing sense of discovery. Although often you know you're exerting a lot of
8083440	8090320	metabolical effort, it feels effortless. So in the flow state when you're sparring,
8090320	8096000	your hand just goes up for the block, and your strike just goes through the empty space.
8096000	8100000	Or if you're a goalie in hockey, I've got to mention hockey once I'm a Canadian,
8100000	8109520	right? You put out your glove hand in the pucks there, right? So there's this tremendous sense
8110240	8119920	of grace, atonement, super salience, discovery, and realness. People don't, well, people don't,
8119920	8122400	when they're in the flow state, they don't go, I bet this is an illusion.
8123440	8130080	The interesting question for me and my co-authors in the book, in the article we published,
8130080	8135760	in the Oxford Handbook, A Spontaneous Thought with Arian, Harry Bennett, and Leo Ferraro,
8135760	8141280	is that's a descriptive account of flow. We wanted an explanatory account, one of the causal
8141280	8150960	mechanisms at work in flow. And so we actually proposed two interlocking cognitive processes.
8151600	8157520	The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow? Well, think about it. Think about the
8157520	8164160	rock climber. The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier, they're constantly restructuring
8164160	8168960	how they're seeing the rock face. They're constantly doing something like insight.
8169600	8174800	And if they fail to do it, they impasse, and that starts to get dangerous. So they got to do it
8174800	8180160	in insight, that primes in insight, that primes in insight. So imagine the aha experience,
8180160	8186560	that flash in that moment, and imagine it cascading, so you're getting the extended aha.
8186560	8191120	That's why things are super salient. There's a sense of discovery. There's a sense of atonement,
8191200	8195760	of deep participation, of grace. But there's something else going on too.
8197040	8202320	So there's a phenomena called implicit learning. Also, very well replicated,
8202960	8209360	starts way back in the 60s with Reber. You can give people complex patterns, like number and
8209360	8218240	letter strings, right? And they can learn about those patterns outside of deliberate
8218240	8223120	focal awareness. That's what's called implicit learning. And what's interesting is if you try
8223120	8231360	and change that task into, you know, tell me the pattern, but explicitly try to figure out
8231360	8237280	the performance degrades. So here's the idea. You have this adaptive capacity for implicit
8237280	8243760	learning. And what it does is it results in you being able to track complex variables in a way,
8243760	8248960	but you don't know how you came up with that knowledge. And this is Hogarth's proposal in
8248960	8253920	educating intuition. Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning. So an example I use
8253920	8263360	is, how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral? There's a lot of complex variables.
8263360	8268960	There's status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history,
8268960	8274000	all kinds of stuff. And yet you know how to do it. And you didn't have to go to funeral school.
8275120	8280000	I'm just using that as an example. So you have these powerful intuitions. Now here's Hogarth's
8280000	8286080	great point. Implicit learning, and remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive make
8286080	8291760	a subject to self-deception. Here's another example. Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on
8291760	8298080	complex patterns, but it doesn't care what kind of pattern it is. It doesn't distinguish causal
8298080	8304800	patterns from merely correlational patterns. So when we like it, it's intuition. When it's picking
8304800	8309520	up on stuff that's bogus, we call it prejudice, or all kinds of other names for intuition that's
8309520	8315440	going wrong. Now he said, okay, what do we do? What do we do about this? And this will get back to
8315440	8319600	flow. What do we do about this? Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning with explicit
8319600	8324960	learning because we'll lose all the adaptiveness to it. So what can we do explicitly? What we can
8324960	8330960	do is take care of the environment in which we're doing the implicit learning. How do we do that?
8330960	8336880	We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish causation from correlation.
8338160	8342880	What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing causation from correlation?
8343520	8349280	Experimental environments. What do you do in an experiment? You make sure that the variables
8349280	8354080	are clear. No confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness. You make sure there's a tight coupling between
8354080	8359120	the independent and the dependent variable, and your hypothesis can be falsified. Error
8359120	8365120	matters. Now look at those three legs. Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for
8365120	8373360	flow. Clear information, tightly coupled feedback, and error matters. So flow is not only an
8373360	8381520	insight cascade, improving your insight capacity. It's also a marker that you're cultivating the
8381520	8388160	best kind of intuitions, the ones that fit you best to the causal patterns in your environment.
8389360	8394240	But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment where there's a clear distinction between
8394240	8401200	causality and correlation, and it has the rigor of a scientific experiment.
8401200	8406880	Fair enough. And I don't think Hogarth was saying it's going to be epistemically as rigorous as a
8406880	8413920	scientific experiment. But he's saying, if you structure that, it will tend to do what that
8413920	8418320	scientific method does, which is find causal. Think of the rock climber. All of those things are
8418320	8424560	the case. They need clear information. It's tightly coupled, and error matters. And they think what
8424560	8431760	they're doing is very real, because if they're not conforming to the real causal patterns of the
8431760	8440720	rock face and the physiology of their body, they will fall. Is there something to be said about
8440720	8446320	the power of discovering meaning and having this deep relationship with the moment?
8448160	8455280	There's something about flow that really forgets the past and the future, and is really focused on
8455280	8460160	the moment. I think that's part of the phenomenology. But I think the functionality has to do with the
8460160	8468320	fact that what's happening in flow is that dynamic non-propositional connectedness that is so central
8468320	8478320	to meaning is being optimized. This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life,
8478880	8484240	how much well-being you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive and interrelated
8484240	8489280	with how meaningful you find your life. One of the things that you can do, but there's an important
8489280	8495600	caveat, to increase your sense of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently.
8496160	8500800	That's why I said you want a moving practice that's conducive to the flow state. But there's one
8500800	8509040	important caveat, which is we of course have figured out, and I'm playing with words here,
8509040	8515360	how to game this and how to hijack it by creating things like video games. I'm not saying this is
8515440	8521760	the case for all video games or this is the case for all people, but the WHO now acknowledges this
8521760	8529840	as a real thing that you can get into the flow state within the video game world to the detriment
8529840	8535280	of your ability to get into the flow state in the real world. What's the opposite of flow?
8536000	8539360	Depression. In fact, depression has been called anti-flow.
8540320	8548160	You get these people that are flowing in this non-real world, and they can't transfer it to the
8548160	8553760	real world, and it's actually costing them flow in the real world. They tend to suffer depression
8553760	8561440	and all kinds of things. Your ability, your habit, and just skill at attaining flow in the
8562080	8571600	video game world basically makes you less effective or maybe shocks you at how difficult
8571600	8578960	it is to achieve flow in the physical world. I don't want to push back against the implied
8579920	8588080	challenge of transferability because I have a lot of friends that play video games,
8588800	8597040	a very large percent of young folks play video games. I'm hesitant to build up models
8598480	8604160	of how that affects behavior. My intuition is weak there. Oftentimes, people that have
8604160	8610320	PhDs are of a certain age that they came up when video games weren't a deep part of their life
8610320	8617760	development. I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games being
8618480	8625040	a large part of that world are in some sense different humans, and it's possible that they
8625040	8633440	can transfer more effectively some of the lessons, some of the ability to attain flow from the
8633440	8638800	virtual world to the physical world. They're also more, I would venture to say, resilient
8638800	8647040	to the negative effects of, for example, social media or video games they have that may be the
8647040	8652880	objectification or the over sexualized or violent aspect of video games. They're able to
8652880	8656800	turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on when they're playing
8656800	8665360	the video games probably more effectively than the old timers. I just want to say that I'm not
8665360	8671120	sure it's a really interesting question how transferable the flow state is. If you want to
8671120	8675680	comment on that. I do. First of all, I did qualify and I'm saying it's not the case for all video
8675680	8680000	games or for all people. I'm holding out the possibility and I know this possibility because
8680880	8687440	I've had students who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me.
8688240	8692240	Oh, the ability to achieve. They couldn't transfer, yeah.
8694560	8698800	And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science
8698800	8705120	and write about it and work on it. Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim
8705200	8714480	because there seems to be mounting evidence. It's not consensus, but it's certainly not
8714480	8720720	regarded as fringe that the increase in social media is pretty strongly correlated with increase
8720720	8726000	in depression, self-destructive behavior, things like this. I would like to see that evidence.
8726960	8729440	No, no, no. Let me.
8733280	8742000	I'm always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree with things that I want to agree with.
8742880	8750320	There's a public perception. Everyone seems to hate on social media. I wonder, as always with
8750320	8757120	these things, does it reveal depression or does it create depression? Sure. This is always the
8757120	8763120	question. It's like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create
8763120	8768960	hate or does it reveal hate? And that's a good thing to ask and you should always challenge the
8768960	8776640	things that you intuitively want to believe. I agree with that. Like aliens. So one of the ways
8776640	8783200	you address this, and it's not sufficient, and I did say the work is preliminary, but if I can
8783200	8790160	give you a plausible mechanism that's new and then that lends credence and part of what happens
8790160	8796880	is a losery social comparison. Think of Instagram. People are posting things that are not accurate
8796880	8803360	representation of their life or life events. In fact, they will stage things, but the people
8803360	8810880	that are looking at these, they take it often as real and so they get downward social comparison.
8814560	8818960	Compared to how you and I probably live, where we may get one or two of those events
8818960	8825200	a week, they're getting them moment by moment and so it's a plausible mechanism that why it might
8825200	8832160	be driving people into a more depressed state. The flip side of that is because there's a greater
8832480	8838320	gap going from real world to Instagram world. You start to be able to laugh at it and realize
8838320	8843920	that it's artificial. So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize like
8844800	8851280	there's like, it's the same kind of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world.
8851280	8853680	In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things,
8854960	8858480	grant that thought or you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want,
8858480	8863520	in the real world you can't and you start to develop an understanding of how to have fun in
8863520	8868800	the virtual world and in the physical world. And I think it's just a pushback. I'm not saying
8868800	8874000	either is true though. Those are very interesting claims. The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram
8874000	8880400	becomes the easier you can laugh it off potentially in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.
8880400	8883840	I'll respond to that, but at some point we should get back to flow.
8884800	8887280	As we engage in flow.
8887280	8892400	You laugh at the shampoo commercial and you buy the shampoo.
8895040	8896000	Yeah.
8896000	8901360	There's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines are designed
8901360	8906880	to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking.
8906880	8917280	I'm thinking of common examples because sometimes you're
8919920	8924640	can laugh all the way to the bank. So you can laugh and not buy the shampoo.
8924640	8924960	Right.
8924960	8928960	There's many cases. So I think you have to laugh hard enough.
8928960	8934320	You do have to laugh hard enough, but the advertisers get millions of dollars
8934320	8940000	precisely because for many, many people it does make you buy the shampoo and that's the concern.
8940000	8944720	And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.
8944720	8953600	Yes. The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately right,
8953600	8961520	the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing. And I want to contrast that to an experience
8961520	8965520	I had when I was in grad school. I've been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years
8965520	8970240	very religiously in both senses of the word, like three or four hours a day and reading all
8970240	8976880	the literature and I was having all the weird experiences, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that
8976880	8985760	stuff. But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what's going on? You're different.
8986560	8992800	And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, you're a lot more balanced in your interactions
8992800	8998560	and you're a lot more flowing and you're a lot more sort of flexible and you adjust more.
8998560	9005040	And I realized, oh, you know, and this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan
9005040	9011520	that it actually transfers in ways that you might not expect. You start to be able,
9011520	9017200	and I've now noticed that. I now notice how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this interaction
9017200	9022800	and how it can facilitate and afford. And so there's a powerful transfer. And that's what I
9022800	9030160	meant by flow wisely, not only flow in a way that's making sure that your distinguishing
9030160	9036400	causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate it, home it,
9036400	9040480	so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains of your life.
9042480	9048080	Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation
9049280	9057920	and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind? Where does the mind go
9060720	9069520	when it's on psychedelics? I want to remind you of something you said which is a gem.
9070480	9074240	It's not so much the experience, but the degree to which it can be integrated back.
9076400	9081280	So here's a proposal. It comes from Woodward and others. A lot of converges around this.
9081280	9085840	Carrot Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain. But I'm not going to talk
9085840	9089840	first about psychedelics. I'm going to talk about neural networks. And I'm going to talk about
9090480	9095360	a classic problem in neural networks. So neural networks like us with intuition and implicit
9095360	9101040	learning are fantastic at picking up on complex patterns. Which neural networks are we talking
9101040	9108080	about? I'm talking about a general part. Both artificial and biological? Yes. Yes. Yes. I think
9108080	9114320	at this point there is no relevant difference. So one of the classic problems, because of their
9114320	9121840	power, is they suffer from overfitting to the data. Or for those of you with statistical orientation,
9122400	9127920	they pick up patterns in the sample that aren't actually present in the population.
9129120	9137120	And so what you do, there's various strategies. You can do dropout. You periodically turn off
9137120	9144080	half of the nodes in a network. You can drop noise into the network. And what that does is
9144080	9149280	it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to generalize more powerfully to the
9149280	9159520	environment. I proposed to you that that's basically what psychedelics do. They do that.
9159520	9167360	They basically do significant constraint reduction. And so you get areas of the brain
9167360	9171920	talking to each other that don't normally talk to each other. Areas that do talk to each other,
9171920	9176400	not talking to each other, down regulation of areas that are very dominant, like the default
9176400	9181680	mode network, et cetera. And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous, sorry,
9181680	9187440	to what's happening in dropout or putting noise into the data. It opens up. By the way,
9187440	9192000	if you give people, if you give human beings an insight problem that they're trying to solve
9192000	9197040	and you throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight in them.
9199280	9203200	So like literally a very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system.
9203680	9209440	It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up. Now, that means though
9210560	9221280	that just doing that in and of itself is not the answer because you also have to make sure
9221840	9227120	that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly. This isn't a problem with
9227120	9231600	neural networks. You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks.
9231680	9234400	And now they explore the state space that they couldn't explore before.
9235040	9240560	Human beings are a little bit more messy around this and this is where the analogy does get a
9240560	9249680	little bit strained. So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new
9249680	9257520	state space so they can properly integrate it. So beyond Leary's state set and setting,
9258480	9265840	I think you need another S. I think you need sacred. Psychedelics need to be practiced
9266560	9272560	within a sapiential framework, a framework in which people are independently and beforehand
9273360	9278960	improving their abilities to deal with self-deception and afford insight and self-regulate. This is,
9278960	9283760	of course, the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous cultures.
9284400	9291760	And I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people
9292800	9298480	self-transcending, cultivating, meaning, and increasing wisdom. But I think we remove them
9298480	9305280	out of that context and put them in the context of commodities taken just to have
9305280	9309840	certain phenomenological changes. We run certain important risks.
9310720	9317680	So using the term of higher states of consciousness, is consciousness an important
9317680	9329120	part of that word? Why higher? Is it a higher state or is it a detour, a side road on the main
9329120	9337440	road of consciousness? Where do we go here? I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum.
9337520	9342640	There's insight, and then if flow is an insight cascade, there's flow, and then you can have
9342640	9348640	sort of psychedelic experiences, mind-revealing experiences, but they overlap with mystical
9348640	9355200	experiences, and they aren't the same. So, for example, in the Griffiths lab, they gave people
9355200	9361840	psilocybin, and they taught them ahead of time how sort of the features of a mystical experience,
9361840	9366800	and only a certain proportion of the people that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic
9366800	9371600	into a mystical experience. What was interesting is the people that had the mystical experience
9371600	9376800	had measurable and long-standing change to one of the big five factors of personality.
9376800	9380720	They had increased openness. Openness is supposed to actually go down over time,
9380720	9385760	and these traits aren't supposed to be that malleable, and it was significantly altered.
9387040	9395120	But imagine if you just created more openness in a person, and they're now open to a lot more,
9395120	9398640	and they want to explore a lot more, but you don't give them the tools of discernment,
9399360	9403920	that could be problematic for them in important ways. That could be very problematic.
9403920	9414160	Yes, I got it. So, you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow, integrated back into
9414160	9418080	your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception of that world.
9418080	9422400	And when people do that, that's when I call it a transformative experience.
9423280	9426960	Now, the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move
9426960	9432160	people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience. Because what happens
9432160	9437200	in these experiences is something really, really interesting. They get to a state that's ineffable,
9437200	9443360	they can't put it into words, they can't describe it, but they do this, they're in this state
9443360	9448400	temporarily, and then they come back and they do this. They say, that was really real, and this
9448400	9454080	in comparison is less real. So, I remember that platonic meta-desire, I want to change my life
9454080	9460160	myself so that I'm more in conformity with that really real. And that is really odd, Lex, because
9460160	9467280	normally when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, when we
9467280	9471760	come back from it, we say, that doesn't fit into everything, therefore, it's unreal. They do the
9471760	9477600	exact opposite. They come out of these states and they say, that doesn't fit into this, right?
9477680	9483120	Consensus intelligibility, and that means this is less real. They do the exact opposite,
9483120	9491200	and that fascinates me. Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative
9491200	9495840	states? And the thing is, those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that
9495840	9502000	ontonormativity, the realness that demands that you make a change in your life, they serve to
9502640	9506560	bridge between mystical experiences and genuine transformative experiences.
9506560	9511120	So, you do think seeing those as more real is productive because then you reach for them?
9511120	9518640	So, Jaden's done work on it. Again, all of this stuff isn't recent, so we have to take it with
9518640	9524640	a grain of salt, but by a lot of objective measure, people who do this, who have these
9524640	9529840	higher states of consciousness and undertake the transformative process, their lives get better,
9529840	9535920	their relationships improve, their sense of self improves, their anxieties go down, depression,
9535920	9541440	like all of these other measures, the needles are moved on these measures by people undergoing
9541440	9546560	this transformative experience. Their lives, by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to
9546560	9555760	be good, get better. I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that
9555760	9563280	leads to mass formation of ideologies that have had an impact on our world. So, you spoke about
9563280	9570960	the clash of the two great pseudo-religious ideologies of Marxism and Nazism, especially their
9570960	9580400	clash on the Eastern Front. Can you explain the origin of each of these? Marxism and Nazism
9581120	9585360	in a kind of way that we have been talking about the formation of ideas.
9587200	9593520	Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism. He was the philosopher who took
9594240	9602400	German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling, and he built
9602480	9609920	a philosophical system. He explicitly said this, by the way. He wanted to bridge
9610560	9615040	between philosophy and religion. He explicitly said that. I'm not voicing that on him. He said it
9615040	9620960	repeatedly in many different places. So, he's trying to create a philosophical system that
9621920	9629120	gathered to it, I think, the core mythos of Christianity. The core mythos of Christianity
9629120	9635200	is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which progress is real,
9635200	9641280	in which our actions now can change the future. We can co-participate with God
9641280	9645680	in the creation of the future, and that future can be better. It can reach something like a
9645680	9651520	utopia or the promised land or whatever. He created a philosophical system of brilliance,
9651520	9657440	by the way. He's a genius, but basically what it did was it took that religious vision
9657440	9662560	and gave it the air of philosophical intelligibility and respect.
9664240	9670480	Then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the narrative is working itself
9670480	9675280	out that Hegel called dialectic? I don't think it's primarily happening in ideas. I think it's
9675280	9680800	happening primarily in between classes within socioeconomic factors, but it's the same story.
9680800	9687120	Here's this mechanism of history. It's teleological. It's going to move this way. It can move towards
9687120	9693920	a utopia. We can either participate in furthering it, like participating in the work of God,
9693920	9701440	or we can thwart it and be against it. You have a pseudo-religious vision. It's all
9701440	9706560	encompassing. Think about how Marxism is not just a philosophical position. It's not just
9706560	9715840	an economic position. It's an entire worldview, an entire account of history and a demanding
9715840	9722480	account of what human excellence is. It has all these things about participating, belonging,
9722480	9733440	fitting to. In Marx's case, it's very pragmatic or directly applicable to society
9733440	9738640	to where it more naturally leads to political ideologies.
9738640	9745280	It does, but I think Marx to a very significant degree inherits one of Hegel's main flaws.
9746000	9753520	Hegel is talking about all this, and he's trying to fit it into post-Contian philosophy. For him,
9753520	9761520	it's ultimately propositional, conceptual. He, like everybody after Descartes, is very focused
9761520	9768320	on the propositional level, and he's not paying deep attention to the non-propositional. This
9768320	9774560	is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, they're trying to put their finger
9774560	9780000	on the non-propositional, the non-conceptual, the will to power or faith in Kierkegaard,
9780000	9784400	and they're trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing as being inadequate.
9784400	9788720	That's why Kierkegaard met when he said, Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside it.
9789280	9799600	Right. Marxism is very much, it is activist. It's about reorganizing society, but the
9799600	9805280	transformation in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it's largely about
9806080	9811200	these significant propositional changes and adopting a set of beliefs.
9811200	9817600	When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union, why do you
9817600	9824560	think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people? Not Marxism, but implementation
9824560	9834400	of Marxism in the name of communism. Because it offered people, I mean, it offered people
9834400	9843280	something that typically only religions had offered, and it offered people the hope of making a new
9843280	9849520	man, a new kind of human being in a new world. And when you've been living in Russia,
9851520	9857840	in which things seem to be locked in a system that is crushing most people,
9858640	9867040	getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy that we can make new human beings
9867840	9874000	and a new world and in which happiness will ensue. That's an intoxicating proposal.
9877040	9883280	You get all of the intoxication of religious utopia, but you get all the seeming legitimacy
9883280	9888720	of claiming that it's a scientific understanding of history and economics.
9889520	9896480	It's very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days. And I often put myself in the place
9897040	9904400	before any of the implementations came to be, I tried to think if I would be able to predict
9906240	9912160	what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in in the 20th century.
9912160	9918640	And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction, because at the core of the ideas are
9919600	9927120	respecting, with Marx, it's very economics type theory. So it's basically respecting the value
9927120	9935200	of the worker and the regular man in society for making a contribution to that society.
9935200	9942640	And to me, that seems like a powerful idea. And it's not clear to me how it goes wrong.
9942640	9950400	In fact, it's still not clear to me why the hell did this like with Stalin happen
9950400	9956240	or Mao happen. It's there's something very interesting and complex about human nature
9956240	9961760	in hierarchies about distributed cognition that results in that. And it's not trivial to understand.
9961760	9968640	No, no. So I mean, I wonder if you can put a finger on it. Why like why did it go so wrong?
9968640	9975040	So I think, you know, what Ohana talks about in the intellectual history of modernity
9977200	9988400	talks about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal and think about how it's
9988960	9995440	not so radical to us. And in that sense, Marxism has succeeded the radical proposal that you see
9995440	10000400	even in the French Revolution, and don't forget the terror comes in the French Revolution too,
10001680	10007440	that we can make ourselves into Godlike beings. Think of the hubris in that.
10008480	10014400	Right. And think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand human nature and all of
10014400	10021200	its complexities and human history, right, and how religion functioned and every that we can just
10021200	10029680	come in with a plan and make it run. It's to my mind, that Promethean spirit is part of why
10029680	10036320	it's doomed to fail. And it's doomed to fail in a kind of terrorizing way, because the Promethean
10036320	10045120	spirit really licenses you to do anything because the ends justify the means.
10045440	10051520	This the end justify the means really free you to do some of basically,
10054080	10055840	well, commit atrocities at any scale.
10056480	10063040	Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Cameroosh, right? Exactly. And you only, you can only believe
10063920	10068960	in an ends that can justify any means if you believe in a utopia, and you can only believe
10068960	10072400	in the utopia if you really buy into the Promethean spirit.
10072400	10075200	So is that what explains Nazism?
10075200	10081600	So Nazism is part of that too, the Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into
10081600	10094880	Superman, Ubermench, right? And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting
10095840	10103840	sort of Gnostic themes that are very prevalent. Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when people
10103840	10109440	are experiencing, you know, increased meaning crisis. And don't forget, the Weimar Republic is like,
10110240	10115440	a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels. Everybody's suffering domicite. Everybody's
10115440	10120960	home and way of life and identity and culture and relationship to religion and science. All of that,
10121920	10130240	right? And so Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism, again, twisted, perverted.
10130240	10137440	I'm not saying all nots, I'm not, not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis, but there is this Gnostic
10137440	10144000	mythology, mythos, and it comes to the fore. I remember, and this stuck with me,
10144720	10151360	undergrad, I was taking political science, and the professor extended lecture on this,
10151360	10156240	and it still rings true for me, says, if you understand Nazism as just a political movement,
10156240	10164640	you have misunderstood it. It is much more a religious phenomena in many ways.
10164640	10172640	Is it religious in that the loss of religion? So is it a meaning crisis? Or is it out of a
10172640	10178480	meaning crisis, every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of...
10179200	10182880	I think it's the latter. I think there's this vacuum created.
10183520	10188240	In that context is Hitler, the central religious figure.
10188240	10188800	Yes.
10188800	10196880	And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler, or did Hitler create Nazi Germany? So in this
10196880	10201920	distributed cognition, where everyone's having a dialogue, what's the role of the charismatic
10201920	10210160	leader? Is it an emergent phenomena, or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace?
10210160	10215760	I hope it's not a necessary requirement. I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha,
10215760	10220640	rather than a specific individual. But I think in that situation,
10221600	10228240	Hitler's charisma allowed him to take on a mythological, in the proper sense, archetypal.
10229200	10233760	He became deeply symbolic, and he instituted all kinds of rituals,
10234400	10241520	all kinds of rituals, and all kinds of mythos. There's all this mythos about the master race,
10241520	10246880	and there's all these rituals. The swastika is, of course, itself a religious symbol.
10247600	10257840	There's all of this going on because he was tapping into the fact that when you put people
10257840	10264720	into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity, they will fall back on more and more mythological ways
10264720	10271120	of thinking in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new meaning-making,
10271120	10274000	I should say, meaning-participating behavior.
10276000	10280560	What is evil? Is this a word you avoid?
10281120	10291520	No, I don't, because I think part of what we're wrestling with here is resisting the enlightenment,
10291520	10298320	I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced to
10298320	10307840	immorality, individual human immorality. I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin than
10307840	10315840	just immoral. I think sin is a much more comprehensive category. I think sin is a failure to love
10315840	10323200	wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry. You take something as ultimate,
10323200	10333280	which is not, and that can tend to constolate these collective agents, I call them hyperagents,
10333280	10340960	within distributed cognition, that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due
10340960	10349040	to a sum total of immoral decisions. This goes to Hannah Arendt's thing, and the banality of
10349040	10354480	Eichmann, and she was really wrestling with it. I think she's close to something, but I think she's
10354480	10359840	slightly off. Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral decisions, but it doesn't seem to
10359840	10367280	capture the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide and the warfare. She's right,
10367280	10373680	because you're not going to get just the summation of a lot of individual, rather banal, immoral choices
10373680	10381040	adding up to what was going on. You're getting a comprehensive parasitic process within massive
10381040	10388480	distributed cognition that has the power to confront the world and confront aspects of the
10388480	10393760	world that individuals can't. I think when we're talking about evil, that's what we're trying to
10393760	10398960	point to. This is a point of convergence between me and Jonathan Peugeot. We've been talking about
10398960	10404960	this. The word sin is interesting. Are you comfortable using the word sin? Because it's so
10404960	10410880	deeply rooted in the religious text. It is. In part, and I struggle around this
10411760	10418080	because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian, and so that is still there within
10418080	10424960	me. There's trauma associated with that. Probably layers of self-deception mechanisms.
10425760	10432800	No doubt. No doubt. You're slowly escaping. Trying to, and trying to come into a proper,
10432800	10440000	respectful relationship with Christianity via a detour through Buddhism, Taoism,
10440000	10444080	and pagan Neoplatonism. Trying to find a way how to love wisely.
10444080	10454160	Yes, exactly. I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something
10454160	10460640	that we would prototypically call immoral, but if they're failing to love wisely,
10461200	10469520	they are disconnecting themselves in some important way from the structures of reality.
10472880	10478560	I think it was Hume. I may be wrong. Hume says, people don't do things because they think it's
10478560	10484560	wrong. They do a lesser good in place of a greater good. That's a different thing than
10484560	10489280	being immoral. We're saying, you're doing something that's wrong. It's like, well, no, no.
10490640	10496080	I'm loving my wife. That's a great thing, isn't it? But if you love your wife at the expense of
10496080	10504560	your kids, maybe something's going awry here. Well, I love my country. Great. But should you
10504560	10511520	love your country at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong to? People should
10511520	10516560	wrestle with these questions, and I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions
10517120	10521600	properly. To be content with the choices you've made without considering,
10523840	10529440	is there a greater good that could be done? Your lecture series on the meaning crisis
10530560	10536000	puts us in dialogue in the same way as with the podcast, with a bunch of fascinating
10536000	10543120	thinkers throughout history, Heidegger, Corbyn, the man Carl Jung, Tillage, Barfield.
10543440	10549360	Is there, can you describe, this might be challenging, but one powerful idea from each
10550000	10560000	that jumps the mind, maybe Heidegger. So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had
10560000	10565440	a huge influence on me. He's had a huge influence on me in many ways. He's a big influence on what's
10565440	10570160	called 4e cognitive science. And this whole idea about the non-propositional, that was deeply
10571120	10576800	afforded by Heidegger and Marla Ponti. But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one,
10576800	10583120	is his critique of ontotheology, his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a
10583120	10588720	supreme being, something like that, and how that gets us fundamentally messed up, and we get
10588720	10594000	disconnected from being because we are over focused on particular beings. We're failing to love
10594000	10599680	wisely. We're loving the individual things, and we're not loving the ground from which they spring.
10600160	10603760	Can you explain that a little more? What's the difference between the being and the supreme
10603760	10608400	being and why that gets us into trouble? Okay. So like, well, we talked about this before,
10608400	10613920	the supreme being is a particular being, whereas being is no thing. It's not any particular kind
10613920	10620160	of thing. And so if you're thinking of being as a being, you're thinking of it in a thingy way
10620160	10626000	about something that is fundamentally no thingness. And so then you're disconnecting yourself from
10626000	10632400	presumably ultimate reality. This takes me to Tillich. Tillich's great idea is understanding
10632400	10639520	faith as ultimate concern rather than a set of propositions that you're asserting.
10640320	10648960	So what are you ultimately concerned about? What do you want to be in right relationship to?
10648960	10656240	Ratio relicchio? And is that ultimate? Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?
10656240	10662960	Are those two things in sync? This has had a profound influence on me, and I think it's a
10662960	10670320	brilliant idea. So some of the others, how do they integrate? Maybe the second, so they're
10670320	10678240	called Young and Freud. Which team are you on? I'm on Young. Freud is the better writer.
10678960	10684560	But Young has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer to where cognitive science is heading.
10685760	10689120	He's more prescient. Which aspect of his model is the psyche?
10689120	10693440	Directly. So Freud has a hydraulic model. The psyche is like a steam engine. Things are under
10693440	10698800	pressure, and there's a fluid that's moving around. It's like, shh, like this is a record
10698800	10704720	noted this. Young has an organic model. The psyche is like a living being. It's doing all this
10704720	10711520	opponent processing. It's doing all of this self-transcending and growing. And I think that's
10711520	10716880	a much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model.
10716880	10721840	What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind? What do you think their
10721840	10730000	view and your own view of what's going on there in the shadow? So all that stuff, some good stuff?
10730960	10738800	Any stuff at all? Well, I mean, both Freud and Young are only talking about the psychodynamic
10738800	10743120	unconscious, which is only a small part of the unconscious. Can you elaborate?
10744960	10750480	They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do with your
10751360	10756800	sort of ego development and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.
10757680	10761840	Yeah, but what else is there? There's the unconscious that allows you to turn the
10761840	10766720	noise coming out of my face hole into ideas. Also, there's the unconscious that's, yeah.
10767600	10773520	All that stuff, which is huge and powerful. And they didn't think about that. They're focused
10773520	10778320	on the big romantic stuff that you have to deal with through psychotherapy, that kind of stuff.
10778320	10781440	Which is relevant and important. I'm not dismissing. I'm not saying it doesn't exist,
10781440	10786000	but it's certainly not all of the unconscious. A lot of work that's going on,
10786000	10791840	my colleague and deep friend, Anderson Todd, is about, can we take the Jungian stuff
10791840	10795200	and the cognitive science stuff and can we integrate it together theoretically?
10795200	10797920	And so he's working on that, exactly that project.
10799040	10802160	But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.
10802160	10807040	Or at least an unconscious. I like the term unconscious. And Young continually reminded
10807040	10811840	people that the unconscious is unconscious, that we're not conscious of it. And that's
10811840	10820160	its fundamental property. Yeah. And then isn't the task of therapy then to make the unconscious
10820160	10829040	conscious? Yeah, to a degree, right? But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there
10829040	10836400	was unconscious is part of Young's mythos. But it's also not the thought that that can be completed.
10836400	10841840	Part of the why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind is that so it can enter into
10841840	10848880	more proper dialogical relationship with the self-organizing system of the unconscious mind.
10848880	10855840	What do they have to say about the motivations of humans? So, for Freud joking, I said,
10855840	10862640	sex, there's so much of our mind is developing our young age, sexual interactions with the world
10862720	10869760	or whatever. Hence, the thing about the edible complex and all, I wanted to have sex with your
10869760	10876720	mother. What do you think about their description about what motivates humans? And what do you
10876720	10885200	think about the will to power from Nietzsche? Which camp are you in there? What motivates humans?
10885920	10893760	Sex or power? I think Plato's right. And I think there's a connection for me. Plato's my first
10893760	10897440	philosopher. Young's my first psychologist. And Young is very much the Plato of the psyche.
10897440	10902640	You never forget your first. Yeah, you never do. You never do. And I think we have,
10904320	10911600	I reject the monological mind. I reject the monophasic mind model. I think we are multi-centered.
10911680	10916480	I think we have different centers of motivation that operate according to different principles
10917120	10925760	to satisfy different problems. And that part of the task of our humanity is to get those
10925760	10934560	different centers into some internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating rather than
10934560	10943200	in conflict with each other. What advice would you give to young people? Today, they're in high
10943200	10946640	school trying to figure out what they're going to do with their life. Maybe they're in college.
10947840	10952720	What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they
10952720	10966640	can be proud of? So the first thing is find an ecology of practices and a community that supports
10966640	10972800	them without involving you in believing things that contravene our best understood science
10974000	10981200	so that wisdom and virtue, especially how they show up in relationships, are primary to you.
10981840	10989680	This will sound ridiculous, but if you take care of that, the other things you want are more
10989680	10997760	likely to occur because what you most want is you, what you want at when you're approaching your death
10998800	11006240	is what were the relationships you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world. And
11006240	11012640	what did you do to improve the chance of them being deep and profound relationships?
11013280	11018720	That's an interesting ecology of practice. Finding a place where a lot of people are doing
11018720	11024640	different things that are interesting, interplay with each other, but at the same time is not a
11024640	11035920	cult where ideas can flourish. Now, how the hell do you know? In a place where people are really
11035920	11042000	excited about doing stuff, that's very ripe for cult formation. Especially if they're a wash
11042000	11049120	in a culture in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit. Yes, precisely. Try to keep
11049120	11055200	away from the bullshit is the advice. I take this very seriously and I was with a bunch of
11055200	11060960	people in Vermont at the respond retreat, people, Rafe Kelly was there, a bunch of people who have
11060960	11070400	set up colleges of practices and created communities. And I have good reason to find all of these
11070400	11076800	people trustworthy. And so we gather together to try and generate real diologos, flow in distributed
11076800	11084720	cognition, exercise the collective intelligence and try and address that problem, both in terms of
11085680	11090960	you know, meta-curriculum that we can offer emerging communities in terms of practices of
11090960	11097040	vetting, how we will self-govern the federation we're forming so that we can resist gurification.
11098080	11103680	Gurification of people or ideas. Both. Yeah. Both. Some of us just get unlucky. Some of us get
11103680	11111520	unlucky and we all at respond, we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around this,
11112400	11118000	but we were trying to balance it about not being premature, but there it was going to,
11118000	11122480	I mean, there's, we're going to produce a meta-curriculum that's coming in months. There's
11122480	11127920	going to be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on wisdom with this practitioner
11127920	11134800	based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom. There's going to be projects about how we can
11134800	11141840	create a self-correcting vetted vetting system. So we can say to people, we think this ecology
11141840	11147600	is legit. It's in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies. We don't know about that
11147600	11152720	one. We're hesitant about that one. It's not in good fellowship. We have concerns. Here's why we
11152720	11158320	have our concerns, et cetera. And you may say, well, who are you to do that? It's like nobody,
11158320	11162480	but somebody's got to do it, right? And that's what it comes down to. And so we're going to give it
11162480	11172560	our best effort. It's worth a try. You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization,
11172560	11179840	but in your own personal life, what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind?
11180400	11187040	Has there been difficult times in your life where you really struggled? Yes. So when I left,
11188000	11195760	I was left fundamentalist Christianity. And for a while, I was just sort of a hard-bitten atheist.
11198240	11205680	The problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn't deal with all the non-propositional
11205680	11211680	things that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits and all the perspectives and all the
11211680	11218560	identities and the trauma associated with that. So I required therapy. It required years of
11218560	11226080	meditation and Tai Chi. And I'm still wrestling with it. But for the first four or five years,
11229760	11234160	I described it like this. I called it the black burning. I felt like there was a
11235200	11241280	blackness that was on fire inside of me, precisely because the religion had left a taste
11241280	11247200	for the transcendent in my mouth, but the food it had given me, food in square quotes had soured
11247200	11253280	in my stomach and made me nauseous. And the juxtaposition of those seemed like an
11253280	11261440	irresolvable problem for me. That was a very, very dark time for me. Did it feel lonely?
11261440	11267520	When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely. And deeply alienating,
11268480	11274560	the universe seemed absurd. And there was also existential anxiety. I talk about these things
11274560	11278640	for a reason. I don't just talk about them as things I'm pointing to. I'm talking about them
11278640	11287760	as seeing in myself and in people I care, having undergone them and how they can bring you close
11287760	11293280	to self-destructive. I started engaging in kinds of self-destructive behavior.
11293360	11300480	So the meaning crisis to you is not just the thing you look outside and see many people
11300480	11307040	struggling. You yourself have struggled. That's, in fact, the narrative is I struggled with it,
11307040	11313680	thinking it was a purely personal, idiosyncratic thing. I started learning the kogsai. I started
11313680	11318320	doing the tai chi and the meditation. I started doing all this, right? Socratic philosophy.
11319040	11326800	And when I started to talk about these pieces, I saw my students' eyes light up. And I realized,
11326800	11334400	oh, wait, maybe this isn't just something I'm going through. And then talking to them and
11334400	11341520	then doing the research and expanding it out. It's like, oh, many people in a shared fashion
11341520	11345680	and also in an individual lonely fashion are going through a meaning crisis.
11346400	11352240	Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning. And you said that the goal is to love wisely.
11352240	11357040	So let me ask about love. What's the role of love in the human condition?
11357840	11365600	It's central. I mean, it's even central to reason and rationality. This is Plato, but Spinoza,
11366240	11373200	the most logical of the rationalists. The ethics is written like Euclid's geometry.
11373280	11378960	But he calls it the ethics for a reason because he wants to talk about the blessed life. And what
11378960	11387280	does he say? He says that ultimately, reason needs love because love is what brings reason out of
11387280	11394720	being entrapped in the gravity well of egocentrism. And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really
11394720	11399440	beautifully, love is when you painfully realize that something other than yourself is real.
11400320	11408560	Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism. Beautifully put, a beautiful way to end it,
11408560	11413200	John. You're a beautiful human being. Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the
11414880	11421200	search for meaning and encouraging others to do the same. And ultimately, to learn how to love
11421200	11425600	wisely. Thank you so much for talking today. It's been a great pleasure, Lex. I really enjoyed it
11425600	11430960	a lot. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Rovecchi. To support
11430960	11435520	this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you
11435520	11441440	with some words from Herman Hessay and Siddhartha. I've always believed, and I still believe, that
11441440	11446960	whatever good or bad fortune may come our way, we can always give it meaning and transform it
11446960	11452160	into something of value. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
