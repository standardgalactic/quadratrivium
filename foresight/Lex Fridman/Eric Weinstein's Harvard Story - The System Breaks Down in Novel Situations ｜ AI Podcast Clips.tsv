0	11120	Without naming names, can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at Harvard?
11120	16040	Maybe in a way that tells the bigger story of the struggle of young, bright minds that
16040	23340	are trying to come up with big, bold ideas within the institutions that we're talking
23340	24340	about?
24340	26840	You can start.
27160	40900	In part, it starts with coffee with a couple of Croatians in the math department at MIT.
40900	48560	We used to talk about music and dance and math and physics and love and all this kind
48560	54800	of stuff as Eastern Europeans love to and I ate it up.
54800	60820	My friend, Gordana, who was an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduate
60820	66840	student at Harvard, said to me, I'm probably going to do a bad version of her accent.
66840	67840	Here we go.
67840	74000	Eric, will I see you tomorrow at the secret seminar?
74000	76600	And I said, what secret seminar?
76600	79120	Eric, don't joke.
79120	83840	I said, I'm not used to this style of humor, Gordana.
84800	94000	The secret seminar that your advisor is running, I said, what are you talking about?
94000	96960	Your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect.
96960	101000	I think it was like the churned Simon's invariant.
101000	105640	Not sure what the topic was again, but she gave me the room number and the time and she
105640	107320	was like not cracking a smile.
107320	110880	I've never known her to make this kind of a joke and I thought this was crazy and I
110880	112680	was trying to have an advisor.
112680	117560	I didn't want an advisor, but people said you have to have one, so I took one.
117560	123520	And I went to this room like 15 minutes early and there was not a soul inside it.
123520	129520	It was outside of the math department and it was still in the same building, the Science
129520	131840	Center at Harvard.
131840	136040	And I sat there and I let five minutes go by, I let seven minutes go by, 10 minutes
136040	137040	go by, there's nobody.
137040	140480	I thought, okay, so this was all an elaborate joke.
141240	147280	And then like three minutes to the hour, this graduate student walks in and like sees me
147280	149200	and does a double take.
149200	155960	And then I start to see the professors in geometry and topology start to file in.
155960	161640	And everybody's like very disconcerted that I'm in this room.
161640	168960	And finally, the person who was supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and
168960	173440	sees me and goes, why does it ghost?
173440	181040	And I realized that the secret seminar is true, that the department is conducting a
181040	186680	secret seminar on the exact topic that I'm interested in, not telling me about it.
186680	192000	And that these are the reindeer games that the Rudolphs of the department are not invited
192000	193440	to.
193440	196400	And so then I realized, okay, I did not understand it.
196400	200160	There's a parallel department.
200160	211200	And that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which I came to understand that
211200	223360	the game that I had been sold about publication, about blind refereeing, about openness and
223360	228800	public transmission of information was all a lie.
228800	235200	I came to understand that at the very top, there's a second system that's about closed
235200	244320	meetings and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest
244320	246600	of us don't understand.
246600	251600	And that in large measure, that is the thing that I won't submit to.
251640	256040	And so when you ask me questions like, well, why wouldn't you feel good about talking to
256040	257040	your critics?
257040	258040	Or why wouldn't you feel...
258040	259800	The answer is, oh, you don't know.
259800	265600	If you stay in a nice hotel, you don't realize that there is an entire second structure inside
265600	272640	of that hotel where there's usually a workers' cafe in a resort complex that isn't available
272640	274480	to the people who are staying in the hotel.
274480	282560	And then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are parallel structures.
282560	287160	So that's what I found, which was, in essence, just the way you can stay hotels your whole
287160	291520	life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're not
291520	293800	supposed to see as the guest.
293800	299160	There is a second structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respect
299160	304240	to how people get dinged, how people get their grants taken away, how this person comes
304240	308160	to have that thing named after them.
308160	315520	And by pretending that we're not running a parallel structure, I have no patience for
315520	316920	that anymore.
316920	322960	So I got a chance to see how the game, how hardball is really played at Harvard.
322960	330400	And I'm now eager to play hardball back with the same people who played hardball with me.
330400	333160	Let me ask two questions on this.
333160	341080	So one, do you think it's possible, I call those people assholes, that's the technical
341080	342080	term.
342080	347080	Do you think it's possible that that's just not the entire system, but a part of the
347080	348080	system?
348080	354400	Sort of that there's, you can navigate, you can swim in the waters and find the groups
354400	357200	of people who do aspire to open this.
357200	364280	The guy who rescued my PhD was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar.
364280	368760	Right, but are there people outside of this?
368760	369760	Is he an asshole?
369760	375120	Well, yes, I was, it was a bad, no, but I'm trying to make this point, which is this isn't
375120	378640	my failure to correctly map these people.
378640	379640	It's yours.
379640	383720	You have a simplification that isn't going to work.
383720	390120	I think, okay, as long as it was the wrong term, I would say lacking of character and...
390120	393160	What would you have had these people do?
393160	394280	Why did they do this?
394280	396680	Why have a secret seminar?
396680	400440	I don't understand the exact dynamics of a secret seminar, but I think the right thing
400440	405080	to do is to, I mean, to see individuals like you.
405080	410560	There might be a reason to have a secret seminar, but they should detect that an individual
410560	415960	like you, a brilliant mind who's thinking about certain ideas could be damaged by this.
415960	418440	I don't think that they see it that way.
418440	423200	The idea is we're going to sneak food to the children we want to survive.
423200	427360	Yeah, so that's highly problematic, and there should be people within that room.
427360	432360	But I'm trying to say, this is the thing, the ball that can't is thrown, but won't be caught.
432360	441000	The problem is they know that most of their children won't survive, and they can't say
441000	442000	that.
442000	443000	I see.
443000	445120	Sorry to interrupt.
445120	451000	You mean that the fact that the whole system is underfunded, that they naturally have to
451000	452800	pick favorites?
452800	459500	They live in a world which reached steady state of some level, let's say, in the early
459900	461400	70s.
461400	468300	In that world, before that time, you have a professor like Norman Steenrod, and you'd
468300	472500	have 20 children that is graduate students, and all of them would go on to be professors,
472500	475700	and all of them would want to have 20 children.
475700	481660	You start taking higher and higher powers of 20, and you see that the system could not,
481660	485260	it's not just about money, the system couldn't survive.
485260	491620	The way it's supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhD
491620	499620	programs, and we should let the small number of truly top places populate mostly teaching
499620	503620	and research departments that aren't PhD producing.
503620	507500	We don't want to do that because we use PhD students as a labor force.
507500	513420	The whole thing has to do with growth, resources, dishonesty.
513700	520500	In that world, you see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world, the key question is where
520500	525700	are we going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out?
525700	531020	My problem was I wasn't interested in dying.
531020	537020	You clearly highlight that there's aspects of the system that are broken, but as an individual,
537020	543220	is your role to exit the system or just acknowledge that it's a game and win it?
543220	548180	My role is to survive and thrive in the public eye.
548180	556100	In other words, when you have an escapee of the system, like yourself, such as, and that
556100	558740	person says, you know, I wasn't exactly finished.
558740	561020	Let me show you a bunch of stuff.
561020	566140	Let me show you that the theory of telomeres never got reported properly.
566140	571860	Let me show you that all of marginal economics is supposed to be redone with a different
571860	573580	version of the differential calculus.
573580	577980	Let me show you that you didn't understand the self-dual Yang-Mills equations correctly
577980	586140	in topology and physics because they're in fact much more broadly found and it's only
586140	588900	the mutations that happen in special dimensions.
588900	594900	There are lots of things to say, but this particular group of people, like if you just
594900	600580	take, where are all the Gen X and Millennial University presidents?
601300	601820	Right.
601820	602300	Okay.
602300	606740	They're all in a holding pattern.
606740	615860	Now, why in the story of telomeres was it an older professor and a younger graduate student?
615860	620460	It's this issue of what would be called interference competition.
620460	625980	So, for example, orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blowholes so that
625980	630100	they suffocate because the needed resource is air.
630140	630500	Okay.
630500	632100	Well, what do the universities do?
632140	638460	They try to make sure that you can't be viable, that you need them, that you need their grants.
638540	646060	You need to be zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the
646060	647380	locals love to play.
648180	650660	Well, my point is, okay, what's the cost of this?
651060	655460	How many people died as a result of these interference competition games?
656300	660820	You know, when you take somebody like Douglas Prasher who did green fluorescent protein and
660820	663260	he drives a shuttle bus, right?
663260	666860	Because his grant runs out and he has to give away all of his research and all of that
666860	670980	research gets a Nobel Prize and he gets to drive a shuttle bus for $35,000 a year.
671260	672260	What do you mean by died?
672260	674700	Do you mean their career, their dreams, their passions?
674700	679020	Yeah, the whole, as an academic, Doug Prasher was dead for a long period of time.
679860	689180	Okay, so as a person who's escaped the system, can't you at this, because you also have in
689180	695100	your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be useful, maybe not?
695420	695940	Let's hope.
696820	701420	Can't you also play the game enough, like with the children?
701620	708180	So like publish and but also if you told me that this would work, really what I want to do,
708260	715140	you see, is I would love to revolutionize a field with an H index of zero.
718380	722900	Like we have these proxies that count how many papers you've written, how cited are the papers
722900	723420	you've written.
724540	725740	All this is nonsense.
726180	726860	That's interesting.
727180	729260	Sorry, what do you mean by a field with an H index?
729260	732700	So totally new field H index is count somehow.
732700	735060	How many papers have you gotten that get so many citations?
735060	735260	Yeah.
736260	738220	Let's say H index undefined.
740300	747980	Like for example, I don't have an advisor for my PhD, but I have to have an advisor as
747980	755660	far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks who advised whom down the line.
757140	760300	So I am my own advisor, which sets up a loop, right?
760580	762300	How many students do I have an infinite number?
762500	765980	Your descendants, they don't want to have that story.
766220	771020	So I have to be, I have to have formal advisor, Raoul bot, and my Wikipedia entry, for example,
771020	773580	says that I was advised by Raoul bot, which is not true.
775100	780220	So you get fit into a system that says, well, we have to know what your H index is.
780220	784860	We have to know, you know, where are you a professor if you want to apply for a grant?
784860	786380	It makes all of these assumptions.
787260	791260	What I'm trying to do is in part to show all of this is nonsense.
791340	794380	This is proxy BS that came up in the institutional setting.
794940	799660	And right now, it's important for those of us who are still vital, like Elon, it would
799660	804220	be great to have Elon as a professor of physics and engineering, right?
804220	811980	It seems ridiculous to say, but just as a shot in the arm, you know, like, it'd be
811980	816940	great to have Elon at Caltech, even one day a week, one day a month.
817180	817900	One day a month.
819580	821260	Okay, well, why can't we be in there?
821260	822140	It's the same reason.
822140	823820	Well, why can't you be on the view?
823820	825260	Why can't you be on Bill Martin?
825260	828060	We need to know what you're going to do before we take you on the show.
828060	828700	On the show.
828700	830140	Well, I don't want to tell you what I'm going to do.
831100	834860	Do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit?
834860	836300	I can dance the dance fun.
836300	837100	To be on the view.
837100	837660	Oh, come on.
838380	838940	So you can.
838940	839500	Yeah, you do.
839500	840140	You're not, you're not.
840140	841180	I can do that fine.
841180	844220	Here's where it's, the place that it goes south is,
845180	849580	there's like a set of questions that get you into this more adversarial stuff.
849580	853500	And you've in fact asked some of those more adversarial questions this setting.
854460	857180	And they're not things that are necessarily aggressive, but they're
857180	859100	things that are making assumptions.
860140	860540	Right.
860540	860860	Right.
860860	864220	Well, so when you make, I have a question, it's like, you know, Lex,
864220	865420	are you avoiding your critics?
867020	869580	You know, it's just like, okay, well, why did you frame that that way?
869580	873740	Or the next question would be like, do you think that you should have a
874060	877100	special exemption and that you should have the right to break rules and everyone else
877100	877900	should have to follow them?
878460	880540	Like that question I find innervating.
880540	880860	Yeah.
880860	882780	It doesn't really come out of anything meaningful.
882780	885900	It's just like, we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other person
885900	888700	to show that we're not captured by their madness.
888700	890700	That's not the real question you want to ask me.
890700	893100	If you want to get really excited about this, you want to ask,
893740	895020	do you think this thing is right?
896060	896700	Yeah.
896700	897500	Weirdly, I do.
898060	900620	Do you think that it's going to be immediately seen to be right?
900620	901100	I don't.
901100	904780	I think it's going to, it's going to have an interesting fight and it's going to have
904780	906460	an interesting evolution.
906460	910140	And well, what do you hope to do with it in non-physical terms?
910140	917020	Oh, gosh, I hope it revolutionizes our relationship of, well, with people outside
917020	920540	of the institutional framework and it reinflicts us into the institutional
920540	924620	framework where we can do the most good to bring the institutions back to health.
925820	928940	You know, it's like, these are positive uplifting questions.
928940	933900	If you had Frank Wilczek, you wouldn't say, Frank, let's be honest,
933900	939580	you have done very little with your life after the original huge show that you used to break
939580	940460	under the physics scene.
940460	945340	Like, we weirdly ask people different questions based upon how they sit down.
945340	946860	Yeah, that's very strange, right?
946860	954620	But you have to understand that, so here's the thing, I get these days a large number
954700	959260	of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory of everything for AGI.
960540	970940	And I use my own radar, BS radar, to detect unfairly, perhaps, whether they're full of
970940	971500	shit or not.
973580	975420	I love where you're going with this, by the way.
975980	984940	And my concern, I often think about, is there's elements of brilliance in what people write
984940	991900	to me and I'm trying to, right now, as you made it clear, the kind of judgments and
991900	998780	assumptions we make, how am I supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system
998780	1004620	and think about what you're doing, because my radar is saying you're not full of shit.
1005980	1008540	But I'm also not completely outside of the system.
1008540	1009100	That's right.
1009100	1010940	You've danced beautifully.
1010940	1016620	You've actually got all the credibility that you're supposed to get, all the nice little
1016620	1021340	stamps of approval, not all, but a large enough amount.
1023580	1032220	I mean, it's hard to put into words exactly why you sound, whether your theory turns out to
1032220	1036940	be good or not, you sound like a special human being.
1037660	1038380	I appreciate that.
1038380	1038940	And thank you very much for this.
1038940	1039740	In a good way.
1039740	1040140	No, no, no.
1040780	1045180	So, but what am I supposed to do with that flood of emails from AGI folks?
1045180	1046380	Why do I sound different?
1047180	1047660	I don't know.
1048540	1050140	And I would like to systemize that.
1050140	1050620	I don't know.
1051820	1058460	Look, when you're talking to people, you very quickly can surmise.
1059340	1060860	Am I claiming to be a physicist?
1060860	1062060	No, I say it every turn.
1062060	1064380	I'm not a physicist, right?
1065180	1068860	When I say, when you say something about bundles, you say, well, can you explain it differently?
1068860	1074780	And I, you know, I'm pushing around on this, this area, that lever over there.
1075500	1079500	I'm trying to find something that we can play with and engage.
1080380	1083980	And, you know, another thing is, is that I'll say something at scale.
1084860	1089180	So if I was saying completely wrong things about bundles on the Joe Rogan program,
1089180	1092300	you don't think that we wouldn't hear a crushing chorus?
1092300	1093020	Yes.
1093020	1095740	And, you know, same thing with geometric unity.
1095740	1100620	So I put up this, this video from this Oxford lecture.
1100620	1102540	I understand that it's not a standard lecture,
1104060	1108860	but you haven't heard, you know, the most brilliant people in the field say,
1108860	1110460	well, this is obviously nonsense.
1111340	1112380	They don't know what to make of it.
1114460	1117020	And they're going to hide behind, well, he hasn't said enough details.
1117020	1118140	Where's the paper?
1118140	1118860	Where's the paper?
1118940	1121020	I've seen the criticism.
1121020	1122380	I've gotten the same kind of criticism.
1122380	1127420	I've published a few things and like, especially stuff related to Tesla,
1128620	1130540	that we did studies on Tesla vehicles.
1130540	1135260	And the kind of criticism I've gotten was showed that they're completely...
1135260	1135740	Oh, right.
1135740	1140220	Like the guy who had Elon Musk on his program twice is going to give us an accurate assessment.
1140220	1141100	Yeah, exactly.
1141100	1141740	Exactly.
1141740	1143420	It's just very low level.
1143420	1147740	Like without actually ever addressing the content.
1148860	1156300	You know, Lex, I think that in part you're trying to solve a puzzle that isn't really your puzzle.
1156300	1157980	I think you know that I'm sincere.
1157980	1160460	You don't know whether the theory is going to work or not.
1161180	1164700	And you know that it's not coming out of somebody who's coming out of left field.
1165260	1166700	Like the story makes sense.
1166700	1172700	There's enough that's new and creative and different in other aspects where you can check me
1173660	1178940	that your real concern is, are you really telling me that when you start breaking the rules,
1178940	1183340	you see the system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive?
1183340	1184140	And the answer is yes.
1185500	1190620	And I had to break the rules in part because of learning issues because I came into this field,
1190620	1193900	you know, with a totally different set of attributes.
1193900	1196620	My profile just doesn't look like anybody else's remotely.
1197500	1203260	But as a result, what that did is it showed me what is the system true to its own ideals?
1203260	1205500	Or does it just follow these weird procedures?
1205500	1209980	And then when you take it off the rails, it behaves terribly.
1209980	1214700	And that's really what my story, I think, does is it just says, well,
1214700	1219980	he completely takes the system into new territory where it's not expecting to have to deal with
1219980	1222380	somebody with these confusing sets of attributes.
1222380	1226780	And I think what he's telling us is he believes it behaves terribly.
1226780	1232940	Now, if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests and, you know,
1232940	1236780	a winner of math competitions and you put them in a PhD program,
1237740	1239020	they're probably going to be okay.
1240300	1248140	I'm not saying that the system, you know, breaks down for everybody under all circumstances.
1248220	1251740	I'm saying when you present the system with a novel situation,
1252460	1257260	at the moment, it will almost certainly break down with probability approaching 100%.
1259500	1266780	But to me, the painful and the tragic thing is it sorry to bring out my motherly instinct,
1267340	1268860	but it feels like it's too much.
1269580	1272620	It could be too much of a burden to exist outside the system.
1272620	1274540	Maybe, bi psychologically.
1274540	1282220	First of all, I've got a podcast that I kind of like and I've got amazing friends.
1282220	1286380	I have a life which has more interesting people passing through it than I know what to do with.
1287180	1291500	And they haven't managed to kill me off yet, so so far so good.
