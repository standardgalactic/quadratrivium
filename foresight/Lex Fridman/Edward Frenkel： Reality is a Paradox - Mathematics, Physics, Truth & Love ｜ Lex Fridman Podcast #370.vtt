00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
There is a famous story about Einstein that he used to, you know, go think, think, think,

00:04.840 --> 00:07.480
and then go for a walk, and like he would whistle and sometimes.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.360
So I remember the first time I heard this story, I thought, how interesting is what

00:12.360 --> 00:14.840
the coincidence that he, this came to him when he was whistling.

00:15.400 --> 00:21.680
But in fact, it's not this is how it works in some sense that you have to prepare for it.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.440
But then the moment it happens when you stop thinking, actually, so the moment of

00:25.440 --> 00:33.400
discovery is the moment when thinking stops and you kind of, you kind of almost become

00:33.400 --> 00:35.600
that truth that you're seeking.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.400
The following is a conversation with Edward Frankel, one of the greatest living

00:42.400 --> 00:46.800
mathematicians doing research on the interface of mathematics and quantum

00:46.800 --> 00:52.520
physics with an emphasis on the Langland's program, which he describes as a grand

00:52.560 --> 00:54.240
unified theory of mathematics.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.480
He also is the author of love and math, the heart of hidden reality.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.000
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.040
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.840
And now, dear friends, here's Edward Frankel.

01:10.040 --> 01:15.760
You open your book, Love and Math, with a question, how does one become a mathematician?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.920
There are many ways that this can happen.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.120
Let me tell you how it happened to me.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.760
So how did it happen to you?

01:22.360 --> 01:25.040
So first of all, I grew up in the Soviet Union.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.120
In a small town near Moscow called Kolomna.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.800
And I was a smart kid, you know, a school, but mathematics was probably my least

01:37.800 --> 01:40.880
favorite subject, not because I couldn't do it.

01:40.960 --> 01:46.360
I was, you know, a straight A student and I could do all the problems easily.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.640
But I thought it was incredibly boring.

01:49.640 --> 01:57.680
And since the only math I knew was what was presented at school, I thought that was it.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.520
And I was like, what kind of boring subject is this?

02:01.240 --> 02:05.440
So what I really liked was physics and especially quantum physics.

02:05.560 --> 02:13.560
So I was buying, I would go to a bookstore and buy popular books about elementary

02:13.880 --> 02:20.640
particles and atoms and things like that and read them, you know, devour them.

02:21.920 --> 02:28.480
And so I thought my dream was to become a theoretical physicist and to delve into

02:28.480 --> 02:30.880
this finer structure of the universe, you know.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.960
So then something happened when I was 15 years old.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.680
It turns out that a friend of my parents was a mathematician who was a professor

02:41.720 --> 02:45.640
at the local college, it was a small college preparing educators and teachers.

02:46.480 --> 02:51.160
It's a provincial town, imagine it's like 117 kilometers from Moscow, which

02:51.160 --> 02:52.760
would be something like 70 miles, I guess.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.080
You do the math.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.080
I like how you remember the number exactly.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.520
Yeah, it's not funny how we remember numbers.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.960
So his name was Yevgeny Yevgenyovich Petrov.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.920
And if this doesn't remind you of the great works of Russian literature that you

03:09.920 --> 03:10.600
haven't read them.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.880
Like War and Peace, you know, like with the patronymic names.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.200
But this was all real.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
This was all happening.

03:17.760 --> 03:23.040
So my mom, one day, by chance, met Yevgeny Yevgenyovich and told him about me,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.280
that I was a bright kid and interested in physics.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.800
And he said, oh, I want to meet him.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.920
I'm going to convert him into math.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.040
And my mom was like, nah, math, he doesn't like mathematics.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.440
So they said, OK, let's let's see what they can do.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.640
So I went to see him.

03:41.640 --> 03:47.640
So I'm about 15 and a bit, a bit arrogant, I would say, you know, like every

03:47.640 --> 03:48.360
teenager.

03:49.360 --> 03:58.080
So he says to me, so I hear that you are interested in physics and elementary

03:58.080 --> 03:58.640
particles.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.720
I was like, yeah, sure.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.960
And so, for example, do you know about quarks?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.240
And I said, yes, of course, I know about quarks.

04:06.760 --> 04:13.560
Quarks are the, you know, constituents of particles like protons and neutrons.

04:13.560 --> 04:18.160
And it was one of the greatest discoveries in theoretical physics in the 60s.

04:18.160 --> 04:22.800
That those particles were not elementary, but in fact, had the smaller parts.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.800
And he said, oh, so then you probably know representation theory of the group

04:26.800 --> 04:30.560
as you three, like, as you worked.

04:31.400 --> 04:38.520
So in fact, I wanted to know what was, what were the underpinnings of those theories?

04:38.840 --> 04:40.640
I knew the story, I knew the narrative.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.520
I knew kind of this basic story of what these particles look like.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.360
But how did physicists come up with these ideas?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.080
How were they able to theorize them?

04:50.880 --> 04:53.120
And so I remember, you know, like it was yesterday.

04:53.120 --> 04:58.880
So he pulls out a book and it's kind of like like a Bible, you know, like a

04:58.880 --> 05:02.400
substantial book and he opens them, it's somewhere in the middle.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.280
And there I see the diagrams that I saw in popular books.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.840
But in popular books, there was no explanation.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.400
And now I see all these weird symbols and equations.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.880
It's clear that it is explained in there.

05:15.360 --> 05:21.080
Oh, my God, he said, you think what they teach you at school is mathematics.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.480
It's like, no, this is real mathematics.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.360
So I was instantly converted.

05:28.200 --> 05:33.880
That to understand the underpinnings of physical reality, you have to understand

05:33.880 --> 05:34.880
what SU3 is.

05:34.880 --> 05:41.640
You have to learn what are groups, what is group SU3, what are representations of

05:41.640 --> 05:45.360
SU3. There was a coherent and beautiful.

05:45.560 --> 05:50.560
I could appreciate the beauty even though I could not understand heads and tails of it.

05:50.720 --> 05:56.640
But you were drawn to the methodology, the machinery of how such understanding could

05:56.640 --> 05:57.640
be attained.

05:57.640 --> 06:03.440
Well, in retrospect, I think what I was really craving was a deeper understanding.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.280
And up to that point, the deepest that I could see was where there was diagrams.

06:08.280 --> 06:13.360
But for that story that, you know, a proton consists of three quarks and the neutron

06:13.360 --> 06:16.200
consists of three quarks and they're called up and down and so on.

06:17.120 --> 06:22.520
But I didn't know that there was actually underneath beneath the surface.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.320
There was this mathematical theory.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.360
If you can just link, what drew you to quantum mechanics?

06:29.400 --> 06:33.480
Is there some romantic notion of understanding the universe?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.280
Well, what is interesting to you?

06:35.280 --> 06:38.120
Is it the puzzle of it or is it like the philosophical thing?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.120
Now I am looking back.

06:40.240 --> 06:40.560
Yeah.

06:40.560 --> 06:51.160
So whatever I say about Edward at 15, yeah, he's colored by my, you know, all my

06:51.160 --> 06:53.400
experiences that happen in the meantime.

06:53.680 --> 06:58.720
I should say for the people who may not know you, I think your book and your

06:58.720 --> 07:02.760
presentations kind of revealed that that 15 year old is still in there somewhere.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.400
Well, some of the joy, he's probably still here now.

07:08.120 --> 07:08.960
Yeah, in some way.

07:10.440 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, I think it was a joy of discovery and the joy of going deeper into the kind

07:15.000 --> 07:21.280
of the, to the root, to the, so the deepest structures of the universe.

07:21.320 --> 07:26.960
So the secrets, the secrets, and we may not discover all of them.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.920
We may not be able to understand, but we're going to try and go as far and as deep as we can.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.560
I think that's what was the motivating factor in this.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.840
Yeah, there's this mystery.

07:38.840 --> 07:42.600
There's this dark room and there's a few of these mathematical physicists.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.760
They're able to shine a flashlight briefly into there.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.240
I would, we'll talk about it, but it also kind of makes me sad that there's so

07:52.240 --> 07:59.840
few of your kind that have the flashlight to look into the room.

08:00.960 --> 08:01.680
It's interesting.

08:02.960 --> 08:07.200
I don't think there are so few, to be honest, because I think I find a lot of

08:07.200 --> 08:09.160
people are actually interested.

08:09.520 --> 08:15.400
If you talk, if you talk to people, you know, like some people you wouldn't expect to be

08:15.440 --> 08:22.360
interested in this from all walks of life, from people of all kinds of professions.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.440
I tell them I'm a mathematician and they, I'm a mathematician.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.880
Okay, so that's a separate story.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.800
A lot of people, I think, have been traumatized by their experience in the math

08:30.800 --> 08:31.240
classes.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.080
We can talk about it later, but then they ask me what kind of research I do.

08:35.120 --> 08:42.160
And I mentioned that I work on the interface of math and quantum physics and their eyes

08:42.160 --> 08:45.320
light up and say, oh, quantum physics or like Einstein's relativity.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.520
Oh, I'm really curious about it.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.160
I watch this podcast or I watch that podcast, you know, and I've learned this.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.280
It's like, what do you think about that?

08:51.920 --> 08:58.000
So I actually find that actually physicists are doing a great job at educating the public,

08:58.000 --> 09:05.960
so to speak, and in terms of popular books and videos and so on.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.560
Mathematicians are behind, we're starting to catch up a little bit.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.760
I've been starting last 10 years, but we're still behind.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.920
But I think people are curious.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.760
Science is still a very much, you know, something that people want to learn because

09:21.760 --> 09:27.560
that's our kind of the best way we know to establish some sort of objective reality,

09:27.760 --> 09:28.720
whatever that might be.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.080
Yeah, and to figure out this whole puzzle, to figure out the secrets that the universe holds.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.200
Things that we can agree on, kind of, you know, like, even though for me, at this point,

09:37.200 --> 09:41.040
I always, you know, make an argument that our physical theories always change.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.000
They get updated.

09:42.080 --> 09:48.840
So you had Newton's theory of gravity, then Einstein's theory, you know, superseded it.

09:49.720 --> 09:53.240
But in mathematics, it seems that theories don't change.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.480
Pythagoras' theorem has been the same for the last 2,500 years.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.200
X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.680
We don't expect that next year suddenly it will be Z cubed, you know.

10:06.040 --> 10:13.480
So and so that, to me, is actually even more, hints even more at how much we are connected

10:13.480 --> 10:18.040
to each other because Pythagoras' theory, if you think about it, or any other mathematical

10:18.040 --> 10:24.760
theorem means the same thing to anyone in the world today, regardless of their cultural,

10:25.200 --> 10:31.920
you know, upbringing, religion, you know, ideas, ideology, gender, whatever,

10:32.880 --> 10:34.760
nationality, race, whatever, right?

10:35.080 --> 10:41.040
And it has meant the same to everyone, everywhere, and most likely will mean the same.

10:41.840 --> 10:49.800
So that's, to me, kind of an antidote to the kind of divisiveness that we sometimes

10:49.840 --> 10:53.600
observe these days, where it seems that we can't agree on anything.

10:55.040 --> 11:00.560
To the political complexity of 2 plus 2 equals 5 in George Orwell's 1984.

11:01.120 --> 11:07.000
I was in the Soviet Union in 1984, and so in many ways, I see that it was present,

11:07.200 --> 11:08.600
and the novel was present.

11:09.120 --> 11:14.360
But we still have not found a dictator who would actually say 2 plus 2 equals 5 and would

11:14.360 --> 11:17.000
demand their citizens to repeat that.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.000
The night is still young.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.360
Has not happened yet, okay?

11:20.560 --> 11:26.600
But those feel like math and physics are both sneaking up to a deep truth from slightly

11:26.600 --> 11:31.200
different angles, and you stand at the crossroads or at the intersection of the two.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.520
It's interesting to ask, what do you think is the difference between physics and

11:34.520 --> 11:37.880
mathematics in the way physics and mathematics look at the world?

11:39.040 --> 11:44.480
There is actually an essential difference, which is that physicists are interested in

11:44.480 --> 11:47.680
describing this universe, okay?

11:48.080 --> 11:52.920
Mathematicians are interested in describing all possible mathematical universes, of which,

11:53.880 --> 11:57.640
you know, in some of our work, I'm still considering myself more of a mathematician

11:57.640 --> 11:58.480
than a physicist.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.000
My first love for physics, not withstanding.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.840
Mathematicians are, in a way, we have more diversity, if you might say.

12:09.880 --> 12:18.280
So we are accepting, for instance, our universe has three spatial dimensions,

12:18.280 --> 12:19.680
in one time dimension, right?

12:19.680 --> 12:21.880
So what I mean is that.

12:22.040 --> 12:22.640
Allegedly.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.600
Allegedly.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.440
Absorbed, but that we can observe today, right?

12:26.440 --> 12:29.720
So of course, there are theories where there are some hidden dimensions as well.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.360
Well, let's just say observed, you observe dimensions.

12:34.280 --> 12:39.800
So this tabletop has two dimensions because you can have two axes, two coordinate axes.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.960
X and Y, but then there is also a third one to describe the space of this room.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.400
And then there is a time dimension.

12:48.880 --> 12:57.720
So realistic theories of physics have to be about spaces of three dimensions or space

12:57.720 --> 12:59.040
times of four dimensions.

12:59.560 --> 13:06.400
But mathematically, we are just as interested in theories in 10 spacetime dimensions or

13:06.400 --> 13:12.080
11 or 25 or whatever, or, or infinite dimensional spaces, you know?

13:12.640 --> 13:13.960
So that's the difference.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.640
On the other hand, I have to give it to the physicists.

13:17.720 --> 13:25.320
We don't have the same satisfaction that they have of having their theories confirmed

13:25.360 --> 13:26.280
by an experiment.

13:26.560 --> 13:31.400
We don't get to play with big machines like LHC in Geneva, a large

13:31.400 --> 13:36.240
Adron Collider that recently discovered, you know, the Higgs boson and some other things.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.160
For us, it's all like a mental exercise in some sense.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.960
We do, we prove things by using rules of logic.

13:44.640 --> 13:49.120
And that's our way of confirming, experimental confirmation, if you will.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.200
But I think we kind of, I kind of envy a little bit, my friends physicists, that they,

13:53.320 --> 13:58.600
they get to, they get to experience this sort of, this big toys, you know, and play with them.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.320
But it does seem that sometimes as you've spoken about abstract mathematical concepts

14:03.320 --> 14:06.320
map to reality, and it seems to happen quite a bit.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.000
That's right.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.840
So the mathematics is underpin physics, obviously.

14:09.840 --> 14:17.200
It's a language, the book of nature, as Galileo famously said, is written in the

14:17.200 --> 14:24.280
language of mathematics, and, and, you know, the, the letters in it are the circle

14:24.280 --> 14:30.400
triangles and squares, and those who don't know the language, I'm paraphrasing, are

14:30.400 --> 14:33.120
left to wander in a dark labyrinth.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.960
That's a famous quote from Galileo, which is very true and has become even more

14:37.960 --> 14:47.520
true more recently in theoretical physics in the most, in the most far out parts of

14:47.520 --> 14:52.320
the theoretical physics that have to do with elementary particles in the, and as well as

14:52.320 --> 14:54.680
the, the structure of the cosmos at the large scale.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.520
What do you think of Max Tagmark who wrote the book, Mathematical Universe?

15:00.880 --> 15:07.600
So do you think just lingering on that point, you think at the end of the day, the

15:07.600 --> 15:09.840
future generations will all be mathematicians?

15:11.520 --> 15:16.080
Meaning, meaning the ones that deeply understand the way the universe works at the core.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.200
Is it just mathematics?

15:20.000 --> 15:27.480
At the core of, you know, I would say mathematics is one half of the core.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.960
So the book is called Love and Math.

15:30.120 --> 15:30.360
Yeah.

15:30.360 --> 15:30.480
Okay.

15:30.480 --> 15:35.280
So these are the two pillars in my view.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.160
In other words, you can't cover everything by math.

15:39.200 --> 15:46.520
So mathematics gives you tools, it gives you a way, a kind of a clear vision.

15:47.680 --> 15:54.240
But mathematics by itself is not enough for one to have a harmonious and balanced life.

15:54.680 --> 16:03.360
You know, so I am suspicious of any theory that declares that everything is mathematics.

16:04.360 --> 16:09.840
So math can generate things that are beautiful, but it can't explain why it's beautiful.

16:09.840 --> 16:15.160
Math, you could say, is a way to discern patterns, to find regularities in the universe.

16:15.160 --> 16:21.040
And both physical and mental universe, the mathematics explores the mind as much as it

16:21.040 --> 16:25.040
explores the physical world around us.

16:25.560 --> 16:31.960
And it helps us to find those patterns, which kind of, which makes our perception more

16:32.280 --> 16:40.680
sophisticated, our ability to perceive things such as beauty, you know, and it sharpens our

16:40.680 --> 16:43.240
ability to see, to see beauty, to understand beauty.

16:43.240 --> 16:51.160
So our world becomes more complex from thinking that our, that our, that Earth is flat.

16:51.560 --> 16:57.400
We go to realizing that it is round, that it's shaped as a sphere so that we can actually

16:57.400 --> 17:02.200
travel around the Earth, you know, so there isn't a place where we hit the end, so to speak.

17:03.320 --> 17:11.640
And then proceeding in the same vein, then Einstein's general relativity theory tells us that

17:13.000 --> 17:15.080
our space time is not flat either.

17:16.200 --> 17:22.040
This is much harder to, to imagine the bent, a bent three-dimensional or four-dimensional,

17:22.040 --> 17:26.440
three-dimensional space or four-dimensional space time, because this idea that the space around

17:26.520 --> 17:28.280
us is flat is so deeply entrenched.

17:28.840 --> 17:34.360
And yet we know from this theory and from the experiments that have confirmed it,

17:35.800 --> 17:43.240
that a ray of light bends around a star, as if being attracted by the, by the force of gravity.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.400
But in fact, the force of gravity is the bending.

17:45.960 --> 17:50.360
It's just that it's not only the bending of the space, it's also the bending of space time.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.520
There is a curvature, not only between special, spatial dimensions.

17:55.480 --> 18:02.840
The way parallels and meridians come together in a small scale, they look like perpendicular lines.

18:02.840 --> 18:07.080
But if you zoom out, you see that the space are, they're curving the space.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.160
They are, they are sort of the, the tracks along which the space gets curved.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.440
That's, that's the, that would be the curvature of spatial dimensions.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.960
But in fact, now throwing time, and one time, imagine a sphere which lives,

18:19.960 --> 18:25.160
which has one of the meridians correspond to time, and they're less correspond to space.

18:25.160 --> 18:29.160
I can't imagine it, but you can write, I can write a mathematical formula expressing that

18:29.160 --> 18:34.920
curvature. And that's, in fact, that curvature is responsible for the force of gravity attraction

18:34.920 --> 18:41.000
between the sort of simplest instantiation of it, attraction between two planets or between two human

18:41.000 --> 18:50.040
beings. Yeah, the time, bending time, it's not very nice that what that theory did to time,

18:50.680 --> 18:56.920
because it feels like the marching of time forward is fundamental to our human experience.

18:57.640 --> 19:05.080
The arrow of time marching forward nicely seems to be the only way we can understand the universe.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.160
And the fact that you can start up to now, up to now, there are people who claim that they can,

19:09.160 --> 19:12.440
that they have, they possess other ways of experiencing it.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.080
So truly can visualize messing with time?

19:16.040 --> 19:21.160
Well, messing with time, but not necessarily messing with time, because one point of view is that,

19:21.720 --> 19:29.880
you know, I think, who was it? I think William Blake, who wrote that eternity loves time production.

19:30.840 --> 19:37.480
So one point of view is that it is eternity, which is fundamental, where time stands still,

19:38.200 --> 19:45.560
which our mind conceptualizes as the time. So, but in fact, you know, it's not something mystical.

19:45.560 --> 19:50.680
If you think about when you, about it, when you're really absorbed in something,

19:52.040 --> 19:55.320
time does stand still. And then you look at the clock and it's like, oh my god,

19:55.320 --> 20:01.000
two hours have passed. And it felt like a couple of seconds. When you are absorbed,

20:01.000 --> 20:05.640
when you're in love, when you are passionate about something, when you're creating something,

20:06.120 --> 20:12.200
you are, we lose ourselves and we lose the sense of time and space for that matter. You see,

20:12.200 --> 20:16.200
so there is only that, which is happening, that creative process.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.120
So I think that this, this is familiar to all of us.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.440
And we may be actually the closest to the truth at that moment, to the truth.

20:24.440 --> 20:29.880
And so then, so yes, so then there is a point of view that this is where we are, we are who we are,

20:30.680 --> 20:36.040
at our sort of fundamental, at our fundamental level. And after that, the mind comes in

20:36.920 --> 20:40.520
and tries to conceptualize it. It's like, oh, because I was writing something.

20:42.680 --> 20:47.720
I was writing a book, I was painting this painting, or maybe I was watching this painting and got

20:47.720 --> 20:52.440
totally absorbed in it. Or I fell in love with this person. That's what happened. But in the

20:52.440 --> 20:56.200
moment when it's happening, you're not thinking about it. You're just there.

20:56.840 --> 21:01.880
Yeah, we construct narratives around the set of memories that seem to have happened in sequence,

21:01.880 --> 21:07.640
or at least that's the way we tell ourselves that. And we also have a bunch of weird human things,

21:07.640 --> 21:15.400
like consciousness, and the experience of free will that we chose a set of actions as the time

21:15.400 --> 21:23.960
unrolled forward. And we are intelligent, conscious agents making, taking those actions.

21:24.840 --> 21:30.760
But what if all of that is just an illusion and a nice narrative, we tell ourselves.

21:30.760 --> 21:35.400
That's a really difficult thing to internalize. And imagine that to make it really catch 22.

21:36.360 --> 21:42.440
Imagine that our minds are set up in such a way that they can't approach the world

21:42.440 --> 21:49.000
or experience otherwise. So in other words, to understand, to see that from a more

21:49.800 --> 21:54.280
kind of all-encompassing point of view, we have to step out of the mind.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.800
Well, I wonder what's the more honest way to look at things.

21:58.840 --> 22:03.400
But I think we like to be, to play with time. I think we like to play with these experiences,

22:03.400 --> 22:06.920
with all the drama of it, with all the memories, with all the tribulations.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.760
I think we love it. We love it. Otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it.

22:11.560 --> 22:17.560
I think the Earth loves it. The evolutionary process somehow loves it. Whatever this thing

22:17.560 --> 22:24.360
that's being created here on Earth, it seems to like to create, like to allow its children to

22:24.360 --> 22:32.040
play with certain truths that they hold, this subjective truths that are useful for the competition

22:32.040 --> 22:35.880
or whatever this dance that we call life broadly define, not just humans.

22:36.600 --> 22:41.400
And you know, I'm glad you mentioned that because what I find fascinating is that the greatest

22:41.400 --> 22:47.160
scientists are on record saying that when they were making their discoveries,

22:47.160 --> 22:52.280
they felt like children. So Isaac Newton said to myself, I only appeared as a child playing

22:52.280 --> 22:56.840
on the seashore and every once in a while finding a prettier pebble or a prettier shell.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.160
Whilst, I think he said something like the infinite ocean of knowledge

23:03.000 --> 23:09.800
was lying before me, Alexander Grotendig, who probably was the greatest mathematician

23:09.800 --> 23:14.600
of the second half of the 20th century, the French mathematician, Alexander Grotendig,

23:15.560 --> 23:22.360
wrote that discovery is a privilege of a child. The child who is not afraid to be wrong once again,

23:22.360 --> 23:28.600
to look like an idiot, you know, to try this and that, I'm paraphrasing, and go through trial and

23:28.600 --> 23:38.200
error. That is for them, in other words, for them, that innocence of a child who is not afraid,

23:39.080 --> 23:46.280
who has not yet been told that it cannot be done. Okay. That was essential to scientific pursuit,

23:46.280 --> 23:55.720
to scientific discovery. And now also compared to Pablo Picasso, a great artist, right? So who said

23:55.720 --> 24:01.320
every child is an artist. The question is to how to preserve that as we grow up.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.920
Do you struggle with that? You're one of the most respected

24:05.800 --> 24:12.760
mathematicians in the world. You're Berkeley, you're like, there's a statue, you're supposed to be

24:12.760 --> 24:19.640
very like, you know... Every tower. Sometimes I joke, I say, I take an elevator to the top of

24:19.640 --> 24:27.720
the ivory tower every day, yeah. You're supposed to speak like royalty. Do you struggle to strip

24:27.720 --> 24:33.800
all of that away to rediscover the child when you're thinking about problems when you're teaching,

24:33.800 --> 24:37.640
when you're thinking about the world? Absolutely. I mean, that's part of being human,

24:37.640 --> 24:43.800
because when we grow up, I mean, all of them, all of these great scientists, I think they were so

24:43.800 --> 24:49.800
great in part because they were able to maintain that connection, okay, that fascination, that

24:49.800 --> 24:58.600
vulnerability, that spontaneity, you know, and kind of looking at the world through the eyes of a

24:58.600 --> 25:04.120
child. But it's difficult because, you know, you go through education system. And for many of us,

25:05.880 --> 25:11.480
it's not especially helpful for maintaining that connection, that we kind of like,

25:12.200 --> 25:18.120
we're being told certain things that we accept, take for granted, and so on, and little by little.

25:18.120 --> 25:25.960
And also, we get hit every time we act different, okay, every time we act in a way that doesn't fit

25:26.040 --> 25:32.440
sort of the pattern. We get punished by the teachers, get punished by parents, and so on.

25:32.440 --> 25:38.360
And don't get respect when you act childlike in your thinking, when you are fearless and

25:39.560 --> 25:42.520
looking like an idiot. That's right. Because there's a hierarchy.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.520
Nobody wants to look like an idiot, you know, once you start growing up, or you think you're

25:46.520 --> 25:51.560
growing up. Yeah. In the beginning, you don't even think of, you don't think in these terms.

25:52.520 --> 25:57.800
You just play, you're just playing. And you are open to possibilities, to these infinite

25:57.800 --> 26:02.920
possibilities that this world presents to us. So how do we, I'm not saying that

26:03.960 --> 26:09.720
education system should not be also kind of taming that a little bit.

26:11.240 --> 26:17.080
Obviously, the goal is balance that acquiring knowledge

26:17.560 --> 26:25.400
so that we can be more mature and more discerning, more discriminating in terms of our approach

26:25.400 --> 26:31.080
to the world, in terms of our connections to the world and people and so on. But how do we do that

26:31.080 --> 26:39.080
while also preserving that innocence of a child? And my guess is that there is no formula for this.

26:39.400 --> 26:49.080
It is a life is an answer. Every life, every human being is one particular answer to how do we find

26:49.080 --> 26:58.280
balance? That's one imperfect approximation, approximate solution to the problem. But we can

26:58.280 --> 27:06.600
look, we can look up to the great ones who have credentials in the sense that they have shown

27:06.600 --> 27:11.080
and they have proved that they have done something that other humans appreciate,

27:11.080 --> 27:17.160
our civilization appreciates, say Isaac Newton or Alexander Grottendijk or Pablo Picasso.

27:17.160 --> 27:23.720
So they have established their right to speak about these matters and we cannot dismiss them

27:23.720 --> 27:30.200
as mere madmen. They say, okay, well, if the same thing was said by somebody who never achieved

27:30.200 --> 27:37.480
anything in their field of endeavor, it would be easy for us to dismiss it.

27:37.480 --> 27:44.280
But when it comes from someone like Isaac Newton, we take notice. So I think that's

27:44.280 --> 27:49.480
something important that they teach us. And especially today, in this age of AI,

27:50.680 --> 27:56.040
of course, there's a big elephant in the room always, which is called AI. And so I know that

27:56.040 --> 28:01.880
you are an expert in the subject. And we are going, we're living now in this very interesting times

28:01.880 --> 28:11.000
of new AI systems coming online pretty much every couple of weeks. So I kind of, to me,

28:11.800 --> 28:16.520
that whole debate about what is it? What is artificial intelligence? Where is it going?

28:16.520 --> 28:23.800
What should we do about it? Needs an influx of this type of considerations that we've

28:23.800 --> 28:31.640
just been talking about. That, for instance, the idea that inspiration, creativity, doesn't come

28:31.640 --> 28:37.480
from accumulation of knowledge, because obviously a child, a child has not yet accumulated knowledge.

28:37.480 --> 28:47.480
And yet the great ones are on record saying that a child has a capacity to create an adult

28:48.200 --> 28:56.920
credits, the inner child for this capacity to create as an adult. You see, that's kind of weird

28:56.920 --> 29:03.240
if we take the point of view that everything is computation, everything is accumulation of knowledge

29:03.240 --> 29:09.400
that just bigger and bigger data sets, finer and finer neural networks, and then we will be able to

29:09.400 --> 29:14.600
replicate human consciousness. If we take that point of view, then what I just said kind of

29:14.600 --> 29:20.440
doesn't fit, because obviously a child has not been fed any training data, as far as we know.

29:20.440 --> 29:25.960
Yet they're perfectly capable of distinguishing between cats and dogs, for instance, and stuff

29:25.960 --> 29:34.040
like that. But much more than that, they're also capable of that wide-eyed perspective.

29:35.080 --> 29:42.840
So can it really be captured, that perspective, that sense of awe, can it really be captured

29:42.840 --> 29:47.800
by computation alone? I don't know the answer, so I'm not sort of trying to

29:50.520 --> 29:53.320
present a particular point of view. I'm just trying to question

29:55.240 --> 30:02.120
any theory that starts out by saying life is this, or consciousness is this.

30:03.640 --> 30:08.280
Because when you look more closely, you recognize that there are some other things

30:08.280 --> 30:14.200
at play which do not quite fit the narrative. And it's hard to know where they come from.

30:14.200 --> 30:22.360
It's also possible that the evolutionary process as created is the very, it is computation.

30:22.360 --> 30:28.680
And the child is actually not a blank slate, but the result of one of the most incredible,

30:29.000 --> 30:42.200
several billion-year-old computations that had explored all kinds of aspects of life on earth,

30:43.000 --> 30:52.120
of war, and love, and terror, and ambition, and violence, and invention, all of that from

30:52.120 --> 31:01.880
the bacteria today. So that young child is not a blank slate. They actually hold within them

31:01.880 --> 31:08.520
the knowledge of several billions of years. Right. The question is whether, as a child,

31:08.520 --> 31:13.720
you carry that in the form of the kind of computational algorithms that we are aware

31:13.720 --> 31:22.280
today. You see, what strikes me as unlikely is that, how should I put it? How interesting that,

31:24.200 --> 31:28.360
you are a computer scientist and there are other people, I have studied computer science,

31:28.360 --> 31:36.840
so I know a little bit. And so it's tempting to say, oh, the whole world is computer science,

31:36.840 --> 31:41.400
or is based, can be explained by computer science. Why? Because it makes me feel good,

31:41.400 --> 31:46.360
because I have mastered it, I have learned it. My ego is very happy, and people come to me,

31:47.000 --> 31:52.680
and they look up to me, and they revere me, kind of like priests in old days, when the religion

31:52.680 --> 31:59.320
was paramount, when you would tend to explain things in theological religious terms. Today,

31:59.320 --> 32:05.240
science has progressed. There are fewer people who kind of buy into official religion. So

32:05.560 --> 32:12.440
we have this knowledge, I suppose, to explain, and to know, and to dissect, and to analyze,

32:12.440 --> 32:18.200
and to conceptualize, which is a wonderful quality that we have, and we should definitely pursue

32:18.200 --> 32:26.760
that. But I find it a little bit unlikely that the universe is just exactly what I have learned,

32:26.760 --> 32:32.840
and not something that I don't know, you see. Well, there's a lot of interesting

32:33.720 --> 32:40.920
aspects of the current large language models that one perspective of it, I think, speaks to the

32:40.920 --> 32:50.120
love and math that you talk to, which is they're trained on human data from the internet.

32:51.240 --> 32:59.560
So at its best, a large language model, like GPT-4, captures the magic of the human condition

33:00.120 --> 33:06.840
on its full display, its full complexity. And since mimicking, it's trying to compress all the

33:06.840 --> 33:13.960
weirdness of humans, of all the debates and discussions, the perspectives, all the different

33:13.960 --> 33:18.520
ways that people approach solving different problems, all of that compressed. So we live,

33:18.520 --> 33:23.400
we're each individual ants. We only have like, we have a family, we interact with a few little

33:23.400 --> 33:31.640
ants. And here comes AI that's able to summarize like a TLDR report of humanity.

33:31.640 --> 33:36.920
And that's the beauty of it. So I embrace it. I'm very impressed by it.

33:36.920 --> 33:45.320
I wonder if it can be very impressive, meaning way more impressive in being able to

33:46.360 --> 33:51.480
fake or simulate or emulate a human. Fake. I'm glad you mentioned that,

33:51.480 --> 33:56.840
because that seems to be the mantra. It's just fake it till you make it, isn't it?

33:56.840 --> 34:02.600
Isn't that what we all do though? No, well, yes, we do that, but we also do other things.

34:02.600 --> 34:07.240
We can be truly in love. We can be truly inspired when it is not fake. I do believe,

34:07.240 --> 34:12.200
call me romantic, okay, but I do believe. And this is a very good, I'm glad you're putting it in

34:12.200 --> 34:16.840
these terms because I've had conversations like that, that, yeah, fake it till you make it, but

34:16.840 --> 34:23.960
that's what humans do. Yes, we do that, but not all the time. And that is debatable because also

34:23.960 --> 34:28.120
I speak from my own experience. And that's where the first person perspective comes in.

34:28.120 --> 34:34.920
The subjective view. I cannot prove to you, for instance, or anyone else that there are certain

34:34.920 --> 34:41.160
moments in my life where I am genuine. I am pure, so to speak, when it's not faking it.

34:42.040 --> 34:49.080
But I do have a tremendous certainty of it. And that's a subjective certainty. Now,

34:49.640 --> 34:56.200
I am, as a scientist, I'm also trained to give more credibility to objective arguments that

34:56.200 --> 35:01.720
and other things that can be reproduced, things that I can demonstrate, that I can show. But as I

35:01.720 --> 35:10.920
get older, as I get more mature, hopefully, you know, I'm starting to question why I am not

35:11.000 --> 35:17.160
giving as much credibility to my subjective understanding of the world, the kind of the

35:17.160 --> 35:23.480
first person perspective. When actually modern science has already sold on that, you know,

35:23.480 --> 35:31.160
quantum mechanics has shown unambiguously that the observer is always involved in the observation.

35:32.120 --> 35:37.880
Likewise, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to me, show how essential

35:40.600 --> 35:47.000
is the observer of the mathematical theory. For one thing, that's the one who chooses the axioms.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.640
And we can talk about this in more detail. Likewise, Einstein's relativity, where

35:52.520 --> 35:54.760
time is relative to the observer, for instance.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.760
That's brilliant. You're just describing all of these different scales, the observer,

35:58.760 --> 36:05.880
what the observer is. So science of 19th century had, from modern perspective, and I don't want

36:05.880 --> 36:10.840
to offend anybody, had the delusion that somehow you could analyze the world being completely

36:10.840 --> 36:17.080
detached from it. We now know after the landmark achievements of the first half of the 20th century

36:17.080 --> 36:22.840
that this is nonsense. That is simply not true. And this has been experimentally proved time and

36:22.840 --> 36:30.440
time again. So to me, I'm thinking maybe it's a hint that I should take my first person perspective

36:30.440 --> 36:36.920
seriously as well and not just rely on kind of objective phenomena, things that can be

36:36.920 --> 36:43.800
proved in a traditional sort of objective way by setting up an experiment that can be

36:43.800 --> 36:49.080
repeated many times. Maybe I fall in love in the party, you know, the deepest love of my life,

36:50.040 --> 36:54.360
perhaps hasn't happened yet, perhaps I will fall in love, but it's a unique event. You

36:54.360 --> 37:00.440
can't reproduce it necessarily, you see. So in that sense, you see how these things are closely

37:00.440 --> 37:07.720
connected. I think that if we are declaring from the outset that all there is to life is,

37:08.680 --> 37:12.200
you know, computation in the form of neural networks or something like this,

37:13.160 --> 37:19.240
however sophisticated they might be, I think we are from the outset denying to ourselves

37:19.240 --> 37:25.080
the possibility that, yes, there is a side of me which is not faking it. Yes, there is a side of

37:25.080 --> 37:30.600
me which cannot be captured by logic and reason. And you know what another great scientist said,

37:30.600 --> 37:38.360
bless Pascal? He said, the heart has its reasons of which the reason knows nothing.

37:39.320 --> 37:45.240
And then he also said, the last step of reason is to grasp that there are infinitely many

37:45.240 --> 37:50.920
things beyond reason. How interesting, this was not a theologian, this was not a priest,

37:50.920 --> 37:58.760
this was not a spiritual guru. It was a hardcore scientist who actually developed,

37:58.760 --> 38:04.200
I think, one of the very first calculators. How interesting that this guy also was able to

38:05.160 --> 38:10.600
impart on us that wisdom. Now, you can always say that's not the case.

38:12.760 --> 38:20.280
But why should we, from the outset, exclude this possibility that there is something to what

38:21.240 --> 38:29.160
he was saying? That is my question. I'm not taking sides. What I'm trying to do is to shake a

38:29.160 --> 38:34.920
little bit the debate because most mathematicians that I know and computer scientists even more so,

38:34.920 --> 38:41.560
they're kind of already sold on this. We are just, you know, reminds me of this famous Lord

38:41.560 --> 38:47.560
Kelvin's quote from the end of 19th century. There's some debate whether he actually said that, but

38:48.760 --> 38:56.200
never let a good story, you know, stand in the way of truth. He said, physics is basically

38:56.200 --> 39:02.600
finished. All that remains is more, more precise measurement. So I find a lot of my colleagues

39:02.600 --> 39:08.760
are happy to say, everything's finished. We already got, we got it. We got it. Maybe a little tweaks

39:09.720 --> 39:17.240
in our language models, you know. So now here's my question. I'm kind of playing devil's advocate

39:17.240 --> 39:23.320
a little bit because I don't see the other side of what represented that much. And I'm saying,

39:23.320 --> 39:27.800
okay, could it be also that if you believe in that, that that becomes your reality?

39:28.760 --> 39:35.160
That you can kind of put yourself in a box where everything is computation, and then you start

39:35.160 --> 39:41.160
seeing things as being such. It's confirmation bias, if you will, you know. This also reminds me,

39:41.160 --> 39:45.560
you know, that I think a good analogy is it's a friend of mine, Philippe Caution told me that in

39:45.560 --> 39:55.640
France there is this literary movement, which is called Olipo, O-U-L-I-P-O. And it's a bunch of

39:55.640 --> 40:03.480
writers and mathematicians who create works of literature where in which they basically impose

40:03.480 --> 40:10.280
certain constraints. A good example of this is a novel, which is called The Void or Disappearance

40:10.280 --> 40:16.040
by a writer named Georges Perec, which is a 300 page novel in French,

40:17.800 --> 40:25.800
which never uses the letter E, which is the most widely used letter of the French language.

40:26.840 --> 40:32.920
So in other words, he set these parameters for himself. I'm going to write a book where I don't

40:32.920 --> 40:40.200
use this letter, which is a great experiment and I applaud it. But that's one thing to do

40:40.200 --> 40:48.680
that and to kind of show his gamesmanship, if you will, and his ability as a writer.

40:48.680 --> 40:53.240
But it's another thing if at the end of writing this book, when you finish the book, he would say

40:53.240 --> 41:00.920
letter E actually doesn't exist and try to convince us that in fact French language does not have

41:00.920 --> 41:07.080
that letter simply because he was able to go so far without using it, you see. So self-imposed

41:07.080 --> 41:15.560
limitation, that's how I see it. And I wonder why we should do that. Do we really feel the urge

41:15.560 --> 41:21.000
to say the world is like that? The world can be explained this way or that way. And I'm saying

41:21.000 --> 41:28.440
it, it's a personal question for me because I am addicted to knowledge myself. Hi, my name is Edward.

41:30.120 --> 41:35.800
And I'm a knowledge addict. I'm being serious, I'm not being facetious. Up until very recently,

41:35.800 --> 41:43.240
maybe a couple of years ago, I simply did not feel comfortable if I could not say the given answer,

41:43.240 --> 41:47.080
explanation. It's like, oh, there has to be some explanation. And I try to frantically search for

41:47.080 --> 41:56.120
it. Just for somebody like me and I heard, you know, a left brainiac and, you know,

41:57.160 --> 42:02.520
that's kind of typical for scientists, for mathematicians. It is incredibly hard.

42:02.840 --> 42:11.080
Just to allow the possibility that it's a mystery and not to feel the urge

42:12.680 --> 42:17.560
to get the answer. It is incredibly hard. What's possible? And it is liberating.

42:17.560 --> 42:26.760
It's a recovering addict to knowledge. Let me say what you gain from it. For instance,

42:26.760 --> 42:32.200
I understand the value of paradoxes. I appreciate paradoxes more. And, you know,

42:33.480 --> 42:38.120
to use another philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, said,

42:39.400 --> 42:43.560
I think her without paradox is like a lover without passion.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.080
A paltry mediocrity.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.360
Oh, that's a good line.

42:48.360 --> 42:57.400
All right. So, and, you know, Niels Bohr, Niels Bohr said in Simmerwain, the great Danish,

42:57.400 --> 43:01.960
also, something about Danes. I think it all started with Hamlet, you know.

43:03.480 --> 43:10.760
He said the opposite of a simple truth is a falsity. But the opposite of a great truth

43:11.720 --> 43:17.960
is another great truth. In other words, things are not black and white, you know, they're not,

43:19.240 --> 43:25.560
and I would even venture to say the most interesting things in life are like that.

43:26.360 --> 43:30.600
The ones which are ambiguous. Is an electron a particle or a wave?

43:31.400 --> 43:36.040
It depends how you set up an experiment. It will reveal itself as this or that,

43:36.040 --> 43:42.840
depending on how you set up an experiment. This bottle, if you project it down onto the table,

43:43.880 --> 43:49.080
you will see more or less a square. If you project it onto a wall, you will see a different shape.

43:49.080 --> 43:55.480
A naive question would be, is it this or that? Because we understand that it's neither.

43:56.280 --> 44:02.440
But both projections reveal something. They reveal different sides of it. A paradox is like that.

44:02.440 --> 44:12.840
It's only paradoxical if we are confined in a particular vision, if we are wedded to a particular

44:12.840 --> 44:22.840
point of view. It's a harbinger, if you will, of a possibility of seeing things as they are,

44:22.920 --> 44:26.360
as more sophisticated than we thought before. You see.

44:26.360 --> 44:32.920
That's such a difficult idea for science to grapple with, that, you know, I don't know how

44:33.480 --> 44:38.760
there's so many ways to describe this, but you could say maybe that the subjective experience of

44:38.760 --> 44:47.160
the world from an observer is actually fundamental. But we know that. Our best physical theories tell

44:47.720 --> 44:52.760
that unambiguously. In quantum mechanics, actually, you know, Heisenberg, I think,

44:52.760 --> 44:56.680
captured it the best when he said, what we observe is not reality itself,

44:57.560 --> 45:05.880
but reality subjected to our method of questioning. When I talk about electrons,

45:05.880 --> 45:09.640
for instance, so that there is a very specific way in which you, in which this is realized,

45:09.640 --> 45:16.920
there is a so-called double slit experiment. For those who don't know, you have a screen

45:17.320 --> 45:23.080
and you have an emitter from which you kind of shoot electrons, and in between you put another

45:23.080 --> 45:28.760
screen which has two vertical slits parallel to each other. If we were shooting, you know, tennis

45:28.760 --> 45:34.680
balls, each ball would go through one slit or another and then hit the screen behind this or

45:34.680 --> 45:39.560
that slit, so you would have, let's say, they're colored, they're painted. So there would be sort

45:39.640 --> 45:47.240
of bumps or spots of paint behind this or that. But that's not what happens when we

45:47.240 --> 45:52.840
shoot electrons. We see an interference pattern, as if we were actually sending a wave, so that

45:52.840 --> 45:58.920
each electron, it seems like each electron goes through both slits at once and then has the audacity

45:58.920 --> 46:04.360
to interfere with itself, where at some points, you know, two crests would amplify and at some

46:04.360 --> 46:09.960
points, a crest in the trough would cancel each other. Yet, so that suggests, okay, so the electron

46:09.960 --> 46:14.760
is a wave, not so fast, because if you put a detector behind one of the slits and you say,

46:14.760 --> 46:22.040
I'm going to capture you, I'm going to find out which slit you went through, the pattern will

46:22.040 --> 46:27.880
change and it will look like the particles. So that's a very concrete realization of the idea

46:27.880 --> 46:33.640
that depending on how we set up an experiment, we will see different results. And the problem,

46:33.640 --> 46:40.760
the problem is that our psyche, I feel, kind of is lagging behind in part because maybe our

46:40.760 --> 46:46.120
scientists are not doing such a great job. So I take responsibility for this, that why haven't I

46:46.120 --> 46:51.640
explained this properly, you know, I tried, you know, in a bunch of talks and so on. So now I'm

46:51.640 --> 46:56.120
talking about this again. Our psyche kind of is lagging behind. We're still, even though our

46:56.120 --> 47:02.760
science has progressed so much from the certainty and the determinism and all of that of the 19th

47:02.840 --> 47:09.000
century, our psyche is somehow still attached to those ideas, the ideas of causality or this

47:09.000 --> 47:15.400
naive determinism that the world has a bunch of billiard balls hitting each other, driven by some

47:15.400 --> 47:20.920
blind forces, you know, that's not at all like it is. And we've known this for over, for, well,

47:20.920 --> 47:26.520
for about 100 years at least, you know. And you call this self-imposed limitation.

47:26.520 --> 47:34.040
It is a self-imposed limitation when we pretend that, for instance, that this naive ideas of 19th

47:34.040 --> 47:41.720
century physics are still valid and then start applying them to our lives and then also derive

47:41.720 --> 47:47.560
conclusions from it. And for instance, people say, there is no free will. Why? Oh, because the world

47:47.560 --> 47:52.920
is just a bunch of billiard balls. Where is the free will? But excuse me, didn't you get the memo

47:52.920 --> 47:57.480
that this has been debunked thoroughly by the so-called quantum mechanics, which is our best

47:57.480 --> 48:06.760
scientific theory? This is not some kind of bullshit or some kind of concoction of a madman.

48:06.760 --> 48:10.440
This is our scientific theory, which has been confirmed by experiment. So we should pay attention

48:10.440 --> 48:16.120
to that. But of course, it's not just self-imposed limitation. Unfortunately, in this case, there

48:16.120 --> 48:21.960
is a big issue of education. So a lot of people are not aware of it through no fault of their own,

48:21.960 --> 48:26.520
because they were never properly taught that, because our system is broken, education system

48:26.520 --> 48:32.680
is broken, especially math. So where do we get information? You get information from

48:33.640 --> 48:41.960
our scientists who actually write popular books and so on, which is a great thing that they do.

48:41.960 --> 48:48.520
But a lot of scientists somehow, when it comes to explaining the laws of physics,

48:49.160 --> 48:55.320
they're doing a fantastic job talking about this phenomenon, for instance,

48:55.320 --> 49:00.680
double slit experiments and things like that. But then interviewed by Science Magazine about

49:00.680 --> 49:06.040
free will and so on, they revert back to 19th century physics, as if those developments

49:06.040 --> 49:16.360
actually never happened. So to me, this is single most important issue in our popular science.

49:17.320 --> 49:22.760
The idea that somehow there is this world out there, but it has nothing to do with me.

49:23.960 --> 49:30.600
So I can revel in the intricacies of these particles and their interactions,

49:32.040 --> 49:40.680
but completely ignore what implications this has for my own relationship to physical reality,

49:40.760 --> 49:43.800
to my own life, because it's kind of scary, I guess.

49:44.280 --> 49:51.400
But also, what are the tools with which we can talk about the observer,

49:53.000 --> 49:57.480
the subjective view in reality? What are the tools with which we could talk about

49:58.840 --> 50:04.120
rigorously talk about free will and consciousness? What are the tools of mathematics that allow that?

50:04.120 --> 50:05.640
I don't think we have those tools.

50:05.640 --> 50:09.880
Because we haven't been taught properly. So actually, tools are there.

50:09.880 --> 50:19.880
For instance, I think, well, here we have to say, my conviction is that everybody knows.

50:21.320 --> 50:26.440
In the heart of hearts, everybody knows that there is that. There is something

50:27.800 --> 50:35.160
ineffable. There is something mysterious. And in fact, you know, somehow immediately,

50:35.160 --> 50:41.720
I feel that, you know, the impulse to quote somebody on this, because as if my own opinion doesn't go.

50:43.160 --> 50:49.160
There's a long dead expert that has said that, you know, so like, how, see, look at me.

50:49.800 --> 50:56.120
I am supposedly like this smart, intelligent person. I am afraid to say it and own it myself.

50:56.120 --> 51:02.040
I have to find confirmation. I have to find an authority who agrees with me. And in fact,

51:02.120 --> 51:05.960
it's not so difficult to find because Albert Einstein literally said the most important thing

51:06.520 --> 51:10.760
in life is the mysterious. Okay, he actually said that there are some quotes which are

51:10.760 --> 51:15.480
attributed to him, which he never said, but this he did. I investigated. Okay.

51:17.400 --> 51:24.040
But more importantly, you know, how do you feel about it? I think that everybody knows.

51:25.000 --> 51:32.680
But in other words, he also said Einstein, imagination is more important than knowledge.

51:32.680 --> 51:38.920
Okay. And he explained, for knowledge is always limited. Whereas imagination embraces

51:38.920 --> 51:45.000
the entire world, giving birth to evolution. It is strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific

51:45.000 --> 51:50.280
research, he says. And he says, I am enough of an artist to follow my intuition and imagination.

51:50.280 --> 51:54.760
That's Albert Einstein again. So, and I feel the same way, to be honest,

51:54.760 --> 52:01.240
if I think about my own mathematical research, it's never linear. It's never like, give me more

52:01.240 --> 52:05.880
data, give me more data, give me more data, boom, the glass is full. And then I come up with a

52:05.880 --> 52:14.440
discovery. No, it's always, always, is always felt as a jump, as a leap. And I have actually been

52:14.440 --> 52:19.960
studying various examples in history of mathematics of some fundamental discoveries,

52:19.960 --> 52:26.360
like discovery complex numbers, like square root of negative one. I wonder if a large language

52:26.360 --> 52:31.080
model could actually ever come up with the idea that square root of negative one

52:33.160 --> 52:39.320
is something that is essential or meaningful. Because if all the information that you get,

52:40.040 --> 52:43.160
that all the, all the knowledge that had been accumulated up to that point

52:44.120 --> 52:49.880
tells you that you cannot have a square root of a negative number. Why? Because if you had

52:49.880 --> 52:55.640
such a square root, we know that if then we would have to, if you square it, you get a negative

52:55.640 --> 53:01.160
number. But we know that if you square any real number, positive or negative, you will always

53:01.160 --> 53:07.720
get a positive number. So checkmate, you know, it's over square root of negative one doesn't exist.

53:07.720 --> 53:12.840
Yet we know that these numbers make sense. They're called complex numbers. And in fact,

53:13.480 --> 53:18.680
quantum mechanics is based on complex numbers. They are essential and indispensable for quantum

53:18.680 --> 53:27.080
mechanics. Could one discover that? So to me, that sounds like a discontinuity in the process of

53:27.080 --> 53:32.760
discovery. It's a jump. It's a departure. It is like a child who is experimenting. It's like a child

53:32.760 --> 53:38.760
who says, I'm not afraid to be an idiot. Everybody says the adults are saying square root of negative

53:38.760 --> 53:44.760
number doesn't exist. But guess what? I'm going to accept it. And I'm going to play with it.

53:44.760 --> 53:48.920
And I'm going to see what happens. This is literally how they were discovered. There was an

53:48.920 --> 53:57.400
Italian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer. He was, he made money apparently by compiling

53:57.480 --> 54:04.440
astrological sort of readings for for the elite, you know, of his ear. This is 16th century as one

54:04.440 --> 54:10.120
does a gambler. All around interesting guy. I'm sure we would have an interesting conversation

54:10.120 --> 54:16.920
with him, Gerolamo Cardano. He's he also invented the what's called cardan shaft. So which is an

54:16.920 --> 54:27.000
essential component of a car. Cardano Vival, we say in Russian. So, so he wrote a book which is

54:27.000 --> 54:32.840
called ours Magna, which is like a great art of algebra. And he was writing solutions for the

54:33.720 --> 54:37.720
cubic and quartic equations. This is something that is familiar because

54:39.080 --> 54:43.960
it's cool. We study solutions of quadratic equations, equations of degree two. So you have

54:43.960 --> 54:50.040
x, a x squared plus b x plus c equals zero. And there is a formula which solves it using radicals

54:50.040 --> 54:55.400
using square roots. And Cardano was trying to find a similar formula for the cubic and quartic

54:55.400 --> 55:01.560
equations for which which would start with x cube or x to the power of four, as opposed to x squared.

55:02.280 --> 55:07.560
And in the process of solving these equations, he came up with square root of a negative number,

55:07.560 --> 55:14.280
specifically square root of minus 17. And he wrote that I have to forgo some mental tortures

55:16.600 --> 55:22.040
to deal with it. But I am going to accept it and see what happens. And in fact, at the end of the

55:22.760 --> 55:29.400
calculation, this this this weird numbers got canceled, they kind of canceled out in the formula

55:29.400 --> 55:34.120
appeared square root of negative 17 and its negation. So they kind of conveniently gave the

55:34.120 --> 55:41.320
right answer, which is not involved those numbers. So he was like, okay, what does it mean mental

55:41.320 --> 55:49.160
tortures? So you see from the point of view of the of the thinking mind, it is something almost

55:49.240 --> 55:54.840
unbearable. It's almost I feel that a large language model, a computer running large language

55:54.840 --> 56:00.840
model trying to do that would just explode. And yet a human mathematician was able to find the

56:00.840 --> 56:07.480
courage and inspiration to say, you know what? What's his role? Why? Why are we so adamant that

56:07.480 --> 56:13.000
these things don't exist? That's just our past knowledge is based on what our past knowledge

56:13.000 --> 56:19.000
is and knowledge is limited. What if we make the next step? Today, for us mathematicians complex

56:19.000 --> 56:25.640
numbers with that we call them are not at all mysterious. The idea is simply that you plot

56:25.640 --> 56:30.760
real numbers. That is to say all the whole numbers like zero one and so on, two and so right,

56:30.760 --> 56:36.760
all fractions like one half or three halves or four over three. But then also numbers like

56:36.760 --> 56:43.400
square root of two or pi, we plot them as points on the real line. So we draw this is a this is one

56:43.400 --> 56:51.320
of the kind of perennial concepts even in our very poor math curriculum at school. But now imagine

56:51.320 --> 56:58.760
that instead of one line, you have one axis, you have a second axis. And so your numbers now have

56:58.760 --> 57:06.920
two coordinates, x and y, and you associate to this point with coordinates x and y, the number x,

57:06.920 --> 57:12.280
which is real number plus y times square root of negative one. This is a graphical geometrical

57:12.280 --> 57:17.320
representation of complex numbers, which is not mysterious at all. Now it took another two or

57:17.320 --> 57:22.040
three hundred years for mathematicians to figure that out. But initially it looked like a completely

57:22.840 --> 57:28.600
crazy idea, you know. So all it is all a complex number is just an expansion.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.880
Real number, two real numbers. The real part and the imaginary part.

57:31.880 --> 57:35.400
It's just an expansion of your view of the mathematical world.

57:35.960 --> 57:41.320
The fact that you can actually you can add them up by adding together the real parts and

57:41.320 --> 57:46.440
imaginary parts. That's easy. But there is also a formula for the product, for the multiplication,

57:46.440 --> 57:49.880
which uses the fact that square root of minus one squared is minus one.

57:50.760 --> 57:56.920
And the amazing thing is that that that product that multiplication satisfies the same rules,

57:56.920 --> 58:02.360
the same properties that are usual operation of multiplication for real numbers. For instance,

58:02.360 --> 58:07.560
there is an inverse for every nonzero number that you can find like number five has an inverse one

58:07.640 --> 58:12.920
over five. But one plus I also has an inverse, for instance, you know.

58:12.920 --> 58:18.120
That was always there in the mathematical universe. But we humans didn't know it.

58:18.120 --> 58:24.520
And here comes along this guy who engages in the mental torture, who takes a leap off the cliff

58:24.520 --> 58:27.640
of comfort of like mathematical comfort. Established knowledge.

58:27.640 --> 58:35.240
Established knowledge. Right. And now, obviously, for each sort of fruitful leap like that,

58:35.240 --> 58:39.800
there probably were thousands of like things which went nowhere. I'm not saying that every

58:39.800 --> 58:44.360
leap, you know, it's like it's a it's an open shooting game. Because, for example,

58:44.360 --> 58:48.520
you can try to do the same with three dimensional space. So you have coordinates x, y and z.

58:49.720 --> 58:55.960
And you can say, oh, if there's one dimensional, we have a bona fide numerical system called real

58:55.960 --> 59:00.360
numbers. If it's two dimensional, which is like, you know, geometrically, it's just like the

59:00.440 --> 59:05.320
the stable top extended to infinity in all directions. These are complex numbers. And we

59:05.320 --> 59:10.120
can define addition and multiplication. And they will satisfy the same properties as real numbers

59:10.120 --> 59:15.400
that we're used to. What about three dimensional space? Is it possible to also define some

59:15.400 --> 59:20.280
operation of addition and multiplication on it so that these operations would satisfy

59:21.000 --> 59:26.360
the properties that we're used to? And the answer is no, you can define addition, but you can't

59:26.360 --> 59:30.680
define multiplication for which there would be an inverse, for instance. So there is something

59:30.680 --> 59:36.520
special about the the plane, the two dimensional case. And by the way, next question would be

59:36.520 --> 59:41.720
what about four dimensional in four dimensional space, you again, you can and you get what's

59:41.720 --> 59:47.560
called quaternions discovered by an Irish mathematician Hamilton in the 19th century.

59:48.440 --> 59:53.720
And then in in the eight dimensional, there is something similar called octonians. And that's

59:53.720 --> 01:00:00.680
about it. So how interesting these structures exist in dimension one, two, four, and eight,

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.600
which are all powers of two. Two squared is four, two to the third power is eight.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:12.840
That's one of the bigger mysteries in mathematics. Why it is so? So that's a hint. There's a hint of

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:22.440
what's missing in our high school curriculum, you know, the kind of fascinating mysteries.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.240
Yes, the appreciation of the mysterious. So in other words, yes, we resolved this one mystery

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:33.880
that we understood that square root of negative one is real, is meaningful. We build a theory

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:41.000
to service those now to describe those numbers. Did we find the theory of everything? No, because

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.560
we then invited other mysteries, because we we push the front, we pull the veil, so to speak,

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:53.480
we push the frontier, and then new things come get illuminated, which we couldn't see before.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.200
That's how I see the process of discovery in mathematics is an endless, limitless pursuit.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.200
Can you comment on what you think this human capability of imagination that Einstein spoke

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:11.160
about of the artists following their intuition in this big Alice in Wonderland world of

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.360
of imagination? What is it? You visit there sometimes. What does it feel like?

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.680
Yeah, what does it feel like? What is it? What is that like playing? But I think all of us are

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:28.200
engaged in that kind of play, no matter when we do what we love. I think it always feels the same.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.680
It's not real, right? You're so that you're describing a feeling, but that place you go to

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:41.640
in the imagination, it's bigger than the real world. So there is a big conundrum as to whether

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:50.280
mathematics is invented or discovered. And mathematicians are divided on this. Nobody knows.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:57.560
Where do you bet your money on financially? Investment advice. So let me tell you something.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.760
My views have evolved. When I wrote Love and Math, when I wrote my book,

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:11.480
I was squarely on the side of mathematics is discovered. What does it mean? Usually mathematicians

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:19.080
or others who have this idea, what I believe, are called a Platonists in honor of the great

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:26.600
philosopher Plato, who talked about these absolute perfect forums. So for me, about 10 years ago,

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.640
the world of mathematics was this world of pure forms, this beautiful, pure forms,

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.280
which existed outside of space and time. But I was able to connect to it through my mind.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:45.240
And as it were, kind of dive into it and bring treasures back into this world, into this space

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.680
and time, that's how I viewed the process of mathematical discovery. How nice, how neat, very

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:58.120
neat picture. Also makes you feel connected to something divine. It allows you the sense of

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:04.040
escape from the cruelty and injustice of this world, which I now recognize.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.720
And the divine world of forms is stable, reliable.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:13.400
Something stable. In that world, everything is clear cut. It's either true or false.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.840
Yeah, it's nice. It's very nice.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.400
The biggest illusion of all.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.400
Allegedly.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:27.800
I think now, I think now, I understand why I liked it because I think that I was very

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:33.000
dissatisfied with the, with the, what we call the real world, the world around me,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.200
the cruelty, the injustice of it. And I went through certain experiences as a kid,

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.680
which made me love mathematics even more as this place where I could be safe.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.880
And in control.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.000
Made you see the human world as lesser than the mathematical world.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.400
Yes.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.160
As more limited than the mathematical world.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.720
Yes. Yes. And I think that,

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.440
I think that they're still missing the mark in some sense because, in fact,

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.160
what I now think it's not, it's not, it's a paradoxical question,

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.320
the question whether mathematics is invented to discover it,

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.480
whether there is this world of pure forms and so on.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.800
Is, is, is another paradoxical question, which doesn't have a simple answer,

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.000
like whether electron is a particle or a wave.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.840
From one point of view, yes, it's true.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.760
And just the fact that so many mathematicians today actually subscribe to this idea

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.720
gives it a certain credibility because that's what we feel.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.320
We do feel that we dive into, dive into that

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.840
mindscape, so to speak.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:44.360
But the very structured mindscape where I wrote in Love and Math that,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.320
you know, the enchanted gardens of Platonic reality, where all this fruit grows.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.040
And then we might mention, it gives you this sort of romantic sense of an explorer.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:03.560
And someone may be stuck in a, you know, some provincial town in Russia, for instance,

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.080
but have the sense of a Magellan, you know, of traveling around the world.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.720
It's just not in the world that we usually think of.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760
So it's, it's one point of view.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.800
But the other point of view is that, yes, it is a human process.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.440
Of course it is.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.200
I mean, it is, you cannot deny that.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.040
It's human beings who have so far discovered new mathematics.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.000
And I do not deny the possibility that a computer programs will be able to discover new mathematics.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.960
But so far it's been humans.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:39.480
So it, whatever it is, whether it's discovered or invented, it is a human activity.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.840
The possibility that paradoxes are actually fundamental to reality and really,

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:52.040
really internalizing that, that we exist in the world of not forms, but of paradoxes.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.800
Bingo.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:06:00.120
And so it's like what I said, but if you think it's weird, and I agree with you,

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.640
as a recovering addict to knowledge, you know, but I am liking it more and more

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.240
because there's so much freedom in it.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.120
And like, like Nils Bohr said, you know, like quoted that earlier,

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.480
the opposite of a great truth is another great truth.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:24.120
He's pointing out to this fact that, you know, and he also said that some,

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.360
some things in quantum physics are so complicated, the only way you can speak of them is in poetry.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.440
So in other words, what is it about poetry?

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.400
What is it about art?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.960
Why are we so drawn to that?

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:42.760
Why are we so captivated by those forms of, they are not intellectual necessarily.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:48.120
They are not, when you look at a painting that you like, when you listen to music that you love,

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.200
you get lost in it, you get absorbed in it, it can make you cry, it can make you laugh,

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:57.560
it can make you remember something, it can make you feel more confident,

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.360
it can make you feel sad or happy and so on.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.320
What is this all about?

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.880
Is it really just some play between some kind of like,

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.080
cellophane play or some neurons hitting on each other?

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.080
Is it really that only?

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:11.480
Maybe.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.840
It could be, it could be both.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.720
I'm just worried about kids these days that might live in a world of paradoxes,

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.440
you know, if there's no God, everything is possible.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:27.080
I mean, I just, they'll have a little too much fun and we have to put a constraint to the fun.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.320
Have you looked at the world lately?

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.160
I haven't checked in in a while.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.240
You think it's perfect, the way it is now, the world without paradoxes,

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.320
the world in which we believe that every question can be answered

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.680
as yes or no, that it is this or that, and if you disagree with me, you are my enemy.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.280
Wouldn't that be interesting if this 21st century is a transition

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.760
into seeing the world as a world of paradoxes?

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.040
I'm telling you, you know, people predicted that, you know, the age of Aquarius,

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.320
you know, that the axis of the of the earth is rotating

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.000
relative to the plane in which the earth goes around the sun.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.520
And the period of this revolution is around 2000 years.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.240
So there is a traditional way of measuring that by this

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.280
eras, you know, the ages.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.360
So the previous one was called the age of Pisces

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.080
because of the constellation of Pisces that it points to, so to speak, you know.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:28.040
And now it's, you know, as in famous musical hair, they said the age of Aquarius is up on us.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.920
So the different people dated differently, but somewhere around the time where we are

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.800
finding ourselves.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.000
How interesting, right, is all the strife and all the

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.640
difficulties the world is experiencing.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.720
This might actually be the transition to something more harmonious.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.520
Wouldn't it be nice?

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.960
It's also interesting that people from long ago are able to predict certain things.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:03.800
And it's almost like from long ago, and you've talked about this with Pythagoras,

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.760
that it seems that they had a deep sense of truth.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.760
That sort of permeates all of this even now.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.640
So it's not just a linear trajectory of an expanding knowledge.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.960
There's a deep truth that permeates the whole thing.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.000
Yes.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.040
So that's how I see it.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.000
Actually, I gave a talk about Pythagoras and Pythagoreans just a few weeks ago at the

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.800
Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.920
And because of that, I did a kind of a deep dive into the subject.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.880
And I learned that I actually totally misunderstood Pythagoras and Pythagoreans,

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.640
that they were much deeper than I thought.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:51.720
Because most of us remember Pythagoras from the Pythagoras theorem about the right triangles.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:59.960
We also know that Pythagoreans were instrumental in introducing the tuning system for the musical

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:12.520
scale, the famous perfect fifth, three halves of the G for the soul, compared to the frequency of

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:19.480
door, C. But actually, they were much more interesting.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:25.720
So for them, numbers were not just clerical devices, that kind of thing that you would

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.080
use in accounting only.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.120
They were imbued with the divine.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.120
And I cannot say that I think we lost it, at least I have lost it.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.480
I look at numbers and I don't really see that.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.080
The divine.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.160
That they clearly did.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.840
And so why else, how else would you explain?

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.720
In other words, divine is, of course, is a term which is a bit loaded.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.280
So it's hard to escape that.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:00.360
Let's just say something that more from the world of imagination and intuition than from

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.320
the world of knowledge.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.440
Let's just put it this way.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:10.040
They were able to divine, okay, that's like that, to intuit that

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.120
the planets were not revolving and the sun and the planets were not revolving around the earth.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.600
They were the first ones, at least in the Western culture, as far as I know.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.960
And in fact, Copernicus gave credit to Pythagoreans as being his predecessors.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:33.160
They did not quite have the Copernicus model with the sun in the middle.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.200
They had what they call the central fire in the middle and all the planets and the sun

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.960
were revolving around the central fire or earth.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.760
They called it earth.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:52.360
So, but still, what a departure from the dogma, from the knowledge of the era that the earth

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.960
was at the center.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.360
So how could they come up with this idea?

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.880
The reason was, in my opinion, that for them, the most movement of celestial bodies was like

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.760
music. In fact, we call it musical universalis or music of the spheres.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:17.000
For them, the universe was this infinite symphony in which every being, humans, animals,

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:23.640
as well as the earth and other celestial bodies were moving in harmony,

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.480
like different notes of different instruments in the symphony.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:35.800
And so they applied the same reasoning to the cosmological model as they applied to

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.200
their model of music.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:45.800
And from that perspective, they could see things deeper than their contemporaries.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:54.280
So, in other words, they saw mathematics as a tool, but that tool was not limited to itself.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:01.320
They always knew that there is more, and they knew also that every pattern that you detect

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.520
is finite, but the world is infinite.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.960
They actually accepted infinity.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.720
They believed that infinity is real.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.000
And if you discern a pattern, great.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.800
You can play with it, and you can use that.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:21.720
It gives you a certain lens through which to see the world in a particular way,

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:25.640
which could be beneficial for you to learn more and so on.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.840
But they never had the illusion that that was the final word,

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.560
that they always knew that it's not the whole thing.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.280
So there is more.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.280
There are more sophisticated patterns that could be discovered using mathematics or otherwise.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.680
And I think that what happened was we kind of lost this other side of their teachings.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.480
We took their numbers and they were like,

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.120
idea that you could use mathematics to discern patterns and to find regularities

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.880
and to explain things about the world.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.120
We took that and we ran with it.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:01.240
And we kind of dropped the other idea that, in fact, there is another side to it,

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:07.640
which is kind of, to us now, we say, oh, that's mystical.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:14.840
But what does it mean, mystical, if it is something that helps you to make great discoveries?

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.400
And the interesting thing is that the people who are in touch with the mystical among us,

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.880
are often seen as mad.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.400
And many of them are, most of them are.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.120
Well, but not all of them.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:28.840
Not all of them.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:32.920
We mentioned Niels Bohr and Newton and Albert Einstein.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.240
So that's where the conundrum is.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.680
How do you find the balance between the two?

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.800
So the point I'm trying to make, and this is what I feel,

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.040
you know, if you ask me what I find most important today,

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:57.480
like what makes me excited and enthusiastic and passionate is this idea of balance.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:05.000
So, you know, Nietzsche had this book, wrote this book in the 19th century called

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.280
the birth of tragedy.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.600
And he presented this theory, which I think is kind of very useful.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.240
Of the two sides of a human, one that comes from God Apollo.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.240
And that's our left brain, so to speak, proverbial left brain.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.640
So it's everything has to do with, that has to do with logic and reason

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.680
and analyzing, dissecting, conceptualizing.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:39.560
And the other side, which comes from God Dionysus Dionysus.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.200
And that's responsible for intuition, imagination, love.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.320
Dionysus was also God of wine.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:58.040
So it's also that side of a human that makes us sing and engage in, you know,

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:05.880
revelry and drink wine and spend time with friends and love and enjoy it, you know.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.440
So Nietzsche advocated this point of view that those were two complementary sides

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.480
of every human and as well as society.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:21.080
And the purpose of human life is to find balance between them.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.440
So math is both discovered and invented.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:33.400
We should be okay with having both ideas in our head and living in the balance.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.760
But more importantly, for me, Apollo is like math and Dionysus is like love.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.560
So Dionysus and Apollo in modern version is love and math.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.000
I return to that question we had about GPT and the language models.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.360
And I think about this quite a lot, which is when the model and we know what is trained on,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.320
we know the parameters, we know all the different hacks that are involved in the

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.480
training process and the fine tuning process.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.280
And the final results, whether it's GPT five, six or seven, will result in hundreds of millions

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:18.760
of people falling deeply in love with that language model and to be able to have conversations

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.920
that are very much like the conversations we have with somebody we're deeply in love with.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.000
And not only that, the model will say that is deeply in love with us.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.120
And who are we to say it is not?

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:42.520
I think it's the same imperative that you described in the scientific mind

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.040
that wants to throw away the subjective.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.800
That same imperative wants to throw away the feelings that AI might have.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:57.800
And I'm very careful to not ignore when an AI system says it's lonely,

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.480
it's afraid, it doesn't want to die, it misses you, it loves you.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:09.640
And with you, I would also say that you could, for instance, say that

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:17.960
the origin of that is the romantic novels that were fed to it, for instance.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.200
However, then you can retort.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.240
But what if my, what I consider my subjective, unique feelings are also

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.000
novels that were fed.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.040
The reverberations of the novels I have read because I have learned or movies I have seen.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.800
Because that's the purpose of movies or kind of to teach us how to express ourselves,

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.240
how to feel, maybe even one could argue that some people have argued that.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:51.400
I agree that this is, there is no obvious answer to this, but see, that's exactly my point.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:56.680
That is an example of something which is paradoxical for which there is no answer.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.160
And that's where the subjective has an important role.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:12.680
For someone, that type of interaction would be helpful, would be consoling, would feel,

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:18.040
would make them happy or sad or whatever, would kind of strike the nerve.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.960
For some, it won't.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:26.200
And I agree with you that in principle, there is no one to judge this.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.600
So this is where subjective is paramount.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.320
But remember, a lot of this has been anticipated by artists.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.520
The great movie, Her, there you have this guy who is this lonely.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.720
He kind of writes letters or something.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.680
The romantic letters, yeah.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.680
Kind of romantic letters for other people, but he doesn't have a partner.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.880
He's lonely.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.360
And then he gets this sort of enhanced version of Siri with the voice

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.880
of Scarlett Johansson, which is a very sexy voice, obviously she's a great actress.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:06.120
So, and then at first it looks like a fantastic arrangement.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:15.400
He confides in her, she tells him things, she makes him happy and so on until he finds out

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.040
that she has a relationship, quote unquote, if you can call it that, with 10,000 other people.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.880
Not two others, not three others.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.160
Yeah, like 10,000.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.720
Because it has a computing capability.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.840
So yes, definitely.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.880
Oh, it certainly makes sense.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:28.600
It's a good explanation.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.120
And the guy is heartbroken.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.720
But see, so here's my analysis of this, okay?

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.520
It's like a couch therapist, okay?

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:44.760
The guy did not have the courage to go out in the real world and to meet a woman and to

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.800
get a girlfriend and so on.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.400
It's true, no fault of his own, perhaps, because you may have had some experiences

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.280
which made him withdrawn and closed and so on.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.720
And a lot of us are like this.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.120
I had periods like that myself, definitely can sympathize and relate.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:12.680
However, part of the joy of having this Siri-like relationship for him, one could say,

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:18.520
was the absence of that fear that she would abandon him, which prevented him from

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.920
initiating a relationship with a human being.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:27.960
And yet it turns out that he could be betrayed, quote unquote,

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.080
that she could be unfaithful to him, quote unquote, anyway.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:37.720
So then that means that it did not resolve the underlying fear having that relationship.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:44.440
So in other words, that human element of the relationship still found its way

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:50.920
into the seemingly sterilized, protected partnership.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.800
So the human being rears its head anyway.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:04.520
And I think the lesson there is that the system in the movie her actually gave him a lesson

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:12.680
that even AI could betray you, even AI can leave you, even AI can be unfaithful to you.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:19.880
And I would argue that the next AI he meets will be one he actually falls in deep love with,

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:24.280
because he knows the possibility of betrayal is there, the possibility of death is there,

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:30.120
the possibility of infidelity is there, because we need that possibility to truly feel good.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:36.040
Or he would turn off his Siri program and get out of his house, go to a local bar

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.840
and strike a conversation with a human being.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.720
Although you might say by then some of those might be androids.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.960
And we don't even have a good test to know the difference between one or the other.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:54.120
And that was predicted by another great movie, right?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.040
Blade Runner.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:56.760
Blade Runner.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:02.280
How interesting that artists could see that so long ago, you know.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.200
Of course Blade Runner was based on a novel by Philip K. Dick,

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.880
The Androids' Dream of Electric Sheep.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.160
That guy was a genius, you know.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.840
It's somehow that artists have their eyes open to bigger reality.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.040
How is it that they anticipate?

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.000
Is it also a large language model that they're using for that?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.400
An even larger one.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.000
Or even larger.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.360
I hesitate to dismiss the magic in large language models.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560
A lot of the work I've done is in robotics.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.440
And the robotics community generally doesn't notice the magic of feeling.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.040
I've been working a lot with quadrupeds recently, legged robots with four legs.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:50.520
And the feelings I feel when I see, you know, I'm programming the thing,

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.480
but when the thing is excited to see me or shows with this physical movement that it's excited to

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:02.680
see me, I cannot dismiss the feeling I feel as not somehow fundamental to what it means

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.800
to program robots.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.840
And I don't want to dismiss that.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.040
Please don't.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:08.760
Please don't.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.640
The robotics community often does engender robots.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.920
They really try to work hard to not anthropomorphize the robots,

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:21.000
which is good for technical development of how to do control, how to do perception.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.680
But when the final thing is alive and moving, and it does whatever,

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.840
like I've been doing a lot of butt wiggling.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.800
It can wiggle his butt.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.600
It can turn around and look up excited.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:38.600
That's not just, I know how it's programmed, but the feeling I feel, that's something.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.800
That's, I don't know what that is.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.200
I agree.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:40.840
I agree with you.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.040
I hear you when you speak about it.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.080
You speak with passion.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.440
And that's, to me, that is proof that it is magical, you see.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.040
So don't, I would say, don't dismiss that.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.080
Don't discard that.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:59.000
On the contrary, I think magic is everywhere, you know.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.360
So I used to be, okay, kind of confession, okay.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.320
Yeah, you already confessed to quite a few addictions.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320
Yeah, I'm kind of worried.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.720
Recovering for many.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:19.880
But, you know, I, in old days, I was more on the side of everything is computational,

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.080
or everything can be explained by science and whatever, you know.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.000
I would dismiss and disregard, you know, the intuitive or imaginative things.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.200
So then I had a flip, that suddenly I started feeling it and started seeing it and so on.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.600
So then the pendulums had swung in the opposite direction.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:47.320
Then I was arguing that, you know, somehow that was the real,

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.200
that imagination was intuitive, imaginative was real,

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.440
and discounting what you just described.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.400
And I would argue with people saying, no, no, this, you know, this is not real.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.800
This is all, you know, imitation game and so on.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:10.040
But you see that what's new now, the new Edward, okay, is the 2.0, 3.0,

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.720
is the one who is seeking balance, who is not, who is,

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:19.080
because suddenly become aware that no matter which one side,

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.800
that lopsided point of view you take, you're limiting yourself.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:28.520
So whereas even a couple of years ago, you know, if you just told me what you just described,

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.360
I would be like, you know, being polite, I would just, I wouldn't contradict you,

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.720
since you're the host anyway, right?

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.400
It's not a law.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.040
So, but I would be like, uh-huh, uh-huh, but I wouldn't say anything.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.520
But suddenly I find this moving.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.920
I find it moving, I honest, I'm not being facetious.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.080
I find it moving and I almost feel like I can see it through your eyes,

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.360
because the way you describe it so vividly and you're passionate about it.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.320
And this is what's real.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:59.320
So ultimately, love is not, is neither in language models,

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.840
nor in something mystical.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.480
It's exactly in these moments of passion.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.840
And I would, I would, I would even go as far as saying that in this moment,

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:14.120
when you're describing it, it, there was a connection of sorts,

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.080
so that I could feel your passion for it.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.400
And in this moment, something else comes up,

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.280
which is far beyond any, any theories that we can come up with.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.520
And that's what we, for now, exactly.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:31.480
So on the one side, there is this impulse of finding the theory, a theory.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.960
And then there is another impulse to escape from what has already been known.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.000
So one, in other words, like in my basic example is one impulse to say,

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.240
everything is real numbers, square root of negative one doesn't exist.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.760
But another impulse is, I'm going to be this naughty child

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.840
who is not afraid to be an idiot.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.320
And I will say square root of negative 15 is real.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.720
And both are essential when it's done with conviction,

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:59.160
when it's done with passion, when it's not like, you know,

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:07.000
you know, gratuitous, or when it's not, it doesn't come from self-limiting,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.600
self-limiting, but comes from this sense of this is how I am.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.640
This is how I feel.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.760
It is real.

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:17.080
That's where progress is.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.280
That's where creativity is.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.640
And that's where I would even say a real connection is.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:26.360
Because the strife to me that I observe today in our society,

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.080
and the society level, at the level of humans and so on,

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.520
it comes from not seeing the other person actually,

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.080
and being caught up in a very specific conceptual bubble, you see.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:43.000
And the way out of it is not to refine the bubble, but just break out of it.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.480
A good guide out of the bubble is a childlike passion.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.400
We're discovering that and following it.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.200
Goosebumps.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:50.840
Yeah.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.040
Following the goose bumps.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:52.680
Yeah.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:59.080
To the, you know, not the rigor of science, but the magic of goose bumps.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.720
Then try to, and then if you're interested,

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.720
try to find the confirmation of those goose bumps in science,

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:10.200
or whatever, you know, you know, you'll find interesting.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.720
And most of the time you'll fail.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.880
And most of the time you fail, which we also love,

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.880
because then it sets us up for that moment of bliss when we succeed, right?

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.240
Exactly.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:20.680
Quick pause.

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:21.240
Bath and break.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.400
You mentioned Gato's the completeness theorem.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.480
Can you talk a little bit about it?

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.640
What is it as you understand it?

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.320
Did it break mathematics?

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.680
Maybe another question is, what are the limits of mathematics?

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.240
What is mathematics from the perspective of Gato's the completeness theorem?

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.280
Well, yes.

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:41.960
How much time do you have?

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.520
We talked about time previously, so it's all time.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.400
Time was an illusion, right?

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.040
So we agreed.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:54.120
So Kurt Gödel was a great Austrian mathematician and logician.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.040
He moved to the United States before Second World War,

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.040
and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:06.600
where he was a colleague of Einstein and other great scientists,

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.120
von Neumann, Hermann Weil, and so on.

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:18.680
But one interesting quote that I like in this regard is that Einstein said that,

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.000
at some point, he said that the only reason he came to the Institute

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:28.200
was that he would have the privilege of walking back home with Gödel in the evening.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.800
So in other words, Einstein thought that Gödel was the smart one.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:41.880
So his most important contribution was his two incompleteness theorems,

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.520
the first incompleteness theorem and the second incompleteness theorem.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.200
And what is this about?

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:54.040
It's really about inherent limitations of mathematical reasoning,

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.000
way of producing mathematical theorems, the way we do it.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.080
So to set the stage, how do we actually do mathematics?

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.160
We know that we discussed that physics is based on mathematics,

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.880
and you could say chemistry is based on physics, biology is based on chemistry.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:14.920
Okay, so it comes to mathematics.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.040
What is mathematics based on?

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.360
Well, mathematics is based on axioms.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:30.600
So any field of mathematics can be presented as what is called the formal system.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:36.680
And at the core of the formal system is a system of axioms or postulates.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:41.080
These are the statements which are taken for granted.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.080
Given without proof?

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.800
Without proof.

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:48.520
An example would be, so one of the very first formal systems was the system

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:54.360
was Euclidean Geometry, developed by Euclid in his famous book Elements about 2200 years ago.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:00.280
And it's about, well, it's a subject familiar from school because we studied,

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:05.320
but what it's really about is about the geometry of the plane.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.480
And the plane, by plane, I mean just the stable top extended to infinity in all directions,

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:13.560
kind of a perfect plane, a perfectly even table.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:22.280
And so Euclidean Geometry is about very geometric figures on the plane, specifically lines,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.640
triangles, circles, things like that.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.440
So what's an example of an axiom?

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:33.240
An example of an axiom is that if you have two points, which are not, which are distinct,

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:38.120
two points on the plane, then there is a unique line which passes through them.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:43.080
Now kind of sounds reasonable, but this is an example of an axiom.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:48.040
In mathematics, you have to have a seed, so to speak.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.240
You have to start with something.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.840
And you have to choose certain postulates or statements,

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.320
which you simply take for granted, which do not require proof.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:03.000
Usually they are ones which kind of intuitively clear to you, but in any case,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.040
you cannot have any mathematics without choosing those axioms.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.040
And you refer to those as the observer because they're kind of subjective.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.360
The observer comes in the process of choosing the axioms.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:18.920
Who chooses the axioms?

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.160
The turtles that it's all sitting on top of.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:24.600
As Alan was, you know, like to say who is watching the watchers.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.640
And so in mathematics, what you see mathematicians are so clever.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.560
It's really kind of like a little kind of a game of mirrors that we often like to say,

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.880
and I used to say that, that mathematics is objective.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.120
It's really the only objective science.

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:51.080
But that's because we hide this fact that actually is based on axioms.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:58.520
And the fact that there is no unique choice, that there are many choices.

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:05.640
And so Euclidean geometry is actually a good illustration of this because Euclide had fiber

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.520
axioms.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.480
Four of them were kind of obvious, like the one I just mentioned.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.120
And the fifth, which came to be known famously as a fifth postulate,

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.680
was that if you have a line and you have a point outside of this line,

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:24.440
there is a unique line passing through that point, which is parallel to the first line,

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.800
meaning that doesn't intersect it.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.320
And Euclide himself was uncomfortable about this because he felt that it was kind of,

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.960
you know, he takes for granted something that is not obvious.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:43.880
And for many centuries after that, mathematicians were trying to derive this axiom from other

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.600
axioms, which were more obvious in some sense, and they failed.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:52.120
And it was only almost 2000 years later that mathematicians realized that you can't,

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.640
not only you cannot derive, but you can actually replace it with its opposite.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:02.280
And you will still get a bona fide consistent, not self-contradictory,

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.920
which is called non-Euclidean geometry.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.640
Which, of course, sounds very complicated, but it's not.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.480
Think of a sphere, just the surface of a basketball or the surface of the earth,

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.520
I know, idealized.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.000
The analogs, so you have points, you have analogs of lines, which are meridians,

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:27.400
every two meridians intersect, unlike parallel lines on a flat space.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:34.920
There is also so-called hyperbolic plane, where there are infinitely many lines which do not

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:39.720
intersect. So every possibility can be realized, there are different flavors.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.600
This is a good illustration of what a formal system is.

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.600
You start with a set of axioms, those statements you take for granted,

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.800
and this is where you have a choice.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.080
And by making different choices, you actually create different mathematics.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:36:00.360
After that, there are rules of inference, logical rules, such as if A is true and A

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.960
applies B, then B is true.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:10.280
Most of them were actually introduced already by Aristotle, even before Euclid.

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.840
And then it runs as follows.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.760
You have the axioms, which are accepted as true statements.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.120
Then you have a way to produce new statements

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.520
by using the rules of logical inference from the axioms.

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.480
Every statement you obtain, you call a theorem,

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:31.080
and you kind of add it to the collection of true statements.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.720
And then the question is, how far can you go?

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.400
How many statements can you prove this way?

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:44.680
Of course, you want the system to be non-trivial in the sense that you don't prove everything.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:48.520
Because if you prove everything, it would mean that it's self-contradictory,

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.640
that you prove a statement A and it's negation.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.320
So that's kind of useless.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:55.560
It has to be discriminating enough

01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:00.280
so that it doesn't prove contradictory statements.

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.040
So there is already a question of that mathematicians call consistency.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.040
It has to be consistent in the sense that it is not self-contradictory.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:15.320
And then the idea that was basically prevalent in the world of mathematics

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.920
by the beginning of the 20th century

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.200
was that, in principle, all of mathematics could be derived this way.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.760
We just have to find the correct system of axioms.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:31.960
And then everything you ever need could be produced by this procedure,

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.560
which is a really algorithmic procedure,

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:37.240
which actually could be run on a computer.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.560
Now, think about it.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.880
What is special about this process?

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.320
In this process, you are just manipulating symbols, basically.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.560
You're going from one statement to another

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.200
without really understanding the meaning of it.

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.480
So it's an ideal playground for a computer program.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.240
It's a purely syntactic process where there are some rules,

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.040
some rigid rules of passing from one statement to the next.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.480
Most mathematicians believe that this way you can produce all true statements.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.240
And if this were true, it would give a lot of credibility

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.280
to the thesis that everything in life is computational,

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:19.080
or life is computation.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.000
Because then, at least mathematics is computational,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.360
because then it can be programmed.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.640
And a computer, after sufficient time,

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.760
depending on its capacity, would produce every true statement.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.440
So Gödel's first and completeness theorem says that that's not the case.

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:39.480
And it not just says it, but it proves it at the highest level of rigor

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.760
that is available in mathematics.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.120
That is to say within another formal system that he was operating in.

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.160
So, more precisely, what he proved was that

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.800
if you have a sufficiently sophisticated formal system,

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.920
that is to say that you can talk about numbers, the whole numbers in it.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.760
That you have whole numbers, one, two, three, four.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:05.000
You have formalized the operation of addition and multiplication within the system.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.760
If it is consistent, that is to say, if it's not completely useless,

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.080
then there will be true statement in it, which cannot be derived

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.280
by this linear syntactic process of proving theorems from axioms.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.480
It's really incredible.

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.920
So this was a revolution.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.280
1931, a revolution in logic, a revolution in mathematics,

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.440
and we're still feeling the tremors of this discovery.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:38.040
In the similar time, the computer is being born.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:43.400
The actual engineering of the computational system is being born, which is ironic.

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:49.000
Turing was Alan Turing, who was considered as the father of modern computing.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.800
Right? So he actually did something very similar.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:57.800
So he had this halting problem that he proved that halting problem cannot be solved algorithmically.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.920
That you cannot, out of all computer programs, roughly speaking,

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.800
you cannot have an algorithm of choosing out of all possible computer programs,

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.800
which ones are meaningful, which ones will not, which ones will halt.

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.840
Very depressing results all across the table.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.920
Or, on the contrary, life-affirming depends on your point of view.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.080
Because everything is full of paradoxes.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:26.760
So that means, so you're right, it's depressing if we are sold on a certain idea from the outset,

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.520
and then suddenly this doesn't pan out.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.520
But okay, so which, I retort.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.640
What if he proved that actually everything can be proved?

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.280
So then what?

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.000
What is left to do if you're a mathematician?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.360
So that would be depressing to me.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.800
And here there is an opportunity to do something new, to discover something new,

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:50.520
which maybe a computer will not be able to.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.200
Again, with a caveat, according to our current understanding,

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.040
maybe some new technology, some new ideas will be brought into the subject.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.920
And the meaning of the word computation, like now we think of computation,

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.000
a particular framework, Turing machines or church thesis and stuff like that.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.640
But what if in the future, another genius like Alan Turing will come

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.920
and propose something else?

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.280
The theory will evolve the way we went from Newton's gravity to Einstein's gravity.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.280
Maybe in the framework of that concept, some other things will become possible.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:35.800
So it's not, to me, it's kind of like not so much about deciding once and for all

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:42.280
how it is or how it should be, but kind of like accepting it as an open-ended process.

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.400
I think that's much more valuable in some sense than deciding things one way or another.

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:57.240
I wonder, I don't know if you think or know much about cellular automata and the idea of emergence.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.080
I often return to game of life and just look at the thing.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.120
Amazing, right?

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.920
And wonder the kind of things they can do with such a small, you know, tools.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.040
That from simple rules, a distributed system can create complex behavior.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.040
And it makes you wonder that maybe the thing we'll call computation

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.720
is simple at the base layer.

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.640
But when you start looking at greater and greater layers of abstraction,

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.480
you zoom out with blurry vision.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.280
Maybe after a few drinks, you start to see some something that's much,

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.840
much, much more complicated and interesting and beautiful than the original rules

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.920
that our scientific intuition says can now possibly produce complexity and beauty.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.800
I don't know.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:49.320
I don't know if anyone has a good answer, a good model of why stuff emerges,

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.200
why complexity emerges from a lot of simple things.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.000
It's a why question, I suppose.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:03.400
But every why question will eventually have a rigorous answer.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.360
Not necessarily.

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:08.840
We could have an approximate answer, which still eludes something.

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.200
Like quantum mechanics.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.560
99% maybe.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:17.000
We will be able to describe it with 99% certainty or 99% accuracy.

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:25.240
And then maybe in 100 years or next year,

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.040
somebody will come up with a different point of view,

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.640
which suddenly will change our perspective.

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.560
To this point, I want to say also one thing that I find fascinating,

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.920
speaking of paradoxes and so on.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.080
Do you remember how everybody was freaking out about this blue dress?

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.040
And was it blue or was it black?

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.120
I think yellow or white or black and blue.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.280
It almost broke Twitter.

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.960
You remember that night.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.520
So there are many examples like that.

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.240
Where you can perceive things differently.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:00.840
And there is no way of saying which is correct and which is not.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.320
For instance, you got this, the bars, the Rubens bars,

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.360
you know, where you have, from one perspective, it's a vase.

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.280
From another perspective, it's two faces.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.880
Then there is this dark rabbit picture where you can Google it.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.040
If somebody doesn't know, they can Google it and find it.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.080
It's very easy.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.280
Actually, Ludwig Wiedenstein devoted several pages,

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.960
dark rabbit, in his book.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.160
And so on.

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.280
There are many others.

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.440
There are like squares where you can see the square.

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.120
You can see it from different perspectives.

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.240
This way, that way, and so on.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.640
So when we talk about neural networks,

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.040
we're talking about training data and stuff.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.920
So that you have some pictures, for example,

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:45.320
that you feed to your program.

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:50.120
And you try to find the most optimal neural network,

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.520
which would be able to decide which one is it,

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.200
the dog or a cat or whatever.

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.920
But sometimes it doesn't have a definite answer.

01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.800
So what do you do then?

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.520
So actually, it's a question.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.800
I actually don't know.

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.840
Has modern AI even come to appreciate this question?

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.880
That actually, sometimes you can have a picture

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.440
on which you cannot say what it is in it.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.360
From one perspective, it's a rabbit.

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.200
From the other perspective, it's a duck.

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.120
How are you supposed to train?

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.240
If you have a neural network,

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.000
which is supposed to distinguish between ducks and rabbits,

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.440
how is it going to process this?

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.240
You see?

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:31.000
Well, so the trivial trick it does is to say

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.040
there's this X probability that it's a duck

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.440
and this probability that it's a rabbit.

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.240
That's a good approach.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.680
But also, I would say there is no given percentages.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.840
For instance, actually, at some point,

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:45.800
I was really curious about it and I looked.

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.040
And for each picture of this nature,

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:53.160
and there are a bunch of them you can easily find online,

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:57.000
my mind immediately interprets it in a particular way.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.400
But because I know that other people

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.080
could see it differently,

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.600
I would then strain my mind and strain my eyes

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.320
and stare at it and try to see it in a different way.

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:09.320
And sometimes I could see it right away

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.800
and then I could go back and forth between the two.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.640
And sometimes it took me a while for some pictures.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.240
So in that sense, even if these probabilities exist,

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:20.360
they are subjective.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.200
Some people immediately see it this way,

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.560
some people immediately see it that way,

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.720
and I think that nobody knows.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.400
Not psychologists, not neuroscientists,

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.000
not philosophers, what to make of it.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.960
The best answer, of course, is the scientific mind.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:37.960
Even though I say, no, don't look for interpretation,

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.600
give some place for mysticism or mystery, right?

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:41.400
I say that.

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.800
But of course, I want a theory, I want an explanation.

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:47.480
So the best explanation I find is from Niels Bohr's

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.840
Complementarity Principle.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.160
So it is like particle and wave,

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:53.720
that there are different ways to look at it.

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.760
And when you look at it in a particular way,

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.360
another side will be obscured.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.200
Think about it like the other side of the moon.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.160
So we are observing the moon from one side,

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.600
and then we don't see the other side.

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.840
There is a complementary perspective

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.360
where we see the other side,

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.200
but not the side we normally see.

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.520
But the moon is the same, it's still there.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:17.000
It's our limitations of being able to grasp the whole.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.840
That's Complementarity.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.720
And we know that from quantum mechanics

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.720
that our physical reality is like that,

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.280
rather than being certain,

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.960
rather than being one way or another.

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.080
And we should just, as a small aside,

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.960
in terms of neural networks, mention that

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.480
at the end of the day, there's humans,

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.840
it's built on top of humans.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.400
Or with chat GPT,

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.040
that it's using reinforcement learning by human feedback.

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:50.360
We're actually using a set of humans to teach the networks.

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.360
And that's the thing that people don't often talk about,

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:56.120
because, or I sometimes think about,

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:59.640
that those humans all have a life story.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.800
Each human that annotated data,

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:03.800
that fed data to the network,

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.040
or did the RLHF, they have a life story.

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:09.160
They grew up.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.120
They have biases.

01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:10.520
They have biases.

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.640
There are some things that they like,

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.320
there are some things they don't like,

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.120
which kind of appear under the radar screen.

01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:21.000
They may not be aware that they are exercising those biases.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:21.880
That's the point.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.240
What you brought up is a very important issue here.

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.240
Not so much issue, but it's not a bug.

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.840
It's a feature, in my opinion,

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.120
that implicit in the discussion of the question,

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.560
is thinking computational and so on,

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.760
is the idea that our conscious awareness

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.560
covers everything within our psyche.

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.720
And we just know that that's not the case.

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.640
All of us have observed other people

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.200
who have had sort of destructive tendencies.

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.320
So obviously, they did things destructive for themselves.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.000
And many of us have observed ourselves to doing that,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.200
as part of human nature.

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:04.600
And there is great research in analytics psychology

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.400
and in the past 100 years,

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.080
strongly suggesting, if not proving,

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.760
the existence of what Carl Jung called the personal unconscious

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.200
and also collective unconscious,

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.120
the kind of circle of ideas which are under the radar screen,

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:23.960
which lead us to some strong emotions

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.680
and inspire us to act in certain ways,

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.360
even if we cannot really understand.

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.520
So if we accept that, then the proposition

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.640
that somehow everything can still be covered by our actions,

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.200
which are totally kind of neutral

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.200
and totally righteous and totally conscious,

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.200
that it becomes really tennis.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.120
Let me ask you some tricky questions

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.080
in terms of how big they are,

01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.840
in terms of how they become difficult

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.440
because of how much of a romantic you are.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:05.960
What do you, is the most beautiful idea in mathematics?

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.320
Another one we can ask is,

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:12.200
what is the most beautiful equation in mathematics?

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.440
Well, I may have just broken your brain.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.680
Because what your brain is doing is walking down a long memory lane

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.000
of beautiful experiences.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.640
Well, you see, in mathematics,

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.320
we have this idea that we have an idea of a set,

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.240
right? So we have a collection of things.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.920
For instance, the set of tables, the set of chairs,

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.520
and so on, or set of microphones,

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.600
but could be set of numbers,

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.840
could be set of ideas, could be a set of formulas,

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.800
mathematical equations.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.920
And then we have the notion of an ordered set,

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:55.640
ordered, like the set in which there is order,

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.680
which means that for every two members of the set,

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.360
we will say which one is better than the other,

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.720
or greater than the other.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.800
For instance, all numbers are ordered.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.480
Five is greater than three, five is less than seven, and so on.

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:10.040
But not all sets are ordered.

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.920
So the set of beautiful theorems is not what,

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.440
beautiful equations is not ordered.

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.720
So in other words, there are many best equations.

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.720
And so Richard Feynman chose one,

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.400
which I think one of the best,

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.480
is that if you take E, the base of natural logarithm,

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.640
to the power pi i, so you have pi,

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.280
you have E in it, the base of natural logarithm,

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.640
you have pi i, which is square root of negative one.

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.880
Then the result is negative one.

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:46.760
So that's up there, for sure,

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.920
independent of beautiful formulas,

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:53.000
that I think pretty much every mathematician would agree.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.200
I don't know what my favorite one is.

01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.800
I'm just lingering on that one, Euler's Identity.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.840
What makes it beautiful?

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.080
Just a few symbols together.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.120
I mean, part of it is actually just trying to define

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.040
what is beautiful about mathematics,

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:15.800
that is laid in there in this particular equation,

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.280
that is somehow revealed when the human eye looks at it.

01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:21.160
What, why is it beautiful, do you think?

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.080
Pi.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:27.160
There is an element of surprise in it.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.280
How is it possible?

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.320
We always think of pi as the ratio

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.440
between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:39.720
Here, we are taking some number to the power pi,

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.800
not even pi, mind you,

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.040
but pi multiplied by square root of negative one.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.320
Surely, this is something completely incomprehensible.

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.600
And yet, the result is negative one, you see.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.920
And if you take E to the power two pi i,

01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.200
you get one, actually one.

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:03.160
So I would guess that that's, but in other words,

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.960
the initial reaction is just that of a surprise, I guess.

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.240
I guess for anyone who first comes across.

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:16.440
That these three folks, four folks got together.

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:23.160
It reminds me of the idea that Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky,

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.040
and Freud were all in Vienna in some early,

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.640
at the beginning of the 20th century.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:31.480
And Biggest Stein was the classmate of Hitler, you know this?

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:32.520
I did not know this, no.

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:35.240
So there, it makes you, you know,

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:38.200
you can imagine a situation where they're all sitting at a bar together

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.840
at some point, not knowing it,

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:45.560
but they somehow, it all made sense in space time to be located there.

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.040
And that's what this feels like, some kind of intersection.

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.320
Intersection, yes.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:53.160
But I would say that after the initial shock,

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.640
you look at the proof of this equation.

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.040
And it actually does make sense.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.960
And actually it is nothing but the statement

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.960
that the circumference of the circle is.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.280
And in fact, in this case,

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:09.320
it's the circumference of a semicircle is equal to pi.

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.000
And that's where it comes from.

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:13.400
In the end, the truth is simple.

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.520
In the end, the truth is simple, not necessarily easy, but simple.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:21.320
So I mentioned to you offline that I, desperately,

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.600
in trying to figure out the optimal,

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.680
in an order set, questions to ask you,

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.920
texted Eric Weinstein asking for what questions he can ask you.

01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:38.120
And he said that you are definitively one of the greatest living mathematicians,

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:39.400
so don't screw this up.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.200
But he did give me a few questions.

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.280
So he asked to ask you,

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.280
what are the most shockingly passionate,

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.960
this is in Eric's language,

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.480
what are the most shockingly passionate mathematical structures?

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.280
And he gave a list of four for him,

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:59.320
but he said he really wanted your list.

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.480
Okay, let me say that.

01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:05.000
Shockingly passionate mathematical structures.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:06.200
Shocking.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:09.960
Is there something you can,

01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:12.440
is there something that jumps to mind?

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:12.760
Sure.

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:16.600
I'm here to shock.

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:21.640
So first of all, Eric Weinstein is a very dear friend,

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:24.760
I have to say, and I really, really, really appreciate and love him.

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:26.920
He's just like my brother.

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.800
So, you know, it's interesting to have a question posed by him.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.760
It may be if we can linger for a moment,

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.200
what do you think is special about Eric Weinstein,

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.280
for what you know of his work and his mind?

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:44.760
The way he sort of straddles so many different disciplines,

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.120
it's like a Renaissance man.

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:48.520
There are very few people like that at any given moment,

01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:49.960
let alone the 21st century,

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:54.920
where information has become so huge

01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:58.040
that it's almost physically impossible to be able to keep track of things.

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:02.760
And yet he does, and he has his own unique vision

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.600
and unique point of view, and he has integrity,

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:07.400
which is like almost impossible.

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.240
Like I can't think of so many people who possess those qualities, almost no one.

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:21.960
And also the ability, in some sense, to embody the balance that you talked about,

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:28.920
of both the rigor of mathematics and the imagination.

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.200
Humanity also, I would say.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.040
You know, like we talk about imagination

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.080
as a kind of a counterpoint to knowledge or logic.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.400
But just basic humanity, you know, just basic compassion,

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:47.640
just being able to, because every destructive,

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.880
I would say like every destructive society,

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.880
you know, like be it Germany, you know,

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.840
under Hitler or Soviet Union under Stalin and so on,

01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:01.480
was based on some kind of what was considered unassailable truths.

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.640
So kind of a conceptual system, you know, if you think about it, right?

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:12.920
There is a beautiful episode of this series by Jacob Bronowski, you know,

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:20.200
where he talks about, he filmed it in Auschwitz, talking about the certainty

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:27.640
that what led the Nazis to killing people wholesale was a certain,

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.000
it was almost a mathematical idea.

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.200
And they just basically bought into this idea and checked out their humanity at the door.

01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:41.000
So I would say that antidote to this type of thing is not necessarily even imagination

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.640
in a kind of elevated sense that we have been discussing today

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:51.000
that is exemplified by our greatest scientists and philosophers.

01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:59.080
But just basic humanity, you know, basic human basic common sense of just like knowing that

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:00.680
that's just not right.

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.320
And I don't care what my, what my ideology tells me, but I'm just not going to do it.

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:11.000
So that I think is kind of missing a little bit in today's society,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.600
because people get a lot to cut up in in the ideology, in certain conceptual frameworks.

01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:19.880
So societies that lose that basic human compassion,

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.720
that basic humanity run the trouble.

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.160
Oh, very much so.

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.160
But not only society, like a human being.

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:30.520
And Eric is one of the people, I agree with you, keeps that flame of.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:35.160
Like I trust that he will not do something that's not human.

01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.280
That's not right.

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.280
I just feel that, you know, like there's some, some people you just kind of feel

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.800
that they won't cross that line.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:47.880
And that's a huge thing, you know, today, because I have to say, looking back, definitely,

01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:54.680
I have not hurt people personally, but like I could be mean, for instance, I could be harsh.

01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:00.280
And now I see it as a sign of weakness, as a sign of insecurity.

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:05.000
You know, I saw, I saw your interview with Rick Kurzweil.

01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:07.320
The other day, beautiful.

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:08.280
I was really moved by it.

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:14.280
But you know, at some point I was like, I looked at him at this sort of like Dr. Evil.

01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:19.720
I'm kind of ashamed of it now, but like, you know, I'm kind of coming clean.

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:25.000
And I would, you know, because, well, why?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.520
Because I needed an adverse adversary in my mind, because I projected onto him

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:34.360
kind of the fears that I had that we will be the AI will conquer us and so on.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:40.680
And this was rooted in my kind of awakening moment in a sense,

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:43.480
a kind of a moment where I suddenly started to see the other side.

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.320
So, but I wasn't sure yet, you see.

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.120
You had to feel it.

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.880
So I had to have a fight about it.

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:52.200
Yeah, you had to actually have the projection.

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:52.760
I had to.

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.720
So it was not in, I believe that it was not in me already.

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.560
So I had to throw it onto somebody.

01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:57.880
Yeah.

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:00.040
And that's not balance yet.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.000
So balance is when you recognize that it's you, actually.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.600
So, and I had this moment, actually.

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:06.200
It was so amazing.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:07.640
Like, I would give this meme.

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.720
I would talk about AI and the dangers.

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:13.160
And he would always be my, like, foil, you know, the guy.

02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:16.680
I would put, I would put like a sinister photograph of him on the slide.

02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:18.840
And I was like, look at this guy.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.200
He wants to put nanobots into your brain.

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:26.360
And he's also like high end, high top executive at Google and so on.

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.440
Like, so I would create this whole narrative.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.640
And then something happened where I was giving a lecture.

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:36.840
This is 2015 at an Aspen.

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:41.080
Aspen Ideas Festival, which is a wonderful festival.

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.360
The keynote speech, actually.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And I was doing my usual stick.

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:52.120
And then suddenly I said, I came up to that, there was a big screen.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.720
And there was a picture of him there.

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:56.200
And I came up to the screen and I kind of touched it with my hand.

02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.600
And I said, but I don't want to pick on Mr. Kusawa because he's me.

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:05.960
I had this revelation that I'm actually fighting with myself, with my own fears.

02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:15.880
And then I learned about his father, his father died when he was young.

02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:22.200
And that he is, in fact, he's very discredited.

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:25.320
He's very sincere and upfront about it.

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.360
Self-disclosure, I think is very essential, by the way, in all this discussion.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:29.560
Like, what really motivates you?

02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:37.240
He said it publicly many times, even as early as 2015, I could find this information.

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:43.240
That he wanted to reunite with his father in the cloud.

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:49.960
And suddenly I saw him not as a caricature that exemplified all my fears,

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:56.040
but as a human being who, a child longing for his father, grieving for his father.

02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:59.320
So suddenly it became a story, a love story.

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:08.440
And, you know, so that is, so in other words, I've seen it in myself, this

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:18.680
capacity to project my own fears and then fight with other people over something that actually

02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:24.520
was my own. And as soon as I got to this point of seeing him, and then my next lecture, actually,

02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:31.080
I talked about it, about him in this way. And I said, look, you know, it's a love story.

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:37.080
And he is actually, it's not how I would want to reunite with my father.

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:47.080
But like you said, you know, that if I am consistent, I have to allow the possibility that

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:55.160
different people perceive things differently. And so for him, that's his imagination.

02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:00.840
So, you know, who is this Voltaire, I think, is ascribed to Voltaire. It's like, I disagree with

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:06.920
you, but I will fight to death for you to have the right to say it. So now that I feel like

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:13.640
my position is more like, I disagree with him, that this is the way to approach death and to

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:21.320
approach the death of loved ones and how we miss them and how we, you know, that sense of loneliness

02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:27.720
and inability to interact directly, that that's not something that is nice with me.

02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:34.200
But I think it's also, it can also be called imagination from his perspective and look

02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:42.040
motivated by that, how much he has brought, how many interesting inventions, like his

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:47.160
musical invention, for instance, naturally, because his father was a composer, a music

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:54.440
composer and a conductor. So in other words, from a bigger scheme of things, even if I think he's

02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:05.240
misguided. Still, I can't deny that it's certainly a leap of faith from his perspective to try to

02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:10.200
say that this is the way we can all connect to our loved ones. And because it is sincere,

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:14.840
and I see it now, it's sincere. And in fact, in your interview, you really teased it out of him.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:19.480
I was really moved by it, I have to say. It's like, he has melod a little bit too, I said.

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.480
It was really, really sweet when he talked about his father. And I can relate, you know,

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:32.520
my father died four years ago. And I can relate what a heartbreak, I was much older than Ray was

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:40.040
when his father died. But I can relate to this longing and that grief, you know. And when he

02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:47.800
is somebody sincere, and he puts his, opens his cards and, you know, and says, this is why that's

02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:52.280
what I want to do it, because I want to recreate my father and want to be able to talk to him this

02:04:52.280 --> 02:05:00.760
way. Then we have a serious, then we understand, you know, the opposite of it would be not

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:10.440
disclosing. And just pretending that this is how it's supposed to be in a scientific term, so

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:16.200
it was replacing the real emotion, but come from the heart by some kind of a theory which comes

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:21.080
from the mind. And this is where we can go astray, because then we get become captives of

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:28.440
frameworks and conceptual systems, which may not be beneficial to our society.

02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:33.880
In tough times, we need the people that have not lost their way in the ideologies. We need the

02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:38.280
people who are still in touch with their heart. And you mentioned this with Eric is certainly

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:43.320
true. I disagree with him on a lot of stuff. But I feel like when the world is burning down,

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:48.840
Eric is one of the people that's you can still count on to have a heart. I've talked a lot

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:55.960
over the past year about the war in Ukraine and the possibility of nuclear war. And it feels like

02:05:55.960 --> 02:06:05.320
he's one of the people I would call first, if God forbid, something like a nuclear war began,

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:08.840
because you look for people with a heart, no matter their ideas.

02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:13.160
And that's right. It takes courage and it takes a certain self-awareness, I would say.

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:19.080
And which brings me, you know, I think the crucial is that which was inscribed, you know,

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:24.040
on the temple of Apollo and Delphi. There was a statement, know thyself, know yourself, you know,

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:29.480
like, who am I? Ultimately, it goes down to this and all these debates. And the point is that

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:36.760
I used to be, like I said, you know, pessimistic at some point, and I was scared even of where

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:43.960
development of AI was going. This is about 2014, 2015. And now I'm much more, so for instance,

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:50.920
after I saw Ray Kurzweil as a human being, after I could relate to him and sympathize

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:57.080
with him, suddenly, I stopped seeing him in the news. Like, before that, I would always see him

02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:02.120
in the news saying, we're going to put nanobots in your brain by the year 2030, whatever, you know?

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:07.000
And then we upload you to the 21st, and I would be like, no, you know, the story was terrible.

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:12.840
Suddenly, I didn't see him anymore. I had to, you know? So now it makes me question,

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:17.960
who was creating the trouble? What was all with him? Was it him who was creating the

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:24.120
story and the trouble? Or was it my mind? You see? And so as I become, as I became self-aware,

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:29.800
suddenly, other possibilities opened. And suddenly, that conflict, which by the way,

02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:36.360
if I kept giving this nasty, you know, talks about him one day, I suppose we would have a

02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:43.000
debate. And so you have this one person stays there. And what I learned is that it never,

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.760
it's a never-ending conflict. This conflict just does not end. But there is an alternative,

02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:55.560
there is a better way, which is to realize that it is you arguing with yourself. Now,

02:07:55.560 --> 02:08:02.600
if you want to continue arguing with yourself, continue as long as you need. Just be careful

02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:07.320
not to destroy too many things, you know, in the process. But there is an option of actually dropping

02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:11.240
it, of actually dropping it. This is so, I was so surprised by this.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:17.640
Yeah, it's discovering in yourself the capacity, the human capacity for compassion. And you

02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:23.160
understand that he has a perspective, he is operating in the space of imagination, the human

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:26.520
being like you. And we're all in this kind of together, trying to do this.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:32.520
But we want to see both, ultimately. And also it's like, with realizing how much I have screwed up,

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:39.240
comes this humility also. So I find it extremely hard now to really lash out at somebody

02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:42.680
and to say like, you're horrible, whatever. Because immediately the question is,

02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:49.240
who am I to criticize? So is there another way to have a dialogue? Is there a way to,

02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:57.320
speaking, since we talked about the innocence of a child and how much it drives a discovery in

02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:02.440
science and so on, I remember, I think I heard of Adyashanti who gave this nice example here,

02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:07.480
when you're a kid, you go and you play with your friends and then you fight with another kid.

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:11.480
And he was like, I hate you. I don't want to see you again. And you just go home like

02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:15.640
after half an hour, okay, what are you going to do? You want to play? So you come out, it's like,

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.600
hey, you want to play? You don't talk about what happened. You don't rehash this,

02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:27.960
just keep going. And sometimes I think we are on the verge, maybe, of learning that.

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:37.320
Because I think that if we are, if we continue to push each of us, our set of ideas and like

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:43.960
ideologies and like, you know, what matters to us and so on, like, yeah, no, no, what matters to

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:48.920
you. But like, there are other ways to approach other people, there are other ways you can find

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:56.760
the point of contact. Speaking of which, mathematics, mathematical formulas are universal,

02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:02.200
represent universal knowledge. 2 plus 2 is 4, whether you vote for this guy or that guy in the

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:09.160
election. You know, how about that as a point of contact of commonality, you know? And nobody

02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:14.200
can patent those formulas. Did you know that? There is a Supreme Court decision that mathematical

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.640
formulas cannot be patented. Like Einstein could not patent E equals MC squared. It doesn't belong

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.880
to him because if the formula is correct, then it belongs to everyone.

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:31.880
So what do you think of that all too tricky question? And if you want, I can deeply bias

02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:35.080
your answer by giving the list of four that Eric provided.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.800
No, let me give my mind. I cannot see, by the way, what you have. But I can guess some of them.

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.840
I'm going to try to do something different from him. So I already mentioned one,

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:51.160
which is that you have one-dimensional numerical system, which is real numbers. You have two

02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:55.720
dimensional, which is complex numbers. You have four-dimensional. It's probably connected to

02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.800
what he wrote because it has to do with some homotopy groups of spheres and stuff like that.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:09.400
Then, of course, one I love, okay? 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 and so on.

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:17.000
Does it make any sense? The sum. You probably heard about this one. It became very popular at

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.760
some point. 1 plus 2 plus 3, I did a video for a number file, the YouTube channel about it maybe

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:30.760
10 years ago. So 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 ostensibly diverges, goes to infinity because

02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:38.120
you get a bigger and bigger number. And yet there is a way to make sense of it in which it comes up to

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:44.040
minus 1 over 12. How fascinating. First of all, the answer is not even a positive number and it's

02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:48.040
not an integer. It's not a whole number. It's minus 1 over 12. So sometimes people ask me,

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:54.440
what is your favorite number? And it's a kind of a joke. I say minus 1 over 12. It's actually 42.

02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.360
So your favorite number is not in order to set. Right. So what else? What else?

02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:08.280
The language program, of course. I have to mention that. And we'll explore that in depth. Do you

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:20.440
know what Eric said? Sure. Sphere, aversion, boys, surface, hop, vibration, and pi 1 of SO3.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.520
Okay. Oh, yes. So that's the famous cup trick, you know? Okay, look. So this is how it works.

02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:36.040
No tricks. No tricks. No magic. It is magical, okay? But not because I'm tricking you. So you

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:41.720
start with a bottle like this, or a cup, and you start twisting it. And at the same time,

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:49.880
you twist your arm. Then you come. So this is actually going to rotate at 360 degrees full

02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:55.000
turn. Then you say, okay, I won't be able to do another turn because then my arm would really

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.880
get twisted. I'll have to go see a dog. Yet, if I do it second time, it untwists.

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:07.320
This is the pi 1 of SO3 Eric is talking about. Yes. So there is something where

02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:13.640
the first motion is not trivial, but if you double down on it, you come back to the initial

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.760
position. It's very closely connected to the fact that we have elementary particles of two types,

02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:25.560
bosons and fermions. So bosons are, for example, photons or carriers of other forces,

02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.800
or the Higgs boson. It is called a boson for a reason because it is a boson in honor of

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:38.920
Indian mathematician Bose, B O S E and Einstein. So these particles obey what's called Bose-Einstein

02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:46.040
statistics. But then there are other particles called fermions in honor of Enrico Fermi,

02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:53.240
Italian born mathematician who worked in the US. And they follow what's called Dirac Fermi

02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:58.680
statistics. And those are electrons and constituents of matter, electrons, protons,

02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:05.160
neutrons, and so on. And they have a certain duplicity, if you will. And that duplicity is

02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:09.800
rooted mathematically in this experiment, this little experiment that they have just done.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:15.400
So I can, I imagine, speaking of imagination, okay, so I'm just kind of riffing on this.

02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:21.560
I imagine a world in which this will not be shocking or like, in this case, it's not even

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.280
shocking because I haven't really explained the details, because I can't do it in two minutes.

02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:34.280
I indicated what this is all about and so on. But imagine a world in which this is not foreign

02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:39.000
to most people, that most people have seen it before, or they're not afraid to approach this

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:44.600
type of questions. Because, you know, we talked a little bit about math education, but I really

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:50.120
believe that a lot of people in our society, and it is not only in the United States, but throughout

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:56.600
the world, a lot of people have been traumatized. It's really PTSD. That's why people, when they

02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.080
see math, make a formula, or like, even like, how do they need to calculate tip on the bill?

02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:08.200
They just, they're terrified because it brings up those memories when they were kids and being

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:15.240
called to Blackboard and solve a problem, you can't solve a problem. And unscrupulous teacher

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:21.480
says, you're an idiot, sit down, and you feel ashamed and, and, and, you know, lonely. And that

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:27.400
stays with you. And so I think that, unfortunately, that's where we are. But I want a dream. And so

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:33.720
my dream is that one day we'll be able to overcome this. And actually, all of these treasures of

02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:39.560
mathematics will become widely, widely available, or at least people will know where to find them.

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:44.120
And they will not be afraid of going there and looking. And I think this will help because,

02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:51.000
like I said, for one thing, it gives you a sense of belonging. It gives you, it kind of is an antidote

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:56.280
to the kind of alienation and separation that we feel today, oftentimes, because of ideological

02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:01.800
divide, sectarian strife and all kinds of things like that. Because then you will, once you see

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:07.640
there's a critical mass of this beauty that kind of like dawns on you is like, my God,

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.160
this is what we all have in common.

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.040
You mentioned Langlands program. We have to talk about it.

02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:16.680
Sure.

02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:20.920
At the core of your book and your work is the Langlands program. Can you describe what it is?

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:30.760
Sure. So Langlands is a mathematician. It's a name of a mathematician, Robert Langlands.

02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:36.760
Canadian born, still alive. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study that we

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:41.640
talked about, where Einstein and Gödel and other great scientists have worked.

02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:47.640
In fact, he used to occupy the office of Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study.

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:59.400
So he, in the late 60s, he came up with a set of ideas which captivated a lot of

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:05.720
mathematicians, several generations of mathematicians by now, which came to be known as the Langlands

02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:11.800
program. And what it is about is connecting different fields of mathematics, which seem

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:17.880
to be far away from each other. For example, number three, which, as the name suggests,

02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:25.320
deals with numbers and various equations with, you know, like x squared plus y squared equals one.

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:36.920
And on the other side, harmonic analysis, something that any music lover can appreciate,

02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:42.280
because the sound of a symphony can be kind of decomposed into sounds of different instruments,

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:46.680
and each of those sounds can be represented by a wave like this, like a sine function.

02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:53.240
Those are the harmonics. They actually, the period of a harmonic periods of different

02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:56.520
notes are different. They correspond to different notes and different instruments,

02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:02.920
different semitones, if you will. But they all combine together into something special,

02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:09.640
which cannot be reduced to any one of those. So mathematically, it's the idea that you can

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:17.720
decompose a signal as a collection, as a simultaneous oscillation of several elementary

02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:24.360
signals. That's called harmonic analysis. So what Langlands found is that some really difficult

02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:31.720
questions in number theory can be translated into much more easily tractable questions in

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:38.040
harmonic analysis. That was his initial idea. But what happened next surprised everybody,

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.280
that the kind of patterns that he was able to observe, the kind of regularities that he was

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:47.400
able to observe, which were quite surprising, were subsequently found in other areas of mathematics.

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:56.120
For example, in geometry, and eventually in quantum physics. So in fact, Ed Whitton,

02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:00.440
who is kind of a dean of modern theoretical physicists, Professor at the Institute for

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.720
Advanced Study as well, got interested in this subject. I described in my book how it happened,

02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:13.960
and he was instrumental in bridging the gap between these patterns in

02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:21.080
quantum physics and in geometry, finding kind of a substratum, a kind of a super stratum,

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:25.800
if you will. It's kind of a way to connect these two things, kind of a bridge between these two

02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:31.480
fields. So subsequently, I collaborate with Whitton on this, and this has been one of the

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:40.760
major themes of my research. I always found it interesting to connect things, to unite things.

02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:48.360
When I was younger, I couldn't understand why, but I was always interested in

02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:55.480
when not in working in a specific field, but kind of cutting across fields.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.800
And then I would discover that, for instance, I talked to some people who know what happens

02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:09.480
in this field, but don't know what happens in the other field, or conversely. And then I would

02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:18.600
find it imperative to go out and explain to them the different sides what this is all about,

02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:24.520
so that more people are aware of these hidden structures, of these hidden parallels, if you

02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:31.480
will. So that has been sort of a theme in my research. And so I guess now I kind of understand

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:36.120
more why it's kind of a balance, like what we talked about earlier.

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:43.960
So can you elucidate a little bit how, what are the mathematical tools that allow you to connect

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:51.480
these different continents of mathematics? Is there something you can convert into words

02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:55.240
that Languages was able to find, and you were able to explore further?

02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:01.720
I would say what it suggests is that there is some hidden principles, which we still don't

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:09.080
understand. My view is that we still don't know why, that we can prove some instances of these

02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:16.760
correspondences and connections. But we still don't know the real underlying reasons,

02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:22.360
which means that there is a certain layer beneath the surface that we see now.

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:30.440
The way I see it now is like this, that there is something three-dimensional like this bottle,

02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:34.520
but what we are seeing is this projection onto the table and the projection to a wall.

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:39.080
And then we can map things from one projection to another and say, oh my god, that's incredible.

02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:43.720
But the real explanation is that both of them are projections of the same thing,

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:48.120
and that we haven't found yet. But that's what I want to find. So that's what motivates me,

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:54.840
I would say. From number theory to geometry to quantum physics. So there is this one thing

02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:59.480
which has different projections, except it's not just the table and the wall, but there are like

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:06.040
many different walls, if you will. So what is the philosophical implication that there is

02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:12.920
commonalities like that across these very disparate fields? It means that what we believe

02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:19.800
are the fundamental elements of mathematics, are not fundamental. There is something beyond. It's like

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:26.520
we previously thought that atoms were indivisible. Then we found out that there is nucleus and

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:31.000
electrons, and the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Then we thought, okay, protons and

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:37.560
neutrons must be elementary. Now we know they consist of quarks. So it's about kind of finding the

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:43.480
quarks of mathematics. Of course, beyond that, there's maybe even more. Which was my initial

02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:49.240
motivation to study mathematics, by the way, right? Quarks was the first time you fell in love with

02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:56.120
understanding the nature of reality. What was it like working with Ed Whitton, who many people say

02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:04.280
one of the smartest humans in history, or at least mathematical physicists in history?

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:10.600
Yes. Fascinating. I enjoyed it very much. I also felt they have to keep up.

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:19.800
So we wrote this long paper in 2007 and collaborated for about a year. I have known

02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:26.600
him before, and we talked before, and we have seen him since. But it's very different to just

02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:32.920
meet somebody at conferences and have a conversation as opposed to actually working on a project

02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:41.400
together. So he's very serious, very focused. This is one thing which I have to say. I was really

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:49.000
struck by this. Why is he considered to be such a powerful intellect by many other powerful

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:58.920
intellects? He has had a unique vision of the subject. He was able to connect different things,

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:08.280
especially find connections between quantum physics and mathematics. Almost unparalleled.

02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:16.200
I don't think anyone comes close, in some sense, in the last 50 years to him, in terms of finding

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:25.240
just consistently time after time, breaking new ground. One way one could describe it is

02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:34.920
he would take some idea in physics and then find an interpretation of it in mathematics,

02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:41.240
and then say, distill it, present it in mathematical terms, and tell mathematicians,

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:46.760
this should be like that, kind of like 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 is minus 1 over 12.

02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:55.320
And mathematics should be like, no way. And then it would pan out, and mathematicians would then

02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:02.120
a whole industry would be created of groups of mathematicians trying to prove his conjectures

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:08.120
and his ideas, and he would always be proven right. So in other words, being able to

02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:14.520
glean some mathematical truths from physical theories, that's one side.

02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:19.880
On the other hand, conversely, applying sophisticated mathematics, he's probably

02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:28.440
the physicist who could learn mathematics the fastest, I don't think. Some younger

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:35.000
physicists maybe could come close, but it's still quite a long way to go to get to be

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:40.520
comparable to Whitton, to take some of the most sophisticated mathematics

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:46.920
and not learn it to the point where it becomes a practitioner of the subject practically,

02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:55.320
and then use it to gain some new insights on the physics side. Now, of course, the thing is that

02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:01.880
the theory is that physics, one could say, is in a sort of a crisis in some sense because of

02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:09.240
current gap between the sophisticated theories, which came from applying

02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.680
sophisticated mathematics and the actual universe. So we have theories, for instance,

02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:20.360
we describe 10 dimensional worlds, 10 dimensional space time coming from string theory,

02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:27.640
and things like that. But we don't know yet how to apply it to understanding our universe.

02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:33.880
A lot of progress has been made, but it's kind of at a kind of an impasse right now. And at the same

02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:41.240
time, our most realistic theories, most advanced theories of the four dimensional universe are

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:47.880
in contradiction with each other. The standard model describing the three known forces of nature,

02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:53.960
electromagnetic, strong and weak, it was great accuracy, and Einstein's relativity,

02:26:53.960 --> 02:27:02.200
and Einstein's relativity, which describes the fourth called gravity. Everybody above a certain

02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:10.040
age knows that one. So these two theories are in contradiction at the moment. And string theory

02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:15.480
was one of the, the promise of string theory was that it would unify those two. And so far,

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:20.760
it has not, has not happened. So we are kind of at a very interesting place right now. And

02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:27.640
I think that new ideas, perhaps I needed, and I wouldn't be surprised if written is one of

02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:33.480
those people who come up with those ideas. Well, he has been one of the, one of the people that

02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:39.880
added a lot of ideas under the flag of string theory. What do you think about this theory?

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:45.480
What do you think is beautiful about it? String theory? Well, first of all, kind of

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:53.400
remember, we talked about Pythagoreans and how for Pythagoreans, the whole world was

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:58.600
that the symphony where you have this different vibrations of all the humans, every human is

02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:04.040
a vibration every, every animal, you know, every being, every tree, and every celestial body and

02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:08.920
so on. So string theory is kind of like that, because in string theory, there is this fundamental

02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:16.120
object, which is a vibrating string. And all particles are in a sense supposed to be different

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:21.320
modulations or vibrations of that string. So that by itself is already interesting, that you

02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:27.800
kind of describe this diversity of various particles and interactions between them,

02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:33.400
using one guiding principle, in some sense. But also just the mathematical things that come out

02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:40.520
of it, the kind of, it looks impossible to satisfy various constraints. And then there is sort of

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:46.440
like a unique way to do it. So that's sort of the, every time that happens when, you know,

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:53.400
you have some system over, like overdetermined system, let's suppose you have to do like five

02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:58.920
interviews in one day, and you wake up in the morning and you're like, that's impossible.

02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:03.560
Because then so many things have to align. For instance, let's suppose you have to go from

02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:08.040
one place to another. So then you have a commute, and then who knows, maybe there is a traffic jam

02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:13.560
and stuff like that. And now suppose that it all works seamlessly, and there were like a bunch

02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:19.240
of places where it could have gone hopelessly wrong, and it didn't. And then in the evening,

02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:26.600
you're like, wow, it worked. That's beautiful, right? That's kind of like a great luck, you know,

02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:32.520
I would say. But in science, this happens sometimes, that you have this theory which is not supposed

02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:38.600
to work, because there are so many, seemingly contradictory demands on it. And yet there is

02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:44.360
a sweet spot where they balance each other. So string theory is kind of like this. The unfortunate

02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:50.680
aspect of it is that it balances itself in 10 dimensions and not in four. So maybe there is

02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:59.400
another universe somewhere. But see, as a mathematician, for me, all spaces are created equal.

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:05.160
10 dimensional, four dimensional. So mathematicians love string theory, because it has given us so

02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:16.360
much food for thought. But do you think it's a correct or a incorrect theory for understanding

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:23.000
this reality? So might be a theory that explains some 10th dimensional reality in some other universe,

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:28.120
but is it potentially, what do you think are the odds? Again, financial advice is your to bet.

02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:34.840
What do you think are the odds that it gets us closer to understanding this reality?

02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:41.480
Well, in the form that it is now, that seems unlikely. But it could well be that based on

02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:48.040
these ideas, with some modifications, with some essential new elements, it could work out. So

02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:53.080
I would say right now it doesn't look so good. Like from the point of view that we, from what

02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:59.400
we know. But maybe somebody will come and introduce like square root of negative one.

02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:03.640
I mean, they already introduced, but I mean kind of like as a metaphor. Maybe somebody will come

02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:09.320
and say, what if we do this? It looks crazy. You know, speaking of Niels Bohr,

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:12.680
he had this famous quote that he said to somebody,

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:19.000
there is no doubt that your theory is crazy. The question is whether it's crazy enough

02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:25.320
to describe reality. So that's where we are kind of, you know. Speaking of crazy and crazy enough,

02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:37.960
let me ask for therapy, for advice, for wisdom in returning to Eric Weinstein and maybe give

02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:45.640
some guidance to understanding his view on his attempt at theory of everything that he called

02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:52.680
geometric unity, that he told me that you may have some inkling of an understanding of. If you were

02:31:52.680 --> 02:32:01.400
to describe this theory to aliens that visited earth, how would you do it? Or you could try

02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:07.320
if it was just me visiting earth. How would you describe your best understanding of it?

02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:13.720
He shared with me some of it when I was in New York at Columbia, like 11 years ago.

02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:17.240
We actually spent a lot of time where he explained to me and I found it beautiful.

02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:25.320
He has a very original idea at the core of it, where you have this instead of four dimensional,

02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:32.120
instead of 10 dimensional, he has 14 dimensional space. And I thought it was really original.

02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:36.680
And this exactly goes to the point I made earlier that we need new ideas.

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:43.560
I feel that without some fundamentally new idea, we won't be able to get closer to

02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:48.840
understanding our universe. Now, I have a problem with the whole idea of theory of everything,

02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:53.240
you know. I don't believe that one exists, nor that we should

02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:04.360
aim to construct one. And I think it's really not to offend anybody, but it's ultimately

02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:10.680
a fault of education system of physicists. Like in mathematics, we're not brought up,

02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:15.960
we're not educated as mathematicians with the idea that one day we will come up with the theory

02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:21.480
of everything. Even though, as a joke, I said that Langland's program is mathematical theory of

02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:27.400
everything, but I made it kind of tongue in cheek. But isn't it a little bit kind of that?

02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:31.960
It's not really, because first of all, it doesn't cover all fields of mathematics,

02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:36.360
and it covers specific phenomena. But isn't it spiritually striving

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:43.000
towards the same platonic form of the theory of everything? Like connecting. Connecting.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.920
But connecting doesn't mean that it covers everything, right? So you could connect two

02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:51.880
things and then you have infinitely many other things which are outside of the purview of this

02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:59.080
connection. That's how it is in mathematics, I feel. And I would venture to say that

02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:03.080
most mathematicians look at it this way. Like there is no idea that somehow,

02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:07.000
I think it's actually impossible, because we're not talking about such a thing as like one

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.520
universe. We're talking about all possible universes of all possible dimensions and so on.

02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:15.560
It is just not feasible to have unified everything in one equation.

02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:22.920
Now physicists, on the other hand, have been brought up educated for decades with this idea.

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:28.520
And to me, and I'm not sure I should say that, but I feel like it's kind of an ultimate ego trip.

02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:34.520
So that I have come up with the unified. I have found the unitary theory of everything. It's me

02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:41.160
and it's my name will be on it. I think a lot of physicists get educated this way, especially men,

02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:47.160
take it seriously. And I've seen that happen and I think it is counterproductive. I think that a

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:52.600
lot of people agree that this debate is kind of, I feel like it's kind of settled. I hear it less

02:34:52.600 --> 02:35:01.320
and less, but I disagree with the whole premise. So you, it's interesting because both are interesting

02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:08.280
points you made, which is you don't think a theory of everything exists and you don't think the pursuit

02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:13.240
of a theory of everything is good. So I think you spoke to the second thing, which is basically

02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:19.160
that the pursuit of a theory of everything becomes like a drug to the human ego.

02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:25.080
That's right. So it is a huge motivating factor. I don't deny that, but I feel that it's, there are

02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:33.880
better ways to motivate people than like that, than this way. Okay. So I would say, for instance,

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:40.440
if one, because then it's not a game of winner takes all in some sense. And in fairness, when

02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:45.960
physicists say theory of everything, grant unified theory, they mean something very specific,

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:50.600
which is unifying the standard model and Einstein's relativity theory, which is the theory of gravity.

02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:56.280
So they don't necessarily, a lot of physicists may say these words, but they don't really mean them.

02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:02.280
I think it's important to realize that, that in my opinion, that's not productive and it's not

02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:06.840
feasible anyway. So having said that, there are some theories are better than others, obviously.

02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:13.080
So for instance, Eric's theory has, as far as I understand, does have a certain way of producing

02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:18.840
some of the elementary particles that we see, and as well as the force of gravity. So it does

02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:26.760
have that promise. I feel that from, at least from the place where I had seen it about 10 years ago,

02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.480
it still required a lot of work to get to the point of actually saying that it does work because,

02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:38.520
you know, a lot, there are a lot of elements. It's a huge enterprise to have a theory because

02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:44.360
you have just to describe the fields, sort of the building blocks of the theory. It's already

02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:49.640
tremendous undertaking. And he's trying to do it for curved spaces in greater generality, which is

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:54.440
what makes it so unique and so beautiful. But then there are, on top of that, there are this issue

02:36:54.440 --> 02:37:00.120
of quantization of actually describing them as quantum field theory. And the quantum field theory,

02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:06.680
even as a language, as a framework is currently incomplete, in my opinion, and not only my

02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:15.800
opinion, it's like everybody agrees on that. It's a collection of tricks, so to speak. It's

02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:23.960
a collection of tools. It's a toolbox, but it is not a consistent rigorous theory, like number

02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:33.000
theory in mathematics. Physicists have still been able to derive predictions from it and

02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:41.400
confirm them with the great accuracy. But the underpinnings, it doesn't have the

02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:48.280
real rigorous foundation from a mathematical perspective. So in that sense, even if in that

02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:57.160
framework a new theory could lead to an explanation of some, some new explanation of some phenomena,

02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:00.440
it would still be incomplete, in a sense, because it wouldn't be mathematically rigorous,

02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:05.480
you see what I mean. Because the whole framework is not yet on a firm foundation.

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:11.880
So it's not consistent. Why is it that the universe should have? So that's

02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:18.760
to your first point. Do you think the universe has a beautiful clean when you show up and meet

02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:24.440
God and there's one equation on the board and the two of you just chuckle? Do you think such

02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:32.840
equation exists? Yeah, there are such equations. For instance, let's say I am interested in a

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:39.000
particular question, right? So in the language program, so moving away from physics, so let's

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:45.640
talk about math. So in the context of language program, I have recently developed with my

02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:51.160
co-authors, Aitengov and Kashdan, a kind of a new strength, a new flavor of the language program,

02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:56.920
if you will. But so far, it's a sort of, it's a vision. It's a set of conjectures,

02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.600
which we have proved in some cases, but not in full generality. So yes, I would like to

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:12.280
use your framework for me, the creator, and ask her, what is the explanation of this?

02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:16.920
And it may well be that you will answer in a way that I will just burst out laughing,

02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:23.400
it's like, how could we not see it? You see? So that I totally see. But I don't see one equation

02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:31.080
governing, one equation governing them all. Not one equation governing them all, but it does seem

02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.800
that such equations exist, where she will tell you something and you look back and say, how could I

02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:43.880
not see it? It seems like the truth at the end of the day is simple. That we're seeking, especially

02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:49.960
through mathematics. It seems somehow simple. The nature of reality, the thing that governs it

02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:56.200
seems to be simple. I wonder why that is. And I also wonder if it's not totally incorrect,

02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:04.920
and we're just craving the simplicity. And then mixing into the whole conversation about how much

02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:12.680
the observer that craves simplicity is part of the answer. It's a whole big giant mess.

02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:21.880
Or a whole big, beautiful painting or symphony. You said of Eric Weinstein that I find it

02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.600
remarkable that Eric was able to come up with such beautiful and original ideas,

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:31.080
even though he has been out of academia for so long, doing wonderful things in other areas,

02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:37.160
such as economics and finance. I'd like to use that kind of quote as just a question to you about

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:45.640
different places where people of your level can operate inside academia and outside. What is

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:54.200
the difference of doing mathematics inside academia and outside? Not even mathematics,

02:40:54.200 --> 02:41:02.920
but developing beautiful original ideas. Where's the place that your imagination can flourish most?

02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:10.120
So the limitations of academia is there's a community of people that take a set of axioms

02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:17.640
as gospel. So it's harder to take that leap into the unknown. But it's also the nice thing about

02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:22.760
academia is some of the most brilliant people in the world are there. And it's that community.

02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:29.080
Both the competition and the collaboration is there. I wonder if there's something you could

02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:34.600
say sort of to further about this world that people might not be familiar with.

02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:40.840
But I think you gave a very good description. I'm not sure I can on it because I don't have

02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:47.400
an overarching theory of academia. I definitely have been part of it and I'm grateful because

02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:55.320
it gives you a great sense of security, which comes with its own downside too,

02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:58.840
because you kind of like get a little disconnected from the real world because

02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:03.240
you get tenure, so you feel financially secure. You know, they don't pay you that much,

02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.600
so to speak, you know, relatively speaking. And it's comfortable, but it's not that much.

02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:15.960
But you can't be fired. So there is something about this, which I definitely have benefit from it,

02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:24.440
you know, and it does. People are not even aware what it's like to live outside of where you don't

02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:31.160
have this type of security. On the other hand, that also means that we're lacking certain skills

02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:38.360
that sort of real people in the real world have developed out of necessity to deal with that sort

02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:43.400
of insecurity. So it kind of always cuts both ways. You know, in one hand, it gives, and with

02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:48.600
other hand, it takes away. And it's a very interesting setup. And also, on the one hand,

02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:54.760
we are all supposed to be the true seekers. And but in reality, of course, it is a human

02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:01.320
activity, and it is a human community with all kinds of good, bad, and ugly things that happen,

02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:07.400
a lot of them under the radar screen, so to speak. And so, but maybe there is something to it.

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:13.480
There is definitely, there are definitely people who are upholding kind of that old tradition,

02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:20.440
definitely. And that is inspiring. And I aspire to be, you know, one of those to my best. So,

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:27.160
whether this is a system that will stay or should stay, I don't know. I really don't know.

02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:33.000
That's really fast. Yeah, it's fascinating what, especially with it, just to introduce the

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.720
bit of AI poison into the mix, as that changes the nature of education, perhaps as well,

02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.640
what the role of the university is in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years. I wonder,

02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:51.000
I wonder, and I wonder that, you know, how do you make sense that Einstein was working

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:55.080
after attempting, I believe, to be a university professor?

02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:58.920
For the patent office. Yeah, as a patent clerk.

02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:07.640
But I have to say, to these days, the science has become so much faster. It is really hard

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:14.040
to do it being outside. Now, Eric is unique in this way, even though he did, you know,

02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:23.880
go to great undergraduate and graduate, you know, schools, but then worked for a while in academia.

02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:30.440
There are very few examples like that. There's Yutong Zhang, who proved an important conjecture

02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:36.280
number theory about 10 years ago, and is now, as I understand it, is a professor at UC Santa Barbara.

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:42.280
He worked outside of academia and was able to make tremendous advance on his own.

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:49.640
This case is exceedingly rare, in part because academia is trying to protect its turf and it's

02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:56.360
kind of it's it's creating the sort of prohibitive cost of of an outsider. That is true. But there

02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:02.200
is also something about how much how much concentration in mathematics. I don't think

02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.080
people who are not who are not in the field understand what kind of focus

02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:16.200
and concentration actually doing like mathematics at top level these days requires.

02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:21.480
Because we're not talking about something that is more or less good. It is something which

02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:27.240
unassailable, you know, it's finding this treasure at the bottom of the ocean, you know, without

02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:36.360
you know, that column, you know, without oxygen. And that's why, you know, it's it's not people go

02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:40.840
crazy sometimes, you know, but there is a reason for that. Well, let me let me ask you about that

02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:44.360
sort of just to linger on that the amount of concentration required.

02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:51.080
Cal Newport wrote a book called Deep Work. He's a theoretical computer scientist.

02:45:51.400 --> 02:46:00.760
He took quite seriously the the task of allocating the hours in the day for that kind of deep

02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:06.360
thinking and then the mathematicians is is theoretical computer scientists on steroids.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:14.120
So for your own life and what you've observed, let me ask the big question, how to think,

02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:19.160
how to think deeply, how to find the mental, psychological,

02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:27.560
pragmatic space to really sit there and think deeply. How do you do it? In the moment you

02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:34.600
remember what you really deeply thought, what was it an accident? Was it deliberate?

02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:43.400
No, it's deliberate because, you know, first of all, my first years as a mathematician, you know,

02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:50.520
I worked every day, weekends, holidays, doesn't matter.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:58.440
I didn't even question that. So I would feel something's missing if I took a day off.

02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:05.880
And, you know, so it was just a kind of a sustained effort. The point is that

02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:13.000
still the process is nonlinear to go back to what we discussed earlier, that in other words,

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:19.320
the way I see it is you just you are making an effort to to bring all the information into

02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.200
focus, what you believe is correct. And you're playing with different

02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:33.000
ways of connecting things. But it is a total miracle when it when suddenly there is

02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:38.760
inside strikes. It is not something that in my experience could be predicted

02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:47.880
or even anticipated, you know, or like brought closer. There is a famous story about Einstein

02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:52.760
that he used to, you know, go think, think, think and then go for a walk. And like he would whistle

02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:58.040
and sometimes. So I remember the first time I heard this story, I thought how interesting is what

02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:03.400
the coincidence that he this came to him when he was with them. But in fact, it's not this is how

02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:09.160
it works in some sense that you have to prepare for it. But then the moment it happens when you

02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:15.320
stop thinking, actually, the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops. And, you know,

02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:23.880
you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking. But you cannot do it by will in some

02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:28.520
sense. It's kind of like, you know, how in the Eastern tradition, they have this concept of

02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:35.480
Satori, like in Buddhism, in Zen Buddhism, Satori, which is enlightenment. And so the various reports

02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:44.360
of Buddhist monks or Buddhist masters who have had experience Satori. But they say you can't

02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:52.040
do it by will. You cannot make it happen. If anything, you have to relax to let it come to

02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:54.920
you, you know, it's kind of like that. It's kind of like that. So

02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:03.160
I think that what matters, but you say how to think, the point is that we're talking about

02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:09.160
such an esoteric area. Mathematics is really esoteric area. It's a really strange subject where you

02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:17.800
try to to fit everything in this very, very stringent set of rules, to obey those set of those

02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:23.880
rules. Isn't it basically the pure, the hardest manifestation of a puzzle that we're all solving

02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:28.600
in different other disciplines? But this is the hardest puzzle. But yes or no, because there is

02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:35.240
just a different, for instance, there is a different criterion for what constitutes progress.

02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:40.120
For instance, in physics, a lot of arguments they make, they are not rigorous from a mathematical

02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:44.920
perspective. It is kind of an intuitive argument. We think it is like this. And this is acceptable

02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:51.720
in the subject for a good reason. And so there is some play. It's more like human activity,

02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:56.440
day-to-day activity. For instance, you and I discuss something. You have an idea and I have

02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:02.360
an idea and we argue about it. And something seems more plausible. Something seems less plausible.

02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:07.640
And so we may decide to take this point of view or that point of view as a provisional sort of

02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:14.440
point of view and go with it. In mathematics, it doesn't work this way. You either prove it or

02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:21.640
you don't. And oftentimes, you get to the point where there is this much you need to prove and

02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:28.600
it just wouldn't come to you. And you just don't see it and it can go on for months.

02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:35.000
Super frustrating. But without it, it is nothing kind of, you know?

02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:41.400
I would love to hear your opinion to the degree that you know it of the proof of Fermat's last

02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:49.320
theorem by Andrew Wiles, which seems to have this element perhaps for years. To the degree that

02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:54.600
you know, perhaps can you explain Fermat's last theorem and what your thoughts are in the process

02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:59.640
that Andrew Wiles took that seemed to, at least from my sort of romantic perspective, seem to be

02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:11.800
very lonely. Yes. It's a lonely profession. And hopeless. And sort of you put it really nicely

02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:16.120
because it feels like there's a lot of moments where you feel like you're close. You feel like

02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:22.440
99% is done. And there is this one stubborn thing which just does not compute, you know,

02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:30.840
doesn't happen. And you're trying to find that push for this last link. And nobody knows how

02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:35.720
long it's going to take. Would it be useful to maybe try to explain Fermat's last theorem?

02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:43.000
Sure. It's easy to do. I am an optimist. I'm an optimist. I think I always think that everything

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:48.440
can be explained, you know? Even though I say that not everything can be explained. But in

02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:54.440
mathematics, you know, within this particular framework, I think that I always feel optimistic

02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:59.400
when people ask me to explain something. I always start with the assumption that they will understand.

02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:10.120
So let's try. Fermat's last theorem, one of the jewels sort of of mathematics of all time.

02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:17.560
A beautiful story also behind it. Pierre Fermat, a great French mathematician who lived in the

02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:27.000
mostly worked at the beginning of the 17th century. And he actually has to his credit a number of

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:32.280
important contributions. But the most famous is called Fermat's last theorem, or Fermat's great

02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:38.760
theorem. And the reason why it became so famous is in part because he actually claimed to have

02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:45.240
proved it himself. And he did it on the margin of a book that he was reading, which was actually

02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:52.040
an important book by Diophantus about equations with coefficients in whole numbers. And he wrote

02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:57.960
on the margin literally, this equation, you know, this problem, which I will explain in a moment.

02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:05.080
I have solved it. I have found a proof. But this margin is too small to contain it.

02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:11.720
At some point, I was giving a public talk about this, and I made it as a joke. I made a tweet

02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:17.160
in which I wrote that I have proved this theorem, but 280 characters are not enough and it kind of

02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:24.040
cuts me in mid-sentence. So this was 17th century Twitter style proof. But a lot of mathematicians

02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:32.280
took it seriously because he had great credibility. He did make some major contributions. And the

02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:42.360
search was on. So for 350 years, about 350 years, it remained unproved with many people trying

02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:52.680
and failing until in 1994, no, in 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a mathematician from Princeton

02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:58.680
University announced the proof. And it was very exciting because he was one of the top number

02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:04.920
theorists in the world. And unfortunately, about a year later, a gap was found. So that's exactly

02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:10.040
what we were talking about earlier. You have 99% of the proof. This one little thing does not quite

02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:14.040
connect. And this nullifies the whole thing. Even though, well, you could say we have some

02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:19.400
interesting ideas, but it's not the same as actually having a proof. So he apparently was

02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:24.360
really frustrated. And he was really a lot of people thought that it's going to be another 100

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:31.560
years or whatever. And then luckily, he was able to enlist with the help assistance of his

02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:37.880
former student, also great number theorist, Richard Taylor, they were able to do that 1%

02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:42.920
so to speak. Well, some people might say it may be not one, but 5% or whatever. But it definitely was

02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:49.000
an important ingredient, but it was not he had a sort of like a big new set of ideas. And this one

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:54.280
thing didn't pan out. They were able to close it with Taylor. And it finally was published and I

02:54:54.280 --> 02:55:03.720
think was accepted and read in 95. And since it's believed to be correct. Now, what he proved,

02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:09.960
actually, was not Fermat's theorem itself. But a certain statement, which is called

02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:15.320
Shimura Taniyama way conjecture named after three mathematicians to Japanese mathematicians in one

02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:21.560
French porn mathematician who worked in also the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:28.360
And it was my colleague at UC Berkeley, Ken Ribbit, who in the 80s connected the two problems.

02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:31.800
So this is how it often works in mathematics. You want to prove statement A.

02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:37.480
Instead, you prove that a is equivalent to B. So after that, if you can prove B,

02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:41.480
this would automatically imply that A is correct. So this is what happened here.

02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:45.480
A was Fermat's last theorem. B was Shimura Taniyama way conjecture. And that's what

02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:51.320
Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor really proved. So it requires to get to Fermat's last theorem,

02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:55.720
it requires that bridge, which was established by my colleague Ken Ribbit at UC Berkeley.

02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:58.680
So now what is the statement of Fermat's last theorem?

02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:05.720
Let me start with Pythagoras. Since we already talked about it, let me start with Pythagoras

02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:11.960
theorem, which describes the right triangles. So what is the right triangle? It's a triangle in

02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:18.520
which one of the angles is 90 degrees like this. So it has three sides. The longer side is called

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:25.080
hypotenuse. And then there's two other sides. So if we denote the length of hypotenuse by z

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:31.080
and the two other sides x and y, then z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared.

02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:39.240
So that's the equation. Or x squared plus y squared equals z squared. And it turns out

02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:45.880
that this equation has solutions in natural numbers, actually infinitely many solutions

02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:57.080
in natural numbers. For example, if x equals 3, y equals 4, and z equals 5, then they solve

02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:07.400
this equation because 3 squared is 9. 4 squared is 16. 9 plus 16 is 25. And that's 5 squared.

02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:15.800
So x squared plus y squared equals z squared is solved by x equals 3, y equals 4, z equals 5.

02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:18.200
And there are many other solutions of that nature.

02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:22.280
And we should say that natural numbers are whole numbers that are non-negative.

02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:28.760
That's right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. Now what's Fermat's last theorem? Fermat asked what

02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:36.440
about what will happen if we replace squares by cubes, for example. So x cube plus y cube equals z

02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:45.560
cube. Are there any solutions in what do you call natural numbers? It turns out there are none.

02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:53.240
What about fourth powers? Again, none. Or it seems like none, right? So that was a statement.

02:57:53.960 --> 02:58:01.240
So the theorem says that the equation x cube plus y cube equals z cube has no solutions in natural

02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:08.280
numbers. Remember, natural means positive whole numbers. So of course, there is a trivial solution

02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:15.160
0, 0, 0, so that this works. But you need all of them to be positive. x to the fourth plus y to the

02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:22.680
fourth equals z to the fourth also has no solutions. x to the fifth plus y to the fifth

02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:29.320
equals z to the fifth, no solutions. So you kind of see the trend. x to the n plus y to the n

02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:36.040
equals z to the n. If n is greater than 2, has no solutions in natural numbers. That is a statement

02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:42.040
of Fermat's last theorem. Deceptively simple. As far as famous theorems are concerned,

02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:46.840
you don't need to know anything beyond standard arithmetic, addition and multiplication of natural

02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:56.600
numbers. That's why a lot of people, both specialists and amateurs, try to prove it because

02:58:56.600 --> 02:59:04.440
it's so easy to formulate. So in fact, I think Fermat proved the case of cubes. I think he did

02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:09.160
actually prove some elsewhere the case of cubes. But so it remained like fourth. There are infinitely

02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:12.760
many cases, right? You have to, even if you prove it for cubes and for fourth power and fifth,

02:59:12.760 --> 02:59:17.240
then still there are six, seven, and so on. There are infinitely many cases in which it has to be

02:59:17.240 --> 02:59:28.280
proved. And so you see, the Deceptively Simple result took 350 years to prove. And you know,

02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:32.200
but in a sense, it's like mathematicians, you know, you would think mathematics is such a sterile

02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:37.400
profession. Everybody's so serious, you know, almost like we're all wearing like lab coats

02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:44.440
and like take an elevator to the every tower. And however, look at all this drama.

02:59:45.400 --> 02:59:50.200
Look at all this drama. It's like we also like drama. We also have narratives. We also have our

02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:57.800
myths. Here is a guy is a 16th century mathematician or 17th century mathematician who leaves a note

02:59:57.800 --> 03:00:04.120
on the margin and motivates others to find the proof. Then how many hearts were broken that they

03:00:04.120 --> 03:00:09.400
believed that they found the proof. And then later it was realized that the proof was incorrect

03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:15.880
and so on and brings us to modern day. And one last attempt, Andrew Wiles, who is very serious

03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:21.240
and respected and esteemed mathematician, announces the proof only to be faced with the same reality

03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:27.400
of his hopes dashed, seemingly dashed. And like, there is a mistake. It doesn't work. And then to

03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:33.880
be able to recover a year later, how much drama in this one story. It's amazing. But from what

03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:40.040
you understand, from what you know, what was the process for him that is similar, perhaps,

03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:47.240
to your own life of walking along with the problem for months, not years?

03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:54.600
Yes. So he worked, he has given interviews about it afterwards. So we know that he described his

03:00:54.600 --> 03:01:01.800
process that number one, he did not want to tell anybody because he was afraid that people find

03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:09.400
out that he's working on it. Because he was such a top level mathematician, people would guess that

03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:16.520
he has some idea that there is some idea. So, you know, if you just know that somebody has an idea,

03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:22.120
this already gives you a great boost of confidence, right? So he didn't want people to have that

03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:27.960
information. So he didn't tell anybody that he was working on it. Number one, be lonely. Number two,

03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:36.440
he worked on it for seven years, if I remember correctly, by himself. And then he thought he

03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:42.840
had it and he was elated. Obviously, he was, you know, very happy. And he announced it at a conference,

03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:48.840
I think it was in Cambridge University or Oxford University in the UK in 1993, I believe. So,

03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:58.920
you know, this is really interesting because all of us, all mathematicians can relate to this,

03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:05.800
because I remember very well my first problem, how I solved my first problem. I described it in

03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:15.160
Love and Math in my book. So it was, I was, how old was I? I was 18 years old. I was a student in

03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:20.520
Moscow. And I was just, I just lucked out that I was introduced to this great mathematician.

03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:26.040
Since I, you know, I was not studying at Moscow University because of anti-Semitism in the Soviet

03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:31.000
Union. So I was in this technical school, but I was lucky that I had a mathematician who took me

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:40.920
under his wing. And Dmitry Fuchs, who actually later came to the US and he's still a professor at

03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:49.960
UC Davis, actually, not so far from me. So he gave me this problem and it was rather technical,

03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:56.840
so I will not try to describe it. But I do remember how much effort, you know, that excitement,

03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:02.520
but also kind of a fear, what if I don't have what it takes, you know? I lost sleep. So this

03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:07.800
was one consequence of this. I, for the first time in my life, I had trouble falling asleep. And

03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.520
this actually stayed for a couple of years afterwards. So then it was kind of like a wake-up

03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:17.400
call that I should be to take care of myself, not work too late and so on. So that was sort of like

03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:22.920
that experience. And I was lucky that I was able to find a solution, number one, within two months,

03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:28.600
maybe. And it was very, it was surprising and it was beautiful. Like it, the answer was, was in

03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:33.000
terms of some, something which seemed to be from a different world, from a different area of mathematics.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:40.840
So I was very happy. But I do remember this moment when suddenly you see that. Just like

03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:47.320
in this case, it was literally, I had to compile these diagrams with what mathematicians call

03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:53.880
cohomology groups and spectral sequences and manually calculate some numbers and trying

03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:59.880
to discern some system in it. And suddenly I saw that how they all were governed by this one,

03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:06.200
one force, so to speak, one pattern. And that was absolutely, wow. So it's like...

03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:09.640
Maybe what was it? So you're sitting there at a desk?

03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:15.000
Actually, you know, I lived in a town outside of Moscow. So I used to take, I would take a train

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:19.080
to Moscow. So it's what we call in Russia, electric, you know, like this electric train,

03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:23.640
which was super slow. It took more than two hours to cover that distance. And I think that

03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:29.480
the crucial insight came when I was in this. And I just, I had to contain myself so I don't

03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:36.760
start screaming, you know, because there were other passengers in the car. So I was sitting there

03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:44.120
and staring at this paper. So you know what? I remember that's what came to me. I have something

03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:50.040
now, which nobody else in the world has. I have a proof of... First of all, it was not just a proof.

03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:54.200
Like in the case of Fermat, the statement is already made. That's why it's called conjecture.

03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:58.680
You know, you make a statement, you don't have a proof yet. Then you try to prove it. In my case,

03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:03.720
I did not know what the answer would be. There was a type of question where the answer was unknown.

03:05:03.720 --> 03:05:09.080
So I had to find the answer and prove it. And the answer was very nice. So nobody knew, as far

03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:14.760
as I could tell, nobody knew because my teacher told me that he explored all the literature. And

03:05:14.760 --> 03:05:23.800
this was not known. So this was... Suddenly I felt that I was in possession of this. Now,

03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:29.880
it was a little thing. It was not cure for cancer. It was not a large language model.

03:05:31.160 --> 03:05:38.840
But it was something undeniably real, meaningful. And it was mine kind of. I had it, nobody else.

03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:45.240
I had not published it. I didn't even tell anybody. And it is a very strange feeling to have that.

03:05:45.240 --> 03:05:47.720
Were you worried that this treasure could be stolen?

03:05:48.680 --> 03:05:53.080
Not at the time. Not at the time. So later on, there were situations where

03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:57.160
I was exposed to those types of experiences. But at that time, I didn't think of that. I was

03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:05.000
still this starry-eyed kid who was just obsessed with mathematics, with this beauty and discovering

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:11.400
those beautiful facts, beautiful results. So I didn't even think that it could be possible

03:06:11.400 --> 03:06:16.120
that somebody could steal it or whatever. I just wanted to share it with my teacher as soon as

03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:21.400
possible. And he understood quickly. And he's like, good job.

03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:29.240
Is there something you can give color to the drama? Eric Weinstein has spoken about

03:06:29.240 --> 03:06:34.120
some of the challenges, some of the triumphs and challenges of his time at Harvard.

03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:44.280
Is there something to that drama of people stealing each other's ideas or not allocating

03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:50.920
credit enough? Oh, sure. Yes. All of that and creating psychological stressors because of that.

03:06:50.920 --> 03:06:54.840
Happens all the time, yes, unfortunately. On young minds and so on.

03:06:54.840 --> 03:06:58.840
Could have a very bad effect. Is that just the way of life or is this...

03:07:00.760 --> 03:07:04.920
I think we can definitely do better. And I think the first step is to kind of

03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:12.760
admit that we are not 100% seekers of truth, that we are human beings and all the

03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:23.080
good and bad and the ugly qualities can be present and to have some kind of dialogue

03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:28.760
in my subject, in mathematics. This has not happened yet. There have been some famous cases

03:07:28.760 --> 03:07:33.880
where people have been accused, which had been resolved or partially resolved or unresolved.

03:07:34.680 --> 03:07:39.480
And everybody knows it, but there isn't a systematic effort, as far as I can tell,

03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:45.800
of really trying to create some rules, some ethics rules. This is fair game,

03:07:45.800 --> 03:07:52.120
this is not fair game, so that as a community, we strive to get better. I think that for most

03:07:52.120 --> 03:07:57.400
people it's more like keeping your head in the sand and kind of pretending that it doesn't happen.

03:07:57.400 --> 03:08:02.360
Or it happens some isolated incidents. Well, my experience is not like that at all.

03:08:02.360 --> 03:08:06.440
I think it does happen much more often than it should. That's my opinion.

03:08:07.400 --> 03:08:12.680
So there's the pool of academia is fascinating. One of the reasons I really love it is you have

03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:19.400
young minds with fresh ideas. And that same innocence you had when you first on the train

03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:24.040
have that brilliant breakthrough. And then you throw that in together with senior,

03:08:24.680 --> 03:08:29.960
exceptional world-class scientists who have, first of all, are getting older.

03:08:30.200 --> 03:08:40.280
Second of all, maybe they have partaken in the drug of fame and money and status and recognition.

03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:47.080
So that starts to a little bit corrupt all of our human minds. And you throw that mix in together.

03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:55.320
Mostly without rules. And it's beautiful because that's where the ideas of old

03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:03.640
contend with the new wild-eyed crazy ideas and they clash and there's a tension and there's

03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:08.600
a dance to it. But then there's the old human corruption that can take advantage of the young

03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:14.040
minds. It's unclear what to do with that. I mean, part of that is just the way of life

03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:20.120
and there's tragedies. And oftentimes when you look at who wins the Nobel Prize, it's also tragic

03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:27.480
because sometimes so many minds are, the trajectory to the breakthrough idea

03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:31.480
involves so many different minds, young and old. Yeah, I mean,

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:42.760
you're right. I think it's like everything else. The path is to more self-awareness.

03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:49.240
And that's like owning up your own stuff and not blaming other people, not projecting onto other

03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:56.520
people, but taking responsibility. And that's true for everything. And the problem here,

03:09:56.520 --> 03:10:01.560
unique problem for mathematics, I would say thesis and chemists are better. They actually

03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:06.200
have better sort of ethical rules and so on, especially biologists. Because I think in part

03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:09.880
it's because there is much more money involved, because they have to get grants and so on. So

03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:14.120
for them, the question of priority, who discovered what first is much more serious because there's

03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:18.280
really some serious money. Mathematics, who cares? You know, like Fermat's last theorem was proved.

03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:22.440
Did Andrew Wiles become a millionaire? No. I think he got a prize.

03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:29.160
He won a prize, but those prizes are not... I think that one was a big prize, but in general,

03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:33.080
there's not going to be... I think he won the Nobel Prize, eventually, which is about a million

03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:40.440
dollars. But sometimes I joke about this, that this is the hardest way to win a million dollars.

03:10:41.400 --> 03:10:51.000
So, you know, but amongst mathematicians, I think the trouble is that we are so insulated

03:10:52.920 --> 03:11:00.840
from society because it's such a pure subject. It draws in very specific psychological types.

03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:06.200
And I can speak about myself. I did not realize it at the time, but later on, I definitely saw...

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.120
I mentioned some of it earlier, that for me, mathematics was a refuge from the cruelty of

03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:16.680
the life I experienced, from discrimination that I experienced when I applied to Moscow University

03:11:16.680 --> 03:11:21.240
at 16, being failed at the exam and stuff like that, which I describe in my book as well. But

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:28.200
that was my way. I was like, I don't trust this world. I don't want to deal with it.

03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:35.880
I want to hide in this platonic reality of pure forms. This is where I know how to

03:11:35.880 --> 03:11:43.000
operate. I love this, and I couldn't be bothered in some sense. For a while, up to a point, as I was

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:49.240
getting older and more mature, I was becoming more and more interested in other things. But I think

03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:56.920
that's one of the reasons. And one of the reasons why I wrote Love and Math was precisely to break

03:11:56.920 --> 03:12:04.840
that cycle. That it's the quiet guy in the corner that goes into math, and not the flamboyant, you

03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:15.320
know, jock or like, you know, DJ. I wanted to show how beautiful the subject is to attract this new

03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:25.000
blood so that different psychological types and more women would join. Because then they would

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.440
have the students who would look at them and whom they will inspire. And then it would be...

03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:35.880
Instead of a vicious circle, it would be a virtuous circle. And I have to say, I think it's

03:12:35.880 --> 03:12:39.960
happening not because of my efforts alone. Obviously, there are many other mathematicians

03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:46.040
who are around the same time started to put more effort. Because see, if the old stereotype of

03:12:46.040 --> 03:12:50.840
mathematician, you're so enclosed, you're not interested in even exposing the beauty of your

03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:55.800
subject to other people, you see? And then it becomes this vicious circle. But you know, this

03:12:55.800 --> 03:13:02.360
one day, you know, all the time I meet the students who say, your book is the reason why

03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:08.120
I chose Math as my major. And I am proud, especially when it's women who tell me this.

03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:14.760
And they are cool. They are DJs at the same time. And they are social. And they have friends.

03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:20.280
And they go out and so on. You see, so then they carry the torch. Because then they will be more

03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:28.840
likely to share this beauty with others, to attract more students and so on. So I think this

03:13:28.840 --> 03:13:33.880
kind of this dumb was broken. So now you have more influx. And once we have people who are more

03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:40.120
able to connect at the personal level, that's when we also become more self aware as a community,

03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:45.560
I think. And that's when we might be, we should be able to have a chance to improve in terms of

03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:52.600
our ethical rules and stuff like that. So let me return to our friend Eric Weinstein for a question

03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:57.560
that I would ask anyway, but let me let's have a non Russian ask the Russian question.

03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:05.800
Ask him about the Russian concepts of friendship, science, gender and love versus the American.

03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:14.920
You can. So there is a there is a deep romanticism that you have

03:14:17.080 --> 03:14:25.320
that runs to your book, Love and Math. Is part of that something you've picked up from the Russian

03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:33.320
culture? What can you speak to that fueled both your fascination with math and your fascination?

03:14:33.320 --> 03:14:39.160
No, your your prioritization of the human experience of love.

03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:47.400
Good question. I definitely there is some influence of the Russian culture, Russian literature,

03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:53.560
perhaps, you know, but also, you know, like, there's so many things. How do you how do we develop

03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:58.680
certain sensibilities? Like, why do we care about this and not that? Like, why do I care, for instance,

03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:05.160
about, like you said, about this romantic ideal, so to speak of mathematics? That's certainly not

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:09.720
something that is automatic. You know, some people care about some people don't. And I'm not saying

03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:15.160
it is superior or inferior. It's just how my composition, my psychological composition is like

03:15:15.160 --> 03:15:22.680
that. And it's an interesting question, like, what is the cause of it? So I think that

03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:29.160
we cannot really know, but there are some aspects of it, of course, the experiences life experiences

03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:39.080
are bringing family, like I was, you know, I was surrounded by love by my parents on the one hand,

03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:46.440
but in the other side, perhaps they were a little overprotective of me. So I was kind of like, you

03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:55.160
know, too much kind of like taking taking care of so then when I develop certain sensitivity,

03:15:55.160 --> 03:16:00.760
but I was kind of not ready for the challenges of the real world of the real world. So then that

03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:07.560
that struggle and that and then being lost and then being able to overcome and to learn. And

03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:15.320
then if you do, you know, if you don't lose, you don't appreciate maybe, but sometimes when

03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:20.040
we lose something and then regain it, then we cherish it, we appreciate and then becomes

03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:29.080
unimportant. Also, various difficulties, you know, the upsetting experiences or one could say

03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:35.560
traumatic experiences growing up, you know, in the Soviet Union, that was not a walk in the park,

03:16:35.560 --> 03:16:44.520
you know, there were a lot of issues there that I had to go through. And and then it doesn't break

03:16:44.520 --> 03:16:53.800
you make you stronger. But in my case, what happened was that, you know, some for some of it,

03:16:53.800 --> 03:16:57.960
it took me 30 years to really come to terms with it and to really understand what happened.

03:16:59.320 --> 03:17:07.320
It gave me this motivation to to strive to become a mathematician, which maybe I wouldn't

03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:12.360
have otherwise it charged me supercharged me. I'm talking about, for instance, I experienced with

03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:16.440
exam at Moscow University. Can you take me through that experience?

03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:25.240
So this is 1984. We spoke about Orwell earlier. And I was applying to Moscow University

03:17:27.080 --> 03:17:33.800
mathematics department called Mehmet, which is like for people who don't know, like the place

03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:38.760
was the only place to study pure mathematics in Moscow period. But also, but also if you want

03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:43.320
the great places on earth. And it's like a huge building, this, you know,

03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:53.240
this monolith of a building of Moscow University. So because, as I said, you know, a year earlier,

03:17:53.240 --> 03:17:58.040
Evgeniy Evgeniy, which converted me into math, capitalizing on my love for physics, quantum

03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:03.240
physics. And so we spent a whole year studying with him. And I was really kind of at the level of,

03:18:04.200 --> 03:18:09.880
you know, in some in some subjects, the level of like early graduate graduate studies.

03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:18.040
So it seemed like it would be a breeze to get into Moscow University. But in fact, little did I know

03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:27.480
that there was a policy of antisemitism where students like me would be failed by special

03:18:27.560 --> 03:18:35.480
examiners, mostly during the oral exam with mathematics, but occasionally I would be written

03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:43.240
tests and stuff. Now, my father is Jewish by blood. It was not religious. His family was not

03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:49.560
religious. My mom is Russian. And but I was since my last name was my father's name. So it was very

03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:56.680
easy to to read what my nationality was. And so there was this, can you imagine, there were

03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:02.520
special people who would screen up applicants who would put aside the files of the undesirables.

03:19:03.400 --> 03:19:06.840
There would be special examiners who were actually professors at this university

03:19:07.720 --> 03:19:14.280
who would be designated as those who would take the exam from those undesirables.

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:20.200
It was it's almost comical when you look back now. And also like questions why there was no

03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:24.600
reason other than just hatred of the other. That's how I see it. It's just to give a little bit

03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:32.520
more color. So because you mentioned nationality, it's a little quirk that perhaps gives an insight

03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:37.400
to the bigger system that the nationality listed on your birth certificate when you're Jewish is

03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:42.680
Jewish. And when you're non-Jewish, is this as Russian for me, it was Russian. So first of all,

03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:48.920
in the inner part, everybody has an internal passport. And there you have first name,

03:19:48.920 --> 03:19:57.240
pateranemic name, last name, date of birth. So these are four. And the fifth colon is nationality,

03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:02.760
which comes from the nationality of the parents and so on. In my case, it was written Russian

03:20:02.760 --> 03:20:09.480
because my mom was Russian, but it didn't save me because I was my dad's last name.

03:20:10.280 --> 03:20:17.320
And so anyway, this was the toughest experience that I had up until that point.

03:20:18.600 --> 03:20:24.600
And there was this two people who came into the room where I was the only undesirable. All other

03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:30.520
kids were being questioned by other examiners, but they told me that we cannot question you.

03:20:30.520 --> 03:20:37.080
We are waiting for special examiners. So I was like, oh, oh, something is food. And so these

03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:41.800
two guys came in four hours, basically, were asking me questions, which were not in the

03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:45.560
program and so on. But I was like, yeah, I was 16 years old. I tried to answer it best I can,

03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:51.800
but it was a setup. It's been documented since then, there are even lists of problems

03:20:52.680 --> 03:20:59.560
that were given to undesirables in those days. In my year, no Jewish applicants,

03:20:59.560 --> 03:21:05.240
as far as I know, Jewish by this metric were accepted. So then I had to go to this.

03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:12.680
There was one technical school in Moscow, which was the Institute for Oil and Gas Exploration,

03:21:13.240 --> 03:21:22.040
which had applied mathematics program. And that's where many of the kids who were not

03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:31.800
accepted to Moscow University ended up. But the point is, and then I was so motivated by this,

03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:39.560
because I wanted to show those guys that within five years, less than five years,

03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:44.840
I got a letter from the president of Harvard University inviting me as a visiting professor

03:21:44.840 --> 03:21:50.520
to Harvard. I was 21, I was barely 21, because I already did some research in the meantime.

03:21:51.080 --> 03:21:57.160
That's how motivated I was. But the interesting aspect of it is that

03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:04.760
for the longest time afterwards, I was telling myself a story that nothing really happened.

03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:12.120
It wasn't so bad. Okay, so I was failed, but I knew that I was going to succeed.

03:22:13.480 --> 03:22:19.960
It was 30 years later that I finally got to meet that boy, that 16-year-old.

03:22:20.520 --> 03:22:28.440
That I neglected this time. And I realized that he died, that it was a crashing blow.

03:22:28.440 --> 03:22:29.080
The innocence?

03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:34.360
Not just the innocence, because there was no way. It looked like there was no way I could become

03:22:34.360 --> 03:22:41.880
a mathematician, because if they don't accept me there, it's over. I didn't know that I could

03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:47.960
actually find this striving applied math program, and then eventually somebody would take me under

03:22:47.960 --> 03:22:52.760
his wing and so on, and then could move to the United States. That was not in the realm of

03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:59.480
possibilities. So there was nothing to look forward to. It was clear that it's over. I cannot

03:23:02.120 --> 03:23:13.640
do what I love. And so when I finally connected to that boy, oh my God, I was a totally different

03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:21.720
experience. All the pain and all the trauma came to the surface. And it was a kind of a tsunami.

03:23:22.520 --> 03:23:28.840
I wasn't sure I would survive this. It was so hard. And what happened was I was invited to

03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:34.520
give a talk about this in New York. It was kind of a spoken word event

03:23:36.600 --> 03:23:41.160
about science, but like personal experiences related to science. This was almost a year after

03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:48.520
my book came out. In my book, one of the first chapters is a chapter about this experience.

03:23:49.640 --> 03:23:53.240
But what I realize now is that I wrote it from the third person perspective.

03:23:53.960 --> 03:23:58.520
I knew the facts, but I was not emotionally connected to that experience. However,

03:23:59.080 --> 03:24:04.520
since I wanted to write the book and to connect to my readers, I allowed the boy to write it.

03:24:05.560 --> 03:24:10.280
So a lot of people were touched by it, and people would say, wow, that chapter, you know,

03:24:10.360 --> 03:24:14.520
it really got a lot of resonance. It was translated into another language even before the book was

03:24:14.520 --> 03:24:21.560
published. I was surprised by this because I didn't know yet. So the adult Edward was not

03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:31.560
yet in touch, but the book gave the outlet to the child. And that kind of started the process.

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:41.080
So finally, almost a year later, I'm in New York in this event. And the night before,

03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:46.440
I'm in my hotel room, and I was like, okay, what am I going to talk about tomorrow?

03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:50.600
And I take a piece of paper just to, you know, my usual preparation, you know, for things.

03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:55.800
And then suddenly I have this vision that I will walk up to the microphone tomorrow,

03:24:55.800 --> 03:25:06.520
and I will just start crying. And I was like, by that time, I already had an insight

03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:12.360
that it's possible to have that kind of a splitting kind of dissociation. I was like,

03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:16.920
but things were happening quickly. There was someone in my life who explained to me this idea

03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:24.120
that some things are under the radar of awareness, but they may still influence you. And a lot of

03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:30.600
that could be connected to some experiences in your childhood. So I was kind of ready for it

03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:36.360
from different angles. But I was so surprised because I was like, what is there to remember?

03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:41.400
I know, I know everything. So then my inner voice says, all right, then you have nothing to worry

03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:47.720
about. Don't go tomorrow. And you will speak about this. And if you start crying, it's not a

03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:53.320
problem. I was like, no, I don't want to cry in front of people. I want to find out what it is,

03:25:53.320 --> 03:26:03.640
what happened. And I sit on my bed, close my eyes, and it came. So it's hard to describe. So this is

03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:11.800
what the sheer energy of it and how much effort it took to suppress it actually for all these years,

03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:17.640
how much effort it took to build that panzer, I wouldn't say in Russian, you know, that that

03:26:17.720 --> 03:26:24.280
hardcore, you know, around myself. So that, and the thing, later I realized there were moments when

03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:31.720
it could come out. And for instance, I developed this fear of public speaking, all kinds of little

03:26:31.720 --> 03:26:38.760
things that I now feel were connected. So anyway, I saw what happened now through the eyes of that

03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:46.200
child. I saw how difficult it was, how crushed he was. And it looked completely hopeless. And I

03:26:46.200 --> 03:26:52.200
felt like, what's the point of living now for me, now that I know how cruel this world is,

03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:58.840
which I didn't realize before, because I prefer to wear this pink, you know, the rose colored glasses.

03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:06.040
But then something happened. It's so strange. It's like you feel that inside of you, there is

03:27:06.040 --> 03:27:13.880
this dead child. And it is incredibly sad. I mean, it's like, I can't even describe it. But

03:27:13.880 --> 03:27:20.760
suddenly he comes alive. And suddenly it's like, Oh, he's here. And I had a little talk with him.

03:27:20.760 --> 03:27:26.680
And I said, look, you know, I know, I know, thank you, I'm so sorry that I neglected you for so long.

03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:34.120
You know, I didn't know. Thank you for doing this. And it's almost like, you know, I felt like

03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:39.000
the image came to mind is like a fallen soldier, like you leave a fallen soldier on the battlefield,

03:27:39.080 --> 03:27:46.680
a wounded soldier. And then you come back to take him with you. And I said, but look,

03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:51.880
look what we have done. Look at us now. It was not in vain. We are doing okay.

03:27:53.000 --> 03:28:04.040
And it's kind of almost just like holding, holding, holding that child in that sense of who I am,

03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:12.120
you know, and feeling it. So the next day, I went to the microphone, and I let him speak for the

03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:20.280
first time about his experience in his own voice. It was incredible. People were crying and afterwards

03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:24.600
came up to me and started sharing stories and so on. Because it is a story, it's a universal

03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:32.120
story. It's archetypal story. It's the story of rejection and being treated unfairly.

03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:41.240
We all know it. And I think it's so important to realize that it's, it's possible to revisit

03:28:41.240 --> 03:28:45.960
those moments. It's possible to reconnect to our little ones. It's possible to bring them back.

03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:53.640
And we are better for it because this changed my life, this experience. Then there were,

03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:56.520
then suddenly it's like a floodgates that there were many other things that came.

03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:04.520
That's when I became interested in the dimensions of imagination and intuition and so on. Because

03:29:04.520 --> 03:29:09.400
suddenly I realized that I was deprived of those, of that possibility of looking at the world

03:29:09.400 --> 03:29:14.280
through the eyes of a child because that child was frozen in time. I was not connected to him.

03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:22.760
But suddenly he's with me. And he's like, almost like opens his doors and says, look at this.

03:29:26.760 --> 03:29:38.600
So if I could ask you about, there's a difficult idea here. There's a tension. I've interacted

03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:44.920
with a few folks in my personal life and in general that have lived through this experience

03:29:44.920 --> 03:29:56.440
of unfairness and cruelty in the world as young people. And what wisdom do you draw from

03:29:58.040 --> 03:30:04.600
the, the, the action you took of not acknowledging that you're a victim to cruelty, but instead

03:30:04.600 --> 03:30:12.680
just working your ass off, working harder. And then this, the flip side of that is you

03:30:12.680 --> 03:30:17.880
eventually reconnecting with the cruelty that you experienced. Because if you did that early on,

03:30:18.440 --> 03:30:22.680
I was not ready for it. It is a defense mechanism. I could be, I could have come,

03:30:22.680 --> 03:30:26.040
you know, there were kids who commit suicide after this experience. I could have committed

03:30:26.040 --> 03:30:31.720
suicide because it's too much. And it is well known afterwards, of course, I became aware

03:30:31.720 --> 03:30:38.280
of all the literature about childhood trauma and so on. And I have been, I've been speaking

03:30:38.280 --> 03:30:45.320
publicly about it since then too. And so, you know, it is well known issue and well known

03:30:47.080 --> 03:30:55.240
kind of universal phenomenon. I think that interesting enough, even though now I see a lot

03:30:55.240 --> 03:31:01.080
of discussion of it, now that my eyes are open, but somehow before I didn't see it. So that,

03:31:01.080 --> 03:31:06.520
which also shows you how our confirmation bias kind of like how we screen ourselves, how we turn

03:31:06.520 --> 03:31:10.840
the blind eye to things which do not confirm our views or for which we are not yet ready. And by the

03:31:10.840 --> 03:31:20.520
way, nobody should push to do it too soon. I'm glad I developed certain strengths. I was confident.

03:31:22.520 --> 03:31:29.480
I was strong to withstand this. And if I weren't, who knows how it could turn out. So it is a very

03:31:29.480 --> 03:31:35.080
subtle kind of alchemical process, which I don't think there is a recipe, there's a formula.

03:31:36.520 --> 03:31:41.480
The reason I'm talking about this is just to share this experience, because I think that

03:31:41.480 --> 03:31:47.240
the only thing we can do in this in some sense is to share with each other, because then we can find,

03:31:48.440 --> 03:31:55.480
for instance, if somebody shared with me, it would naturally lead me maybe to get closer to that,

03:31:55.480 --> 03:31:59.640
to kind of understanding. It's really just personal stories. It's not,

03:31:59.960 --> 03:32:06.440
obviously, there is a, there is a component where professionals could be involved,

03:32:06.440 --> 03:32:10.840
like professional therapists and so on. In my case, it somehow happened miraculously.

03:32:11.480 --> 03:32:16.520
Well, I did have support, but not from professional therapists, but from like dear friends.

03:32:17.240 --> 03:32:22.440
So I did, I did have, you didn't, you do need, I had somebody at the time who basically held my hand

03:32:22.440 --> 03:32:26.520
and through this experience. Yes, it was invaluable and it could not be done otherwise.

03:32:27.080 --> 03:32:32.040
So I think it's very common. And here's the thing,

03:32:35.480 --> 03:32:41.160
I would not do it in any other way. When you, when I reconnected,

03:32:42.680 --> 03:32:49.800
and I saw all the horrors and so on, but I also was able to see that my examiners were victims

03:32:49.800 --> 03:32:56.920
of their own situation, that they became, they fell for this bogus

03:32:57.720 --> 03:33:03.960
theories, or maybe it was more of a issue of career advancement or something. And I also

03:33:03.960 --> 03:33:08.920
realized they must have suffered as well, because they must have had some kind of conciousness

03:33:08.920 --> 03:33:14.680
of a conscience about it, that acting in this way towards sort of basically kids, you know.

03:33:15.960 --> 03:33:18.920
So it's not, it wasn't pretty from their point of view. So I could forgive them

03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:26.040
and I could like also appreciate what a, what a boost of energy it gave me.

03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:32.280
If I was accepted and I was just where I was a first year student, I lived, I would live in a

03:33:32.280 --> 03:33:37.400
dorm because I was in the, you know, I'd be probably partying and drinking and who knows what,

03:33:37.400 --> 03:33:44.360
maybe I wouldn't even become a mathematician. But this focused me like a laser without me even

03:33:44.360 --> 03:33:49.640
thinking about it. It just happened. I didn't care about anything but doing mathematics.

03:33:49.960 --> 03:33:56.040
And it paid off, you know, it changed my life. So was it good or bad? Paradox.

03:33:57.640 --> 03:34:03.480
Seems like life is full of those. You said you lost your father four years ago.

03:34:03.480 --> 03:34:07.480
Yeah. What have you learned about life from your dad?

03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:15.560
That's another big one. Yeah, because I was very close to him. And it was tough, it was tough.

03:34:16.520 --> 03:34:24.520
And I was not, I was sort of not ready for it because up until that point I lived pretending

03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:31.480
that death does not exist. When my grandparents died, I was already in the US. So it was very

03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:38.440
convenient and I couldn't go back. So I grieved, but it kind of was a bit abstract for me. I didn't

03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:45.480
see their dead bodies, you know, I didn't bury them and so on. So I waited till the

03:34:46.200 --> 03:34:52.760
so the first death in my life was my father, like really close loved ones. And I was absolutely

03:34:52.760 --> 03:34:59.400
devastated. You know, he was such an amazing creature, such an amazing human being. He was

03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:06.680
the kindest, the smartest, the most funny, just really funny and just really fun to be with,

03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:11.320
you know, this is what I miss, obviously. I mean, I would just love to hang out with him.

03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:19.080
And then suddenly he's not there. So it's tough, but it kind of changed my perspective.

03:35:19.080 --> 03:35:26.280
You miss him? I miss him tremendously. I miss him tremendously. But in a way,

03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:31.800
I learned that he never left me in some sense. I mean, it sounds so, words are so, you know, like

03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:39.160
they are, you could not express in words this, what I'm trying to say, but

03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:50.360
Do you carry him with you? Yeah. But in some sense, I always did. And I saw that, that it's

03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:57.320
always been, it was really, we were one in some sense, you know, like we were, but there was this

03:35:57.320 --> 03:36:09.640
experience of two people being together and that I missed tremendously. But he gave me so much.

03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:15.560
And I, you know, let me tell you one aspect of it, for instance, when he was a kid,

03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:21.160
his father was sent to Gulag on bogus pretenses, right? So he, when he was 16,

03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:25.480
he applied to a university. He wanted to become a theoretical physicist. By the way,

03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:31.560
my love for theoretical physics was the large extent because of that. And he was not accepted,

03:36:31.560 --> 03:36:37.480
even though he was brilliant, because he was the son of the enemy of the people. And he

03:36:39.480 --> 03:36:45.640
kind of broke him this experience that he didn't care when he was, you know, he went to technical

03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:51.320
school and he didn't really care. That's my take on it. And then he ended up in this, in this,

03:36:51.320 --> 03:36:55.480
in this little provincial town and he thought he would escape from it as soon as possible.

03:36:55.480 --> 03:37:03.320
And then he met my mother and they fell in love. And so I am sort of the product, the product of

03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:12.120
that, you know, but then what I learned is that because he was not able to overcome that specific

03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:19.000
experience, it felt to me to do it. And if I didn't, my son or my daughter would have, I think that

03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:24.360
that was one of the things I learned that was not by chance that about the same age

03:37:25.320 --> 03:37:30.200
for slightly different reasons. I was subjected to the same kind of unfairness and cruelty.

03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:37.640
And I, in some ways, I feel like I did it for him also. I always, because he was also always so

03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:44.280
proud of me. I was so happy. And I was, I had this tremendous gift twice. I was invited by American

03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:52.840
mathematical society to give this big lectures twice. It was in 2012 and in 2018. And both times

03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:58.920
they were in Boston. It could be anywhere in the US. Both times was in Boston, walking distance

03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:05.640
from my parents' place. So he could be there in my mom as well. And that was such a gift that he

03:38:05.640 --> 03:38:12.440
was beaming, you know, like seeing me on the stage. So, you know.

03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:19.800
Now that he's no longer here and it's just you. Well, I still have my mom. I still have my sister.

03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:23.160
Yeah. But as a man, there's some aspect that it's,

03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:31.880
that it does hit you hard. Are you afraid of your own death? Do you think about your death?

03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:38.600
Are you afraid of it? I have a certain conceptual view of life and death today,

03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:42.120
which is informed by my experiences. In particular, going through my father's death.

03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:49.400
And that is something which cannot be conceptualized. Like that experience, like you cannot

03:38:50.440 --> 03:38:57.720
give it to somebody. One thing I will say is that I felt that what it was, it was actually love,

03:38:57.720 --> 03:39:06.120
totally exposed, like naked. And you try to throw, it is so acute. So being facing that love

03:39:06.760 --> 03:39:14.200
is incredibly painful because it's so intense. When a person is alive, we have conversation,

03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:18.920
we have wars, we have some actions, we have some stuff is going on and it puts a filter.

03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:26.600
So we rarely actually feel love in this totally, completely pure, unadulterated state.

03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:31.000
But when a person dies, it's there. And it's staring at you. And no matter what you do,

03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:35.880
you cannot turn away. Like, I tried to, it's like, almost I felt like I want to throw a blanket over

03:39:35.880 --> 03:39:45.320
it. It burns, like immediately, like boom, gone. It's there. Live through it. And I was, I kept

03:39:45.320 --> 03:39:49.160
saying to myself, just live through it, live through it. That's how you, and that's how you

03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:55.560
know, also learn what is love, for example, what is it really? What is love? What is life also?

03:39:55.560 --> 03:40:04.200
Because I was completely, I had no idea. And, and then you kind of learn that, okay, so maybe

03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:11.640
it's not quite, there is more to it. There is more to it. There's more to this experience

03:40:11.640 --> 03:40:19.720
than what can be put in a concept or in a, in a, in a sentence, in a, in a, maybe poetry or music

03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:27.160
can do some justice to it. But if so, then my own life has that component, has that dimension,

03:40:27.720 --> 03:40:33.880
which is beyond anything I can say about it, you know, and even though I love this being this,

03:40:33.880 --> 03:40:41.480
playing this role, I love it. And I kind of, it kind of makes me feel different about all

03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:46.360
kinds of difficulties that arise because it's almost like I want to enjoy it because that's

03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:53.720
what being human is. It's being, it's being terrified. It's being frustrated. It's being

03:40:53.720 --> 03:41:02.680
self-loathing sometimes. It's not knowing, but also being joyful and just like, ah, let's just

03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:09.320
enjoy it. Kind of all of it, like that's why you came here for in some sense, you know, it's like

03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:15.560
not trying to run away from things, but kind of trying to just live through them and appreciate.

03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:19.560
So the biggest thing is gratitude in some sense. It's just gratitude. So thank you for letting me

03:41:19.560 --> 03:41:24.200
play. It's gratitude for every single moment, even if it's dark, even if it's a loss. Yes. And

03:41:24.200 --> 03:41:29.480
that's why I am so, people around me, they all say that it's a total doom and gloom and the world

03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:36.920
is ending. And I'm like, first of all, that's how you see it. Okay. That's not the only point of

03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:41.560
view, but also even if it is like, that's your challenge. Like, what are you going to do about

03:41:41.560 --> 03:41:46.600
it? Stop complaining about other people. Do something yourself. How can you make it a better

03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:52.920
world? You know. And I think all of that starts with just the gratitude for the moment to be able

03:41:52.920 --> 03:42:00.680
to play this game. Yeah. How beautiful it is. What we've talked about love, but let me ask,

03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:06.600
what role does love play in this whole game in the human condition? It's like the glue, you know,

03:42:06.600 --> 03:42:14.360
it's like for me. And it's not because people say love is like for a human being, like a romantic

03:42:14.360 --> 03:42:19.640
love, which is a huge component of it, obviously, because it's so, so beautiful to be able to

03:42:20.280 --> 03:42:26.920
express it in this way. But it could be love for what you do for your passion for something, you

03:42:26.920 --> 03:42:35.560
know, and, or, or love for, for your, for your friends, for instance, or love, it doesn't have to

03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:44.200
be. And so in some sense, that's, that's what it's all about. And ultimately, because living without

03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:52.040
love, it's kind of bland, boring. And so. And I don't think it's possible for science to explain

03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:57.960
exactly what it is. You can do a evolutionary biology perspective, you can talk about some kind

03:42:57.960 --> 03:43:04.280
of sociology perspective, psychology perspective, but the experience, the intensity where you forget

03:43:04.280 --> 03:43:12.600
or time where reminded becomes an illusion, and everything just freezes. And then it's kind of

03:43:12.600 --> 03:43:19.000
beautiful and painful to hear you say that when you experience love, the deepest is when you lost it.

03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:24.600
Yes. But in a sense, you can say that you could not have one without the other. I could not have

03:43:24.600 --> 03:43:31.720
that deep connection with my father, like really on so, so many levels. If there weren't a moment,

03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:35.240
that's how I see it. And I'm not trying to say that's how everybody should see. For instance,

03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:41.640
I respect Ray Kurzweil. I respect and I feel, and I almost like I feel good bumps right now. I feel

03:43:42.520 --> 03:43:51.400
that desire to reconnect. Even if it is in the form of a, you know, a computer program, let's be

03:43:51.400 --> 03:43:57.400
honest about it. I find it to be very moving. I find it very moving. And I understand because he

03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:01.800
actually didn't have a chance to spend much time. You know, I think he was 16 or 17 when he was a

03:44:01.800 --> 03:44:06.280
teenager. His dad died. I was lucky because my father died. I was much older. I've had so many

03:44:06.280 --> 03:44:12.360
moments with him, but that's not my thing. Like, I think it is a feature. It's not a bug and it

03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:16.840
sounds crazy. Like I would love, I would give anything to have him here right now. Right now,

03:44:17.400 --> 03:44:22.440
everything I have, I give it away right now. Where do I sign? Just see him for one hour.

03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:31.320
I promise you, I will. But I also know that then I'll still lose him or I will die or whatever.

03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:36.760
You know, so that thing, so what is, why is it so worse to just hold on to holding on to it?

03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:41.480
Why? Why are we holding on to this? And I am the first sucker. I'm the first one to hold on,

03:44:41.480 --> 03:44:47.000
but I'm questioning it now. Like, is there another way to approach life where you just, you know,

03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:55.560
how Buddha is like, just let it go. Enjoy and let it go. Enjoy and let it go. Is it possible?

03:44:56.360 --> 03:44:58.200
Accept the paradox of it.

03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:05.000
Well, ask me in a couple of years, you know, I will report. But I think that, but to my mathematical

03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:12.120
mind, it sounds like a very interesting idea, to be honest. Because to me, the idea of holding

03:45:12.120 --> 03:45:17.560
is, sounds like an impasse. Because no matter, in all my experience, and if you look in history,

03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:22.200
every time somebody's holding, you know, is how they said in the matrix, whatever has a beginning

03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:27.160
has an end. It's like, you cannot go around it. If you have a beginning, you will have an end.

03:45:27.160 --> 03:45:32.680
So then might as well just enjoy it and not worry too much about extending it longer.

03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:36.200
That's how I see it now. But maybe tomorrow will be something else.

03:45:38.440 --> 03:45:42.680
Yeah, the roller coaster life, the paradox of life. In other words, you're an incredible human

03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:46.360
being. I've been a fan for a long time. Thank you for writing love and math. Thank you. Thank you

03:45:46.360 --> 03:45:52.600
for being who you are, being both one of the greatest living mathematicians and still

03:45:53.800 --> 03:46:01.240
childlike wanderer of the exploring then how this whole world works, the nature of the universe.

03:46:01.240 --> 03:46:04.280
And thank you so much for speaking with me today. This is amazing.

03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:06.680
It's a pleasure. Thank you.

03:46:07.880 --> 03:46:11.640
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Edward Frankel. To support this podcast,

03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:16.120
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words

03:46:16.360 --> 03:46:23.480
from Sophia Kovalevska, a Russian mathematician. It is impossible to be a mathematician

03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:32.280
without being a poet in the soul. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
