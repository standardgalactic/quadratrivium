0	6000	If you have a democratic style of governance, you are entrusting people with one of the most
6000	10240	awesome and radical of responsibilities. And that's saying that you're going to pick the people
10240	13360	that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history. If you're
13360	17520	going to trust people to vote correctly, you have to be able to trust them to have open
17520	21920	and honest dialogue with each other. Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,
22640	26880	you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct
26880	31200	determinations when they hear these types of speeches. And if you're so worried that somebody's
31200	35120	going to hear a certain political figure and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly,
35120	38960	then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy to be a
38960	43200	viable institution, which is fine. You can be anti-democratic, but I don't think you can be
43200	50560	pro-democracy and anti-free speech. The following is a conversation with Stephen Bonnell,
51280	56560	also known online as Destiny. He's a video game streamer and political commentator,
56560	61440	one of the early pioneers of both live streaming in general and live streamed political debate and
61440	68320	discourse. Politically, he is a progressive, identifying as either left or far left, depending
68320	73600	on your perspective. There are many reasons I wanted to talk to Stephen. First, I just talked
73600	80240	to Ben Shapiro and many people have told me that Stephen is the Ben Shapiro of the left
80240	86000	in terms of political perspective and exceptional debate skills. Second reason
86000	93280	is he skillfully defends some nuanced, non-standard views, at the same time being pro-establishment,
93280	98400	pro-institutions, and pro-Biden, while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech.
99360	106000	Third reason is he has been there at the beginning and throughout the meteoric rise of the video
106000	112640	game live streaming community. In some mainstream circles, this community is not taken seriously,
112640	119120	perhaps because of its demographic distribution skewing young or perhaps because of the sometimes
119120	125680	harsh style of communication. But I think this community should be taken seriously and shown
125680	131920	respect. Millions of young minds tune into live streams like Destiny's to question and to try
131920	136880	to understand what is going on with the world, often exploring challenging, even controversial
136880	142160	ideas. The language is sometimes harsher and the humor is sometimes meaner than I would prefer,
142880	151040	but I, grandpa Lex, put on my rain boots and went into the beautiful chaotic muck of online discourse
151040	157680	and have so far survived to tell the tale with a smile and even more love in my heart than before.
158000	164560	On top of all this, we were lucky to have Malina Goranson, a popular streamer and world traveler,
164560	170640	join us at the end of the conversation. You can check out her channel on twitch.tv
170640	176400	slash malina, and you can check out Stephen's channel on youtube.com slash destiny. This is
176400	181360	the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And
181440	187520	now, dear friends, here's destiny. I don't know if you watched me watching your
188080	193200	yay interview. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm so curious. When you're navigating a conversation
193200	199440	like that, are you, how intentional is the thought process between like building rapport and pushing
199440	204560	and giving a little and letting like zero, zero intention? I was watching and thank you so much.
204560	208880	I was very kind for you to review that conversation. It meant a lot that you were
208880	214080	complimentary in parts on the technical aspects of the conversation, but no, zero. And I'm actually
214080	221840	deliberately trying to avoid, I think you've called it debate brain, which is just another
221840	230400	flavor of thinking about like the meta conversation, trying to optimize how should this conversation go.
230400	237040	Because I feel like the more you do that, the better you get at that, the less human connection
237040	241040	you have. Like the less genuinely you're actually sitting there in the moment and listening to the
241040	245520	person, you're more like calculating what's the right thing to say versus like feeling. What is
246880	250640	that person feeling right now? What are they thinking? That's what I'm trying to do is like
250640	256240	putting myself in their mind and thinking, what does the world look like to them? What does the world
256240	263280	feel like to them? And so from that, I truly try to listen. Now I'm also learning, especially because
263360	268240	Rogan and others have been giving me shit for not pushing back. It's good sometimes to say
269440	276800	from a place of care for the other human being to say, stop. What did you just say? I don't think
276800	283840	that represents who you are and what you really mean. Or maybe if it does at that time represents
283840	290560	who they are, I can see a better world if they grow into a different direction and try to point
290560	295040	that direction out to them. There's a really complicated dance between letting somebody
295040	300560	share their full story versus letting somebody like essentially proselytize your audience and
300560	306160	it's like, okay, hold on, let's take a minute here. But yeah, I used to be four or five years ago,
306160	310240	it was attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, whatever you said. And now I'm leaning way more
310240	313360	towards the like, okay, well, tell me how you feel about everything and then we'll go from there.
313360	316640	So a lot of people like my new approach, some older fans will watch and they're like,
316640	320000	why are you letting this guy just ramble on? You know, he said like five or six wrong things and
320000	323040	you're only going to call them out on two of them and it's like, it's different styles of
323040	326720	conversation, but yeah. Do you do a lot of research beforehand too? Depending on the
326720	330000	conversation, yeah. So if we're going to talk like vaccines and stuff, yeah, that's a ton of
330000	335040	reading and stuff that I never thought I'd know going into it. If it's a more personal, like political
335040	338560	philosophy conversation, there's not as much you can prepare for just, it truly depends on the
338560	342960	conversation. How much are you actually listening to the other person? Always listening, you have
342960	346640	to listen because as soon as you stop listening, the quality of everything falls apart, the connection
346640	350320	disappears, the quality of the conversation disappears, but my natural inclination is to
350320	354800	just be way more aggressive than normal. So I have to constantly remind myself, I guess you would
354800	358160	call it a meta conversation when you're like, okay, he's probably saying this because of that or
358160	363360	we'll let him go here and then we'll stop later. But yeah, because my preferred style of conversation
363360	366640	is like, I'm going to talk and the second I say something you disagree with, then let's
367360	371760	iron it out, right? I got like, I think in like syllogisms, like, okay, here's premise A,
372560	376880	good, okay, premise B, okay, and then conclusion. And then as long as we're both deductively
376880	380880	sound, we're not crazy, no psychosis, then we're going to agree on everything. Whereas other people
380880	384560	like to, most people think in stories like narratives, like a whole, there's a whole like
384560	388160	narrative and the individual facts don't matter as much because they'll pick and choose what they
388160	392560	want. And it's really hard because everybody thinks narratives have to function in that world,
392560	397600	but it's frustrating for me sometimes. Well, I've seen, you've had a lot of excellent debates.
397600	404320	One of them I just recently last night watched is on systemic racism. And it's the first time
404320	408640	I've seen you completely lose your shit. Oh, shoot, who was that against? I'm not sure exactly,
408640	412880	but you were just very frustrated and sorry, not lose your shit, but you're frustrated constantly
412880	419200	because of the thing, let's lay out 123. And every time you try to lay it out, it would falter.
419200	424320	I think it had to do with sort of, can you use data to make an argument? Or do you need to use
424320	429120	a study that does an interpretation of that data? And then there's like this tension between,
429120	433520	I think this is a behavioral economist that you were talking to. And the point is, you do this
433520	438000	kind of nice layout that the whole point of behavioral economics, it says there's more
438000	443600	to it than just the data you have to give a context and like do the rich, rigorous interpretation
443600	448080	in the context of the full human story. And then there was like a dance back and forth. Sometimes
448080	452960	you use data, sometimes not, and you're getting really frustrated and shutting down. And so that
452960	458000	felt like a failure mode. I've seen Sam Harris have similar sticking points. Like if we can't
458000	467520	agree on the terminology, we can't go on. To me, I feel like the Wittgenstein perspective is like,
468960	472880	I think if you get stuck on any one thing, you're just not going to make progress. You have to,
473760	482080	part of the conversation has to be about doing a good dance together versus being
482080	488480	dogmatically stuck on the path to truth. I think the true challenge is identifying
488480	495040	what of those sticking points are important versus what is not important. It's like if I'm
495040	500240	having an argument with somebody about Jewish representation and media, it might be like a
500240	504800	big conversation and they might say a couple things. I think Jewish people, they tend to help
504800	509120	their own or whatever and saying, okay. But for the purpose of the conversation, we can keep moving.
509200	513040	But if they casually drop like, yeah, and I think that's why the Holocaust numbers were
513040	516320	blown up from like 100,000 to 6 million. And I was like, okay, hold on, wait,
516320	520720	if you think this, we have to stop here because this is going to be, it's not just a language
520720	524480	game in this part. If you really believe this fact, then the whole rest of the conversation is
524480	530480	going to be informed by that belief. And it has to be something that doesn't bother you personally.
530480	535840	You have to step outside your own ego. So Holocaust denial is somebody that would bother a lot of
535840	541200	people and there's some things just observing you. I feel like when you get really good at
541200	548000	conversation, you can become a stickler to, you might have your favorite terms that really
548000	552640	bothers you. People don't agree on those terms. Beggs the question. You mean racing the question.
552640	557280	Yeah, I usually just want, people say stuff, I just let it slide, yeah. Because if you fight,
557280	560000	when you're having a conversation with somebody and you're talking to their audience at the
560000	563680	same time, because that's really what's happening, you never want to come off as over combative or
563680	568320	over aggressive because it puts people in like, there's like a trigger in your brain and this
568320	571680	is true of relationships or friendships of persuasive rhetoric or whatever. There's a
571680	574640	trigger in the brain and as soon as that defensive trigger gets like flipped on,
574640	578320	everything is over. You've lost the ability to persuade because everything becomes a fight at
578320	584000	that point. Yeah. Well, I wanted to talk to you because I heard somewhere that you were referred
584000	589120	to as the Ben Shapiro of the left and since I'm talking with Ben as well, I wanted to sort of
589120	596960	complete spiritually this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head. You are a progressive
596960	601840	but a progressive with many nonstandard progressive views and you had a heck of a fascinating
601840	607280	journey through all of that. And like I said, I think you argue with passion sometimes with
607280	613200	excessive amounts of passion. That's a really polite way of saying that. Almost always with
613200	618320	good faith and with rigor, with seriousness. I asked on your subreddit, which is an excellent
618320	625040	subreddit. Shout out to the Destiny subreddit so much, at least for that particular post.
625040	628640	What I really loved is when I asked for questions for you, there were like, holy
628640	634880	shit, there's adults and there's all behave. Like nobody say incest. I was like, what was going on
634880	639920	here? But actually the questions that rose to the top were really good. So somebody said that
639920	646560	Destiny was speaking of your journey was a conservative in his early teens. Then he became
646880	652880	libertarian. Then he became a left-wing social justice warrior. Then he flirted with socialism.
652880	657200	And now he is a social democrat liberal. I've also heard you refer to yourself
657760	662960	as a far left person. So to the degree there's truth to that journey. Can you take me through
662960	668560	your evolution through the landscape of political ideologies that you went through?
668560	676400	So my dad comes from Kentucky and my mom is a Cuban immigrant. Cubans are notorious for being
676480	681200	very conservative in the United States for historical reasons and for other reasons.
681200	688080	But my upbringing was a very Republican one. I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck,
688080	693680	Michael Savage on the radio, Billy Cunningham. I think Sean Hannity a little bit later on,
693680	697200	like that was like my whole upbringing politically. I remember I was writing,
698240	700720	I'd written like articles for the school journal, like in favor of
701360	705840	defending the war in Iraq and defending Bush from all the criticism, etc. So that was my
706400	712480	upbringing. I think once I hit high school college, I had my edgy, like libertarian-esque
712480	718160	high school phase of like reading Ayn Rand, of figuring out that like, oh my god, nothing in life
718160	722960	matters except for class and money. That's actually the answer to everything. And I got to college,
722960	730800	I became a Ron Paul fan, very big Ron Paul fan. And then from there, I kind of work, do life, life
730800	734880	happens at the kind of the lowest point in my life in terms of where I'm working financially.
734880	737920	Everything is like kind of in ruin in my life. There's a whole bunch of dumb stuff that's happened
737920	742480	probably my most conservative point. I don't know what it is about like being poor and thinking like
742480	745200	you can work your way out of it, you can do whatever. It's just my upbringing is always just
745200	748800	like, if you're not, if you're not, if you're not having financial success, just work, work, work,
748800	753280	work, work. And then I got into streaming, very, very lucky break. Everything just lined up at
753280	756560	the right time. And then as I've progressed through streaming, I would say through the years,
756560	761520	I've gradually fallen more and more to the left, especially once my kid turned four, five, six years
761520	766320	old. And I started to see like how much different his life was, just because of the financial
766320	770160	opportunities that I was able to provide for him through no merit of his own. And that started
770160	774400	to radically change how I viewed the world in a lot of ways. So actually, let's like linger on that.
774400	781680	Yeah. Low point. You worked at McDonald's, you worked at a casino, you did carpet cleaning.
781680	784960	What was the lowest point? Definitely the carpet cleaning.
785520	790160	Really? Absolutely. Why? Why was it the lowest point? That's when you were just flirting with
790160	795920	starting streaming. My whole life has been a series of lucky breaks, really, truly. I grew up
795920	801920	playing a lot of video games. But back in my day, our day, you had to read, there was a lot of text
801920	806320	on the screen. Back in my day, we used to play... They didn't all talk to you. Yeah, because nowadays,
806320	809760	everything's voice acting. But back then, you'd have to read a lot. I was a really good reader
809760	813200	and a really good vocabulary. Yeah, I've heard you actually say that. What games are we talking
813200	816960	about? What do you mean just reading? You're talking about like RPGs or what? Yeah, JRPGs. So
817040	821040	like Final Fantasy games, Fantasy Stars, all of these, like any RPG that would have been on the
821040	825920	SNES, Sega, PlayStation, these are the things that I'm... Let's pause on that. Okay. I just talked
825920	834880	to Howard, who's of the Elder Scrolls fame and the Fallout fame and beyond. What's your thoughts
834880	842080	on Elder Scrolls? Why Skyrim the greatest RPG of all time? Man, I really don't like Skyrim or Fallout.
842080	845600	You don't love it. Oh, really? No, not at all. Why do you hate Skyrim?
845600	849920	Yeah, so I really like characters and like compelling stories and narratives around those
849920	853920	characters. And I like to see them kind of like grow and change kind of like a movie or a story.
853920	858160	So in your like Final Fantasy games, you've got characters. There are a lot of like,
859440	863840	like classical tropes of like a character starts off kind of like edgy angsty all on their own.
863840	867760	They develop relationships, friendships, they realize that the life is more about themselves
867760	871520	and they do that. And I like that growth. That's kind of what you see in all of those old role
871520	875120	playing games. I didn't like the open world ones as much because your main character is just like
875120	880240	a blank slate, never talks. It's for you to like project onto. But there's not the same like linear
880240	884480	narrative of like growth for the character. Oh, that's fascinating. There's an actual story arc
884480	888960	to the character that's more crafted in a beautiful way by the designers of the game. Yeah.
888960	892240	I don't think one is better or worse. I tend towards like, I want to hear a compelling story
892240	895360	around like a set of characters that like grow and change just again. Oh, that's beautifully
895360	901440	put then. Yeah, I just really loved being able to leave the town, you go outside the town and you
901440	906160	look outside its nature and the world of possibilities is before you. You can do whatever the fuck you
906160	911680	want. I mean, that immensity of just being lost in the world is really immersive for me. But yeah,
911680	918400	you're right. Whatever attracts you about a world. So you were just starting to play video games.
918960	921360	You go out play to video games. That's one of your lucky breaks.
922000	925600	There's just like a lot of random skills you pick up depending on the type of game you play.
925600	930000	I played a lot of tech space games on the computer. So I was a very fast type or I'm still a very
930000	935520	fast type or read a lot, you know, learn weird kind of math stuff for some of the calculations,
935520	940880	some of the games. I think I'm pretty good at getting information, figuring stuff out, learning
940880	945280	patterns, all of that. And then that plus the reading and everything in the games meant that I
945840	949520	I don't want to say I excelled in school because my grades were pretty bad, but I was on like all
949520	954000	honors, all AP classes or whatever. A lot of dual enrollment, a lot of AP credit going into college.
954000	957520	So I did pretty well in school, probably better than I should have, but it was because I had the
957520	961040	game stuff that was like really powering a lot of my brain there while I was trying to sleep
961040	966560	through class. So you're able to soak in information, integrate it, quickly take notes.
966560	971120	Generally, I think I'm pretty good at that. You do this a lot when you stream your typing stuff.
971120	976320	Is there a system in that note taking? And what note what do you use for note taking?
976320	983360	Does it matter? I use a notepad. Like notepad.exe notepad.exe not the plus plus not.
983440	987600	Is there genius to the madness behind that? Or you just don't give a shit?
987600	992080	No, I mean, it's going to depend on the style of conversation. If I'm with somebody that is
992080	996800	very meticulously organized their thoughts and they're a fine and better word here for Rambler,
996800	1000240	you can edit that in, better word for Rambler. Somebody that talks a lot and a lot, I'll start
1000240	1004800	like taking notes, bullet points like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, because there's a
1004800	1008960	style of conversation where I say seven or eight different things. And then when you go to respond
1008960	1012480	to everything I said, I cut you off immediately and we argue that point. But if somebody's going
1012480	1015680	to do that, he's just like, hold on, you just said these eight things, I'm going to respond to
1015680	1018800	every single one. I've written them all down and then you can go, if you want to go point by
1018800	1021360	point, we can, but you just said all this and I wrote it down, so we're going to go.
1021360	1024560	So what are you actually writing down like a couple of words per point they left?
1025280	1029040	Honestly, like there are very few unique conversations in politics. Like a lot of them
1029040	1033520	are kind of retreading old ground. So if we're having a debate on abortion, somebody might say,
1033520	1036800	like, oh, well, I believe this thing about viability. And I believe this thing about, you
1036800	1040080	know, when they're a fetus versus a human and I'll just write down like those points so that when
1040080	1043600	I go to respond, I kind of have like a like note cards, like a guiding thing there to
1043600	1047120	keep me centered on my response. Political discourse is a kind of tree you're walking
1047120	1051840	down and I got it and you're like taking just to keep my focus guided. So I'm not like
1051840	1054320	running off in a weird tangent or responding to something I didn't say or something.
1054320	1059120	What about like doing research? It's just, is there a system to your note taking? Because
1059680	1064320	mentally, you seem to be one of the most organized people I've listened to. So is there,
1064320	1066960	is it in your mind or is there a system that's on paper?
1067520	1072960	A little of both. I feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing if you have interest in an area.
1073600	1077520	So like what I'll tell people is, let's say there's like a totally new topic that I'm
1077520	1080480	researching. I don't know anything. And I'll do a couple of these on stream. I think they're boring
1080480	1084720	about it. People watch it. I might open a Wikipedia article and I'll read and I hit something I don't
1084720	1088240	know. And then I open the next Wikipedia article and I'll read into and then I might have like seven
1088240	1092240	tabs open and I'll read and I'll read and I'll read. And I'll read a ton of stuff maybe for
1092240	1095840	hour two, three, four hours of stuff. And then by the end, you know, someone in chat will ask me
1095840	1100880	like, do you even remember like this particular thing? And I'll say, not really. No, not too much.
1100880	1104480	But what happens is as long as you've seen it once, what'll happen is like the next day of the
1104480	1108720	day after we'll read something else. And we're like, oh, I remember that thing from this thing.
1108720	1112080	I remember like vaguely that. And then if you see it like a third time, you're like, oh, this
1112080	1117280	makes sense because especially when it comes to, oh, here's like a little trick on stuff. If you're
1117280	1122240	ever reading any news and there's a place that pops up, always look at it on a map because so
1122320	1126480	much of history is like on a map. It's so important to like know the geography. It makes things make
1126480	1131360	so much more sense. But yeah, once I once I start to see stuff over and over again, just because
1131360	1134800	I've like read it a few times, stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind and like, oh, yeah,
1134800	1138240	well, this makes sense. Of course, these people believe this because of this or of course, like
1138240	1142240	this happened here, it's because you know, that happened there. So yeah, it's a lot of that if
1142240	1147440	there's like a topic that I'm doing specific research for. So like vaccine related stuff is a
1147440	1152240	big one. The Ukrainian Russian conflict is a big one. That I'll break out a note. I'll probably
1152240	1155440	get like a Google doc and I'll just start like writing like an outline of kind of the rough
1155440	1158880	points of everything just to organize my thoughts around different topics. Yeah.
1158880	1162240	We're just going to go on tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. We'll return to the
1162240	1166400	low point of your life at some point, always returning from the philosophy to the psychology.
1166400	1177760	So you did the Ukraine topic. One question is, what role does US play in this war? Could they
1177760	1184320	have done something to avoid the war? Did they have a role to play in forcing Vladimir Putin's
1184320	1192880	hand? Do they have a role to play in deescalating the war towards a peace agreement and the opposite?
1192880	1198400	If it does escalate towards something like the use of a tactical nuclear weapon,
1198400	1203600	are they to blame? Are we to blame? Oh man, somebody sent me an email a while ago with great
1203600	1209520	words. There's a specific way to navigate a conversation where you can kind of like contribute
1209520	1214800	to a negative event, but you're not really the one responsible for it. Like the classic example
1214800	1218480	is a woman goes out late at night, gets a little bit too drunk, and then something happens. And
1218480	1222160	it's like, while there might have been steps you could have taken to mitigate the risk,
1222160	1227680	it's not her fault of what happened because the responsibility rests on the agent making
1227680	1231920	the choice, right? There's a chooser at some point that is choosing to do wrong or evil.
1232720	1237760	I don't believe in any of the arguments that say the United States has contributed to Russia's
1237760	1242480	position on Ukraine or the actions that they've taken on Ukraine. There are several arguments
1242480	1248000	that some people, some even political scholars are putting out there to say that the United
1248000	1251680	States is to blame, but I find them completely unconvincing. I think that when you ask the
1251680	1256000	question of like, what is the United States role or what has our role been? I think it's
1256000	1258960	really important for us. I don't think we even agree as a country on what our role should be,
1258960	1262800	which I think is a hard one because you've got this kind of, there's this growing populist
1262800	1266560	movement in the United States. It might be the far left and the far right. And I think populists
1266560	1271120	tend to have this kind of isolationist view of the world where the United States should just be
1271120	1275200	our own thing. We shouldn't be telling anybody what to do. We shouldn't be the world police.
1275200	1278720	And then kind of more in these like center left, center right positions. And then across a lot of
1278720	1282720	Europe, you've got, well, okay, the United States is kind of like the big kid on the block.
1282720	1286480	Like we're looking to them for guidance and leadership on situations like what's going on
1286480	1291760	in Ukraine. So in so far as the original question is like, what is like the United
1291760	1296000	States responsibility? I think we have a responsibility to ensure the relative like
1296000	1301280	freedom, prosperity and stability across Europe. I think that defending Ukraine's sovereignty
1301280	1305920	and right to their borders is a part of that. And I don't believe that prior to the invasion
1305920	1311280	in 2022, I don't think the United States was contributing to Russia invading that country.
1312240	1316400	I know there are arguments given that like the expansion of NATO has something that's been
1316400	1320720	threatening to Russia, but the Baltics joined and Russia didn't do anything about it. The
1320720	1325600	invasion to Crimea was very clearly a response to the revolution in 2014. The invasion on the
1325600	1331600	borders is clearly a response to Ukraine winning that civil war in the Southeast and the Donbass
1331600	1335120	and Russia becoming more aggressive. I don't think that you can blame any of that on NATO
1335120	1338160	expansion. There's no NATO countries that are threatening Russia or debating Russia.
1338720	1344160	Do you think there is a nuclear threat? Do you think about this? Do you worry about this that
1344160	1348560	there is a threat of a tactical nuclear weapon being dropped? I think that possibility exists
1348560	1353520	either way. I think the responsibility for that is on Russia because it just can't be the case
1353520	1357120	that if you have nukes, you're allowed to invade countries and take their land. Because of anything,
1357120	1362320	I think that that down the road also increases the potential for nuclear problems in the future,
1362880	1366400	because at that point, either every single country has to acquire their own nuclear weapons,
1366400	1370400	because if you don't, Russia's going to mess with you, or every single country has to join NATO,
1370400	1373440	and now what? We're back at square zero, ground zero, square one, where people are like,
1373440	1376240	oh, well look, all these countries joining NATO is aggressive towards Russia. What are you going
1376240	1383120	to do? Yeah, you've mentioned that there's a complicated calculus going on with the countries
1383120	1389520	that have nuclear weapons, and what's our responsibility? Are you allowed to do anything
1389600	1395280	you want to countries that don't have nuclear weapons? That's a really tricky discussion,
1395280	1399520	for sure, because what is U.S. supposed to do if Russia drops a tactical nuclear weapon?
1400240	1409280	There's a set of options, none of which are good, and it's such a tricky moment right now,
1409280	1416960	because the things that Biden and other public figures say, I feel like has a significant impact
1416960	1421040	on the way this game turns out, because I think mutually assured destruction is partially a game
1421040	1430400	of words. I mean, I believe in the power of conversation of leaders talking to each other.
1430400	1441040	I feel like you have to have a balance between threat and compromise, and empathy for the needs,
1441040	1449920	the geopolitical, the economic needs of a nation, but also respect and represent your own interests.
1450960	1456720	It's a tricky one. How do you play the hand? It reminds me of, I don't know if you've ever
1456720	1460160	heard of evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology. There are things called tit for tat
1460160	1465120	strategies. It reminds me of that, where there are a whole bunch of these little biological
1465120	1468560	mechanisms where creatures will develop, like socializing, like tit for tat. If you do something
1468640	1472720	bad to me, I'm going to do something bad for you, and then more complicated schemes will come out,
1472720	1477200	where it'll be like tit, tit for tat, where it's like you can make one mistake, and then I'm going
1477200	1480640	to get you to do a second one, or it could be tit, tit, tit for tat, or there could be tit for tat,
1480640	1486800	tat for tat. There's all these back and forths where creatures optimize themselves. I think
1486800	1490400	something the United States did really well in terms of that kind of conversational strategy,
1490400	1495280	and I approved of this in the beginning, was Biden was very clear about setting out the exact
1495280	1499520	level of US involvement for the war. We're not going to do a no-fly zone. There's not going to be
1499520	1502800	US troops on the ground in Ukraine, but we are going to send a whole bunch of money and a whole
1502800	1506560	bunch of arms and a whole bunch of intel to them. I thought he did a good job at laying out the
1506560	1510480	limitation of the US involvement while opening as much as we could in the ways that we could help,
1511040	1516080	but that looming threat of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon, I think on the table right now
1516080	1519520	is like it's going to be the annihilation of Russian seaforces and everything, but
1520400	1524000	what happens if it continues to escalate? That's like a world that nobody wants to
1525520	1530000	be in. Yeah. So we talked about difficult conversations, and again, thank you so much
1530000	1537760	for reviewing the Yale conversation. Let me ask you about Putin. Speaking of difficult conversations,
1537760	1542880	so if you sit down, if I sit down with somebody like Vladimir Putin or Vladimir Zelensky,
1543680	1547440	what's the right way to have that conversation? Oh man. We can talk about that one or we could talk
1547440	1557520	about somebody more well understood through history like Stalin or Hitler, something like that.
1557520	1564080	Maybe that's an easier example to illustrate how to handle extremely difficult conversations.
1564080	1566960	Yeah. I mean, I can handle really difficult conversations between like two people,
1567760	1572560	leaders of countries though. There's so much that you are representing in that conversation.
1573280	1578560	I guess the thing that would be interesting to me would be like, what is Vladimir Putin's
1578560	1584400	interest? What is the genuine interest that he has in the conflict? Because I think finding out
1584400	1588400	like what is your buy-in or what is the driving force keeping you here is probably the most
1588400	1592480	important thing. I think for Zelensky, I think it's quite a bit more simpler because he's
1593440	1598080	on the defense, so it's defending his country and his people. For Putin, I've heard all sorts of
1598080	1603600	things. Dugan has his writings on like the East versus the West, the collapse of the West in the
1603600	1609280	face of all of the liberalism and the weird LGBT stuff that they criticize. You've got the desire
1609280	1613840	to return to this former Soviet Union-esque thing. You've got Putin's quotes that collapse of the
1613840	1619680	Soviet Union was the biggest geopolitical disaster of 20th century. I guess figuring out what is
1619680	1622080	Putin after. I'm not actually sure. I don't know the answer to that question. I know a lot of people
1622080	1625760	write about it, but yeah. Well, there's a lot of answers to that question. There's a lot of answers
1625760	1629520	that he can give to that question, so say I sit down with him for three hours and talk about it.
1630880	1637040	I think this is a really interesting distinction because you do do difficult conversations
1637040	1642720	in the space of ideas, but also in your stream, there's a bunch of drama going on. There's the
1642720	1651200	human psychology is laid out in its full richness before you. To me with leaders, I think a part of
1651200	1656800	the conversation has to be about the human psychology, not like a meta-conversation, but
1658400	1665120	really understand what they feel, what they fear, who they are as a human being. As a family man,
1665920	1671760	as a person proud of their country, as a person with an ego, as a person who's been
1672480	1679520	affected, if not corrupted by powers, all of us can be and likely are. All of that,
1679520	1685840	that gives context to then the answers about what do you want in this war, because the answers
1685840	1692400	about what you want in this war will be political answers. It's a game that's being played again
1692400	1697280	with words, and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game. I think the deeper truth
1698320	1704000	comes from understanding the human being from which those words come, and I think that's what
1704000	1707760	you do. I don't know if you do those kinds of conversations where- Never talked to any country
1707760	1713040	leader, so- No, not a country leader, but say a controversial figure or somebody that represents
1713040	1718880	a certain idea. Don't just talk in a space of ideas or challenge the ideas, but understand who
1718880	1723360	is this person, how did you come to those ideas? Oh yeah, when I've had, there have been a couple
1723360	1728960	of very controversial right-leaning figures. So the two, obviously the mainstream is made by
1728960	1735200	Lauren Southern and Nick Fuentes. Those types of conversations initially aren't very political at
1735200	1740240	all. Yeah, it's more like, obviously we believe in very, very, very different things that beliefs
1740240	1743680	don't happen accidentally, so how did you get to where you are? Those are way more personal
1743680	1749440	conversations, that's true. Is there things you regret about those conversations where you failed?
1749440	1754960	Is there things you're proud of or you succeeded? For things that I'm proud of, I feel like I'm
1754960	1760080	really good at attempting to understand people without judgment, that I think a lot of people
1760080	1763440	feel like they can have conversations with me where they can share a lot, and I'm not going to jump
1763440	1768880	down their throat for them having a politically incorrect observation, or for them being judgmental
1768880	1772480	to somebody else or having a feeling that's maybe not something they should have something they're
1772480	1776400	embarrassed about. So I think I do a really good job at that, and then by extension of that,
1776400	1779840	I've gotten the ability to hear perspectives from so many different people that I think I can
1779840	1785360	understand a lot of different perspectives. For failures of mine, I mean it's always going to be
1786720	1790400	on stream, it'll be like I didn't push back hard enough or I didn't know a certain fact for a
1790400	1794800	conversation. These are usually the they're going to be on these like very technical grounds
1794800	1798160	generally. I'm pretty happy with like the direction my conversations have gone
1798800	1801760	recently, especially over like the past six months. So your goal is to
1802800	1810800	de-radicalize the audience of those folks. So that used to be my goal. My goal was de-radicalization.
1810800	1814640	Now I'm kind of hoping that that's just the byproduct. So the goal I think is to talk to
1814640	1819200	somebody and to show they believe this because of these reasons, and if you want to change
1819200	1822640	people's beliefs, we have to talk about the underlying reasons for why they think the things
1822640	1826400	they think. It's not enough to just say like that belief is bad because it's like, well,
1826400	1830000	they believe it for a whole bunch of things that are true and real to them at least. So you have
1830000	1834320	to address all of the underlying things that they believe before you can change the overlying
1834320	1838560	belief. So if I'm having a conversation with somebody, it'll be like, okay, why do you feel
1838560	1842960	this about that, that, and that? Okay, I understand that. Maybe like a better way to solve that would
1842960	1848320	be like this or that instead of this thing. So to what degree do you have to empathize with the
1848320	1855840	person's worldview versus pushback? That's always the hard one. When I'm talking to other people,
1855840	1860560	it's almost always me stepping as much inside their bubble as I can. I have to like live and
1860560	1865360	breathe their worldview and be able to speak their worldview in order to like navigate their thoughts.
1865360	1870720	Because my worldview is, and I'm not even used as an insult. I don't know if I am a little bit
1870720	1874320	autistic or something, but when I break apart things, I just want to see like study, study,
1874320	1878000	study, fact, fact, fact. That's how my mind works for everything. That's what I like to see.
1878720	1881760	Personal stories don't do much for me. Narratives don't do much for me. Just show me like the
1881760	1885680	data and the studies or whatever. But for other people, I think most brains are more human than
1885680	1890240	that and they tend to see things in more kind of like surreal pictures that are kind of painted
1890240	1894240	and the brush strokes are way broader and they don't care about the itty-bitty tiny fact.
1895040	1898400	So if I'm talking to somebody else and I'm trying to get into their head and I'm trying
1898400	1903040	to change their mind on things, I'm going to be stepping into their world and I'm going to try
1903040	1908400	to be working through that framework. Really good example might be, we'll say like when it comes
1908400	1913360	to trans issues for minors, okay, 16 or 17-year-old needs to go on puberty blockers. The way that I
1913360	1918720	want that debate to play out is let's look at all the data, let's see what are the outcomes,
1918720	1921840	let's see what are the processes for getting a medication, and then we'll evaluate all of that
1921840	1925920	and then we'll go in whatever like points more favorably. But that's wholly unconvincing to
1925920	1929600	most people, right? So as a parent, if I'm having that conversation with another parent,
1929600	1933280	the easiest way for me to have that conversation is like, hey, we both have kids.
1933280	1936800	Imagine how horrible it would be if we felt like our kids needed help and the government
1936800	1941120	was trying to get between us and their doctor in that conversation. That might be how that
1941120	1944160	talk plays out, which I mean, I think that's a really good argument because I think there
1944160	1946640	probably are times when the government should get in between it, but I'll have that conversation
1946640	1950880	because now I'm in a world where they understand what I'm saying, I'm resonating with the way
1950880	1954800	that they feel about things and then I can make progress with the way that they're kind of viewing
1954800	1959120	the world because I'm talking in a language they understand. So on this particular topic of
1959120	1965120	trans issues, is that the reason you were banned from Twitch? I'm not sure. I don't know. They just
1965120	1969520	said hate speech, but I don't use like slurs or anything. So it's hard to know exactly. So I think
1969520	1974480	you made the claim that trans women shouldn't compete with cis women in the women's athletics.
1975680	1981680	Can you make this case and can you still man the case against it? I think in your community,
1981680	1987920	there's a lot of trans folks who love you and there's a lot who hate you. Yeah. And so if you
1987920	1994000	can walk the tightrope of this conversation to try to steal men both sides. One of the argumentative
1994000	1997200	strategies I say is that like anytime you have a conversation, you should be able to argue both
1997200	2004640	sides better than anybody else. So for the my side, the genuine belief side, it feels like
2004640	2012960	overwhelmingly all of the data is showing that trans women, even after I think three years on
2013040	2019680	some sort of like HRT or estrogen stuff, they're still maintaining these advantages from their
2019680	2025680	male puberty over cisgender women. And if that is the case, if we are going to draw these distinctions
2025680	2031040	around our sports between women and men, it feels unfair to have a category inside the women's
2031040	2036320	sports that are maintaining advantages that are coming from a male puberty, regardless of the
2036320	2042160	amount of time they've spent on hormone replacement therapy. So that would be my argument on that side.
2042160	2048560	So it's unfair from a performance enhancement aspect. So the same way we ban performance
2049760	2055680	enhancing drugs that involve increasing of testosterone in that same way would be unfair.
2055680	2062800	Essentially, yeah. So what's the case against? So the case in favor of them competing together is
2062800	2069360	that realistically, there's not going to be a trans sports category. Realistically, trans women
2069360	2072240	aren't going to be competitive with cis men because they've gone through these huge,
2072960	2078000	you know, like hormone changes by the medication they're taking. And that when we look at how
2078000	2083440	sports are kind of done anyway, there's a whole bunch of biological differences between people
2083440	2087920	within sports categories that are determining their placement in the professional world.
2087920	2092320	So for instance, somebody like me is probably never going to go far in the NBA because I'm not
2092320	2096320	tall enough. I think the average height in the NBA. Don't doubt yourself. Don't doubt myself yet.
2096320	2102240	I want to say like six or something. They're huge people. Or, you know, you look at like Michael
2102240	2107360	Phelps is a classic example of a guy whose torso is like so long his body is built for swimming.
2107360	2110800	And I think there are some trans people that will look at that or somebody advocating for
2110800	2115040	this position. They'll look at that and go, okay, realistically, the way that Michael Phelps body
2115040	2119520	processes lactic acid, the shape physiologically of his body is going to put him in a level of
2119520	2124240	competition that so many men are never going to reach just because of biology. How is it fair
2124240	2128160	that you can have these biological outliers competing in these categories? But then when we
2128160	2131840	come to like sports categories with trans and cis women, you're going to take trans women and say
2131840	2135440	that they can't compete against cis women. Can't you also just say that they have some level of
2135440	2139040	biological difference there? Like, is it really going to be that great of a difference than what
2139040	2143360	Michael Phelps has versus the average swimmer or an NBA player has versus like the average height
2143360	2150480	male? Yeah, do you think we're going to get into some tricky ethical territory as we start to be
2150480	2157120	able to, through biology and genetics, modify the human body? Absolutely. I feel like those
2157120	2163680	things are coming sooner than we wanted them to. Oh, man, dude, have you seen the AI art?
2163680	2169840	Yes, of course. I'm an AI person. Oh, okay, then yeah, yeah. That's always been like,
2169840	2174240	what's going to happen when robots can do art better than humans, lol? Like, well,
2174240	2178800	we'll see you in 20 years and 20 years and 20 years. And now you have AI art winning competitions.
2179280	2185280	And it's funny because robots are essentially... There's a robot behind you, by the way.
2185280	2190880	A robot behind me. Oh, nice. Robots are really good at... Careful what you say. Yeah. Oh,
2190880	2194800	god, I'll be careful. That's not like the one of the Chinese ones with a gun on it, right? Oh, okay.
2196080	2201760	Hopefully not. We'll see, depending on what you say, yeah. Robots are really good at showing
2201760	2208480	the limitations of the human mind in categories that we didn't believe we were limited before.
2208720	2216400	I think that humans have this idea, intrinsically, that we have some type of innovative creative
2216400	2222400	drive that is just outside of the bounds of physical understanding. And with a sophisticated
2222400	2226880	enough program, we see that maybe that's not actually true. And that's a really scary thing
2227440	2231440	philosophically to deal with because we feel like we're very special, right? We own the planet,
2231440	2235280	we make computers, and the idea that you can start to get these robots that can do things that's
2235360	2240160	like, okay, you can do math, fine. Okay, you can do calculations, fine. But you can't do art.
2240160	2243840	That's the human stuff. And then when they start to do that, it's like, oh, shoot.
2243840	2249520	And that terrifies you a little bit, like the human species losing control of our dominance?
2250800	2254160	I don't think it's necessarily losing control of our dominance. I mean, I guess a Skynet thing
2254160	2260320	could come in at some point. But I think it brings us to this really fundamental level of like,
2260320	2264400	what does it mean to be human? What is it that we're good at? What should we be doing with
2264400	2268960	technology? We never really asked that question in the Western world. It's always the technology is
2268960	2273600	like normative in that technology equals good, and more technology equals better. That's been
2273600	2277440	like the default assumption. In fact, if you ask a lot of people, how do you know if civilization
2277440	2281680	has progressed over the past 100 or 200 years, they don't say we have better relationships,
2281680	2285600	we, you know, have longer marriages, we blah, blah, blah, they'll say technology has improved.
2285600	2290320	We've got crazy phones, we've got crazy computers. And the idea that more technology might be bad
2290320	2293840	has never even crossed somebody's mind, unless it's used for like a really bad thing. So,
2293920	2298000	well, it's interesting. We kind of think as more and more automation is happening,
2298000	2302880	we're going to get more and more meaning from things like being artists and doing creative
2302880	2309360	pursuits. And here's like, oh, shit, if the art, if the creative pursuits are also being automated,
2309360	2312800	then what are we going to gain meaning from? What are the activities from which we'll gain
2312800	2317120	meaning? You know, my whole life I've been working on artificial intelligence systems. There's been
2317120	2323360	different revolutions. One of them is the machine learning revolution. And it's interesting to build
2323440	2331120	up intuition and destroy that intuition about what is and isn't solvable by machines. I think
2332240	2336800	for the longest time, I grew up thinking go is not, the game of go is not solvable.
2338480	2342160	Because my understanding of AI systems is ultimately that it's
2344000	2349360	fundamentally a search mechanism that is fundamentally going to be brute force. There's
2349360	2353920	no shortcuts. Sure. Like if it can't solve the traveling salesman problem, it's not even
2353920	2358240	going to be able to give you an approximation. So most interesting problems are giant travel
2358240	2361920	salesman problem. And then, so of course, it's not going to be able to solve that. And then you,
2362560	2367680	then the deep learning revolution made you realize, holy shit, these large neural networks with a
2367680	2378080	giant number of knobs is able to actually somehow estimate functions that can do a pretty good job
2378080	2384080	of understanding deep representation of a thing, whether that's a game of go, or whether it's the
2384080	2391520	human natural language, or if it's images and video or audio and even actions and different
2391520	2397280	video games and actions of robotics and so on. And then you realize with diffusion models and
2398400	2403760	different generative models, you start to realize, holy shit, it can actually generate not just
2404720	2412480	interesting representations or interesting manifestations of the representations and forms,
2412480	2417600	but it's able to do something that impresses humans in its creativity. It's beautiful in
2417600	2422000	the way we think of art is beautiful. Like it surprises us and makes us chuckle and makes us
2422800	2427520	sit back and all and all those kinds of things. And yet the thing that it seems to struggle with
2427520	2432880	the most is the physical world currently. So that's counterintuitive. We humans think that it's
2433920	2440720	pretty trivial, being able to pick up a cup, being able to write with a pen in the physical
2440720	2445440	space, we think that's trivial. We give ourselves respect for being great artists and great
2446080	2450240	mathematicians and all that kind of stuff. And that seems to be much easier than the physical
2450240	2455280	space. Our bodies are really cool. There is a, I don't know, it's probably Asimov or something,
2455280	2458480	there was some science fiction writer that had a short story and it was like an alien that had
2458480	2462720	landed on earth and it was describing our bodies from a totally alien perspective. And when you
2462720	2468320	think about all the things we can do, it's pretty cool. We can climb through a whole multitude of
2468320	2473920	environments. We can exist in a multitude of temperatures. We can manipulate things just
2473920	2478240	with our hands and the way that we can interact with things around us. And yeah, we're very capable
2478240	2481360	on a physical level. Even though, like you said, we think about ourselves like, oh, well, human
2481360	2485040	beings have really big brains and we do. We're really intelligent as well, but our bodies are
2485040	2493520	pretty cool too. And it's a fascinating hierarchical biological system. We're made up of a bunch of
2493520	2501280	different living organisms that all don't know about the big picture of our body and it's all
2501280	2507120	functioning its own little local world and it's doing its thing, but together as it forms a
2507120	2517120	super resilient system, all of that comes from a very compressed encoding of what makes a human.
2517120	2524640	You start with the DNA and it builds up from a single cell to a giant organism. And because of
2524640	2529760	the DNA through the evolution process, you can constantly create new humans and new living
2529760	2534160	organisms that adapt to the environment. Like that resilience to the physical world,
2535040	2540960	it seems like running the whole earth over again, the whole evolutionary process over again,
2541600	2547520	is might be the only way to do it. So to create a robot that actually adapts
2548800	2553520	is as resilient to the dynamic world might be a really difficult problem.
2554240	2557920	Possibly. Well, it's going to say like in a programming environment, you can do things on
2557920	2562640	time scales that are impossible in the real world, right? Like the benefit to AI and computers is
2562720	2567520	computationally, they can compute so much data so quickly. Whereas on human timetables, we have
2567520	2572240	to wait. When you talk about evolution, you know, it's generation after generation after
2572240	2576400	generation, you know, maybe in a virtual environment that could be simulated and then those changes
2576400	2580160	could happen a lot quicker. Well, that's not a human time scale, but you have to look at earth
2580800	2586320	as a quantum mechanical system, the computation is happening super fast. This is a giant computer
2586320	2591760	doing a giant simulation. So just because for us humans, it's slow, there's like trillions of
2591840	2597760	organisms involved in you, destiny being you. Sure. But the next iteration of like,
2597760	2601840	from human to human, even if on the quantum level, there's a lot of stuff going on, you talk about
2601840	2606720	like, like changes in DNA, for instance, right? Like, that's happening from a generation to
2606720	2610160	generation time scale, like in a virtual environment that could theoretically happen.
2610160	2614080	Well, it already is, there's like protein folding, like huge cloud computing,
2614080	2616800	probably ML stuff that's like working on doing all that stuff, and it'll run like
2616800	2620400	trillions and trillions of simulations, you know, every second and stuff, maybe not every second,
2620400	2626800	but still slower than the actual protein folding, much slower. That's for the problem
2626800	2633200	of solving protein folding to estimate the 3D structure, but the actual body does the actual
2633200	2638960	protein folding way faster. So like we're, the question is, can we shortcut the simulation of
2639520	2643360	human evolution, try to figure out how to build up an organism without
2643920	2648240	simulating all the details? Because we have to simulate all the details of biology were
2648240	2652160	screwed. We don't have- Oh, sure. We'd have to put something in a pond and then watch it for-
2652160	2654320	That might be the most efficient way to do it. Sure.
2654320	2659520	That's what the universe most likely is. It's a kind of simulation created by a teenager in
2659520	2665200	their basement to try to see what happens. It's a computer game. That might be the most
2665200	2671760	efficient way to create interesting organisms, but within the system is perhaps possible to create
2671760	2679520	other robots that will be of use and will entertain us in the way that other humans
2679520	2684880	entertain us. And that's a really interesting, of course, problem, but it's surprising how
2684880	2690400	difficult it has been to create systems that operate in the physical world and operate in
2690400	2696160	that physical world in a way that's safe to humans and interesting to humans. Because there's also
2696160	2700560	the human factor, the human robot interaction. To me, that's like the most interesting problem,
2700560	2707520	to figure out how to do that well. Elon Musk and others, Boston Dynamics have worked on
2707520	2713280	legged robots, so I really care about legged robots. Those are super interesting, how to
2713280	2718800	make them such that they're able to operate successfully in a dynamic environment. It's
2718800	2725040	super tricky. They're like the dumbest of dogs, speaking of which is a dog barking outside.
2726000	2731520	It's really tricky to create those kinds of organisms that live in the human world.
2731520	2739760	Then again, if more and more of us move into the digital world, to you stream a lot,
2739760	2746000	like part of who you are exists in the digital space. The fact that you have a physical
2746000	2751280	representation also, maybe more and more will become not important.
2752240	2755600	I hope that's the case, because I bought a lot of stock in Meta, and man, it's down
2756240	2762240	a lot. Meta the company. Is there some degree? Can you look at yourself,
2762240	2767200	like Steven, the physical meat vehicle, and then the destiny of this digital space,
2767760	2774000	like digital avatar? Do you sense that in a certain way, you're the digital avatar?
2774560	2778400	I've always tried to keep my on-stream personality as genuine as possible. They're
2778400	2781920	one and the same to me. I don't really view them as two separate entities, but I mean,
2781920	2786800	I always view myself as Steven, the real-life person. Destiny's my online name, but...
2786800	2791440	No, but because so many, your social network has established the digital space. So many people
2791440	2796240	know you through the digital space. Can we swap out another person that looks like you
2797040	2801680	in the AI system, and then that entity known as Destiny will continue existing?
2803280	2807680	There must be some level of sophistication that could emulate a human brain, I would imagine.
2809120	2813760	Probably tech's not there yet, but... Well, the question is, what's the level of sophistication
2813760	2819520	of the audience that would recognize that something has changed? Like, it's the Turing test.
2820240	2826800	How hard is it to trick your audience, your large audience of fans that watch your streams,
2827360	2834720	that when you swap out an AI that emulates you, that nothing has changed? And the question is,
2834720	2838640	do you have to really simulate so much of the human brain for that? I don't think so.
2839280	2846480	Probably not. So, I mean, like you said, a lot of political discourses are just walking down the
2846480	2851280	tree together, so you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion. Yeah, it would depend on if
2851280	2855200	you're doing old data sets, and you're training on that, and I'm having conversations about abortion
2855200	2858400	and your crane and vaccines. I imagine it could do it for quite a while. The only thing that would
2858400	2863280	be weird is when novel issues pop up, then you probably need a more sophisticated resemblance
2863280	2867040	of the inner brain, right? You have to keep training on the internet, so how the language
2867040	2870960	models, and that's the most incredible breakthroughs, is the language models. You just have to keep
2870960	2877200	retraining the system on Reddit, which is actually what a lot of it is trained on, which is hilarious.
2877200	2881040	I do think it's really interesting that kind of funny problems, like the trolley problem,
2881040	2885680	that we can kind of work through our normative ethical systems are now real questions. Like,
2885680	2888800	if you're driving a Tesla and it's an autopilot and you're going to hit somebody, but a conservative
2888880	2895040	hit somebody else, what ought the system do? We went very quickly from fun kind of project in
2895040	2899600	philosophy class to we need to solve this for insurance purposes as quickly as possible. It's
2899600	2904480	kind of interesting to think about. Actually, I'll bring up the trolley problem with you later.
2905040	2910800	There's a fascinating version of it that I find hilarious. Okay, let's return to your low point.
2912800	2917760	You started playing video games. That was a lucky break. You did text-based ones. That was a lucky
2917760	2923040	break because you got to be pretty good at learning. Then you started thinking about going to college
2923040	2927520	and so on. What happened next? I went to like a prep school. You kind of have to go to college
2927520	2931040	after. That's like the point, right? I was also millennial. All of us had to go to college. That's
2931040	2937840	always what they told us. My life was kind of, it's hard to describe. I didn't really think
2937840	2941040	much of the future. I was just kind of enjoying the day-to-day because everything in my life was
2941040	2946160	pretty weird. Both my parents had moved to Florida by the time I was 16, 17. I was living with my
2946160	2951200	grandma. I was working. I had a girlfriend. Moved out. We got a place. Did college.
2952400	2956480	By the time I got into college, I had transitioned from working at McDonald's to,
2956480	2960880	I was like working in a casino restaurant basically. I was really good at that job,
2960880	2966480	so a high level of patience for drunk people and sane people. I was doing music in school
2966480	2972720	because I've really grown to love music. My thought process was I can do music as a hobby,
2972720	2975440	I guess, unless I get really good and maybe I can make money with that. Otherwise,
2975440	2978800	I love music. I'm okay going to school for music, getting good at it, and then just doing that on
2978800	2985360	the side. My main job would kind of be this career I was building at the casino. Basically,
2985360	2989440	the trying to balance personal life plus graveyard shift, six-day hour weeks at a casino,
2989440	2994080	and then a full-time music degree was not possible for me. Eventually, I had to drop school after,
2994080	2998400	I think it was like three years. After I dropped school to maintain my casino job,
2999120	3003840	after a few months, I got fired from my casino job. I'd essentially just thrown away the past
3004160	3008480	three or four years of my life. Why did you get fired from the casino job? I heard there's a story
3008480	3012160	behind that. Yeah, there's a story. Basically, I was just really dumb when it came to understanding
3012160	3016320	corporate politics. This is funny because the same attitude kind of followed me into the streaming
3016320	3021680	world. My thought process has kind of always been that as long as I'm really good at what I do,
3021680	3024800	I should be untouchable. If I'm really good, you can't do anything to me. I don't have to play
3024800	3030400	any dumb games or whatever. At the casino, I think I was the youngest, it was originally
3030720	3036560	the supervisor position at the casino. When I started to get my own shifts, there were problems
3036560	3040960	that I would run into on graveyard shift because of carryover from the swing shift. One of these
3040960	3044480	problems was underneath the soda machine, they weren't cleaning it properly and fruit flies were
3044480	3050640	showing up. The manager came in one morning and she was like, hey, what's going on with the machine?
3050640	3055360	I told her, listen, I can't take everything from swing shift and do everything at grave shift.
3055360	3058480	I can't do this. They need to figure out their stuff better or I need more employees. It's not
3058480	3061760	possible for me. She's like, what did you tell anybody? I was like, yeah, I complained to the
3061760	3066880	supervisor on the swing shift all the time. She told me, if you're not getting the answer that
3066880	3071840	you like, then it's your responsibility to email the next person up. I was like, oh, okay, that's
3071840	3077920	interesting. Some months went on and I ran into more problems because on graveyard, here's how,
3077920	3081200	I don't know if it's everywhere, but morning shift is the easiest and that's when you're the
3081200	3084560	most overstaffed because that's when all the VPs are in and that's when all the managers are there
3084560	3088320	and everybody blah, blah, blah. Swing shift is the most challenging. It's where your highest
3088320	3091920	flow of customers is. You're also decently staffed there, but there's a lot of stuff going on.
3091920	3096640	In graveyard, nobody cares at all about you. They don't give you any employees. You might get swamped.
3096640	3099680	You might not. Who cares? Make sure it's clean for day shift. That's the only thing that matters.
3099680	3103040	A quick question for sort of clarification. So this is a 24 hour?
3103600	3107520	24 hour dyno. Yeah, inside a casino. Yeah. So it's a dyno in a casino. Oh, by the way,
3107520	3112560	I had an amazing moment at a dyno in a casino recently. It's a special place. A dyno in a casino
3112560	3116800	is a place of magic. There's a lot of, I don't know if I'd say magic, but there's a lot of other
3116800	3122000	worldly stuff going on. There's characters. There's, and I had an interaction with the waitress that
3122000	3126560	was the sweetest waitress in the world. And it was just like, I don't know, made me feel less alone
3126560	3133760	in this cruel world of ours. So graveyard begins when? For me, my shift was 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
3133760	3139600	or sometimes I got called in early, so it'd be 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. That's no love for that shift.
3139600	3142080	No, especially not trying to do school at the same time. Absolutely not.
3142960	3147280	But yeah, basically, long story short, I ran into a problem where I didn't have enough employees on
3147280	3150960	my shift. VPs were coming in in the morning. There's something like, hey, the diner's kind of dirty.
3150960	3154480	And I'm like, you've cut all my employees past 4 a.m. Like on some nights, I'm literally cooking
3154480	3160000	and doing front of house, like all on my own. Like I can't do this. And my manager, Pam, told me,
3160000	3164400	well, you've got to figure it out. And so I remembered her advice. So I emailed the VP of
3164400	3167920	food and beverage and I CC'd her and I said, I'm not getting the help I need in my restaurant.
3167920	3170800	Now, I didn't know at the time that I was basically completely throwing her under the bus
3171360	3177200	because of that email. But retroactively, when I look back on things or retrospectively, I see
3177200	3181440	that was the moment that I got marked for deletion. And I didn't really understand it,
3181440	3185200	even though I'd heard terminology for papering somebody out the door. But after that point,
3185200	3190400	I started to get written up for a lot of little random things. I'd missed one day of work in my
3190400	3194480	three years at the casino. And I started to get written up for showing up one or two minutes
3194480	3198960	late. That's kind of weird. That's whatever. Or written up for random ways about filing paperwork.
3198960	3203200	And then eventually there came a situation with another employee where they were,
3203200	3206240	it's complicated, it has to be like call out stuff. But basically, they wanted to come or
3206240	3209600	they wanted to call out. And I told them if they called out, they were going to get fired because
3210160	3213600	they were at like 10 points, they were at nine points and 10 points is firing, blah, blah, blah.
3213600	3216800	Pam told me, you can tell her that she's going to get a point, but you can't tell if she's going
3216800	3220000	to get fired. I don't know what that meant. And then I told her that if you call out, you're going
3220000	3223280	to get, you know, you're fucked, you're going to get fired, or you're going to be at 10 points.
3223280	3227360	And then I got called in early, like three days later, and Pam was like, you inappropriately
3227360	3230800	communicated with an employee because you said the F word and a text message. And I'm like,
3230800	3234000	really? There's no shot. And she's like, well, you also tried to fire the employee. And I was
3234000	3236880	like, no, I told her she was going to get 10 points. She's like, well, you use the F word.
3236880	3241840	I'm like, this is insane. And just because I was such a high performing employee, there's no way
3241840	3246240	I'm getting fired. And then I did. And I was like, yeah, cash shot my 401k and moped for like three
3246240	3251120	months because I had thrown away school for this casino job. And then I got fired from this job
3251120	3255360	that like, yeah, nobody believed I got fired. It was just insane. So if you look back, if you
3255360	3260240	were allowed to not just look back to your own memory, but actually watch yourself like some
3260240	3265360	of your court video that whole time, do you think you would be surprised you would notice some things
3265360	3272160	like potentially of not having a self awareness, not having like social, like a civility and social
3272160	3278080	etiquette that's played in the human relations? Yeah, absolutely. So is that is that at the core
3278080	3282240	of it, essentially? Yeah, I think so. I mean, it follows me even to this day, there's a lot of,
3283280	3286320	I don't know if you're recording or not, but when we spoke early about like meta conversations,
3286320	3289280	I have to think a lot sometimes about meta conversations because the way that I want to
3289280	3293200	drive a conversation will sometimes be way different than what is like the best way to
3293200	3298000	have a conversation. Whereas I just want to like go really hard on like some itty bitty, like
3298000	3302000	some idiosyncrasy, some factor figure, whatever, but that's not like the human conversation I need
3302000	3309920	to have, you know? So you got fired slash left that job, and that took you to the job that would
3309920	3316400	be the lowest point? Yeah, because there was a huge downgrade in pay. I went from getting like,
3316400	3320320	I think at the casino, because I worked so much overtime, I was like 22.50 an hour on all my
3320320	3326080	overtime fifth, and this was back in 2008, 2009, as like a college student, like it's amazing pay.
3327360	3330720	I had benefits, like everything was good. And then the carpet cleaning was like,
3330720	3336880	I was probably getting my paycheck like every other week was maybe 1500 bucks or $1,000. And
3336880	3342080	I'm working like 13 day stretches, like I have every other Sunday off, and it's so many hours,
3342080	3345920	like I have to show up at the shop at like seven or six, and then I go home at like
3345920	3349760	eight or nine, depending on when my jobs are throughout the day. You doing businesses or
3349760	3354560	residential or what are you doing? Everything. Everything. Are you working for a company this
3354560	3359120	company? Yeah. Okay. And so like there's a schedule thing, you have to go to it and so on.
3359120	3363760	Yeah, but so like, this is why the schedule would suck is sometimes I'd show up at, I think we had
3363760	3368400	to be in the shop at, I think it was 7am. We show up at the shop at 7am. First job might be at eight
3368400	3372240	or nine, but that job might be like a one hour job. So I might show up at 7am and have a job from
3372240	3377360	830 to 930. Then my next job might not be from, until like say 11. So from 830 to 930, I'll do
3377360	3382640	one job. And then I'm going to drop from like 11 to 12 or something. Then I might have like a decent
3382640	3389760	job from like five to eight, but like my whole day is destroyed and I'm doing like three smallish
3389760	3394960	jobs. So I'm getting like 30 bucks maybe for being in the shop or you know, my job for like 10 or 11
3394960	3399680	hours and it's just like horrible. So you're somebody that seems to be extremely good at
3399680	3406400	thinking and conversation. And so I have a bit of an ego perhaps in both the negative and the
3406400	3411040	positive sense of that word. Was there some aspect of working at McDonald's
3412160	3416880	and then working at the casino and then working for the, as a carpet cleaner that was humbling?
3417680	3425920	No, never. The ego burned bright through it all. Well, or no, you can pitch back in the ego.
3425920	3429680	Yeah, no, I understand. I totally get what you mean. I had a really close friend growing up
3429680	3433520	whose name was Chris. And I think we probably met when he was, we were like four or five,
3433520	3438720	I think he lived behind me. And I grew up with him and I'd always been kind of an outsider to the
3439360	3444480	world that I was in once I got to high school for sure. Because all of those kids were incredibly
3444480	3449200	wealthy, you know, Corvettes and Mustangs when they turned 16, it was a prep school. And I was
3449200	3452560	doing the, they had like a work study program there where you could stay after school from
3452560	3457600	two 30 to five every day to kind of like work to pay for your tuition. So I've been working like
3457600	3461760	throughout all of high school. I got another job at McDonald's when I was 18, worked at the casino.
3462000	3465440	I'd always been doing that kind of work. I never really viewed it as like beneath me or anything.
3465440	3469120	It's not like I don't have like a family of doctors or lawyers or anything. And then me and my other
3469120	3473280	friend, Chris, we'd always make fun of everybody else for being kind of like, you know, like preppy
3473280	3479760	kids and everything. So there is a, there's some pride to that sort of hard work. Yeah, I guess
3479760	3482800	a little bit. Yeah. Because, you know, looking especially at my dad, like the solution to every
3482800	3487200	problem was just throw more hours of work at it basically. So that was always my, yeah, go to.
3488080	3492640	What was psychologically the low point? I think psychologically the low point was that
3493280	3499600	as I'm doing this carpet cleaning job, driving around my city, there's like this feeling of,
3501760	3505680	I guess for a lot of people it's probably college, but there's a feeling when you're in high school
3505680	3510880	that everything is like so exciting and the whole world is kind of in front of you. And
3510880	3516080	there are a trillion, trillion different branching paths of possibilities. And you know, even through
3516160	3519920	high school, you're thinking like, am I going to be a doctor or a lawyer or can I join the
3519920	3525520	MBA or can I do this or that? There's all these things in front of you. And when I especially
3525520	3529920	felt it when I was doing these carpet cleaning jobs and I think it was in the fall, I'd be
3529920	3533280	outside some of these houses and I just kind of look around and I'd recognize a lot of these
3533280	3537200	neighborhoods that I'd drive around with friends in or I'd, you know, be walking through. I ran
3537200	3540480	cross country, some of them I'd be running through these neighborhoods. And it was just kind of like
3540480	3544960	this feeling of looking around. And it was like, when I was here in the past, this was like kind
3545040	3549360	of like a transitionary phase of my life where I'm doing this and it's so fun and exciting. And
3549360	3552480	then I'm going to move on to something else and it's going to be fun and exciting and awesome.
3552480	3557680	And then like, you know, two years later, my whole life has collapsed. Like I'm in a house that I
3557680	3564640	can't afford anymore. My ex that I hate is pregnant with my kid. And I have no money. I've got no
3564640	3571520	upward mobility. I failed college. My job is horrible. Like just every single like this is like
3571920	3576240	all of those, the wave function had collapsed into one thing and that one thing was the worst
3576240	3580080	thing that could have possibly been at the time for me. Yeah. Like everything was gone and horrible.
3580080	3583040	So yeah, that was the feeling I had at the time. Do you ever contemplate suicide?
3583680	3587520	I thought about thinking about it, but I've just never been that kind of person. So
3588160	3593280	I mean, basically as a way to escape from the hardship, something that I'm so incredibly lucky.
3593280	3598080	I don't know why or how I'm just going to chalk it up to biology. I've always had really high
3598080	3602480	mental baseline. I've like depression and all of that. There have been a few short stints of
3602480	3607440	debt with it past 30 because I did a lot of drugs. But other than that, my mental baseline is just
3607440	3612640	so high. And even in the carpet cleaning days, like if you, man, the videos might still be there.
3612640	3616400	I think on my old YouTube channel channel where I'll be like playing Starcraft when I first started
3616400	3619440	to get into streaming and I'll be calling up customers like this is Steve from guaranteed
3619440	3622880	clean. We had to move your job back one hour. Is it okay if I show up instead of 230? And then
3622880	3625440	I hang up and it's like, all right, guys, we got three more games and it's like, let's go.
3625440	3628640	Like stuff like that. So my, my baseline has always been like really high for mental function.
3628640	3632800	So even in low point, there's that you had strength. Is there, is there anything you can give
3633360	3639680	by way of advice from people that for home to wave function collapses as it does for many of us?
3639680	3644640	Like, holy fuck, the world is not full of opportunity and you're kind of a failure.
3645440	3649200	Like I've, I've been there. Yeah, I don't know. It's rough because like,
3649840	3654480	I usually ask for compassion from people that have it better off because like, once you're down
3654560	3660320	there, like the only reason I say I got lucky, but it wasn't even really lucky. Like, or it was
3660320	3663760	lucky, but it was more lucky. It wasn't just lucky that I got into streaming. It was lucky that I
3663760	3667040	was into computers at an early age. It was lucky that I played video games at an early age. It
3667040	3671440	was lucky that all the tech came up at exactly that right point in time. Like I was a pretty smart
3671440	3676400	guy, but it was definitely a preparation meets opportunity and that opportunity was like at
3676400	3680640	the exact precise moment of my life. If anything had gone differently than I would just be cleaning
3680640	3684480	carpets today. So, so in the many worlds, interpretation of quantum mechanics,
3685760	3691360	this is like one out of like, there's many, many Stevens, they're just still carpet cleaning
3692080	3696960	and they're full of pain and resentment. Yeah. The one piece of advice that I give,
3696960	3700640	I hate that I have to push back against all these crypto bros and everybody online for
3700640	3704480	decently intelligent people that are successful. I've never heard anybody give a contradiction
3704480	3709600	to this. Maybe you will. You can tell me if you disagree. I always look at kids in high school
3709600	3713200	and I'm like, just try a little bit harder. Like 30 minutes a night, if you don't study,
3713200	3718160	just do 30 minutes, just do a little bit more. It is, you're laying the foundation for the rest
3718160	3722480	of your life and you can't appreciate it in high school and college. But oh my God, when you get
3722480	3727440	out, everything in your life is so much easier. You have probably more responsibility over the
3727440	3732400	direction of your life when you're like 13, 14 years old than you ever will once you're like 25
3732400	3735600	and older because this is like when you're determining the foundations that everything's
3735600	3742480	going to be built on. But yeah, 100%. So first of all, it does seem that the liberating aspect
3742480	3749760	of being young is like anything you learn. So working hard at learning something will pay off
3750480	3754880	in like nonlinear ways, like you said with video games. I feel like, so like people who are like,
3754880	3760880	I hate school. All right, well, fine. But find something where you're challenging yourself,
3760880	3764400	you're growing, you're learning, you're learning a skill, you're learning about a thing.
3765680	3769520	Of course, you know, you can push back and say, well, there's some trajectories that might not
3769520	3773760	be productive. Like if you spend the entirety of your teen years playing, I don't know,
3773760	3777840	League of Legends, a game you have love and hate relationship with.
3777840	3782240	No, just a hate and hate relationship. Okay. Well, we'll talk about, I think you have a love,
3782240	3788320	hate relationship with hate in general. We'll just in love. We'll try to de-complexify that one.
3788800	3796400	I think in general, just investing yourself fully with passion really does pay off. But that said,
3796400	3803440	also school, I feel like doesn't get enough credit, like high school in particular, middle
3803440	3811520	school and high school, because it's general education. I think if you're, especially if
3811520	3817120	you're lucky to have good teachers, but honestly, I haven't mostly the textbooks themselves with
3817200	3824080	good teachers. It's a one chance in life, you have to really explore a subject. Fuck grades.
3824080	3830640	Like getting good grades is at tension, I would say, with actual learning. That is true. But
3831600	3836640	just get a biology textbook and to explore ideas and biology and allowing yourself to be
3838160	3845440	inspired by the beauty of it. Yeah, I don't know. I think that really, really, really pays off and
3845440	3851120	you never get a chance to do that again. And maybe not even textbooks, like reading, straight
3851120	3857680	up reading. I think if you read, this is one time in life, you get a chance to read, really read.
3857680	3865200	Like read a book a day, read. You can really invest, you can really grow by reading. I mean,
3865200	3869680	I must, all those guys talk about it. It's very, very rare that you meet like a dumb person who
3869680	3874800	reads a lot. I don't know if that's ever happened in my life. Yeah. Dumb or not successful. And
3874880	3880560	the cool thing is, it seems like the reading, it's like investment, the reading you do early
3880560	3888000	on in high school pays off way more than the reading you do later. So like the really influential
3888000	3895040	reading is doing those high school years, because you're basically learning from others,
3895040	3900400	the mistakes they've made, the solutions to problems, you're basically learning the
3900480	3905120	shortcuts to life. Like whatever the hell you want to do, music, read from the best people
3906160	3911760	that the music theory, like learn music theory, learn, read biographies about jazz musicians,
3911760	3916240	blues musicians, see their, like see all the mistakes, see what they did, see the shortcuts.
3916240	3919600	If you want to do podcast and read about other podcasts, if you want to do streaming,
3919600	3924640	read about other streamers, physicists, and so on, I feel like you figure out all the mistakes
3924640	3929120	and get to shortcut through life, because most people show up to college without having done
3929120	3936480	that. And now you get a chance to shortcut your way past them. Yeah, 100%. But nobody really teaches
3936480	3944480	you that. They're like, go to school from this time to that time, shut up, this is just what you
3944480	3949920	do, eat your broccoli. I think I was like, there's two huge problems. One is, now that I'm older,
3949920	3953120	because you don't know anything as a kid, you can't really criticize as an adult as a kid,
3953120	3957600	because you're a kid. By the way, you're ageist, if I may say so. I am super ageist. As I get older,
3957600	3961760	I get even more ageist. There are a lot of people I argue with, I was like, man, dude,
3961760	3967120	you're really 22, aren't you? I can tell every word you say, just seeps of like 22-year-oldness,
3967120	3970400	but that's okay. I love that for you. I could just say, because you mentioned this,
3971520	3975760	your wife is a fellow streamer, Molina. You mentioned that this is a source of fights
3976400	3981520	for the two of you that, and I could just feel that. There is truth to what you're saying,
3981520	3986720	which is like, all right, you're saying that because you're 22. Just wait until you're 25,
3986800	3991280	and you won't be saying that anymore. Sure. No, that is the most annoying thing for people to hear.
3991280	3994720	Yeah, you can't ever say that, of course. Because it's actually usually true,
3996320	4002160	because we do go through phases in life, and you can understand that most things are phases.
4002160	4009040	So just in general, you can say, just wait. Just wait. You won't feel this way. Again,
4009040	4012960	I could say that to you. You could say that to yourself. Just wait. Whatever you're feeling
4013040	4017600	like, just wait. In five, 10 years, you'll be a different person, and you will laugh at the
4017600	4022400	things you take seriously now that are causing you pain now, all that kind of stuff. But people
4022400	4027680	hate hearing that. Absolutely. I think the joke that I always say is that if I could literally
4027680	4032320	step into a time machine, and I could come back out and see myself as a 17-year-old, and I could
4032320	4036560	say, hey, I am literally you from the future. You see the time machine, and I would look at me,
4036560	4040320	and I would see the time machine, and I would give myself the best advice in the world,
4040320	4044160	to be the most successful person. I would ignore all of it. Even knowing it came from myself,
4044160	4047200	I'd be like, this guy sold out. This dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. I'll
4047200	4049520	figure it out better. He must have made some mistakes. That's what I would think is this
4049520	4053040	everything. Even I knew it was myself from the future, I would just 100% never believe it,
4053040	4055920	and knowing that is very frustrating. But I keep that in mind when I deal with younger people.
4055920	4060480	That's why I always say on stream when I'm talking to, there's been stuff with Sneak-Os,
4060480	4064720	another girl on my stream called Lab. When I see the mistakes they're making, oftentimes,
4064720	4068000	because I've made all of these mistakes, sometimes in the most public and horrible
4068000	4071440	fashion ever. But I'm never like a mentor. I'm not going to sit there and tell you,
4071440	4074400	oh, do this or that or that or that, because I don't know if you're going to listen to me,
4074400	4077280	and I don't want to condescend to you. You figure your stuff out, and I'll be here if you want to
4077280	4084080	talk about it. There was a company that didn't work with me, because I was very adamant on
4084080	4088560	defending very radical notions about language and racial slurs and everything, when I was like
4088560	4091840	22 or whatever. There was a company, and they said, well, we don't want to work with this guy
4091840	4096080	for an event. After they had said that, I had written an article on my website called,
4096080	4099440	the company was Gigabyte. They make motherboards, and I said, fuck Gigabyte in the ass. That was
4099440	4102480	the title to my article. And it was like, well, if they don't want to work with me, I'm going to
4102480	4107040	blow them up and never do anything ever with them again. And it was just like, looking back at it
4107040	4110720	now, obviously, as an older person, like, hey, you need to pump the brakes and chill. You're
4110720	4114880	destroying yourself. But as a young person, it's like, yeah, you're 22. Of course, you think that
4114880	4117760	you can say whatever and do whatever. And as long as you're good at what you're doing, you've got
4117760	4122480	the whole world behind you. And yeah, geez. Well, let's go there. You have a history of using
4122480	4131280	offensive language, like the R word, the N word, including the N word with a hard R, calling women
4131280	4141840	bitches, talking about rape in a nonchalant way. What part of that do you regret? And what part
4141840	4147520	of that do you not? Language is very complicated. When it comes to stuff relating to slurs,
4148160	4155760	there's been a whole trajectory of feelings on everything related to language. For you personally
4155760	4159040	and for the internet as a whole. Yeah, I don't care about the internet, almost for me personally.
4159600	4165440	In my early 20s, I'll say like 22, 23, I think probably when I first started streaming, my feeling
4165440	4170240	is that any word is just a word. And if it hurts you, that's your fault. Take responsibility for
4170240	4174240	yourself. This probably came from my background of being a really independent person. So that's
4174320	4178960	just kind of like the mind that I had for everything. And there were basically, they were like a
4178960	4184160	collection of experiences that I had that as I grew, I started to realize like, okay, well,
4184160	4187360	I feel differently about some of these words depending on the context. And I can see how
4187360	4191600	they can affect other people depending on the context. So as I've kind of like grown,
4191600	4195840	I think I've developed a more sophisticated understanding of how different words are used
4195840	4199120	and how they affect people, whether they like it or not. And more importantly, whether I like it
4199120	4204880	or not. And that words can, even if I don't want it to be, they can be a vehicle for emboldening
4204880	4209040	certain types of ideas that I don't want to embolden. And yeah, that's kind of been the whole
4209040	4212960	like growth. I've been lucky that in the time that I came up on the internet, I was able to learn
4212960	4216400	these lessons. Because if I was trying to learn those same lessons today, I would have been completely
4216400	4221040	destroyed because I had insane views on language like 10 years ago. We could talk about the past,
4221040	4224880	we could talk about the present, let's talk about the past first. So how do you deal with the fact
4224880	4231520	that there's videos of you in the past saying the N-word, including the N-word with a hard R?
4232080	4237440	So generally, and what's the context? Can you give me like, what would be the context usually?
4237440	4242240	When I lay out this defense, it's not because I wouldn't have used the N-word. Generally,
4242240	4245680	whenever I said the N-word, it was usually in an example of like, this is something that like a
4245680	4250320	racist person would say, I don't think I've ever, on the internet, I think I've ever called anybody
4250320	4254080	like the N-word with a hard R. Not because I wouldn't have, but just because it wasn't in
4254080	4260640	my vocabulary. I played RTS, Real Time Strategy, and we use the F-slur for gay people. That's
4260640	4265520	what I use that one a ton. I've called people that a ton in the past. So I should actually just
4265520	4273360	as a small tangent, and this is what I'd like to explore with you. There's a ruthlessness to the
4273360	4279600	language in the gaming world. And there's different communities. They have different
4280320	4287600	flavors of language, of hate speech, essentially. And there's also a humor to it,
4289600	4296160	which really bothers me in a dark way that I haven't been able to really think through,
4297280	4305200	because humor seems to be a kind of catalyst for hate. It seems to normalize hate. Like you say,
4306160	4312400	basically, it's like Lucy Kay says a lot of edgy things, but you take something Lucy Kay says
4312400	4318480	and do it in a non-fine way and do it over and over and over and keep increasing the hatefulness
4318480	4325440	of it, the vitriol, and somehow you find yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a world full of hate
4325440	4332240	where there is no good and evil. It's all the same. In fact, the good is to be mocked, and the evil
4332240	4338880	is to be celebrated for the humor of it, basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously. And I
4338880	4343440	don't know what it, it reveals something about human nature that you can let go, the moral
4343440	4350000	relativism that can happen when you do that kind of stuff. At the same time, I'm a fan of dark humor
4351120	4356640	when done well. Anyway, for people who are not familiar, I just wanted to mention that
4357600	4363920	some of the worst hate speech that ends in LOL happens in gaming communities.
4364960	4367120	And that's where you come from in a certain part.
4367120	4370640	So a lot of people don't remember this or don't know this because they're younger, but
4370640	4377200	way back in the day, in the late 90s, early mid 2000s of the internet, the way that online kind
4377200	4383600	of like shit talk worked was you were just trying to ramp up to the most insanely edgy, crazy stuff
4383600	4388560	you could say to like provoke a reaction. Have you ever heard of something called the aristocrats?
4389200	4393200	That it's like a joke, the joke? Oh yeah, the joke. Yeah, there's a movie on it. Yeah.
4393200	4397360	Okay. Basically, every single like shit talk back and forth on the internet was like that.
4397360	4401920	Like what is the most increasingly depraved and back then you didn't get banned for slurs or
4401920	4406720	anything on any of these chat rooms. So it was just like insane world to walk into. And I was
4406720	4412560	fully 100% a part of a product of and a contributor to that world. So that probably still goes on
4412560	4417920	on the internet in some way and that probably still goes on the internet in a maybe more
4417920	4422400	pacified way. Only in darker parts of the internet. I'd say for the most part, most,
4422400	4426000	well, compared to back then compared to 20 years ago, the internet is way cleaned up now.
4426000	4429120	There are still going to be boards you can go on or parts of the internet where you see that
4429120	4433200	type of humor, but not nowhere near as mainstream. Like back then you could open your mic on
4433200	4437840	Xbox Live and hear some insane stuff when that first started nowhere near what you hear today.
4437840	4442160	Although there are still elements of escalation that happened that just seems to be part of
4442160	4447360	human nature on the internet. Because we don't get the feedback of actually hurting people
4447360	4455520	directly. So the trolling, like for the lulls, you'll do like you will still escalate within
4455520	4459600	the bounds. You're just saying that there's more bounds now. On Reddit, there's more bounds and
4459600	4466160	so on. There's moderators that kind of yell at you that ban you and so on if you cross those
4466160	4473040	bounds. But overall, that basic human instinct to escalate, especially under the veil of anonymity
4473040	4476960	is still there. I don't know. It's dark. It's dark. Yeah, just there's a lot of different ways to
4476960	4480000	look at it. And there's different ways you can break that art. Like for instance, like you mentioned
4480000	4486480	dark humor and you say that like sometimes dark humor is funny and sometimes it's not. I think
4486480	4490560	that it's really important to dig into and figure out like why certain things are funny and why
4490560	4495680	certain things. Yeah, go. It's from your subreddit. Oh boy. No, that made me laugh and I felt wrong
4495680	4504320	about it. Oh no. So this is, I already know what this is, yeah. Yeah. So this is a trolley
4504320	4509280	problem. To me, it connects because I think about the, it keeps, because I worked on autonomous
4509280	4514240	vehicles, the trolley problem, the philosophical thought experiment keeps brought up a lot.
4514240	4519840	You know, when AI is part of making the decision, do I kill three people here or five people here?
4519840	4526640	In AI makes that decision, how do you do that calculus? And this particular, there's a deep
4527680	4532960	satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society. I feel like that's why- That's what dark humor
4532960	4537360	does? Successful dark humor does. And I don't know if this- It feels a flaw. Hmm. I feel like
4537360	4542000	certain, there's a certain brand of dark humor. And I think the reason, I think the reason someone
4542000	4546480	is why it's good, or why it is good humor, I think is because I don't think it necessarily
4546480	4550320	reveals a flaw. So sometimes I feel like it reveals like a kind of virtue, I think. Like,
4550320	4553760	if you look at this particular thing- Yeah, can I explain what we're- Yeah, go for it.
4553760	4558400	Oh yeah, sure. We're just listening. The title of the Reddit post is, You Know What to Pick.
4559360	4565920	And it says, five people are going to die either way, but if you flip the lever, the trolley will
4565920	4575280	do a sick fucking loop first. And also the top comment is a question saying, which I think is
4575280	4580000	also part of the dark humor that's successful. Can I get the gender and ethnic backgrounds
4580000	4586960	of the groups first? And the top answer is both groups are each comprised of five white orphaned
4586960	4595600	cis male heavy meth users who are consistently in and out of drug rehab, all who identify as
4595600	4600800	right wing extremists. Humor is such a sophisticated thing that we engage in. Humor is like really
4600800	4607280	complicated. But I would argue that hopefully the humor here shows the virtue of like, this is
4607280	4611280	obviously horrible, but that's kind of why it's funny. It's funny because it's such a horrible
4611280	4615280	question to ask. Like, do we kill five people in a boring way or in a really entertaining way? And
4615280	4618880	it's like, that's really, that's really- And then when you ask even more like, what are the ethnic
4618880	4623040	backgrounds? Like, that's even worse to say that, you know? So I feel like that's like the type of,
4623040	4627120	there's a way that you can engage with dark humor where it's like, oof, like, it's funny because
4627120	4630720	it's so wrong and so taboo. And we all know that it's wrong and taboo. And that's kind of where
4630720	4635840	the shared laugh comes from. So for me, the question that asking the diversity question
4636560	4641440	is a sophisticated way of revealing the absurdity of asking about diversity when it's talking about
4641440	4647360	human life. Oh, interesting. Because the way that I took that was, I think it reveals the absurdity
4647360	4651360	of how people will weigh different ethnic backgrounds so differently when it comes to value of human
4651360	4655600	life. Like, I'm actually thinking of that in terms of like a an immigration related question,
4655600	4660160	where people are really keen and quick to dehumanize like black or brown people. So like,
4660160	4663040	the question is like, well, if five of them are brown and five are white, well, I know which one
4663040	4666400	I'm going to, you know, pull the lever for. That's how I read that. But it's satirizing that.
4666400	4672000	Yeah, exactly. Yes, of course. Yeah. But that's what I mean, that that's the flaw. To me, at least,
4672000	4680800	it showed that humanity or social networks that are easy to be outraged and love the outrage
4680800	4687920	and the chaos, that Twitter and social networks will pull that lever. Like, they would,
4687920	4692960	they would always try to maximize the fun. And there's like a, there's a sick aspect to
4693600	4697920	all the atrocities, all the tragedies that happen in the world, that we kind of always
4697920	4706640	lean towards the, the outrageous narrative weaved around it. The, yeah, the, the one that leads
4706880	4713040	to sort of the most clicks, to the most attention, to the most outrage, to all that,
4713040	4718960	all that kind of stuff. So that, that's almost like a satire of society. When they are faced with
4718960	4727040	tragedy, they will maximize, trying to think of a word that's not fun, but entertainment,
4727040	4731760	maximize the entertainment. Yeah. This is a big criticism I give, especially to conservative
4731760	4736320	crowds. You know, left-leaning people, everybody doesn't. I don't like when people blame the media
4736320	4740960	for the state of the media today. I very much believe that everything in society is a feedback
4740960	4744320	loop and that if you're really unhappy with the state of the media, I think that the media is
4744320	4748000	a good reflection for what people want to see because there is a room right now in the United
4748000	4752320	States where somebody could start a company where all they do is completely factual reporting.
4752320	4755600	They don't have a political slant and they're not giving you these like sensationalist narratives
4755600	4759040	or stories and that media company would fail in two weeks because people don't want to see that.
4759040	4762320	Generally, people really want to see the like, show me the guy that really believes in what I
4762320	4765680	say, that calls the other guy an idiot, the guy that are screaming on TV or on the radio,
4765680	4770000	like, this is what I really want. And people will engage in that and that feedback loop will
4770000	4774720	continue for generations. And then all of a sudden people are like, why is the media so bias? Why is
4774720	4777600	the media driving so many narratives? I was like, well, what do you mean? This is exactly what you
4777600	4782240	want to see. And that's frustrating for me. That's one of my big kind of when I defend
4782240	4787840	establishments or when I talk about like the interplay between citizen and all these institutions
4787840	4792880	we have, that the institutions are very much a reflection of the population, at least in
4792880	4797680	democratic societies. And I think that people very much try to elude the personal responsibility
4797680	4801440	or the country's responsibility to why some of them look the way that they do.
4802880	4806720	But that takes us back to the N word with a hard R. Sure. Why?
4807520	4811760	For the particular examples that I was giving for the particular conversations that I was having,
4811760	4814720	if you're going to have challenging conversations around certain words,
4814720	4818400	I think you should probably be able to say them otherwise it feels really ridiculous to me.
4818400	4819680	That's like, do you still believe that?
4821360	4825440	Yes. Not like calling people those words, but in having conversations about those words,
4825440	4827040	I would say that I still believe that, yeah.
4827040	4830320	But don't you think, as you said, that using those words
4832320	4838000	actually gives motivation and strength to people who have hate in their hearts?
4838000	4843360	I think depending on the context of what's going on, I think that that's going to be a big driver
4843360	4846240	in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it.
4846240	4849760	So in a conversation about the N word, I don't think I would normally say the N word,
4849760	4853840	we would just talk about the word much the same way that like in a movie,
4853840	4857360	like in Django, people use the N word. Should that be censored in that movie?
4857360	4860960	Or in the context of that movie, is it being employed in a way where these aren't good people?
4860960	4863360	You're not supposed to like them. And that's what the audience walks away with.
4864160	4867600	Yeah, but that context is different than conversation. It feels like in conversation,
4868560	4875200	you using that word normalizes it. And that normalizing that word is going to make it easier
4875200	4882320	for people who use that word in a hateful way to use it. Same with the F word, the F slur.
4883360	4891280	If you use that casually and normalize it in a way that's not hateful, you use it in a way
4891280	4896960	that's not hateful, but the side effect is that it normalizes it than people who do use it in a
4897040	4903120	hateful way will be more likely to use it. Therefore, the mathematically looking at the
4903120	4908480	equation of the number of times the N word or the F word is used throughout the world,
4908480	4910640	it increases the number of times it's used in a hateful way.
4911200	4912320	Yeah, I think that human beings-
4912320	4914320	And you're part of that problem, Steven.
4914320	4920160	I don't agree. I understand the thought process. But I don't know if using certain words
4920800	4925840	within different contexts is going to necessarily normalize like the hateful use of that word.
4927280	4931040	That is an argument that I've heard people use. Somebody will say like, okay, well, hold on.
4931040	4935440	That should never be used ever because by virtue of you normalizing it, even in an
4935440	4939600	inoffensive environment, you increase the proclivity for people to use it in a potentially
4939600	4942960	more offensive environment. And my argument is always like, no, I don't think that crossover
4942960	4946320	exists. But if you did want to take that argument, and maybe you do feel this way,
4946320	4949680	I think that you get really problematic when you run into communities that do use certain
4949680	4952640	words that people would say, well, they should be allowed to do it. So for instance, if you think
4952640	4956400	that any utterance of the N word at all is highly problematic and might increase hatred,
4956400	4959440	then like the entire rap industry has to dramatically change the way that they engage
4959440	4963040	with the N word. And obviously a lot of people that criticize people's use of the N word
4963040	4965840	aren't going to turn to rappers and say, well, you guys can't say it either.
4965840	4970960	No, it's who, I mean, it's who uses the N word. That's what it's not. So it's not just the word.
4970960	4981600	It's the, it is context dependent. But I would say that you as a white person having conversations,
4982240	4986640	the context there is the kind that would lead to any increase in hate.
4986640	4988880	Do you think the N word should be censored in the dictionary?
4988880	4993440	No. And I believe there's a Wikipedia page on it and it's not censored.
4994480	4998320	Yeah, I don't, I think it should be in the dictionary. I think the context of casual
4998320	5004800	conversation, like I said, I just believe that on the internet, having humor,
5005440	5009120	having fun conversations as you have on your streams,
5010560	5015120	that leads to the normalization of the word without any educational value,
5015120	5016960	without significant educational value. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think I would,
5016960	5019920	I think I would agree with that. No, sorry. So there's a difference between
5020560	5027680	F slur and N word and both I think should not be used in a fun way, but the F word was used
5027680	5032560	in a fun way for the longest time. For sure. And I'll tell you something that bothers me about
5032560	5040880	your streams, not your streams and basically every other stream is the casual use of the R word.
5040880	5044800	Oh, the ableism, yeah. I don't know if it's about the able, I don't even know,
5046000	5048720	listen, it's complicated. I'm not like virtue signaling here.
5048720	5053040	No, ableism isn't a virtue signal. I mean, it's a legitimate, yeah. Like I get emails
5053040	5057520	from fans that say like, Hey, like I deal with this particular issue. Every time you use this
5057520	5061440	word, it kind of feels like you're attacking me. Like just like, so it's not, it's a valid concept.
5061920	5065600	It's just something cuts wrong for me. Like for example, I'm not bothered by,
5066560	5073680	I am bothered by the excessive use of the word fuck, but not in the same way that moderate use of
5073680	5077520	the word fuck. What is it? I'm curious. And when somebody calls somebody in R word,
5078320	5081040	what is it that, what is the feeling that you get that makes you feel bad about it?
5082400	5087280	It signals to me that you don't give a damn about
5091600	5098320	people who are struggling in ways that you are not struggling. Like that, that signals to me
5098320	5104320	like, about the experience of others. Do you think that there are other words also that could
5104320	5107920	convey like a similar feeling to your wife? Cause it feels like you've drawn a pretty special
5107920	5112240	circle around cause like, I imagine I call, oh, this guy's, you're an uneducated dumb fucker.
5112240	5117760	You're a nitwicker. Like, do those words probably don't feel it? That circle keeps changing.
5117760	5121200	Which it can, which is fine. I think that's the whole point with the culture.
5121280	5126560	So I'm trying to feel my feeling is a kind of, you know, I'm a human being that exists in a
5126560	5131200	social context that we're all evolving that language together and just feels wrong. Like,
5131680	5136640	you know, the word bitch, for example, it really bought, like I've heard on your streams and in
5136640	5144320	general, calling a woman a stupid bitch really bothers me. But it's not just the word bitch,
5144320	5149680	it's context. Like for example, me personally, I'm speaking to me personally, like badass bitch,
5151760	5155360	is different than stupid bitch. Sure. Like a bad bitch or something is different. Yeah,
5155360	5161840	of course. Way different. Sure. I think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility and respect for
5161840	5167680	human beings that are not like you. That's what, that's, that's the feeling that I'm bothering.
5167680	5175760	So I guess what I'm trying to say here is just because people speak in this kind of way
5176720	5183600	in the gaming world and streams doesn't mean that you, like a lot of people look up to you.
5183600	5188880	It doesn't mean young people especially, doesn't mean that you don't have the responsibility to
5188880	5194880	sort of stand alone from the crowd. Because you're somebody that values the power of affected discourse.
5196240	5202960	And to be effective discourse, there's some level of civility. So you can be the sort of
5202960	5210960	the beacon of civility in that world versus giving in to the derogatory words. Because like
5210960	5219440	you have to, you have to lift people out of that world, out of the muck of what I would say is
5219440	5225200	like drama and effective discourse. Like I think that's one of your missions, right, is like to
5225200	5229840	inspire the world through conversation, through debate, through effective discourse. Yeah.
5229840	5234480	So I guess I'm just calling you out that I think using our word, for me personally,
5234480	5242160	as a fan that believes in your mission, it just makes you look ineffective and bad and
5242160	5247040	uninspiring to young people that look up to you. Because those young people are going to use those
5247040	5252160	words that you're using and they'll do it much less effectively. That's the problem.
5252160	5256720	Yeah, I guess the challenge is always just like finding the line. Like my, my book I really shifted
5256720	5261120	dramatically from, even from like two or three years ago, I think my vocabulary shifted quite a
5261120	5264880	bit as we've like, we've kind of gotten rid of some words and some things are kind of coming
5264880	5269600	out. The R word is one that has kind of gone out and come back and gone out and come back,
5269600	5272560	that one we've definitely gone back and forth on. I know there are different thoughts about it in
5272560	5275680	different communities on the internet. This is interesting. I mean, I'm just telling you,
5276400	5282800	for me, it cuts, and I'm not a social justice warrior type, it cuts pretty hard.
5283520	5285520	So what you're saying is I'm going to lose a subscriber if I'm,
5286320	5291840	no, it's not a subscriber. I know, I just, I actually have to empathize harder because I'm
5291840	5297120	like, maybe this is not a very good person. That's what I feel. Like if you're so carelessly using
5297120	5303200	that word, then maybe you're not actually thinking deeply about the suffering in the world. Like
5303200	5306640	to be a student of human nature, you really have to think about other humans and other
5306640	5310640	experiences that are unlike your own. And so that's the sense I get. But at the same time,
5311200	5317760	you're also like the grandpa, the ages, who's trying to be cool with the young kids. A lot of
5317760	5322880	the reason young kids look up to you is like, you also know the language of the internet.
5322880	5326560	Yeah. But I mean, it doesn't, that's not an excuse to use words that we think shouldn't be used.
5326560	5329760	I guess the question that I would have, because it's always a struggle, and to some extent,
5329760	5334880	it's kind of happened, is let's say that like three years ago, I would have said I'm no longer
5334880	5338400	saying the artwork. That's just, I'm just going to get rid of that on my vocabulary. Like,
5338400	5341760	is there a chance that today we would be having a conversation about like,
5341760	5345200	why do you call people dumb fucks? Like, is that really appropriate? Like,
5345200	5349280	does this attack at the core of like somebody's like level of intelligence, education,
5349280	5352640	opportunities in life? Like, is that a worthy, you don't think so?
5352640	5357520	I think that's a, as the kids say, cope. You really think so? I think because the words have
5357520	5361680	definitely moved in a way where it's like, this was okay. Now it's not this. So you're
5361680	5368960	standing your ground by using, listen, you could, you could, you could, but I think it's better
5368960	5374960	to use those words. If you want to defend the ground word stand on, to use them rarely and
5374960	5382640	deliberately versus how you currently use them, which is to express an emotion. Like you,
5383600	5387040	I'm going to be honest, you use our word, not when you're at your best.
5388000	5392160	True. And so that's not, that's generally, that could be true for a lot of swearing to that,
5392160	5396240	but yeah, I know what you mean. No, but like, you know that our word is offensive, you know,
5396240	5404080	and there's part of it is like the, you tell yourself that like, you're still kind of fighting
5404080	5408560	political correctness by using it a little bit when you say it. No, I don't think so. I think,
5408560	5412160	I'm trying to think in terms of like, where is the virtue where, like, there's a whole bunch
5412160	5415680	of arguments for why some words are okay, some words aren't okay or whatever. And I try to,
5415680	5419760	like think more along those lines rather than, but like, there's going to be like a lot of
5419760	5424080	phrases where like, if the our word has come out, the conversation is over. I know that,
5424080	5427120	like things, my brain is shut down, the person I'm talking to is, but there's like,
5427120	5430480	there's a lot of words also in terms of like, it like, if you ever hear me say like,
5430480	5433840	fucking moron in a debate, it's like, it's done, like this conversation is over,
5433840	5436880	there's no way that anything productive is happening past that point.
5436880	5441520	I think fucking moron is not, I think it's ineffective, it's not civil, but it's not,
5442480	5448400	it doesn't bother me in the way. It's basically when you speak in a way that I know there's
5448400	5453920	a group that's going to be heard by that. Not only do I think about the hurt that group experiences,
5453920	5460400	I think of you as a lesser intellectual, like as a lesser person who's thinking about the world.
5460400	5467680	What bothers me the most is just what kind of mindset that inspires in young people,
5467680	5471360	especially when you're a public figure and a lot of people look up to you.
5471360	5478240	So I definitely don't think, sort of this idea, the R word is not the battleground of expanding
5479120	5486720	the Orton window of discourse. Okay. Like I don't think it'll lead to dumb fuck
5487840	5494880	being canceled two years later, unless that word is hurting people's experience,
5495360	5503040	which I don't foresee that happening. I think legitimately our word and F slur and calling
5503040	5510640	women bitches, context matters here too. Of course, but just the way I've heard you use it,
5510640	5515840	it is not, it's from emotion and it's from frustration and it ultimately is rooted in
5515840	5522160	disrespect. I don't, I think it's ineffective. And of course, like who gets to say, I don't know,
5522720	5530720	but I'm saying somebody who would like, I admire effective conversations and I admire great humor,
5531280	5539600	dark humor, wit. To me, oftentimes the use of the R word in the way you've used in the way I see
5539600	5544320	the community use it is none of those things. It contributes not at all to the humor and so on.
5544880	5550080	Now I could see it might contribute to the, to the camaraderie of that particular group,
5550800	5556080	especially when they normalize the use of that word. You kind of take some of the edge off,
5556080	5563360	but you forget that there's a large number of other people that don't have the chemistry,
5563360	5567840	that don't hear the music of the friendship that you have, the relationship you have.
5567840	5572640	And instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word and it ultimately has an impact
5572640	5577440	that's hateful. And then people like me who show up, you know, I haven't watched much of your stuff.
5578080	5583440	It turns me off from like a couple of times your content came before me.
5584240	5587120	And I listened to it a little bit, it turned me off completely. I didn't understand
5587920	5592640	how good your heart is. I didn't understand how your mission of actually
5594400	5600880	deradicalize people, help people like you're, and increase the level of good faith discourse
5600880	5604400	in the world. I didn't understand any of that because like what I was hearing is pretty rough,
5605280	5610880	like the R-word type of stuff. And I just feel like the benefit cost analysis is heavy on the cost.
5610880	5617440	Gotcha. So I just have to sort of call this out. I think, and I straight up think it's wrong,
5618560	5623680	but that's my own. Why do you think it's wrong? Because it's hurting people without any benefit
5623680	5627200	to you whatsoever. When you say hurting people, do you mean the person I'm using it at? Or do
5627200	5633200	you think there's like the third group? It's good feedback, right? I always consider everything,
5633200	5637840	especially, I respect you a lot, you're a really smart guy. Something that I always kind of like
5640080	5643680	fight over in terms of like language or like who to attack or what to attack or what to do
5643680	5650960	is that it's very hard to draw like what boxes are okay to insult people on versus what aren't.
5650960	5657600	So for instance, if I call somebody like a Nazi with a lot of vitriol, I'm okay with every single
5657680	5664080	Nazi being negatively affected by that because that category intrinsically calls upon it some
5664080	5668560	level of more condemnation for me, right? Whereas like if I'm out there, I try not to do like image
5668560	5671840	related jokes, right? I don't want to call you like, oh, you're a fat fucking loser because there's a
5671840	5674960	lot of people that are fat that are overweight where I don't want them to feel bad. I don't want
5674960	5679680	them, I'm not trying to call you out or like insult you. So there's like a lot of, you say cost
5679680	5683440	benefit, I look at like a lot of collateral damage from a word like that where there's no purpose
5683440	5689120	in doing that. So certain words are easy to get rid of, they're off the table, right? Epsilon
5689120	5692560	and word like these are not words you call people because you're there's so much collateral,
5692560	5697760	it's not worth it. We've got some words where it's like if you have some form of like mental
5697760	5702240	thing, it is a bad thing, you're not a bad person, but just using that word could feel like a
5702240	5706640	collateral damage to those people. And then there's other categories of words. So like if I say that
5706640	5712480	like this person is like there is a stupid fucking Republican, right? There's probably some Republicans
5712560	5717440	that aren't dumb that I don't want to feel called out by that. Like are those types of phrases that
5717440	5722000	you think should be completely removed as well? Or I'm kind of curious. So this completely removed
5722640	5727280	just so we're clear. Yeah. I'm not referring to censorship. Oh no, I'm not even talking about
5727280	5732160	this. I'm just a person like emotionally like removed is the wrong word though. Like I care about
5733040	5737280	like I'm not trying to listen to people on the internet saying like you shouldn't say that word,
5737280	5744160	that's not good. I mean, I'm trying to look to your mind and heart. And the reason we're talking
5744160	5751200	today is you're betraying your gift. You're better than this. You think it's indicative of like a more
5751200	5754800	flip of thought process where it's like the only way you can say that word is if you're ignoring
5754800	5759120	the hurt and suffering of those people. And if you're somebody that says those people, you're
5759120	5765440	ignoring the state of language. Because I think you're getting to the point because it's not about
5765440	5772160	a single word. It's about like it's music. And I just feel like there is a very strong note.
5772720	5777840	It's a strong note that ruins the melody. Gotcha. And I don't think I can say, you know,
5777840	5782480	you shouldn't use the R word or whatever. I'm just speaking to it. I'm just listening to music
5782480	5788560	and reviewing the final result. It's not necessarily because maybe one use of the word, the R word
5789520	5795600	strategically or part of an actual like, or when you've built up a camaraderie that's
5795600	5801600	sandwiched in like some love, but then you try to reveal there. Because you're talking about
5801600	5806720	a lot of, there's a bunch of drama. You have friends with whom you're worrying and stuff.
5806720	5812640	And they're all a little bit beautifully insane. And you've said that you are becoming more and
5812640	5816800	more insane. It's beautiful to watch. It's the human condition laid before us. Wonderful. And
5816800	5824720	some of that is swearing and so on. So it's a tricky thing. But the whole skill of discourse,
5824720	5831200	just like it is with dark humor is walking that line. I just feel like it's overuse of the R
5831200	5835440	word. And I don't want to die in that grog because I don't think it's that that represent. Like,
5835440	5841200	there's certain things like that. It feels like it ruins the music. Gotcha. And I don't, you know,
5841200	5846080	it's just saying like a dumb Republican or dumb Democrat. I don't, yeah, that ruins it too a little
5846080	5852000	bit. Depends on how you use it. You can be lazy with that. You know, like even overuse of the
5852000	5856240	word, I think bots is what's used for people who don't think or something. I don't actually know
5856240	5862320	the definition. I'm offended on behalf of robots. That might be a compliment soon.
5863360	5868560	Exactly. But I guess bot means you don't think. Yeah, you're like an NPC. You just copy.
5868560	5873680	Again, I'm a friend on behalf of NPCs. I come myself as one. But there's a sense if you say
5873680	5880480	bots too much, that you're just dismissing people. Like everything I say is right.
5881280	5887120	And anyone that disagrees with me needs a bot. That's lazy too. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes
5887120	5891760	it's effective. Basically saying a lot of people in the mainstream media or something like that are
5891760	5898080	bots. Okay, that's a little bit of that is effective. But too much, it becomes ineffective.
5898160	5902160	And I'm trying to speak to that. And I'm just the reason we're highlighting
5902160	5910240	clear examples like the N word. Joe Rogan had to contend with that. I think it's
5910240	5915360	ineffective. It makes you less effective at discourse. But like you've talked about many
5915360	5919840	times, language is a tricky one. It's always hard because you talk about constructing a melody.
5919840	5924080	There's not one melody that sounds good to everyone. But there are probably certain notes
5924080	5928160	that like if you got rid of them, everybody's still going to like it about as much and you
5928160	5931040	don't really lose anything. There's a whole other part of an audience that might be more
5931040	5935120	willing to listen. Yeah, of course. And it's not about losing the magic of that melody. Like you
5935120	5940160	don't want to be vanilla. I just feel like there's stuff that doesn't need to be there.
5940160	5945120	Yeah, for sure. It's fat. But then again, the other thing that people should understand
5946000	5951680	that might be listening to this, you're streaming many hours a day for many years. I don't know
5952080	5956480	11 or 12, I think. Yeah, started in 2010. And so one of the things that people can do is just
5956480	5962320	clip out anything. You're going through the full human experience of emotion, anger,
5963040	5968400	fear, frustration, all of it. So of course there's going to be moments when you're not the best
5968400	5974960	version of yourself. Anything else to say about the language? It's complicated. I'm still always
5974960	5978800	trying to figure it out. There are opinions that I have that have changed throughout the years.
5978800	5982400	It's possible that the R word has always been the next one on the chopping block that we're all
5982400	5985840	kind of looking at, but people are always worried about that treadmill. But it's possible in a year
5985840	5989520	or two, I'll have a different view on it or all have changed away some of the words I use.
5991520	5994160	It's always like a work in progress. There's always different communities that feel different
5994160	5998000	ways about different words. Yeah, but do you acknowledge that there's people out there
5998960	6006080	that are never going to talk to you? They're never going to think of you as a good man because
6006080	6011440	you used the N word with the hard R publicly. In the past, I mean, yeah, those people exist.
6013200	6017840	There are some people that are beyond my reach, which I'm okay with. There's going to be some
6017840	6021920	people because of things that have been involved or even ideas that I have now that might make them
6021920	6027200	beyond my reach. Something you said earlier is very true. I think the goal is to identify what
6027200	6031920	are the elements that you can cut out that aren't integral to your message, but could be alienating
6032160	6037040	to more people. And those are probably the things that you identify. But I think that you can get
6037040	6042880	lost in yourself or lost in the internet or lost in the outside of yourself if you're trying to
6042880	6048880	appeal to every single person. It's just never going to be the case. I like that I've had the
6048880	6052720	journey that I've had on the internet that you can find me saying and defending a lot of insane
6052720	6056640	stuff 10 years ago, because I think it shows a level of progress. And I think I do get a lot
6056640	6060960	of respect and buy into certain communities where it's like, I'm not just some random dude telling
6060960	6064800	you that, oh, you shouldn't say the F word or the N word. I'm a guy that's been there,
6064800	6068480	that's done it, that's defended it. And you can see my whole past, my whole history is laid bare
6068480	6073760	for you to watch every thousands of hours of it. But I can show that there's growth and evolution
6073760	6079360	and change that can happen in a person. And you're honest about that growth. It's a tricky thing
6079360	6086960	because people just bring up stuff from your past. I hope we figure out as a civilization,
6086960	6093760	a mechanism to clearly say, this was me two years ago. This is me five years ago. I'm a
6093760	6100160	different person. Because Twitter doesn't care about that. These social mechanisms that bring
6100160	6105680	stuff out doesn't care about that. It's like one stupid thing you say, it becomes like a scarlet
6105680	6109920	letter. And I don't know how to fight that. It's tricky to fight that. Have you ever seen men in
6109920	6115440	black? Yes. When K and J are on the bench and he says a person is smart, but people are stupid,
6115520	6120000	dumb, finicky animals or whatever. There's something that changes for human dynamics when
6120000	6125040	there is a group of people that make it so hard to control. I think one-on-one, anybody can
6125040	6132240	sit across on somebody and admit to some horrible stuff. I abused my husband when I was 20 and
6132240	6136160	35 and I see what's wrong or I did this. I was addicted to whatever and I made these mistakes.
6136160	6141520	One-on-one, it's always easy. But in group environments that in group, out group, tribalistic
6141520	6147200	thing of identifying one thing and then coming to destroy a person's life is such a huge impulse
6147200	6151840	we have. And I think probably when we were hunter-gatherers in the forest, it's probably good
6151840	6155840	because you really want to push weird people out or anything like that. But now on the internet,
6155840	6160960	when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion and just with ruthless precision, destroy somebody's
6160960	6166640	life over it, it's pretty scary dynamic. I think one of the mechanisms that could fix it is make
6166640	6171840	it super easy for each individual person to analyze all the stupid shit they themselves have said
6171840	6179040	in the past. Like a full recording because I think people are just honestly paying a very
6179040	6185600	rosy picture to their own brain of who they have been in the past. If we can have empathy for the
6185600	6190960	fact that we've said stupid shit or we're drunk, the ridiculous things you say, the offensive
6190960	6195680	things you might have said, the offensive things you might have done, I just feel like that would
6195680	6202560	give us the ammunition to have empathy for others that are like, okay, yeah, this guy five years
6202560	6208640	ago said this, maybe that doesn't represent them, who doesn't represent who they are anymore than
6208640	6213920	stuff I said five years ago represents who I am today. I feel like technology can actually enable
6213920	6218400	that. Maybe, although you're talking about more recording and more stuff, which people already
6218400	6224400	worry about. It's a double edged sword. I think there is going to be more and more recording,
6224400	6228160	we have to figure out how to do that in a way that respects people's privacy and gives them
6228160	6232720	ownership of their data and so on. I've looked at the search history I've done on Google,
6232720	6236960	which for most people is available, like your Google search history, and it's fascinating to
6236960	6242320	watch the evolution of a human being. It doesn't seem like the same person, like a different person.
6242320	6247200	For sure. It's weird. It's also hard to with the internet today. I'm going to be agist again,
6247200	6252480	but like now all of the people are thrown together, whereas like, I don't want a 27-year-old
6252480	6257280	judging the age of like a 15 or 16-year-old. Obviously, he's in high school. There was that
6257280	6261040	story that came out of the... There was a kid that saved the recording of... I think it was like
6261040	6265760	some white girl. I think that she got her driver's license and she's like, I can drive now and words
6265760	6269120	with the A or whatever. It was dumb. She shouldn't have said it, but I think she was like 15 or 16
6269120	6273120	when she ticked off this or whatever. He held on to that recording until she applied and got
6273120	6277120	accepted to college three years later, and then he released it to get her kicked out of college.
6277120	6283520	And I'm like, damn. Everything that I had ever said as like a 15, 16-year-old was like immortalized
6283520	6289600	on the internet. My life wouldn't have even begun. And those are insanely high standards to hold
6289600	6294160	people to. Not that like, obviously you shouldn't be saying those... You shouldn't be saying certain
6294160	6298480	words or whatever, but you have to be able to make mistakes in adolescence like everybody does.
6298480	6300400	We all did. Everybody did it growing up, you know?
6300400	6307520	Why do you think there's so much misogyny in the streaming community? And how can you fight it?
6307520	6314640	Because you've shown a lot of interest in fighting it. Trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny from
6314640	6319440	your community. I think it's really difficult. I think that eliminating racism is easier than
6319440	6325200	eliminating misogyny. On the internet, you mean? On anywhere. Because I think fundamentally,
6325200	6328240	I don't think there's that much difference between like white people and black people and brown
6328240	6331680	people and Asian people or whatever. We have different cultures and stuff, but at the end of
6331680	6337120	the day, we're all people. But I think there are differences between men and women throughout all
6337120	6342880	of history and time and then even today in every culture. And when real differences do exist,
6342880	6346880	it's harder to account for them in a way that can we have conversations with each other without it
6346880	6350880	becoming very gendered in a negative way, right? Negative way of gendering something,
6350880	6357520	be like a misogynistic way of doing it. Of course, it's unclear to me that it's so difficult to
6359200	6364160	to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive. Because there's a lot of positive to the
6364160	6368000	tension, the dance between the different genders and so on. Maybe in this particular moment in
6368000	6374080	history, it's not. But it's not trivial to me that racism is easier to eliminate. It's an interesting
6374080	6378880	hypothesis just because there's more biological difference between men and women. That means
6378880	6382640	it's harder to eliminate. But I don't know if this is true. I hear this a lot. I feel like I read
6382640	6385120	this somewhere, but I need to get a better source of it. I repeated it everywhere. But I've heard
6385120	6391520	that in the US military, for instance, they do an exceedingly good job at getting different
6391520	6396480	people of different races to integrate. And it's not a huge problem once you're through basic
6396480	6400240	training, all the training, everything. But for a different sex, it still represents a
6400240	6403680	significant problem that the military hasn't figured out. And as you look to, well, what's the
6403680	6407680	military doing? Because if something was solvable, can we sleep for four hours a night and be healthy?
6407680	6410640	If we could, I bet the military would know. So I kind of look sometimes at them to see their
6410640	6413440	integration. But it might be that there are other issues there that make it ironic.
6413440	6418800	Yeah, it feels like the military is a very particular kind of thing. The actual task at hand
6418800	6425680	might bias the difficulty of the process. Potentially, yeah. There's been a lot of interesting
6426400	6433440	talk about women integrating into male groups. And how do you do this in a way where everybody
6433440	6439680	is happy with the outcome? And there's not issues. I think Jordan Peterson spoke about this a little
6439680	6444480	bit and then Workplace Culture speaks about this a bit. Would you happen to remember, I want to say
6444480	6449040	it was like five or 10 years ago, there was a big tech conference and there were two guys behind a
6449040	6454320	woman and they made a joke about like a USB dongle, like dongle was a dick. And this woman turned
6454320	6459440	around, she tweeted pictures of them, spoke about like misogyny and then that blew up into a huge
6459440	6467760	ordeal that like, yeah. There was this interesting phenomenon that in a less misogynistic and more
6467840	6473920	inclusive workplace environment, some women might end up feeling worse because in a more
6473920	6477520	misogynistic environment, you're thinking like, okay, that's a woman. She doesn't get our humor.
6477520	6482400	I'm going to treat her in a very indifferent, very dispassionate, cold way and whatever. And then
6482400	6485680	I'm going to have my boys over here. And then you've got like these environments where they're
6485680	6488880	a little bit more warmer. And it's like, oh, cool, we're going to bring this woman into our environment
6488880	6492560	and we're going to make all the same types of like crash jokes we did before. And it's actually
6492560	6495680	worse now. Another woman feels even more otherwise because like, oh my God, why do you talk like
6495680	6500480	this? I think that internet communities, especially online ones that do like political debate and
6500480	6505920	video games are very much like big boys clubs. So it's not enough to just say you can't be
6505920	6509920	misogynistic to get rid of misogyny. There's always going to be an othering effect on women.
6509920	6513600	There's a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive that you have to account for and you've
6513600	6518000	got to try to like push that back. And that's just a very, very, very challenging thing to do.
6518560	6522560	So like, I like to deal with concrete examples more. So here's a concrete example. And this is
6522560	6525840	like a recent initiative in my community because I'm trying to like be, because misogyny hasn't
6525840	6528240	been fixed anywhere on the internet. And I'm curious, well, there are ways that I can push my
6528240	6532960	community to do this. I don't think you should almost ever make a comment on a woman's appearance
6532960	6537200	ever if they're appearing in like some political or professional manner. Even if it's a positive
6537200	6541360	comment, I think it's equally bad to a negative comment. It's just never good to do. And that's
6541360	6545120	kind of an unintuitive thing because it's like, well, a woman appears, wow, she's really cute.
6545120	6547840	It seems like a nice comment. You're being nice, you know, she looks cute or whatever. But it's
6547840	6551280	like, it's not at all the point of why she's there. And just by saying that, you're kind of like
6551280	6555600	otherizing her as like a person to like think she looks good rather than listening to anything she
6555600	6560080	has to say, you know? Well, there's a lot of stuff that you're saying and
6562240	6567600	that is a part of misogyny. It's almost like obvious, like any woman will tell you that.
6567600	6570400	Woman, well, yeah, but they're not in these spaces and a lot of the guys don't know.
6570400	6577120	But I think what that requires is just empathy. You don't need, you don't need, you need to
6577120	6584160	consider the female experience. That's it. Like you have to either read about or talk with women.
6584160	6589040	You learn like the low hanging food is very easy to learn. It feels like just the level of social
6589040	6596080	skill oftentimes in internet communities is quite low. I disagree. I don't like to say,
6596080	6600800	here's the problem with empathy is it's very hard to have empathy for experiences that are so
6600800	6604400	outside of your own. Well, maybe some people, there might be some people that can do it,
6604400	6608640	I can't. There's a lot of stuff that I had to learn. Women are half the population.
6608640	6614000	But they're women. They're totally different. They're totally different.
6614560	6619760	We'll talk about, they're not totally different. So here's an example, okay? So
6620960	6627920	especially for me, my archetype makes up a lot of the internet. White man. There's never been a
6627920	6632640	point. The name of a beautiful woman. Who might be a dancer. What's the backstory from New Orleans
6633120	6637360	I haven't thought that through yet. It's ambiguous. Like an open world.
6637360	6641120	Open world. I want you to project wherever you want destiny, the dancer to be from.
6641120	6644000	That's in your mind. I'll see that for later tonight.
6645840	6650240	As a white guy, I don't know if there's ever been a spot that I've been in
6650240	6653760	where I've been made to feel like I don't belong there just by virtue of who I am.
6655440	6659120	It's impossible for me to empathize that because I don't even have that experience.
6659680	6664080	If you go back eight, nine years, one of the big issues that came up was harassment and
6664080	6669280	gaming against women. And I was one of the big debaters against that saying that like,
6669280	6673520	sure, women might get harassment, but everybody gets harassment. If you're a woman and you're
6673520	6677120	in gaming and you get harassed, congratulations, you're being treated like a man. What you're
6677120	6680880	actually asking for is for us to actually treat you differently. You don't want to be insulted.
6680880	6684240	You don't want to be treated like a man. And that's actually misogyny is women making that
6684240	6688400	argument. You still stand by that? Is that a problem if I do? No, I'm just kidding.
6689200	6693360	Okay, hold on. So a little while after. I disagree with it. Sure. Okay. That's good.
6693360	6699280	You should. A little while later, I had a friend, Jessica, super cool girl. We go to play games.
6699280	6702640	She was between jobs. She's like, I've got like two months and we're going to grind CS go.
6702640	6706480	And I'm like, okay, this is awesome. Let's do it. CS go, Counter-Strike,
6706480	6711360	Global Offensive, Shooter Game, FPS, microphones. First day we start playing. Okay. Hop into our
6711360	6715200	first game. Obviously she talks. Everybody's making, is that a 12 year old boy? Why aren't
6715200	6718240	you making sandwiches? Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, okay, whatever. Play our first game.
6718240	6722480	Play our second game. Same jokes. Third game, fourth game. By like the fourth or fifth game,
6723120	6726080	I was actually starting to feel triggered. Like every time the game started, I was like,
6726080	6730400	can you just like talk so we can get over like the stupid fucking jokes? It's so fucking stupid.
6730400	6736000	And you hear the same fucking joke every single time. And it took one day of that experience
6736000	6740720	for me to realize it's not about being insulted. It's like this othering feeling that you don't
6740720	6744480	belong. And I've never felt that because I'm a white guy. Like it's not to be like virtue
6744480	6747200	singular. So like there's just, there's no places where it's like, you're white, you don't belong
6747200	6751360	here. You're a guy, you don't belong here. Like I've never felt that not inclusion. And playing
6751360	6757040	with her, there's a different feeling when it's the same types of jokes coming from a group of
6757040	6761120	people to make you feel like you don't belong there. Where I was like, damn, this actually
6761120	6766400	feels really bad. And it feels bad in a different way where it's like, if you call me like NF Slur
6766400	6770400	or any other type of swear word or insult, like, yeah, you can call me that. But at the end of
6770400	6773520	the day, like we're all kind of the same, we're all white dudes and we call each other names.
6773520	6777120	But like this is a woman and this is not her place and she doesn't belong here.
6778000	6781760	Kind of the analogy that I would make because I after getting these experiences, I would learn
6781760	6786880	this afterwards. If I tell you that there's another guy in a room and you need to think of the worst
6786880	6790640	insults ever for that person without ever knowing anything about them or meeting them.
6790640	6795040	If I tell you that it's like a white straight guy and you have to write insults, you're fucked.
6795040	6799200	Maybe you can do like school shooter. There's not really much you can say at the end of the day.
6799280	6802960	But if I tell you it's a woman, whoo, there are so many different jokes you can write.
6802960	6805760	If it's a black person, so many different racist things we can say.
6805760	6808720	Are you sure? I can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy.
6808720	6811680	In terms of stuff that is just intrinsic to him being a white guy?
6811680	6813840	Yeah, like there's really?
6813840	6819440	Wait a minute. What are you talking about? There's a lot. The internet has sharpened that sword.
6819440	6822640	In terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex or targets?
6822960	6826560	Incel, virgin, weak.
6826560	6830080	Some of the incel, virgin, maybe. Yeah, that's getting there, sure. That's for sure.
6831120	6833920	That's recent though. Sorry, I'm older on the internet. We didn't have those words way back
6833920	6836960	then. When I was making these analogies that incel and virgin.
6836960	6840560	Back in my day, we didn't have gender. There were no incels back then. None of us had sex.
6840560	6844000	We just accept it. We were all computer gamers. Nobody had sex to play video games back then,
6844000	6847200	okay? People don't remember that. There wasn't the big bang theory. You were just a loser that
6847200	6850400	was stuck in zero. You guys didn't even know sex exists as we can use this as an insult.
6850400	6853360	We had to download sexual pictures and they took two minutes and you didn't even know if
6853360	6856480	you were going to get the right thing by the time it finished loading. But what I'm saying is that,
6856480	6861280	okay, I think you agree that if somebody gives you a race, like a black person who's a woman,
6861280	6866160	we can write very cutting, scathing insults for that person that are very otherizing.
6866160	6871280	Or words that would really hurt. Yeah, that are very cutting to the person. But for a white guy,
6872000	6876080	it's kind of hard because that's the default. There's not as much otherizing of those people.
6876320	6881600	Yeah. So the insults you have from white guy to white guy, the insults are much harsher.
6881600	6884640	So when you start to apply the same kind of harshness to other groups,
6885200	6889280	you can make them feel like they really don't belong. And that otherizing effect is something
6889280	6892720	that's very hard for me. I can't really empathize with it because I never felt it. So I have to
6892720	6896080	intellectualize it and then sympathize with it. It's like a whole process I have to go through.
6896080	6899440	And then I try to walk other people through that because if you're a white guy on the internet,
6899440	6902080	which is a lot of the internet, you really don't know what that feels like. You've never felt
6902080	6908960	like that before. Well, so you're now in a leadership position, grandpa destiny. So that's
6908960	6914320	a lot of people look up to you for that. For that sort of pathway to empathy. Yeah.
6915440	6920400	How not to otherize. I mean, you have felt otherizing. You mentioned high school people
6920400	6925760	like not being... Yeah, but those are always for things that like it's different to insult somebody
6925760	6929920	for a non-immutable characteristic. Like, okay, you think poorly about me because I'm like not
6929920	6932880	enough money or what? I don't have money, but I could get more money and I could change that.
6932880	6936960	But it's different for somebody to really attack you for like your gender or attack you for like
6936960	6944160	your race. A lot of the attacks that hit the hardest is not about gender. I do think that
6944880	6949920	the way women are attacked on the internet, it's the same kind of attacks you would do
6949920	6954320	towards other guys, but you'd go harsher. I feel like they're fundamentally different.
6954400	6960880	I feel like when we're attacking guys, I'm not usually attacking you on like the virtue of you
6961520	6965440	being a guy. But like, if it's a woman and she's typing something like, oh, did your boyfriend
6965440	6968960	type that for you? Or like, what are you even doing here? Like, shouldn't you be trying to find a
6968960	6972560	husband? Or like, oh, you're like a stupid kind of like ghost type and only fans? No, but the
6972560	6976240	stupidity, the intelligence aspect is what's attacked. Yeah, but it's so much different. Like,
6976240	6979840	you can call a guy stupid, but that's because he's a guy that's being stupid. But when you call
6979840	6984080	a woman stupid, she's stupid because she's a woman. Yeah, but I honestly think that women
6984320	6989840	are called stupid more than men on the internet. But it's nothing to do, like the attack
6990880	6998080	is not gendered. It's the gender inspires an increased level of attack. I feel like it is
6998080	7003360	gendered. I wish we had data on this. Have you ever heard of the XKCD comics? Yes. It's a really
7003360	7007760	good comic where, and this is something that I've dealt with a lot in my community, okay? There's
7007760	7013120	a guy at a board and he fucks up a math equation. And it's like, wow, you suck at math. And then
7013120	7016640	the next panelist, there's a girl that does it and she fucks it up. And it's like, wow, women
7016640	7022560	suck at math. And there's like that feeling that happens where when I bring on, I won't use names,
7022560	7026720	but they're like YouTube people that are brought on that have crazy opinions. And when they're men,
7026720	7031760	that person is crazy. Oh my God, he said the crazy stuff. He's so dumb. He's so crazy, so stupid.
7031760	7035680	But when it's a woman, it's like, oh my God, why do you always bring dumb women here? Why do so
7035680	7039120	many women on the internet have crazy opinions? There's a different like minority character
7039120	7044240	that has to like stand it and like represent like they're a whole group where like white men
7044240	7049920	don't typically have to. Speaking of group sources, individuals, yes. But then what I feel happens is
7049920	7056080	then another person from that group comes, another woman comes and people before she says anything
7057040	7062400	will already feel like they're ready with that attack. For sure. But they're ready for the attack
7062400	7065920	because she's a woman. They're going to call her she's stupid because she's not because she says
7065920	7073360	something to them or just because she's a woman. So like the group in their brain accumulates all
7073360	7077680	the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met, not the positive, the negative,
7077680	7083200	and it becomes like this ball of stickiness. And then that becomes the bias for their judgment of
7083200	7088480	a new person that comes with white men. There's more of a blank slate in terms of bias of how
7088480	7095280	they analyze the person with any of the minority group, they basically make a judgment based on
7095280	7100080	the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met in the past. That leads to a system
7100080	7105440	where you're just harsher towards minority groups and towards women. How do you solve that?
7105440	7109920	The most important thing for any problem ever is step one is to be aware of it. If you're not aware
7109920	7114640	of it, then you're hopelessly lost at sea. But yeah, the first thing I like to say is she's like
7114640	7118240	be aware of it. Like I've had, there's a girl that I've had on recently and she says a lot of,
7118240	7122240	in my opinion, kind of crazy things, but people will use her as like this is why women shouldn't
7122240	7125760	be here. This is like she's crazy and she's a woman and blah, blah, blah. But I can bring on a guy
7125760	7131280	who's has similarly done things and he's evaluated on his own merits because it's a guy. There's never,
7131280	7134560	ever, ever been a case where I brought a stupid guy on stream and everybody's like,
7134560	7138480	this guy makes me hate men. This guy makes me hate white people. That has never happened.
7138480	7141920	But then there's like other women that come on and it's like, now I know why incels exist.
7141920	7145760	Or I totally understand where red pill ideology comes from. And even if the statements are kind
7145760	7150400	of true, when you're making these observations over and over and over and over again, it damages
7150400	7154480	your ability to individually perceive somebody. And then two people that make the same statements,
7154480	7158240	one can be perceived more harshly just because of that like group bias you've got built up.
7158240	7161280	I think there's something about streaming that just brings that out of people. Like because
7161280	7166080	you have to talk for like seven hours. So you're like, all right, well, whatever psychological
7166080	7170560	issues and complexities I have, I'm going to explore that for some magnified magnified.
7171200	7177920	And then it's the, as you talked about the memetic theories or Gerardian, like whatever
7178880	7183280	the things that are very similar and you're going to magnify the conflicts that you have and you're
7183280	7187360	going to explore the, all the different perspectives on those different conflicts.
7187360	7192960	And I mean, I don't know if it's just anecdotal, but it's nice to have women on stream. And I think
7192960	7200400	the dynamic that you guys have is wonderful. It's really interesting. So it's just the female
7200400	7206160	voice in general. I love having women on the podcast. The female voice, I feel like is under
7206160	7211600	heard on the internet and I would love the internet to be a place where women feel safe to
7211600	7218560	speak. All right, given that you're, like we talked about a progressive with non-standard
7218560	7225600	progressive views. So you're very pro free speech, pro capitalism. So given that it's very
7225600	7232240	interesting that you're also pro establishment and pro institutions. So right now if you look
7232320	7237680	at the world, there's a significant distrust of institutions, at least in sort of public
7237680	7242720	intellectual discourse. What is the nature of your support for government and institutions?
7242720	7251520	Can you make the case for and against them? Broadly speaking, there is a synergistic effect
7251520	7257920	when two humans come together. If I can speak very broadly in terms of, we'll say utility,
7258560	7265600	my happiness with one person might be 10. When they come together, it's like 50
7265600	7269360	between the two of them. There's like the synergistic effect when humans work together
7269360	7273520	that the sum is greater than all the individual parts or whatever. There's like an emergent
7273520	7278080	thing that happens there. There's a capacity, there's a possibility of that. Yeah, a possibility,
7278080	7281280	sure. Things could go really wrong. There could be a cannibalistic tribe that all eats each other,
7281840	7284960	but for the purpose of this. There's all their failure modes, but yes.
7284960	7290080	Okay, sure. Yeah. But I think broadly speaking, are you going to be the well actually guy?
7290080	7296000	Okay, if you want to well, okay. Well, actually. Sometimes cannibalism is actually good for both.
7296000	7299680	True. Yeah, sometimes things do go wrong. But I think broadly speaking, the fact that
7299680	7302880	you're sitting here in clothing that you didn't make and I'm sitting here on an airplane that
7302880	7306480	I don't know how to fly or build, like right, there's a lot of cool stuff that happens when
7306480	7312960	people come together and they make civilizations. And part of that civilization building is the
7312960	7318720	fact that we can specialize. And it's the fact that we can offload a bunch of trust onto third
7318720	7323840	parties that we delegate the power to make important decisions about our lives, right?
7323840	7328800	I don't know anything about how to like build like a combustion engine, but I know that when I
7328800	7332080	push the button in my car, it's going to drive around and the fumes aren't going to kill me
7332080	7335760	and I can park it in garages and the building's not going to collapse. And the only reason all
7335760	7339440	of this works is because I've offloaded a lot of trust onto these third party things.
7339440	7342720	And I would say that the pillars of these third party things that society is built on
7342720	7348160	are roughly speaking institutions. So that might be the institution of peer review for
7348160	7355200	scientific articles. It might be the institution of voting for government, right? Or the ability
7355200	7359360	for us to vote in that whole process. It might, yeah, all the FDA, like all of the institutions
7359360	7363840	and things that they need to exist because we don't have the time or the capability to
7363840	7368080	individually sort through all of these things individually. We have to rely on some third
7368080	7376000	party to do it. Okay. So you believe at scale, when we're together, we're greater than the
7376000	7381360	sum of our parts. That's the case for institutions. Absolutely. What about the inefficiencies of
7381360	7388400	bureaucracy? Is there some aspect when at scale, different dynamics come into play than they do
7388400	7392480	when there's two people together, two people that love each other, the birds and the bees?
7393280	7398320	Is there some aspect that leads more to cannibalism at scale? So like corruption
7398320	7404080	inefficiencies that due to bureaucracy and so on. Bureaucracy, which is not, I hate it when people
7404080	7408400	try to say bureaucracy is government because bureaucracy exists a ton in private environments
7408400	7413360	as well, right? In businesses and everything. Bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems.
7413360	7418080	But I mean, a bureaucracy is necessary because it's coordinating all of the underlying things
7418480	7423280	in order to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts, right? Like all of the
7423280	7426640	software developers in the world are useless without being paired with good designers in
7426640	7430320	order to make their products usable by a person. And the coordination of those people and the
7430320	7434320	coordination of increasingly more and more things necessitates some level of bureaucracy.
7434320	7438480	I think we always say bureaucracy when it's like a bad, it's like a slur on us. Like you're
7438480	7441520	a bureaucrat, you're bureaucratic. The bureaucracy is slowing everything down. It's like,
7441520	7445200	sure, the bureaucracy slows things down, but bureaucracy also gives us things like, you know,
7445200	7449840	safe medicine and safe water to drink for most of the US or safe buildings to live in or safe
7449840	7455200	cars to drive. So the managers in institution versus like the software developers and the
7455200	7462320	designers, the managers is the bureaucracy. The reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is that
7462320	7470960	something about human nature leads to bureaucracy often growing, growing indefinitely and becoming
7470960	7477280	less and less efficient. I mean, this is where capitalism can come in, that capitalism puts
7477280	7483760	a pressure on the bureaucracy not to grow too much because you want the bureaucracy to be useful,
7484480	7493040	but not large. To be a certain size, of course. To be the minimum size to get the job done.
7493040	7501280	And so capitalism provides that mechanism. Government does not always. And so that's
7501280	7506800	the criticism of government of institutions where it can grow without a significant mechanism that says
7507520	7512480	there's a cost to bureaucracy that's not being accounted for here. We're just paying for the
7512480	7519120	increasing size of government without the benefit. Yeah, government is a special institution because
7519200	7523600	it doesn't have to show itself to be financially viable. And we kind of live in a capitalist economy
7523600	7527680	where that's generally the case. So government gets its powers from votes from the people,
7527680	7532800	which introduces a whole new set of possible positives and possible negatives. Having something,
7532800	7536800	for instance, that gives food or shelter to homeless people, maybe you don't want that to
7536800	7542480	have to run at a profit. But giving an organization that can self-justify its budgets perpetually
7542480	7546320	and indefinitely growing, maybe that's not the best thing. Yeah, we always have to figure out
7546320	7553120	how to do the constraints there. What about the corrupting nature of power? That comes with
7553120	7558720	institutions as well. Absolutely. So then you better pick your style of institution very carefully.
7558720	7562000	I think that the democratic institution we have in the United States today,
7562000	7565360	I think works very well. But I mean, there are other styles of government that have been tried
7565360	7568800	in the past that I think lend themselves more to corruption. Not to say that, by the way,
7568800	7571920	there's not corruption in the United States. Of course, there's going to be varying levels of
7571920	7579520	corruption at all levels. But you run into this interesting problem where authoritarian regimes
7579520	7583920	can act with ruthless precision and swiftness because they don't have to ask any questions.
7583920	7588720	They just do, do, do, do, do. And that's it. But the problem is, it's an authoritarian regime.
7588720	7593680	They're prone to missteps. They're slow to respond to changing or evolving needs. There was an
7593680	7597280	interesting study that was put out a while ago that showed that every single famine that happened
7597280	7602320	around the world, almost 98% of them happen under authoritarian regimes where freedom of
7602320	7606640	speech is very limited. It's very rare for a famine to happen under democracy because
7606640	7609760	press and everything makes the government more responsive to the needs of the people.
7609760	7613280	Power can corrupt. Their level is of corruption. But you have to have a system of checks and
7613280	7616880	balances on all of those different levels to make sure it doesn't run off the rails, I guess,
7616880	7622960	and do a sick loop-de-loop and half the population gets nice callback. There's a lot of people that
7622960	7627520	will listen to you say that the democracy in the United States is working pretty damn well
7627520	7634080	and they will spit out the drink if they're drinking a drink and be very upset. Can you make the case
7634080	7637680	that they're right and you're wrong? Can I make the case that- Can you steal man?
7637680	7642160	They're right. Yeah. Well, the steal man for them is that people have a lot of problems on the day
7642160	7647680	to day. And when they look and they see what government is doing, they might see potholes
7647680	7653040	outside their house, homeless people all over their downtown, and the United States just approved
7653040	7658640	another X billion amount of dollars for Ukraine. Or they might be living in a city where half
7658640	7663200	the factors are shut down. A lot of their people are out of work, but the president is on the TV
7663200	7667280	talking about how to find jobs for immigrants coming in from Mexico. And for these people,
7667280	7672160	they have problems that exist in their lives. Some of them are paying taxes to alleviate these
7672160	7676080	problems. And then when they listen to the government talk, it feels like the government is
7676080	7680400	not responding to the needs that they have. And then that's one problem. Then on top of that,
7680400	7682960	you've got all of these people working in alternative media that can show you, well,
7682960	7686960	look at this politician wasting this much money. Or look at him double speaking here or there.
7686960	7690960	Look at Hillary Clinton saying she's got a private position and a public position. Look at how
7690960	7694240	all of these politicians have family members that are getting rich because of their relationships
7694240	7699280	with people in Congress. Look at the revolving door between capitalist companies and the government.
7699280	7702480	How can you look at all of that, take into account that the government's not responding
7702560	7706160	to your needs and then really feel like it's a government by the people and for the people?
7706160	7711920	Yeah, this was a very good, good steelman and good question. How can you, how can you,
7711920	7715120	how can you tell that they're not just politicians that care more about
7715760	7720560	continuously winning the elections versus being running government effectively?
7720560	7723360	They should care about winning the elections. That's the first misconception. A lot of people
7723360	7728640	say this guy only cares about getting voted in. This guy, like, he doesn't even believe in fracking
7728640	7732240	or abortion. He just changed his opinion to get voted in. Anytime somebody says that,
7732240	7735680	you say, that's really good. You want them to change their opinions so they get voted in.
7735680	7738720	That's the whole point of the democracy. You don't want them to remain obstinate. You don't
7738720	7741600	want them to say, I'm not changing my opinion no matter what the people want. You want them to
7741600	7745360	evolve and adopt new opinions based on what the population, their constituents are voting for.
7745360	7750080	Yeah, but the cynical take is that on the surface they're changing their opinion,
7750080	7756800	but that there's a boys club or boys means the elite that under in the smoke filled rooms
7758160	7761920	in secret, they're actually have their own agenda and they're following that agenda and they're
7761920	7768800	just saying anything publicly to placate the public based on whatever the new trends are.
7769760	7771840	So here's the cynical take a poll.
7771840	7777680	Yeah, I understand. Somebody asked me this question and it flipped. I won 80 completely.
7777680	7783840	I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016 and my single issue voting thing was lobbying.
7783840	7786560	I thought that lobbying, the government was corrupt, they weren't responding to these people.
7786560	7791840	It was completely destroyed my faith in government and everything. And I had one question post me
7791840	7795680	by a conservative that used to come on my stream and shout at me and he said, I think he asked me,
7795680	7801760	can you think of any popular opinion that the American public has that the government is
7801760	7805360	unresponsive to? Is there some big piece of legislation or policy or whatever that people
7805360	7810800	want that the government isn't doing? They asked me that. I couldn't think of a single good answer.
7810800	7817600	And I'm like, oh, geez, there's good. There's drugs. There's not. Legalization or drug. Hold on.
7817600	7820800	Yeah, go for it. Oh, shoot. You're doing the Joe Rogan thing. You're pushing back because I brought
7820800	7830720	up weed. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I have become meme. I don't even, I don't want to interrupt your quote
7830720	7835440	because there's memes upon memes upon memes I can go with here. But no, because people bring up,
7835440	7840800	okay, there's no issues. There's no issues that the government is not representing of the public.
7840800	7844480	So here's the issue. So somebody will bring up like, well, what about the legalization of drugs?
7844480	7849360	Okay. The first issue people have is one, they look at national polling. Very few things are
7849440	7854640	decided on a national level. So that's the first huge mistake. Arguably, a lot of BLM made mistakes
7854640	7858560	in this arena where they're saying like, why isn't the government doing anything about policing?
7858560	7860960	Federal government can't do anything about policing. That's going to be your, sometimes
7860960	7863840	not even your state government, sometimes your local city government, the people that like elect
7863840	7868800	like your chief of police, your police commissioner, that's coming from your mayor, right? So you've
7868800	7872400	got people looking, one, at the wrong parts of the government to even figure out the solutions to
7872400	7877440	the problem. Two, oftentimes for polling, the questions are vague enough that you can pull
7877440	7882240	very high. But when you get into the weeds on things, no pun intended, you start to realize
7882240	7885840	like, oh, shoot, this is more complicated than I thought. I don't know the numbers in particular
7885840	7890160	for legalization of marijuana, but this is what I'm going to guess is the case. If you poll and you
7890160	7896720	say, should we legalize marijuana, that number might pull at like 65, 70%. But that's including
7896720	7901040	people that are in favor of medical marijuana. If you were to poll, like, should we legalize,
7901040	7905040	should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana, that number might drop to like
7905120	7909120	52%. And then if you poll, like, should we completely legalize, not just decriminalize,
7909120	7912240	but completely legalize recreational use of marijuana, that number might drop to like 40%.
7912880	7915280	There's like all these different ways you can pull around issues where people are like, oh,
7915280	7918960	no, we broadly agree on this topic. But when you really figure out, well, do you,
7918960	7921920	do we really agree? Or is it just like broad consensus around a thing that's never going
7921920	7925920	to show up like in a piece of legislation? A really good example, one example I do know is
7925920	7930320	socialized health care. I think if you poll, there was a time a few years ago where if you
7930320	7935760	poll America, do you think every American citizen should have access to like free health care?
7935760	7941760	I think that answer, that poll like 74% yes. But when you asked, should the government be the sole
7941760	7947280	provider of health care, it dropped to like 26%, dropped 50 points. And you could see it was both
7947280	7950960	asking questions about single payer, but the way that it was asked was so different that even if
7950960	7954960	you all, it looks like there's consensus, there's not nearly as much consensus as people think
7954960	7959600	around certain ideas. Yeah, go. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right.
7960880	7965920	That polls, the way you ask the polls really matters. But when you ask, should the government
7965920	7972480	be in charge of a thing, that also biases the answer, right? Like, because there's such a negative
7973040	7977680	experience with government creating a dog gov site that runs the thing. But sometimes,
7978400	7983440	sometimes, I think if you dig in, if you have a one hour conversation with each individual
7984080	7989040	citizen, I think you will understand that, yes, there is support for socialized medicine.
7990320	7993920	The argument has to be made though, yeah. What do you mean with the argument has to be made?
7993920	7997040	Like, if you just ask a conservative, like what about single payer, they're going to tell you,
7997040	8000240	no, you might be able to build up to an argument for it, but you're going to have to make the case
8000240	8005680	for it. No, but I thought we're talking about the feeling deep inside your mind and heart.
8006320	8012240	Does the government represent that? Oh. So it's not like some shallow surface layer
8012880	8019600	public opinion. Does the government effectively represent what the people want? Not a shallow
8019600	8024320	survey, but deeply what they want. I'm not actually that familiar with the debates over
8024320	8029600	healthcare, but let's maybe look at an easier one. Sure. Maybe you'll say it's harder. War.
8030400	8034960	War is a really good example where the government was very responsive, I think, to the people.
8034960	8041840	You think so. So, Iraq, Afghanistan, the government didn't manipulate public opinion.
8041840	8046080	There is an argument to be made that they did in terms of like WMD and everything,
8046080	8051040	but after 9-11, were you in the United States after 9-11? After 9-11, I legit.
8051040	8053600	That seems accusatory. Like, where were you in 9-11?
8055280	8060560	Just checking, okay. All right, cool. I have evidence and witnesses. No, okay,
8061280	8064800	I'm very defensive right now. That's very strange. Look into it.
8066240	8070000	I think after 9-11, we could have gone to war with any country in the world.
8070880	8076000	We were ready because all of America was like, oh my God. And they pointed to Iraq and, you know,
8076000	8079840	the reasons for the WMDs was kind of dumb, but I don't think we even needed WMDs to go to Iraq.
8079840	8083760	We could have just said, you know, Saddam Hussein was giving medical aid to Taliban,
8083760	8089680	al-Qaeda, Iraq, let's go, and we would have gone for it. But post Iraq, Iraq was for a while
8089680	8094000	popular and then became obviously deeply unpopular, Iraq and Afghanistan. And I think you could see
8094000	8098160	that influence other foreign policy that the United States had. For instance, we opted more
8098160	8102400	towards like drone warfare than troops on the ground for places like Yemen. We opted more
8102400	8105440	towards like kind of like sending money and help instead of boots on the ground for places like
8105440	8110880	Syria. And I think that a lot of that was kind of in response to how unpopular the Iraq stuff
8110880	8114880	had become. And when you looked at a lot of elections afterwards, even for Obama, like one
8114880	8118480	of the defining characteristics of a lot of campaigns were like, I'm going to close Guantanamo
8118480	8122640	Bay. I'm going to get us out of foreign wars. Even up to Trump, I'm going to, you know, I'm not
8122640	8126320	going to stop doing all this weird stuff in the Middle East. But they didn't still withdraw from
8126320	8130080	Afghanistan. They didn't withdraw, but they definitely like tapered off and weren't like as
8130080	8133840	aggressively pushing those types of conflicts because they knew it was unpopular. But I think
8133840	8139600	if you also consider perfect information or good information, if you ask a lot of people,
8141200	8147120	are you okay spending this amount of money for this purpose? So military conflict in
8147120	8150800	Iraq and Afghanistan, I think almost from the very beginning, they would say no.
8151360	8154880	After 9-11? I feel like maybe like a few days after 9-11, like,
8154880	8156160	I remember Freedom Prize.
8156800	8162080	What was the nature? Well, there's some memes and so on, yes. But the nature of the public support
8162080	8168160	for the war, was there public support in 2003, which is when the invasion happened?
8168800	8172080	I feel like initially there was a lot, I remember seeing it on, but then I also lived in a republican
8172080	8175520	household and I was not very like media savvy at that. And I don't know if the nature of that
8175520	8180080	public support had to do with WMDs or with 9-11. Because the weird-
8180080	8181520	It came about WMDs.
8181520	8186240	But I wonder what is the, if you were to poll people and let's say hypothetically,
8186240	8190640	there was above 50% support for the war, what would be the nature of that support?
8191600	8197600	And to what degrees the government actually representing the will of the people versus
8198400	8204560	some complex mechanism like the military industrial complex is manipulating the narrative
8204560	8211280	that's controlling public opinion. And then there's the media that gets a lot of attention
8211280	8216480	by being divided and how they're shaping the narrative through the mechanism of division.
8218080	8221600	There's a lot of complicated things out there. It's not just like the people and then the
8221600	8224400	government. And that's, yeah, for sure, I agree that there are going to be different
8224400	8225520	elements at play.
8225520	8232000	And how much of those elements that lead us astray can be attributed to the
8232000	8239440	largeness of the different systems and the different institutions, like the media institutions
8239440	8244640	and government, the institutions that have a monopoly on violence. Let's put it this way,
8244640	8246880	which is one way to define government.
8246880	8250880	Sure. It's complicated. There's definitely going to be different institutions at play.
8250880	8254560	But I think that like, all I would say is like in reference to my original point,
8254560	8258400	when there becomes like broad consensus around a thing, I think the government will usually
8258400	8261120	follow. It's not going to fight. It's going to follow more often than not.
8261840	8265360	But I think that a lot of times I think Americans think that there's more consensus
8265360	8269440	around certain issues than there actually are. So like a really good example, we're on that war
8269440	8276080	point too. What caused like the lowest dip in Biden's approval rating? I'm pretty sure it was
8276080	8281120	right after we pulled out of Afghanistan, which I think if I would have asked people like a year
8281120	8285440	before, like, let's assume that we could pull out of Afghanistan, the government's probably
8285440	8288240	going to collapse after we leave because they just don't have the will to fight, they don't have
8288240	8291920	the support, whatever, it's just not going to work. But like no Americans are going to die.
8291920	8293760	There might be a couple other people who are like, no Americans are going to die,
8293760	8296960	we're going to get out of Afghanistan. Would you support that? I think broadly speaking,
8296960	8301040	I think more than 60 or 70% of Americans are like, yeah, that would be fine.
8301040	8304080	But then when it actually plays on TV, when we see the people hanging onto the planes,
8304080	8307280	when we see like helicopter embassies, some of the courts and politicians,
8307280	8310080	well now it's like, oh my God, this was horrible and it was so botched.
8310080	8312640	And it could have gone so much better. It's like, well, could it have gone better?
8312880	8317520	Maybe, maybe not. But I mean, it seems like you can have consensus around a certain opinion.
8317520	8320880	But the way that things play out and the way that people actually feel,
8320880	8324880	it's actually way, way, way more complicated. And there's not usually this broad consensus
8324880	8331360	opinion. All right, yeah, go ahead. I'd like to believe that. I mean, just to lay my cards on the
8331360	8344480	table, I have faith in the power of effective government. I just have a lot of concern about
8344480	8350000	what happens as institutions grow in size. For sure. And I just have a lot of worry about the
8350000	8357200	natural corrupting influence on the individuals and on the system as a whole, like the boys' club
8357200	8362320	nature of it. I don't know, there must be a better term. But basically, they, they agree to the game
8362320	8368800	and they play the game and there's a generational aspect momentum to the game. And they more and
8368800	8373840	more stop being responsive to the people that they represent. I just feel like there is that
8373840	8381200	mechanism. And I think the nice thing, democracy elections are a resistance to that natural human
8381200	8386880	mechanism. Also, the balances of power is a resistance to that mechanism. In some ways,
8386880	8392560	the media that reveals the bullshit of politicians is also a resistance to that mechanism. It's hard
8392560	8398160	to be full of shit as a politician because people will try to catch you on it. So there's a honesty
8398880	8404080	method there that keeps you honest. It's to some degree, but it still feels like
8406640	8411520	it still feels like politicians are going to politician. Yeah, they definitely play their
8411520	8416240	games. That is true. There's probably always going to be that meta narrative over like
8416240	8420880	governance that just develops as like, you have to form relationships and play games to
8420880	8424880	like get legislation passed and everything. The only, the only reason why I don't like it when
8424880	8429280	people attack institutions is because one, institutions are incredibly important, arguably
8429280	8434080	paramount. No, they are to keeping society running. And two, I think sometimes when we shift the
8434080	8438480	blame onto institutions too much, I think that we lose sight of what the real problems are.
8438480	8442640	So for instance, in the United States today, people might be very critical of the government not
8442640	8447120	getting much done, but then everybody turns their eyes to the government for being ineffective.
8447120	8451360	What I would argue is I would say the government is actually incredibly effective and it's
8451360	8455680	showcasing the will of the American people really well right now, which is we are historically
8455680	8460160	more divided than we have ever been. And if I were to just look at the people and I would say
8460160	8465040	we have a historic divide that is getting like rapidly blown apart by things like the internet
8465040	8468560	and the media, right? If that exists, well, what would I expect that government to look like?
8468560	8471440	I wouldn't expect the government to be governing very effective. I would expect that government
8471440	8476720	to show that legitimate divide in people. Do you think that divide, we have a perception of a
8476720	8482160	large divide between left and right. Do you think that's a real divide that's in this country?
8482160	8487520	Narrow the language. What do you mean by real divide? Do you think there is that divide in
8487520	8491520	ideology, that there's a large number of people that believe a certain set of policies and the
8491520	8496320	different set of policies? Or is it just the perception on Twitter? No, I think there is a
8496320	8499600	large divide in terms of belief. I don't think there's very much divide between any people
8499600	8503840	in terms of like what they like on the most fundamental levels want in terms of like human
8503840	8508000	beings. But in terms of like Democrat versus Republican right now, I think there is a huge
8508000	8511520	divide in terms of the direction they want to see the country go and what they believe
8511520	8514720	really and what they even believe is reality, right? Unfortunately, that's who we've gotten to.
8515840	8519520	Can I just speak about the mechanism of the left and right here, maybe on the
8519520	8525440	memetic-roverly aspect? Is there some aspect to the left on which you're a part of that attacks
8525440	8532080	their own for ideological impurity more than the right does? Is it the bigotry of small differences?
8532640	8538560	There's a concept where when you're near somebody who is very slightly different than you,
8538560	8542160	you want to destroy it, but when you're with somebody that's way different than you, you don't.
8543440	8546320	I think the left does it, but I think the right does it too. I didn't realize it until
8546320	8549920	I started dipping more into conservative communities, but oh my god, the people from the
8549920	8554960	Daily Wire and the people from Turning Point and the America First, all these different groups
8554960	8559040	of people hate each other and they fight each other so much. They hire and fire sometimes,
8559040	8563120	employs, they talk smack about each other. I think there's a lot of political division between
8563120	8566320	both sides. I think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more because it's like the
8566320	8569520	internet and a lot of the internet spaces have a lot of left-leaning people, so you see like
8569520	8574080	the crazy communists and the crazy progressives and the crazy center-left liberals and the crazy
8574080	8577680	blah blah blah, whereas a lot of the right-leaning people have kind of been pushed off of the main
8577680	8582960	areas of the internet now. Interesting. My sense was that it's hard to exist on the center-left,
8583760	8588800	but maybe because I just don't have the full spectrum view of the political divide. It felt
8588800	8592720	like center-left is a difficult position to occupy. Yeah, I would definitely say so, yeah.
8592720	8597120	I don't know if it's that difficult to be center-right. It's very difficult to be center-right.
8597120	8601040	I think actually maybe even more difficult, because a center-right person might be somebody
8601040	8606960	who's like conservative, but not a fan of Trump and you're like over, like looking like Liz Cheney,
8606960	8610160	right? You've had politicians that are just like, they didn't back the Trump stuff and now they're
8610160	8613760	gone, or you might be like center-right, but like you don't think the election was stolen
8613760	8617280	and now you're like half the Republican party is looking at you like you're crazy, you know?
8618240	8624400	That's true. That's true. I think there's a Ben Shapiro I'm talking with. I think he publicly
8624400	8628400	spoke against Trump, right? He did initially, but I feel like he softened his language up on
8628400	8632640	him pretty significantly, but... So there's a significant pressure to kind of count how to
8632640	8636160	a certain kind of messaging. Which the whole Republican party is feeling right now. Geez,
8636320	8638320	that two years from now, that election is going to be insane.
8639200	8642880	It's just hard. Okay. So to generalize, it's hard to be in the center, it feels like.
8642880	8643440	For sure.
8643440	8650800	To center and then like do like a random walk among the policies around that. I don't know
8650800	8657360	what that mechanism is. I mean, it makes people like me not feel good being in the center. It
8657360	8664160	seems like people are just not nice to people in the center. Like the public, the Twitter machine
8664160	8669360	is not nice to people who are open-minded in the center. Is there some truth to that?
8669360	8673360	Two reasons for that. One is because I think a lot of people that market themselves as center
8673360	8678800	are legitimately spineless cowards and deserve to be called out. I've never killed the man,
8678800	8686080	but today might be my first. Oh no. Like I told you, I'll take over your stream with the AI.
8686080	8688880	Yeah, we'll see. Is that guy going to be streaming in the background?
8688880	8696400	Hey fellas. Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Lots of gotchas, lots of gotchas. Okay, gotcha.
8696400	8702560	And decrease them up, which already is a pretty low level of emotion. Just decrease it completely.
8702560	8707200	When people are screaming at you and accusing stuff, just remain calm.
8707200	8709680	Absolutely. Emotionless. The gaslighter strategy.
8710640	8716240	Okay, so what we're talking about. So I don't. I don't even, I don't ever identify a center
8716240	8718400	anything because it's got such a bad reputation because so many.
8718400	8724080	Fuck that. I stand center with a spine. It's called being open-minded and it's not
8724080	8728080	center left and right, those are just labels. Here's a really good quote my mom said to me
8728080	8732000	when I was really young. She said, Stevie, don't ever let your mind be so open that your brain
8732000	8735520	falls out. And that's what I find that a lot of center people do. That's not what she told me
8735520	8742720	last night. Why are you like this? I'm sorry. Okay, I'm glad I can, glad I can bring that. I'm glad
8742720	8745920	you feel like this is safe space. Like I said, people, not judgmental. If you want to talk about
8745920	8749120	fucking my mom, you know what? You're totally within your rights. I didn't say that. You said
8749120	8752720	that. I didn't say that. I support that. She's a beautiful woman. Her husband probably wouldn't
8752720	8757680	be too happy about it, but you know, I didn't say those any sexual relations. It was just that
8757680	8762480	having a conversation with her, you projected that that says more by you than me. Anyway,
8762480	8769280	go ahead about spineless center. There is some aspect to that, which is like amorphous. To me,
8769280	8776240	center means you think freely about each individual policy without being stuck to a king.
8776240	8779520	Some ideal, yeah, but a lot of people don't do that. They call them so centrist, but then they
8779520	8783440	just, they're anti-establishment essentially on everything. I don't know your position on
8783440	8787600	like the vaccines or anything, but like, I've met a lot of like free and open thinkers who are like,
8787600	8791920	you know what? I'm open to everything and it's an experimental vaccine and I'm going to eat hydroxy
8791920	8795600	chloroquine and ivermectin because that's what the institutions are telling me not to take. And I
8795600	8799920	think Fauci got too much money from that company and these are, but I'm an open thinker. And they,
8799920	8804400	what open thinker becomes- I'm an MIT. What do you think my position of vaccines is exactly?
8804400	8807120	I hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people. Okay. You might be from MIT,
8807120	8810080	but I know you're from the internet. Okay. And people from the internet are weird and crazy.
8810080	8818400	So yeah. Well, I- Who knows? I don't like arrogance. And I have criticized scientists during COVID,
8818400	8822720	a lot of people, but scientists included having arrogance. Which is fair. But- And that's, and I
8822720	8828400	think there's a lot of good criticism to be made of different scientific and medical establishments
8828400	8834160	over a lot of stuff. But nobody can make those good criticisms because they're too like obsessed
8834160	8838880	over like just trying to have the anti-establishment answer. And that is what is upsetting me the most.
8838880	8844640	Like I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handled
8844640	8848480	the coronavirus. You know, were lockdowns effective? Was there enough data to support the
8848480	8854240	huge measures we took? You know, why didn't we have the option to show I was infected a month ago?
8854240	8857040	Why do I need to be vaccinated? Why did, why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United
8857040	8861760	States? I don't think it was. There are really good questions to be asked there. But all the people
8861760	8865520	asking the questions are also trying to tell you that ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the
8865520	8869040	way to go for everything. And the vaccine is evil. And they're just going to turn you gay like the
8869040	8874080	frogs. And it's like, Jesus, like you get, there's like no place to reasonably criticize from
8874080	8878160	because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or, you know,
8878240	8881600	they're not reading studies or do anything. They're saying like, I do my own research, which means
8881600	8884960	they listen to whatever the last guy on Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion 100%.
8884960	8889040	Easy no. Easy no, gross. The last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan. Okay. That Robert Malone
8889040	8893280	guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. That's one guest. People see him as like the father of
8893280	8898960	mRNA technology. He published one paper. Okay. What do you mean people? Which people think that?
8898960	8902080	Joe Rogan fans. I get like, I run into these people. I start arguing with people and they
8902080	8906400	start studying me. But what about- I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine.
8906400	8908480	That's good. I'm glad you do. But there's definitely-
8908480	8912960	Sorry, but you said there's a type. There's a type. What's the type of Joe Rogan fan?
8912960	8918240	Anti-establishment. I think that's not Joe Rogan. That's a general public discourse. There's a
8918240	8924960	default anti-establishment on the right and the left. That's the default easy thing to go to.
8924960	8928160	I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though.
8928160	8932480	Like I could guess the Joe Rogan fan. Like if I were to do general population versus Joe
8932560	8934720	Rogan fan, who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine?
8935520	8937920	Do you have data on this? Are you just guessing?
8937920	8941600	Just guessing. Yeah. I think you are actually judging.
8941600	8944400	I am. Yeah. I think you're judging. Because I think you're also-
8946320	8950400	The beautiful thing about podcasting, this could be similar to streaming, is there's a large
8950400	8955440	number of people that just listen. Like what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan?
8955440	8959280	I don't think you just listen. I think people listen and absorb the information.
8959280	8964480	I would say that Joe Rogan fan base is as divided in the vaccine as the general public.
8964480	8968000	Gotcha. Man, I'm going to look for polling data on that. I'm sure somebody's got to have done it
8968000	8973120	out there. But you're basically revealing the fact they have no data. You're using your own judgment.
8973120	8977600	For sure. Based on how he's had conversations about his experience with the coronavirus,
8977600	8981120	and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like
8981120	8984640	anti-vax talking points and been completely unchallenged. And then based on statements
8984640	8987840	he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well. Yeah.
8987920	8990720	So that it's the level of challenge or not that he's doing.
8990720	8993920	Well, yeah. And then what his true positions are. And then the types of guests he typically
8993920	8996000	chooses to bring on to talk about the vaccines. Yeah.
8996000	9002560	Okay. But that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine.
9002560	9007440	I mean, I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people.
9007440	9011920	They seem to- All the coronavirus, that whole one or two years broke. A lot of people.
9011920	9016960	Because there's a lot of emotion and their emotion quickly solidified into an opinion
9016960	9022720	that almost had nothing to do with like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on.
9022720	9026480	You just made up your mind. Yeah. But I think a lot of it comes from that anti-establishment
9026480	9032960	place. Like the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment. It was a huge private company
9032960	9039920	backed by a huge public government. And there's Fauci, and there's Biden, and there's Pfizer,
9039920	9043200	and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing.
9043280	9048720	Like the vaccine was like the ultimate submission tool to show you that the government owns you.
9048720	9052320	Not only do you have to get injected once, it's a series. And then you got to get boosters,
9052320	9054960	and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb, and that's the control.
9055680	9058320	I feel like that vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like,
9058320	9061440	do you support, are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government
9061440	9065120	tells the sheep to take? Or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd
9065120	9068640	and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the
9068640	9072960	evil Fauci medicine jab them in the arm? And the funny thing is the crowd that stands
9073040	9079360	against the institution is now larger than the crowd of sheep. There's like one sheep standing
9079360	9084960	there. Sure. Or it feels that way sometimes. One vaccinated sheep. Well, okay. What's the
9084960	9089760	defense of institutions? How do you regain the trust of institutions? Like, for first of all,
9089760	9096640	do you think that there's ways in which WHO, CDC failed? And do you think there's criticism
9096640	9101360	towards Pfizer and the big pharma companies that's deserved? Damn, there's the pharma companies,
9101360	9107360	I'm not sure. For CDC and WHO, so here's a criticism that I have of all of academia and I
9107360	9113120	feel it's stronger, stronger every day. I don't think it's enough to be a researcher or to be
9113120	9121760	correct about issues. Academia needs to increase its ability to communicate. It is just an unbelievable,
9121760	9127600	unmitigated failure that academics are unwilling to wade into the complicated topics
9128240	9132640	that exist today because other people are, you know? First, you call me spineless and then you
9132640	9136320	call me a bad communicator. But no, look, you're here, you're doing it. So you get props from me,
9136320	9141200	okay? Good job. That motherfu- But there are like so many, but I'm sure you've, I'm sure that you
9141200	9148080	must have heard another fellow academic, a fellow colleague express some amount of frustration about
9148080	9152320	like in their specific discipline, they know something to be true and they know that like,
9152320	9155600	a lot of the messaging is like wrong or bad and the public about it, but they're never going to
9155600	9158960	step out and say anything because either one, they're very measured and careful with their
9158960	9163120	take, which they feel is incompatible with what people want to hear or two, they're really worried
9163120	9166400	that they might be incorrect. So they're going to be cautious while everybody else is going out in
9166400	9170480	like hardcore. And they also don't have the support of institutions for them to go out on a limb.
9170480	9175760	Yeah, that too. So like to take risks. For example, I've heard that with lab leak theory.
9175760	9180640	I've had a lot of biologists, virologist friends that are like, yeah, it's obviously leaked from
9180720	9187120	lab early on. Oh, maybe. Okay. We can fight over this one. But sorry, go ahead. We can fight over
9187120	9193040	this. But like they, okay, I should sort of back step and say like, that's like, you talk about
9193040	9196720	shooting the shit you haven't really investigated, but it's your gut. Like, this doesn't make any
9196720	9202400	sense. There would never say that publicly. Of course. Mostly because you're saying like what
9202400	9206720	they would all say is like, we want to see data. Yeah, which would be good, which is fine. So
9206720	9211360	they're going with like, this is too many coincidence in the same place. That's the logic,
9211360	9214720	but they don't want to say anything because there's no data. You need to have evidence.
9214720	9219440	You need to have actual evidence to say one way or the other. There's that. But there's also just
9219440	9224240	like you said, I mean, effective, effective communication. You're a fan of Sean Carroll.
9224240	9229360	Oh, yes. He's like one of the only people in this whole planet that I like besides you. I love
9229360	9235520	Sean Carroll. Anytime Sean Carroll is brought up as evidenced, there's a smile that comes over your
9235520	9240480	face. I love it. Of like joy. Yeah. Of like a little kid thinking about Santa Claus. Okay,
9240480	9247200	I love Sean Carroll too. I love Sean Carroll because I hate this divide between like you're
9247200	9250800	either STEM or you're like philosophy, arts and all that other stuff. And the two worlds kind of
9250800	9254880	across. And I love that it was so good at physics, but like explorers and pays attention to all of
9254880	9259440	the like sociological stuff too. It's so rare to find that quality in a person. He's legit. One of
9259440	9262880	the really, really, really specialized, but you don't have to be a Sean Carroll. You can be just
9262960	9268560	a little better at educating. Another person in the medical and the health space is somebody
9268560	9274000	named Andrew Huberman, a friend of mine from Stanford. He's an incredible educator. There's
9274000	9279360	the kind of process and science they usually call like review or survey papers where you basically
9279920	9285440	summarize all that's going on, integrate it and like draw wisdom from it and also project like
9285440	9289840	where's the discipline headed. And Andrew does that basically on all these subcomponents of
9289840	9294800	the different stuff going on in neuroscience and biology and neurobiology, all of that. He's able
9294800	9300800	to, he does a podcast called Huberman Lab where he just summarizes all and is able to explain
9300800	9306000	like what does that actually mean for your, for your life in terms of protocols of how to make
9306000	9310480	your life better. I feel like people should be able to do that more and more, but with viral,
9310480	9317120	virology and boy, that's a tricky one. That's a really tricky one. I wish that people could have
9317120	9321040	honest conversations. Like I attack a lot of people that do the lab leak theory stuff, but
9321040	9325120	truly we should be able to have that conversation publicly. It just, it always feels like the
9325120	9328000	people that are having the conversation don't ever really want to have the conversation. They're
9328000	9334240	not being honest. Like I'm a guy that like does his own research and it's so boring reading studies
9334240	9339680	and a lot of it, I can only do abstracts and like, it's so much work, but I'll never ever say that
9339680	9343120	about myself. I'm a guy that does his own research because every time I hear somebody say that,
9343120	9345920	they don't do any research. When they say they do their own research where they mean is they've
9345920	9349600	seen one podcast and their opinion on his computer podcast is that definitely not mine
9349600	9353680	because it was mine. I wouldn't be criticizing anything they say. But yeah, so like lab leak
9353680	9357520	is another one where it's like, well, how do you know it's lab leak? How do I know it's lab leak?
9357520	9361760	Because Fauci lied and Hunter Biden laptop and it's like, okay, come on, you haven't engaged with
9361760	9365840	it at all. There's really interesting research that shows us a really strong study that shows
9365840	9370800	that there's like a high degree of certainty that it came from the wet markets, very, very high
9370800	9374080	degree of certainty. And there was an article that came out recently where it's like, Senate
9374080	9380000	concludes that virus actually came from the Wuhan virology lab or whatever. And that whole article,
9380000	9382720	if you actually read it, it never says that in the article. I don't know why they tweeted it
9382720	9388480	with that headline. But yeah, to back up, I'm sorry, I think we should have good, you should be
9388480	9393520	sorry. Yeah, I'm not sorry, actually, I get to ramble here. Okay, I'm here for a long time. I
9393520	9398800	rescind my apology. Okay, I actually rescind my apology. We should be able to have challenging
9398800	9402640	conversations about things, but you gotta man, be well read on both sides, not this like, I do
9402640	9405920	my own research. So I don't believe anything that Fauci says, like, come on, dude, do you think
9405920	9410320	you can do better than that? Not you personally, but gotcha. How does that feel?
9412320	9418880	So for people who don't know, that's the catchphrase. Gotcha. Through all tragedy and triumph,
9418880	9425920	through all the roller coaster of life, your response to it is gotcha. It's election. Let me
9425920	9433920	jump to that before I continue with political discourse. Psychologically, you are in a lot
9433920	9439040	of heated debates. And you're usually super calm under fire until you're not. Sometimes you lose
9439040	9444160	your temper completely. Very rarely. But that's like your opinion, man. Let me ask you about
9444160	9447760	your psychology. What are psychologically your strengths and weaknesses that you're
9447760	9452480	self aware about? I think I'm very non judgmental. So I can entertain a lot of different thoughts
9452480	9456320	without agreeing with them or condoning them. I think that's a really big benefit to me.
9457440	9463520	For whatever reason, I seem to be like pretty calm and dealing with annoying people. It's why
9463520	9467120	I got promoted at the casino so fast, I could deal with like drunks or whatever, like it just didn't
9467120	9473120	affect me that much. What percent of the population is annoying? Depends on how you're engaging with
9473120	9476080	them. Most people aren't really annoying ever. That's why I mean that. But if you're doing like
9476080	9480400	political debate, what percentage is annoying? I guess it depends on who I'm debating and what
9480400	9485200	the topic is. I guess I'm trying to point out the fact that sometimes you can say
9486640	9490000	that reveals something about you if you think a large percent of people are annoying.
9490000	9493760	Well, I would say working graveyard shift when alcohol is involved, that percentage of people
9493760	9498400	goes very, very, very high. Or to be more fair, actually, it's not a high percentage truly.
9498400	9502880	But if you're a server, one bad customer can ruin the rest of your shift. So you only need like
9502880	9507200	one or two people acting in that manner to just like totally throw you off. And you're able to,
9507760	9512720	at least these days, not allow that one customer to throw you off, quote unquote.
9512720	9517920	Yeah, very much like a, I noticed this especially after having a son, there's something about like
9517920	9521120	six year old kids or whatever, where it's like, if they get mad, they're never going to be mad
9521120	9524640	for that long. Like they'll move on. Like that's my mentality. I'm like a six year old kid. Like
9524640	9526800	I might be mad about something, but I'll get over it in like 30 minutes or an hour.
9528480	9531600	I'm pretty good about not carrying that through. It's very rare that I'll like hold a grudge
9531600	9536240	against anybody or like be angry about something or really disaffected by something over the
9536240	9540400	long term that almost never happens to me. What are your weaknesses psychologically,
9540400	9545120	would you say? I still have a problem with projecting. I think we all probably do,
9545120	9548480	but like my mind onto others, it's like, if I understand this and I've said this,
9548480	9552400	you should understand it. And if you're not, you're dumb. That's like an issue that I,
9552400	9556640	I still have that where I project too much. What about like holding grudges and stuff like that?
9556640	9560160	I'd never hold grudges. I'm like the least grudgy person ever. It's kind of a meme in my
9560160	9564000	community because anybody can always like come back as long as they're acting different. Yeah.
9564080	9567120	What about the, as long as they're acting different?
9567120	9568880	As long as they're acting different. I mean, all right.
9568880	9572880	The reason why I say that is because so friends, nobody likes this, but I have a strong stance
9572880	9576560	on apologies and then I hate them. I don't ever want to hear an apology. I don't care about them
9576560	9580400	ever. They don't mean anything to me. If you did something bad, as long as you've like fixed the
9580400	9583120	behavior and you're not doing that thing, then we're generally chill. It's like there's been a
9583120	9585920	lot of people that have been involved in weird stuff with me, but then like they, they go off,
9585920	9588800	they do the thing and they come back and it's like, okay, cool. As long as you don't do it again,
9588800	9595280	like we're fine. Like it's all good. I'm sorry. You feel that way. It's not your fault, Steven.
9595280	9600720	It's not your fault. Okay. Gotcha. You said plenty of negative stuff, positive stuff and
9600720	9606160	negative stuff about Hassan. Yeah. This is my podcast. I get to get you to force you to say
9606160	9611440	positive things. What do you love? I'm all about love. Let's go back to grilling me on the R word
9611440	9614800	stuff. You're going to make me compliment Hassan. This is going to be a harder conversation than
9614800	9622480	that. All right. We're going to get you to feel emotions. Okay. For people who don't know,
9622480	9628800	he's another popular political streamer. I think you had, as the kids call it, a bridge burning
9628800	9634720	over Bernie Sanders. I don't know. My research is very limited on this, but what do you respect
9634720	9640400	and love most about Hassan? He puts in a lot of work when he was like growing his stream from
9640400	9644720	2,000 concrete viewers to 15,000. He was streaming like, it was like 12 hours a day,
9644720	9650240	like every single day. So that was, I remember I did a lot of work. He does seem to be pretty good
9650240	9654160	at networking and socializing and making the correct friends and connections to continue
9654160	9657680	to build his business. What about him as a political thinker? I know you don't think
9657680	9664640	I leave him in that regard, but I think that's unfair. I honestly want to push back on that because
9665600	9670240	I have zero respect for him as a political thinker. There's not going to be almost anything.
9670240	9677040	So I will say, I admire the fact that through no actual capability or ability of his own,
9677040	9680240	he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers just because he's towing the line.
9680800	9684400	Good job for him on that. He's got a lot of correct opinions, just he has no idea why.
9684960	9688640	I think that's undeserved. I think that's too harsh, man. The reason I bring that up,
9688720	9695200	because I feel like there is a deep grudge in there somehow. So you're the father now,
9695200	9701120	so since you're so old, the grandfather of the political debate on stream,
9701120	9706240	on live stream political debater. So there could be some grudge about that
9706960	9712400	split that happened or not enough credit given all that kind of stuff. I just think he's somebody
9712400	9718320	that has a left-leaning ideology that's different than yours. He was a Bernie supporter,
9718640	9722880	and I guess you were not. Can you explain to me where the division is?
9722880	9728960	He exemplifies everything that I absolutely hate about politics, which is shallow engagement,
9729680	9733440	heavily ideologically driven, and you're not ideologically different.
9733440	9738320	Absolutely not. That's what we're talking about, like the free thinker in the real
9738320	9745120	meaning of that word. Let me qualify what I mean when I say that. I spent a lot of time,
9745120	9748880	unfortunate time, delving into the boring world of philosophy. I spent a lot of time
9748880	9754720	thinking about what are my ethical positions? How do I feel about myself, the people around me,
9754720	9757920	and how that relates to the world around me? And then from all of these positions,
9757920	9761840	I think you might have used the phrase first principles earlier. From these kind of first
9761840	9767360	principles, out of that is where all of my political positions are built out of, like full stop. So
9767360	9771200	if you ask me a question, how do you feel about the right to own a firearm, or how do you feel
9771200	9775520	about social health care? We can walk through, well, this is how I feel about it is like a
9775520	9779520	thing from the government. This is where the government gets its power. This is ethically how
9779520	9783040	groups of people are supposed to function. This is morally how we relate to each other. And
9783040	9786320	personally, this is how I feel. I'll be able to do every single political belief back there.
9786320	9791200	It's not like I'm telling you, if I were to ask Hassan, what do you feel about this political
9791200	9794320	topic, he's going to tell me what progressives are supposed to say. I don't know what he thinks
9794320	9797440	about it. I don't know if he thinks so. Don't you think that's a cynical take? Why is he,
9797440	9802720	just because his views coincide with the mainstream narrative, mainstream viewpoints
9802720	9808400	of progressive thinkers? I mean, why does that mean he's not thinking? Because his engagement with
9808400	9814160	every subject is incredibly shallow, 100% predictable. Like I could write like a, I could
9814160	9817840	probably program a script to like give you every single potential answer you could have to any
9817840	9821760	single question you could give him. Again, I think that's pretty cynical take. Okay, it could be the
9821760	9825440	case that his brain perfectly aligns with every single mainstream. But I don't know if you know
9825440	9830080	it is perfectly aligns, because I think you're just taking a very select, just extremers do of
9830080	9836960	each other, a very select slice that represents the perfect alignment, as opposed to looking at a
9836960	9841600	person struggling with ideas and thinking through ideas, and then giving him a pass like a lot of
9841600	9848000	people, like I give you a pass on just the fact that you say a lot of crazy shit on streamed for
9848000	9853600	drama, like, which is why I don't say things for drama. That might be dramatic, but I mean,
9853600	9860480	you've evolved as a fish evolves legs, you've evolved a mechanism which creates controversy.
9860480	9866080	Sure. You could say it's not intention, but it happens. I think the extremists kind of learn
9866080	9871680	that kind of thing. And so I'm sure Hassan does the same kind of stuff. And so like underneath it,
9871680	9876800	there's still thinking being that's contending with political ideas. You don't think so.
9876800	9880640	He does a really good job at hiding it. There are other political figures that I really don't
9880640	9883520	like that I wouldn't say the same thing about. So like, I don't know if you have Vosch written in
9883520	9888560	there. Like, okay, that's a person that he also split out of my community and grew up to something
9888560	9891760	and now he hates me and he's an anti fan community and they all have him. Okay, tell me something
9891760	9895680	you love about Vosch. I can tell you a lot of things about Vosch. I think Vosch legitimately
9895680	9900800	thinks through a lot of his political positions. I admire or did admire that he has like his own
9900800	9904800	like positions that we take sometimes contrary to people further left than him. He's got some
9904800	9908560	positions that don't fit his ideology kind of at all, like he's his own independent thinker.
9908560	9913040	Rhetorically, he's very effective. He was willing to sit down and do research for like his debates
9913040	9917120	and everything. He would spend a lot of time practicing like his rhetorical effectiveness
9917120	9921360	and navigating conversations. He intentionally and purposefully built like a community that
9921360	9926800	exemplified his values. Yeah, I've got a lot. I don't, we are completely split and hate each other
9926800	9931440	now, but like I have a lot. Why? Why? Why? First of all, hate is a strong, why the hate?
9931440	9935120	Okay, I don't hate him, but he hates me because we had a couple of really big debates.
9935120	9938880	What happened? Well, one had to do with whether or not you should live your values.
9938880	9942640	And can you give me the story that's a charitable interpretation? I always
9942640	9946160	give charitable interpretation. You don't. I absolutely do. You don't. Wait,
9946160	9949440	name one time it happened. Five minutes ago, you talking about Hassan.
9949440	9952800	Everything I said about Hassan is true. There is no steel man there. Okay. That's not charitable.
9953920	9957760	That's, I'm sorry. If you can, if you can prove me wrong, I would love for you to do it. Okay.
9957760	9964080	I'm using my gut instinct. Usually when somebody feels strongly about another person in that way,
9964080	9969040	it's not coming from a place of data and reason. It's coming from a place of emotion.
9969040	9973040	It's coming from a place of resentment and grudge and all that kind of stuff.
9973040	9976800	Yeah, I understand. There's deep, there's emotions deep in there. So the gacha is hiding,
9977760	9983680	the gacha is a surface of an iceberg and there's a deep ocean underneath that you yourself have
9983680	9985840	not explored. I disagree, but I understand why-
9985840	9991680	And Lav is actually a doorway. The young Lav is a doorway for you to explore the depths of-
9991680	9994240	Get into that ocean to find my fish, my pre-vol form.
9995280	9999040	I understand why you think the way you do and you should, you shouldn't believe me and I understand
9999040	10002000	that because if somebody told me the same thing, I think you probably just really don't like this
10002000	10005920	person for a reason or two. I understand what you think that way. Okay. The reality is though,
10005920	10009440	for any political person that I disagree with, like I can give them a fair shake. It's one of the
10009440	10013520	few things I think I do exceedingly well on my stream. Even with Hassan, there's been drama that
10013520	10017680	he's been involved in and I've like very, when I'm involved in drama, he'll always throw me out of
10017680	10020480	the bus, but when he's involved in stuff, I'll always say like, oh, like I think Hassan was
10020480	10025600	right here or I think that he meant this. There was a thing that came up once we're on
10025600	10029600	live stream fail. He was getting roasted because he referred to somebody, he used the expression
10029600	10035760	shit skin to refer to somebody's like the way they looked. And I have only ever heard that in
10035760	10040400	the context of 4chan people talking about like Indians or like black people. Like it's a racial
10040400	10045760	thing, but I could tell the context and everything that he was saying. He was insulting some guy.
10045760	10048800	I think it was kind of like incel virgin or whatever. He was going for like acne skin.
10048880	10051280	I think that's what he meant when he said it. And there were a whole bunch of people that were
10051280	10053920	insulting like, oh my God, did he just say racist term? And I was like, no, I don't think he was
10053920	10057760	racist. I think he was like, he was just reaching for words. And that's what came out. So like that's
10057760	10063040	an example of me being charitable. Okay, but didn't you criticize him for something? I was trying to,
10063040	10066720	I like Googled why the hell you guys split out because I thought you're friends or you should be
10066720	10070320	like, it's a little bit more common Harris video, but go ahead. Is that why is that the
10071520	10076960	I feel like you criticize them over something. And I'm okay, this is very vague memory, but
10077040	10080800	you criticize them over something. And I felt that criticism wasn't charitable.
10080800	10083920	Was it Pete Buttigieg stuff? Yeah, Pete Buttigieg. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
10083920	10088240	Yeah. So I've said this a million times, but there's no amount of context or no amount of nuances
10088240	10092720	is ever accessible to people. I don't think Hassan is homophobic, but I think the comments
10092720	10097680	made about Pete Buttigieg were really homophobic. That's what he said. Yeah. And there were a lot
10097680	10103200	of people making a lot of comments that made me really uncomfortable about Pete Buttigieg.
10103200	10106960	That was insane to me. Spurred by the comments of Hassan?
10107600	10112400	No, but it was an environment of progressives. All the progressives were attacking Pete,
10112400	10118240	and I felt like his gayness became like the subject. Yeah, but why, why throw Hassan under
10118240	10122560	the bus for that? He was jumping along with all of those types of like insults. You don't think
10122560	10126080	you've done the same kind of stuff? If I do, call me on it and I'll probably say I shouldn't have.
10126080	10129120	That's what the R word was about. That's a good call out.
10129280	10132880	But like your friend, like you should privately tell him, right? Well, no,
10132880	10137200	by then we were sworn enemies. So that wasn't the reason. No, no, no. It was over a Kamala Harris
10137200	10142000	video. Sworn enemies. He hates me. What am I supposed to, listen, for all of these people,
10142000	10144880	I will accept them back into my life if they ever want to come back in at any point in time,
10144880	10147840	but usually they're the ones that would say. If they correct themselves, right?
10148640	10152640	No, I'm not expecting anybody to. So here's the deal with Vosh and Hassan. These are like the three,
10152640	10156880	we're the three guys on line. None of us will talk to each other. Hassan, because he won't give
10156880	10161440	clout to anybody and Vosh because he thinks I'm bad faith. And then neither of them will talk to me
10161440	10165760	because they both hate me. You guys should go on a camping trip together. It's like broke back
10165760	10171520	modern, but three way and just like rejoin, refine, refine the vision for each other. Honestly,
10171520	10177760	just from the internet perspective for me as a, just stepping into this world. There's some aspect
10177760	10185120	to which you have a responsibility. I hate that word. You have an opportunity. I wish you guys
10185120	10190560	would kind of be the beacon of like forgiveness and friendship and like camaraderie and that kind
10190560	10193760	of stuff. Yeah, I agree. And even if we disagree, it would be really good content for us to argue.
10193760	10199840	Shit talk, like friends shit talk versus not, like the fact that you guys don't talk to each other.
10200640	10205120	Like I would love for you to shit talk publicly with the camaraderie always there. Like there's
10205120	10209040	love in the beginning, love in the end, but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle.
10209040	10213200	And that's what live streaming is for, the political discourses. That's great political
10213200	10220400	discourse versus I think what underlines some jealousy and so on. You get this many followers.
10222240	10225280	I just want to make sure you're clear to your audience. Everybody has to your audience.
10226080	10230640	I'm sure you have flaws and I'm just not in this dynamic. Hard to find, you know, because I'm,
10230640	10236000	your only flaws, you're too modest. Yeah. So why did you guys split up? Because I would love it
10236000	10241920	honestly. Just let me just put that idea out there for you guys to make up. Yeah, it's out there,
10241920	10245840	of course, as everybody talks, me, Vash and Hasan, it's crazy that like the three largest like
10245840	10251200	political debate left leading people online, like can't do any type of content or collaboration
10251200	10255920	at all. It's so stupid. Yeah. What was the reason you guys split up? The Kamala Harris?
10255920	10261760	So Hasan's entry into kind of like the Twitch political debate world was in, I think 2018,
10261760	10266320	I think he did a debate with Charlie Kirk and he reached out to me to kind of like review that
10266320	10270720	debate to like go on, to go over it on stream. And he came on, we went over it and then we kind
10270720	10274080	of friendship developed. We hung out in real life. I think when I came to LA, I think I saw
10274080	10280000	it on his couch, we played with his dog, we were like kind of friends. And as time went on, and
10280000	10286240	then he was a little bit more, he was farther left than he led on. So like I was a social Democrat,
10286240	10290400	he was a social Democrat. But back in those days, like 2018, when people said they were a social
10290400	10293360	Democrat, they really met socialists, but they just didn't want to say it. So he was farther
10293360	10299200	left than me. And we had a lot of deep divides in our approach to politics. Whereas like I was
10299200	10303440	very much like a first principles, this is my whole political position. And he was very much kind
10303440	10306880	of like a, this is like the political ideology I'm involved in. And this is kind of like the
10306880	10311440	field that I kind of like navigate in. So there were a couple instances where these divides would
10311440	10317360	be laid very bare. One was when it was either him or the young Turks, I think it was him.
10318320	10322720	There was a shooting in a neighborhood where a very young black child gets killed by a white
10322720	10327600	shooter. And they did a video about like hate crimes and how hate crimes are on the rise
10327600	10331040	between races and white people are evil and blah, blah, blah. Not that, but like white people,
10331040	10334240	community hate crimes against black people. And I remember saying to him, I was like,
10334800	10340000	hey, we don't have all the data yet for this. It feels really bad to make videos about this
10340000	10344400	beforehand, because it's the same type of shit that happens at airports. Is there a thing going
10344400	10348480	on? Was it a brown person? Are they Muslim? It's Islamic extremism. We see this played out so many
10348480	10352480	times in recent history, probably not a good idea to jump to conclusions. And he's like, well,
10352480	10356240	no, you don't understand, like it's not that big a deal, whatever. And obviously, as the story goes,
10356320	10360720	tale as old as time, the data comes out, it was just an errant shot. There was like gang violence,
10360720	10363680	shot goes out of nowhere, hits a kid in the car. It wasn't like a hate crime. The guy was trying to
10363680	10368320	kill a kid. But yeah, we basically, we bump up against a few kind of political disagreements like
10368320	10372960	this. And an annoying thing is happening in my community where Hassan is like the serious political
10372960	10376320	figure because he's from the young Turks. And I'm just kind of like, I do politics, but I also
10376320	10380400	game. And anytime I criticize Hassan, people like destiny, you need to be more respectful. He does
10380400	10383920	this full time. If you're going to bring criticisms, you need to be like really well read and researched
10383920	10386880	because he's got a, you know, more serious, whatever, which I thought was ridiculous.
10386880	10391120	So by the way, if people don't know, he worked at the young Turks, which is
10391120	10394240	like the largest left-leaning YouTube channel probably, or at least at the time. Yeah.
10395280	10400480	So finally, he did a video on, we skip ahead to some more minor disagreements. He does a video on
10400480	10404640	Kamala Harris. It's called the Kamala Harris. And it's like seven or eight horrible things about
10404640	10408400	Kamala Harris. And I'm like, okay, I know at least one or two of these things are not fully accurate.
10408400	10411920	So I'm going to do all the research. I'm going to have all the sources and we're going to have a
10411920	10415600	long conversation about it so that now when I provide criticism to him, it's not going to be
10415600	10419680	like this horrible, like just me saying something flippantly or whatever, it's going to be like
10419680	10427120	substantial criticism. So I was on a plane ride, JFK to Orlando, whatever, flying to Sweden to visit
10427120	10432240	my wife. And on the plane, I review all of the video, all the data, do all the research and I
10432240	10439440	write everything. I'm just like, okay, I get to my, my wife's dad's house and I'm at the table,
10439440	10443840	we're having a conversation like, hey, we should talk about the Kamala Harris stuff. And he's like,
10443840	10449920	okay, well, let's do it. And we go over it and I'll leave to the audience to watch the video.
10449920	10453200	Enough people have said this. I feel pretty common to say this. I was pretty reasonable,
10453200	10457040	pretty measured, pretty calm the whole time. And I think he started to get increasingly irritated
10457040	10461440	that I was levying like more and more serious criticisms at like the quality of work that he
10461440	10466080	did. Probably because he felt a little bit intimidated, I think by my willingness to like
10466080	10469600	dive through political stuff, there'd been a couple of awkward blobs where like on,
10470240	10474400	there was like a show called the Raj Royale, where sometimes politics would come up and
10474400	10477440	Hassan would kind of try to explain something. And there was another person one time on the
10477440	10480240	show that made the joke was like, instead of Hassan taking 10 minutes to explain this
10480240	10484160	condesity, just come here and explain it in 30 seconds. And he like exploded that he got so
10484160	10488640	fucking mad at that. So yeah, I think that when I made that kind of call out or critique of him
10488640	10492240	over the Kamala Harris stuff, he's probably feeling like increasingly irritated, threatened,
10492240	10495920	agitated. And then that's kind of what began the huge split from ours.
10495920	10499200	So you don't think you were a dick at all? I don't think so in that conversation,
10499920	10505920	especially given that like, at that point, because this is still 2018 or 20, this might be 2019,
10505920	10510960	I'm still known at that point as being very aggressive towards conservatives or all writers.
10511840	10515680	Yeah. So and with lefties is what I call them. I think I'm being like very gentle,
10515680	10519440	like my conversation with conservatives is like, you're so dumb. Like that's how I'm
10519920	10522720	like doing it. So like with him, I'm like, well, don't you think that like this is like a little
10522720	10526640	bit of like an inconsistent presentation of how like I feel gonna be nice. But I always leave
10526640	10530720	to the audience so they can go and watch that Kamala Harris video, Destiny Hassan, if they
10530720	10533680	think that I was being a dick or not. But a lot of people watch and said I was being pretty gentle.
10533680	10540320	Well, let me say as a new fan of this space, I hope you guys make up and I hope you guys fight it
10540320	10545280	out in the space of discourse and ideas. Me too. And also with empathy, understanding what the
10545280	10550320	strength of the other person is, what their buttons are. And, you know, there's like an
10550320	10555600	unspoken rule that you don't press the buttons that you don't need to, unless you're doing it
10555600	10560160	mutually and it's fun because, you know, it's fun to piece each other off. So that's kind of
10560160	10564720	like what friends do. You don't cross a certain line. But then other than that, you fight it out.
10565280	10571440	Okay, let's step back. One other super interesting aspect of your worldview is your big supporter
10572000	10577280	of Biden. Can you explain what you love about Biden? Do you love Biden more than Sean Carroll
10577280	10583760	or less? Sean Carroll is just like in another world of admiration. I feel like I'm culturally
10583760	10589280	appropriating you by saying gotcha now. But it's so convenient. It's an easy word. You just, I know
10589280	10593200	we're on the same wavelength. Okay, we're synchronizing. That's good. I mean, it is really
10593200	10597840	interesting because even people that support Biden usually don't say they love sort of,
10597840	10602160	they don't support it strongly, you know? Ideologically, philosophically, the reason
10602160	10606560	why I like Biden is because he's really committed to this bringing the left and right together,
10606560	10611280	which is something we so desperately need in the country. And his, you know, statements over and over
10611280	10615440	again of like, I'm not the Democrat president or the Republican president. I'm the president of
10615440	10620480	the United States. His desire to bring Republicans together to work on things like the infrastructure
10620480	10626400	bill, that's so incredibly needed. And I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for him
10626480	10630960	for trying to push through on that message. Do you think then it's unfortunate that he made
10630960	10635040	that comment about MAGA? MAGA Republicans? Yeah. I mean, I figured what the comment was,
10635040	10640720	but it's MAGA Republicans are not good people kind of there. I watched the full video and
10640720	10645280	he's right. There is this toxic aspect. And it's hard to call out because they're always going to
10645280	10648560	spend like, oh, he hits our Republicans. He's not. If you watch the quote, he's very specifically
10648560	10653040	calling out like this group of people that think that the election was fraudulent.
10653040	10656240	Is it clear? That's what he meant by... We can bring it up.
10656800	10660320	All right. This is... Oh, no. Uh-oh. Did I remember watching it on stream? It was like,
10660320	10663760	if you said it, yeah, that's bad. You can probably like YouTube MAGA Republicans Biden.
10663760	10666480	But like, it feels like it's pretty clear he's talking about the people that are like election
10666480	10674960	denying. Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA
10674960	10681920	Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.
10683120	10690080	Now I want to be very clear, very clear up front. Not every Republican,
10690080	10695760	not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces
10695760	10702320	their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.
10703440	10709360	But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated
10710240	10715680	by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.
10716480	10722480	I disagree with that, man. He didn't clearly say extremist ideology. He didn't say the
10723280	10726480	people that doubt the validity of the election. I mean, that's Donald Trump.
10727040	10730720	No, but there's... That's all the candidates that Donald Trump is supporting. How many,
10730720	10734880	what is it like, 40, 50, how many candidates right now that are MAGA candidates are election
10734960	10739440	Democrats? No, but there's 80 million or whatever people voted for Donald Trump.
10739440	10746480	You could say that's the MAGA Republicans. So to me, it sounded like he was referring to
10747360	10753440	not even the majority. I mean, that's one nice helpful clarifying statement. But basically,
10753440	10757280	there's the mainstream Republicans and then there's those that voted for Donald Trump.
10757280	10758960	That's the way I heard it. Okay.
10758960	10761520	And so maybe you should have done a better job at clarifying, but...
10762080	10767120	Yeah, I feel like there's a clear, there is a huge problem with this group of Americans.
10767120	10769280	I think the election is stolen. I feel like that's what he's trying to call.
10769280	10777680	No matter if that's what he meant, even flirting with that line is not a person who's bringing
10777680	10783040	people together. I feel like the extending a hand to the most... I've worked with Republicans in
10783040	10788560	Congress, not even a majority of Republicans are like this. No, but why say not the majority of
10788560	10796320	Republicans that like to say, we're one country. We believe the same thing. So focus on the uniting
10796320	10798960	part versus saying... Maybe he does before and after. That was 50 seconds, okay.
10800640	10805440	The point is you never say something like that. Listen, you've spoken about the Bosnian speech,
10805440	10809200	which is your favorite of his. I went back to it and listened to it.
10809200	10813360	Before I move to that, just on this, it's really hard for him to call out that group of election
10813360	10816000	deniers, I think, without it always feeling like... Well, why call them out?
10816640	10820240	Because it's arguably one of the most destructive forces that exist in this country today.
10821040	10824240	Did it destroy anything? They were trying to.
10824240	10827120	Did it though? It didn't, did it?
10827120	10829600	So does that mean we don't call it out? We wait till next time?
10829600	10836880	Because calling it out is giving fuel to the division. The people that doubted the validity
10836880	10842800	of the election, that's anger, that's frustration with the other side. You heal that as opposed to
10842800	10849040	saying all those people that believed that at any time are idiots. They're un-American.
10849040	10851840	I mean, they don't think the election was real. I don't know if Biden has the
10851840	10854080	ears of these people at all. I don't know what he can do for...
10854880	10859440	There's people that believe the same thing in 2016 with the Russian hacking, right?
10859440	10861600	There's this... Hold on. Yes.
10862400	10868880	That is a super not fair comparison. There were definitely the mainstream Democrat opinion
10868880	10875360	was that Russian intrusion in terms of social media and stuff happened, but there was never
10875360	10879760	a claim that the election was stolen. Or at least I don't know of any mainstream Democrat
10879760	10883040	that supported that. Donald Trump is not just saying there was interference and blah, blah,
10883040	10888160	blah, blah. Donald Trump is literally saying the election was literally stolen, that ballot boxes
10888160	10892640	were hidden, that vote tallies were manipulated. I think the claim is there's a huge gulf of
10892640	10896320	difference in the two. You can attack Donald Trump for that.
10897440	10903600	I believe it's not the words of a uniter to attack people that believe that.
10904960	10909840	You could argue maybe it's okay, but especially not being super clear about that,
10909840	10915840	about who you're referring to when you say MAGA Republicans, because MAGA is a hat
10916560	10924960	and a slogan that refers to whatever the number is, 70 million people who voted for Donald Trump.
10926160	10929360	Of all the Republicans that consider themselves MAGA Republicans, what percentage of them do
10929360	10935120	you think believe the election was stolen? I feel like that number is probably more than 70%.
10937040	10939600	What's a MAGA Republican? Maybe I'm not familiar...
10939600	10942240	Like a Trump supporting Republican, a MAGA Republican. They're there for Trump.
10943040	10947760	What's the difference between somebody that voted for Trump and a MAGA Republican?
10948320	10953680	My mom is a MAGA Republican. If Trump ran independently and DeSantis ran under the
10953680	10957600	Republican ticket, my mom would vote for Trump. She'll follow him to the end of the earth. That's
10957600	10962720	like a MAGA Republican. I think it's easy to mistake that distinction in these kinds of
10962720	10969120	political speeches. As to me, anybody who voted for Trump can easily in the context of the speech
10969120	10976240	be interpreted as a MAGA Republican. I understand what you're saying. Maybe you
10976240	10980560	could have been more clear, but I think in listening to that, I think it's pretty obvious who
10980560	10983680	he's talking about, but I guess if you have an emotional response to it, I can understand
10983680	10989360	the emotional response. I don't have an emotional response. I just don't like... I think I'm with
10989360	10996800	what is it? Michelle Obama, they go low, we go high. Meaning like, to me, a uniter doesn't
10996800	11001120	participate in derision. Sure, a uniter might not, but a leader has to be able to accurately
11001120	11004960	assess the situation before him and make people aware of what's going on. You mean all the
11004960	11010240	impeachment trials, all the censoring from social media, all of that didn't do the job?
11010240	11015200	That's not his job. I don't know about censoring. That mechanism, his job is to inspire a nation
11015200	11019120	to unite a nation. How can he do that when half the people don't believe that he was even legitimately
11019120	11023200	elected? I think he's done a good job at working on legislation and doing stuff that hopefully
11023280	11027040	benefits all Americans, but I think it's important to recognize that there is a contingent of
11027040	11030880	Americans that don't even believe that this is really crazy. There are plenty of people that
11030880	11035120	recognize that and are fighting that and are constantly screaming that from the rooftops.
11035120	11042800	His job is to be the inspiring figure that makes the majority of Americans be proud for him to
11042800	11050960	be a president of the nation they love. That's what the uniting aspect is. You remind people
11051040	11054800	that we are one and we love this country. We love the ideas that it represents.
11054800	11057360	He does that in other parts of that speech. It's like a 20-minute speech, isn't it?
11057360	11064640	But that's a fuck-up. You just don't participate in that division. Anyway, I understand. I just
11064640	11071920	wanted to push back on the saying one of his strengths is that he's uniting. But yes, that
11073360	11080000	is an ideal. That is a goal, is a great one, and he is one that espoused that goal for a long time.
11080000	11084400	Do you think, what else? From policy perspective and so on.
11084400	11087360	I thought the way he's handled Ukraine and everything thus far has been almost perfect.
11087360	11091440	I think he did a really good job at the political maneuvering and bringing other
11091440	11095360	countries into the fold at establishing clearly what our mission was in relation to Ukraine.
11095360	11099360	I thought he did a good job there. I admire him for pulling out of Afghanistan. Even it was a
11099360	11103120	little bit rough around the edges. We got out and we're gone. No American lives are lost.
11104880	11109360	The domestic policy, he's passed more major legislation than I think anybody thought possible.
11110080	11114480	The green energy stuff with the last bill, the infrastructure bill, a lot of the coronavirus
11114480	11117200	relief I thought was really good, especially the expansion of the child tax credit.
11118000	11121520	So from a policy perspective, foreign and domestic, I think he's been successful.
11121520	11125200	Rhetorically, I think he's generally been above board in terms of not attacking people,
11125200	11128720	being too divisive. He's trying to bring people together and work on them.
11128720	11134160	What do you think about the popular in the media criticism of his mental decline?
11134160	11136080	Do you think he's experiencing mental decline? He's an old guy.
11137040	11142000	But do you think, I mean, yeah, maybe a little bit, but he's still doing a good job.
11143200	11145600	Not from a speech perspective, you mean from a policy perspective?
11145600	11149280	Yeah, I'm analyzing it as a job. Yeah, from a speech perspective, maybe not the greatest,
11149280	11152320	but yeah, I mean, he's definitely, what is he, like 80, 81? How old is he?
11152320	11159440	I lose track after so many years. But you did say that he's probably going to run in 2024
11159440	11163040	and he's probably going to win. Did I say that? That he's probably going to win? No way did I
11163360	11167600	say that? He's probably going to run. Who knows who will win? But I think,
11167600	11170320	I feel like the incumbent advantage is so strong. You're really going to throw that away.
11170320	11173280	Like, I think it's been like one or two times in history in the US, right, where like,
11173280	11175520	the non-incumbent, the parties put somebody else up.
11176160	11182320	Yeah, I mean, the concern is like the, just the age and the mental decline, just the
11183520	11188000	wear and tear of the campaign, all of that kind of stuff, all the speech you have to make,
11188000	11190400	the debates and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I guess we'll see what happens.
11191280	11197600	What? The least excited, I mean, two years from now is a long time. And his current mental state,
11197600	11202400	yeah, he could run and do it. He could do a passable job in two years. Man, I don't know.
11202400	11206240	I've seen videos of Bill Clinton recently, he's looking pretty rough. You know,
11206240	11210480	if Biden is looking a lot more rough, worse for wearing two years, then maybe they actually
11210480	11214320	do have to dig out another person for running. Who knows?
11214320	11224400	What do you think about Trump when he won in 2016, I think is when you came to fruition,
11224400	11230080	politically speaking. So what do you think his winning the 2016 election represents?
11231280	11237840	So for me, Trump, the reason why I got into politics was Trump was like this new
11238800	11245440	epistemic force in American politics that you'd kind of have to flirt with facts before,
11245440	11250480	even if you wanted to be nonfactual. He super didn't care. Lying was like a first language to him,
11250480	11255920	just like in speaking in terms of the way that he used language to just say to you what he felt
11255920	11260560	like you needed to hear, to support him and not care at all about what is going on about,
11261360	11266400	yeah, that's what Trump represented to me in terms of things that I cared about. He also
11266400	11270080	represents a lot more, obviously, that there was this undercurrent of American opinion that a lot
11270080	11274640	of people didn't know still existed, and it did, he got elected, that the Overton window was
11274640	11278800	misidentified by even a large amount of the Republican Party, that populism was a lot more
11278800	11282880	popular than a lot of people figured, you know, yeah, there's a lot that I guess he represented.
11282880	11287600	Do you think Trump should have been banned from Twitter? Can you make the case foreign against
11287600	11292880	it? So you're a big supporter of free speech. Yeah, so the case in favor of-
11292880	11296720	Do you think he should be brought back as Elon-
11296720	11299040	Yeah, because if he gets brought back, there's a higher chance that I'll be brought back,
11299040	11302400	so I'm supporting that all the way. Thank you, Elon. Unban my account.
11303840	11308080	So because you called me weak spine, I'm gonna have to message Elon.
11308080	11310800	Okay, at Omni Destiny, it was a verified Twitter account.
11310800	11312640	Omni Destiny. No, no, I'm just kidding.
11312640	11314480	Why'd you get banned from Twitter, Destiny?
11314480	11315120	I don't know.
11315120	11320000	I'll add that to Elon. I saw that there was a screenshot of you
11320960	11323760	referring to the rape of somebody.
11323760	11326480	Okay, that was on an older Twitter account, and that was a bad tweet.
11326480	11332240	You have multiple Twitter accounts, so you're trying to go around the bands that you keep getting.
11332240	11335360	Okay, hold on. You're slandering me a lot right now, okay?
11335360	11338880	Let's get the facts straight, okay? And I don't even remember why my first time I got banned,
11338880	11342240	but it was a wild account. I tweeted some wildly inappropriate things.
11342240	11343120	You regret?
11343120	11344720	I don't like that word. I'm gonna give the answer to most people.
11344720	11346640	They're just like, I don't regret it because I learned a lot,
11346640	11348160	so I'm glad I had the bad experiences that I did.
11348160	11349440	Why don't you like the word regret?
11350080	11354720	I think if we look at where we are, how do you feel about determinism?
11357920	11360880	I believe in hard, the hardest of determinism. That's who I am.
11360880	11365360	Okay, so who I am today is the culmination of everything that's occurred in the past.
11365360	11375280	I believe you, speaking about regret is a nice way to communicate that in this deterministic
11375280	11379680	world, you've analyzed the acts of the past, and you're no longer that person.
11379760	11380800	Yeah, of course, for sure.
11380800	11383040	That's what regret usually means.
11383040	11385200	Okay, thanks for giving me the human explanation. Okay, true.
11385200	11387840	So in that sense, there's a lot of things I've done that I regret.
11387840	11390080	Oh, you're, what are you? You're not human, you're a bot.
11391200	11392320	NPC is my preferred term.
11392320	11392960	Okay, all right.
11394000	11398480	I wish I would have been smart enough at the time to not have to have had made those mistakes.
11398480	11398880	Okay.
11398880	11399600	There you go.
11399600	11400640	Good job.
11400640	11403520	But yeah, obviously really dumb, really crazy off the wall tweets,
11404240	11408640	but that account got banned, but then I made another account called,
11408640	11409920	I can't believe I'm giving you a history-made Twitter account.
11409920	11411440	So I made another account called OmniDestiny.
11411440	11412400	It's an honor.
11412400	11416080	And that was my, I got verified, I was cool, they let me have that account
11416080	11417920	because originally they banned it and I said appeal and I was like,
11417920	11418880	oh, let me have one more.
11418880	11421440	And the back then Twitter was cool and they're like, okay, go for it.
11421440	11422960	And that account lasts for a long time.
11422960	11427280	And I don't actually know 100% why that account got banned.
11428320	11433280	I believe that the tweet that showed up in the final, I got banned for hate speech.
11433280	11436320	And it was because I was, there was a picture that I tweeted
11436320	11439360	with three different alt writers that are kind of like neo-Nazi people.
11439360	11441840	And they were all like mixed race people.
11441840	11444960	And I said, like the new alt right looks like a Disney channel original movie
11444960	11446480	in terms of racial composition.
11446480	11451280	And somehow they got flagged for instigating violence against minorities, I think.
11451280	11453120	And I think that's the tweet that got me banned
11453120	11454720	because I think that's what showed up in the final report.
11454720	11456320	But I don't know, maybe there were other reasons
11456320	11459280	because nobody ever communicates, but ever since that account went under,
11459280	11460720	it's just been ban evading ever since.
11460720	11460960	So.
11462000	11464000	Oh, ban evading ever since.
11464000	11465520	So all my new accounts that have been banned just get banned
11465520	11467360	because they finally figured out it's me and then they ban evade.
11467360	11472080	There's like one dude at Twitter HQ who's like constantly looking for my new accounts
11472080	11472640	and they get me.
11472640	11473120	Yeah.
11473120	11473360	Yeah.
11474240	11474800	Anyway, yeah.
11475360	11478080	So post Trump world.
11479040	11480480	Do you think, okay, I mean this.
11480480	11481280	Oh, should he be banned?
11481280	11482720	Oh, you asked me to make both cases.
11484000	11485120	Should he be banned?
11485120	11486800	I mean, damn, dude, when you're tweeting out shit
11486800	11490640	that's arguably leading stuff like January 6th, I can understand why.
11490640	11492640	Because it's like, what else is this wild dude going to tweet out?
11492640	11494640	Like, is he going to start instigating other violent events?
11494640	11496000	So I'm sympathetic towards the like, okay.
11496000	11498240	Well, he can't just be here saying stuff like this.
11498240	11498960	That's insane.
11498960	11500000	We're going to ban him.
11500000	11500560	I'm sympathetic.
11500560	11501840	Because it's instigating.
11501840	11502800	Yeah, you're instigating.
11502800	11505440	Physical violence in the physical world.
11505440	11505600	Yeah.
11505600	11508000	Like if I would tweet stuff like that, I would get banned probably.
11508560	11511280	On the flip side, this is the president of the United States.
11511280	11515040	It seems like he's like doing presidential decree by social media sometimes.
11515040	11518640	Like is it really right that one public or private, I should say,
11518640	11523520	one private company can like erase the president of the United States words from
11523520	11526000	the eyes of a lot of Americans that are using these social media feeds.
11526880	11532000	And one big one, which I for sure am against, is the permanent ban.
11532560	11533440	Yeah, I don't like that.
11533440	11533920	I hate that.
11533920	11537440	Even in my community, if somebody comes back over like a year, like, I mean-
11537440	11539840	Did you just compare yourself to the president of the United States?
11539840	11542000	No, I compare myself to Twitter banning the president of the United States.
11542000	11542560	Let me put it this way.
11542560	11545120	If I ban Donald Trump in my chat room, I don't ban him in a year.
11546000	11546720	A year?
11546720	11547200	Yeah.
11547200	11549680	What's the process for unbanning Donald Trump?
11549680	11550880	What would he have to do?
11550880	11552320	Usually people send me an email and they're like,
11552320	11553360	listen, I did this stuff.
11553360	11554400	I'm sorry, I was dumb.
11554400	11555520	I'll give them another chance.
11555520	11557920	But a year, what if they send an email a month later?
11558480	11559600	Usually I'll unban him.
11559600	11560320	That's usually my problem.
11560320	11562160	I ban pretty quickly in my community, but if you ever ask-
11562160	11563360	You're big, softy.
11563360	11564400	Yeah, I usually let him back.
11564400	11564960	I'm very-
11564960	11567920	Well, because I used to be the worst type of internet person,
11567920	11570080	and I think I'm a little bit better than I used to be.
11570080	11570320	So-
11570320	11571280	Now that you're older.
11571280	11572640	Yeah, now that I've matured.
11572640	11573600	Yeah, of course.
11573600	11576640	Age bestows a wisdom that just can't be gotten any other way.
11576640	11577760	What's your sense in general?
11577760	11581120	Is there something interesting you could say about your view on free speech?
11581120	11584240	It seems like one of those terms, it's also overused
11584240	11585600	to mean a lot of different things.
11585600	11586800	What does it mean to you?
11586800	11589920	If you have a democratic style of governance,
11589920	11593440	you are entrusting people with one of the most awesome
11593440	11595120	and radical of responsibilities.
11595120	11597120	And that's saying that you're going to pick the people
11597120	11598720	that are going to make some of the hardest decisions
11598720	11599920	in all of human history.
11599920	11602720	If you're going to trust people to vote correctly,
11602720	11603920	you have to be able to trust them,
11603920	11605760	have open and honest dialogue with each other.
11605760	11608800	Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,
11609520	11612880	you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above
11612880	11614320	and make the correct determinations
11614320	11616080	when they hear these types of speeches.
11616080	11618720	And if you're so worried that somebody's going to hear
11618720	11619840	a certain political figure
11619840	11621920	and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly,
11621920	11624800	then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans
11624800	11626720	for democracy to be a viable institution,
11626720	11627680	which is fine.
11627680	11629040	You can be anti-democratic,
11629040	11632080	but I don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech.
11632640	11633200	Within reason.
11633840	11635360	So what's the within reason?
11635360	11635600	So-
11635600	11637920	I mean, you can't post like Child porn or something on Twitter
11638160	11639360	where people try to get you on that stuff
11639360	11641360	or like direct calls to violence or probably not.
11641360	11642080	You shouldn't be tweeting out like,
11642080	11643840	we're going to meet up tomorrow and go bomb, blah, blah, blah.
11643840	11644160	Probably not.
11644160	11649280	So do you think it's okay to allow racism and anti-Semitism and hate speech?
11650880	11654640	Hate speech, yes, because that can be very broadly defined.
11655200	11660160	I can understand there being some basic rules of like no slurs on like a platform
11660160	11662480	that gets into like acceptable forms of moderation
11662480	11665040	or like excessive harassment and bullying, I can understand.
11665680	11669760	But past that, when the moderation becomes ideological,
11669760	11672400	I get a little bit nervous because, you know, for,
11672400	11673520	there's a whole other-
11673520	11676000	Yeah, there's, of course, it's all a gray area,
11676000	11680240	but when it feels like ideology has seeped into the censorship.
11680240	11680800	Not good.
11680800	11681440	Yeah.
11681440	11683760	Which it's so fascinating to think,
11683760	11685520	especially now that Elon bought Twitter,
11685520	11692080	how do you engineer a system that prevents ideology from seeping in
11692080	11697280	and nevertheless is able to create a platform that has healthy conversations?
11697280	11700400	Because if you have one guy who's just screaming nonsense, nonstop,
11701440	11705760	it has this effect where the quiet voices at the back of the room are silenced.
11705760	11706400	Yeah.
11706400	11708880	So like that's what you usually don't talk about.
11708880	11712080	Like if you let one annoying loud person in,
11712080	11714240	that's actually censoring the voice of a lot of people
11714240	11716240	that would like to speak, but they don't get a chance.
11716240	11718800	That's one of the things, especially around like trans discourse,
11718800	11721760	I have to constantly do that like reminder for my audiences.
11721760	11724080	So like when I'm dealing with these types of people on the internet,
11724080	11725360	a lot of them might seem really crazy.
11725360	11726880	A lot of these types of people might seem insane,
11726880	11730240	but like in the real world, outside of like the crazy Twitter activist world,
11730240	11733440	like the vast majority of people you're meeting from LGBT communities
11733440	11735120	are like the coolest, normalist people.
11735120	11737520	All they want us to like write to live their life in the way they want to
11737520	11739840	and to be like unobstructed and like, yeah.
11739840	11742560	But people will get this impression of like an online activist,
11742560	11745120	like a vegan or LGBT person or whatever.
11745120	11747440	And then they think that every single person in real life is like that.
11747520	11749840	And it's a really negative stereotype.
11749840	11751600	And then even the other people in that group.
11752160	11753520	Oh, is Malina coming over?
11753520	11754720	Oh yeah, actually, I don't know if that's her.
11755280	11757280	Okay, Malina just joined us.
11757280	11758640	What were we talking about?
11758640	11759600	Was it interesting?
11759600	11763920	You were saying that you were going to talk to Elon about getting at Omni Destiny,
11763920	11765200	the verified Twitter account on band.
11765200	11766720	I said, that sounds like a lot.
11766720	11767680	That's so gracious of you.
11767680	11769520	I can't even believe you would do that for me.
11769520	11772960	And then you admitted that you tried to evade the band multiple times,
11772960	11775200	which I'm sure would be very looked upon.
11775200	11777360	You know, I heard that in Norway, in their prison system,
11777360	11779200	they don't actually punish you for trying to escape jail
11779200	11780800	because that's like the natural human thing to do.
11780800	11781440	Hug you?
11781440	11781840	What are they doing?
11781840	11783200	I don't know, but they don't punish you.
11783200	11784400	Because of course you're trying to be free.
11784400	11785520	That's all I'm trying to be on Twitter.
11785520	11786320	I'm just trying to be free.
11786320	11787600	Oh, that's the natural humanistic.
11787600	11790000	Yeah, that's the natural human course, is to ban even.
11790000	11791200	You're not a destructive force.
11791200	11792960	No, I'm a force, I'm a force for good.
11792960	11794720	That's why all my accounts only get banned for banning and banning.
11794720	11796240	I don't get banned for doing bad things.
11796240	11797360	And I'm a progressive shill.
11797360	11798640	I'm like far left.
11798640	11800720	I love like progressive causes.
11800800	11802720	This is what you criticize us on for being.
11803680	11805520	I show them from a place of first principles,
11805520	11808480	not from a mindless AI echoing kind of thing, you know.
11808480	11810720	Okay, so you're a free thinking bot.
11810720	11811840	Yeah, exactly.
11811840	11812800	All right, cool.
11812800	11814400	Well, I'm sure we'll return to some politics.
11814400	11815120	That was beautiful.
11816480	11819120	William, can you tell us about yourself?
11819120	11820720	You're also a fellow streamer.
11820720	11823920	Yes, I stream and I started streaming because I am at him,
11823920	11826640	basically, kind of, but I don't do the politics.
11826640	11829280	I do like travels or talk about relationships,
11829840	11831760	talk to my audience, basically.
11832320	11834240	You're from that part of the world, right, Sweden?
11834240	11834640	Yeah, exactly.
11834640	11836960	So did you escape from prison and they didn't?
11836960	11838000	That was Norway.
11838000	11839040	You just mentioned Norway.
11839040	11839520	That's different.
11840240	11842720	I actually really, I've been to Sweden a bunch of times.
11842720	11843520	I love it.
11843520	11846640	There's a tech sector there that's really like flourishing.
11846640	11847520	Where did you go?
11847520	11848080	Which city?
11848080	11849280	I went to Stockholm.
11849280	11850720	I think I gave a few lectures there.
11850720	11854000	There's a vibrant tech sector in school and people are super nice.
11854800	11856560	Yeah, we're friendly.
11856560	11857840	We're not like very deep.
11857920	11859600	Like we don't really have much deep conversation.
11859600	11860640	It's like a meta conversation.
11860640	11863360	Oh, there's not many intellectuals that come from Sweden.
11863360	11864960	We don't really speak very highly of ourselves.
11864960	11866800	We're kind of like just chill all the time.
11866800	11867760	We don't make a scene.
11867760	11870400	We don't, we're just like talking, you know.
11870400	11871440	Do you know what the name for that is?
11871440	11872800	There's a specific name for it.
11872800	11873680	Jantelagen.
11873680	11875680	Yeah, Jantelagen, yeah.
11875680	11877200	Oh, there's a philosophy behind it.
11877200	11878800	When you're part of like Sweden or Norway,
11878800	11880560	you don't talk too highly of yourself
11880560	11881840	because it's seen as kind of like rude.
11881840	11884160	Like think of like America as the exact opposite.
11884160	11885040	You'd even really want to like,
11885040	11886960	you don't want to make yourself into a victim too much.
11886960	11888320	You don't want to be too much of anything.
11888320	11890400	You're just like sticking to the, to the group
11890400	11892160	to make big scene about yourself.
11892880	11896080	But that said, you came here and you were,
11896080	11898560	you put yourself in front of a camera and became a streamer.
11898560	11900960	Do you understand how weird that is for my friends in Sweden?
11901840	11902000	Do you have anxiety?
11902000	11903760	I just didn't talk about myself
11903760	11906480	and just like make a big deal about myself for hours every day.
11906480	11907440	Was that like terrifying?
11907440	11908720	Did you have anxiety about that?
11908720	11909920	No, because I don't see them.
11909920	11911360	But then I come back and I'm like, ooh.
11912560	11914640	Also, what do you feel like when you're actually streaming?
11914640	11916240	You feel like you're just alone in a room?
11916960	11918000	One-on-one type thing?
11918000	11919920	No, I see, I see Chad and I'm thinking,
11919920	11920960	oh, they're like a little fairies.
11920960	11921680	They're not really real.
11921680	11922640	They're just like out there.
11922640	11923600	I don't know what they look like.
11923600	11926400	I just see little names and they're just cute and just some colors.
11926400	11928640	So you're talking to little fairies inside your head?
11928640	11929280	Yes, I do.
11929280	11930560	Is that how you feel about Chad?
11930560	11931520	They're demons for me.
11931520	11932160	They're demons?
11932160	11933360	Okay, my kind of fairies.
11934000	11936320	Are they, so is Chad a source of stress or happiness?
11936320	11937040	Like is there a...
11937040	11938800	No, for me, that's a source of happiness.
11938800	11940960	I've been very intentional with like the construction
11940960	11941600	of my community.
11941600	11942720	So I'm really happy with where it's at.
11943280	11945920	How are you able to actually have deep political discourse
11945920	11947520	while playing a video game at the same time?
11948080	11950720	I have a really good chat room in terms of like the way
11950720	11952080	that people engage in conversations.
11952080	11956000	Like I was one of the earliest people to embrace the philosophy
11956000	11959520	of like I am in total control of what people watch me think,
11959520	11962080	that like I have a high level of responsibility
11962080	11963520	for how they conduct themselves.
11963520	11965040	And that if I conduct myself in a certain way,
11965040	11966720	I can expect a certain level of conduct from them.
11966720	11968160	And for the most part, it's like worked pretty well
11968160	11970320	for the past, you know, nine or 10 years, yeah.
11970880	11972640	What about the actual playing of the game?
11972640	11975520	Like you're able to parallelize the brain like...
11976160	11979040	Like it seems like Factory seems like a super complex game.
11979040	11980400	Yeah, I don't actually think that's possible.
11980400	11982240	I don't think multitasking for human brain is possible.
11983120	11984560	If you see me playing a game,
11984560	11986880	usually what's happening is the conversation is like,
11986880	11988720	I've had it a million times, so I'm not thinking about it.
11988720	11989760	I've automated that.
11989760	11991520	Or if the conversation is very challenging,
11992160	11994160	then if you watch me, if you really watch what's happening again,
11994160	11995200	I'm probably just running around in circles
11995200	11996720	because I have to think about the conversation.
11996720	11997200	Okay.
11997200	11999680	Because with Factory, it looks like a lot of stuff is going on.
11999680	12000480	Sometimes, yeah.
12000480	12003840	So I guess it's hard for a person who hasn't played the game
12003840	12004800	to detect that you're not actually...
12004800	12007360	Is that come off as like you're super intelligent in multitasking?
12007360	12010160	Or does it come off as like he's not interested in this conversation at all?
12011200	12012480	Yeah, there's a coolness to it.
12012480	12013840	Like when you're not paying attention,
12015840	12018080	if you're looking elsewhere, like you're checking your phone,
12018080	12019440	you're too cool for this conversation.
12019440	12020240	There's a sense like that.
12020240	12020560	Yeah.
12020560	12022160	The reality is though is if you watch,
12022160	12023600	it was easier to see in Minecraft
12023600	12025520	because in Minecraft, when there was a challenging conversation,
12025520	12026240	if you watch me play,
12026240	12028080	I'm literally just running around and jumping in circles
12028080	12029920	because I have to think about the conversation 100%.
12029920	12032640	I can't do a complicated task and think about the conversation.
12032640	12034320	Or like the people will always joke in my chat,
12034320	12035840	like, oh no, the notepad came out.
12035840	12037360	If it's a really challenging conversation,
12037360	12039120	I'll get rid of the game and I'll bring out a notepad
12039120	12041200	and I'll start writing stuff down to keep track of what's going on.
12042080	12043920	So what kind of stuff do you stream?
12043920	12044880	So advice?
12044880	12045440	You talk about...
12045440	12048800	Yeah, like either I talk to chatter, I travel around, basically.
12048800	12052800	Like have a conversation or we like go to countries.
12052800	12053920	I've been to like Italy.
12053920	12056320	I was in Italy for like one and a half months,
12056320	12059360	just like traveling around the loan, going to cities,
12059360	12062960	like having like my camera with me and like streaming for hours.
12063680	12065520	Where's the coolest place you've been to?
12066080	12066800	Ever.
12066800	12068000	It's probably New Zealand.
12068000	12068560	New Zealand?
12068560	12069760	I think so.
12069760	12071440	After it is probably going to be Italy, I think.
12071440	12073200	Because I like history and...
12073200	12075600	Also both history because New Zealand is also beautiful.
12076560	12079760	So it's both natural beauty and historical beauty.
12079760	12080960	Yeah, for sure.
12080960	12083680	I think it's just really like the Polynesian sort of culture.
12083680	12084960	I think it's very interesting.
12084960	12087600	Like the ocean people and it's just really beautiful.
12087600	12088800	People are very relaxed, chill.
12088800	12091680	They're very far away, which is interesting as well.
12091680	12096560	Because whenever they talk about politics or they talk about the world,
12096560	12097600	it feels really far away.
12098400	12099520	So where's home for you?
12099520	12100400	Is Austin home?
12101520	12102000	Did you...
12102000	12102720	Home for me.
12103600	12104960	A human being is home.
12104960	12105360	Yeah.
12105360	12107680	We travel, we've lived in a lot of places and traveled around.
12107680	12110000	So that's what you think of home is like humans.
12110000	12111360	I think so, yeah.
12111920	12113680	I mean, if they're going to be a place,
12113680	12116560	it's probably going to be like my childhood places probably.
12117440	12119440	Like my old country house or something like that.
12119440	12120320	We don't have it anymore.
12120320	12123120	But that's like home for me, I guess.
12123120	12124240	So how'd you guys meet each other?
12125040	12126480	You're currently married.
12126480	12127360	Yes.
12127360	12128240	To each other, yeah.
12128240	12129040	Yeah.
12129040	12129600	To each other.
12133600	12134480	All right, cool.
12134480	12135120	How'd you guys meet?
12135760	12139760	I was watching his YouTube stuff like 2018, I think.
12139760	12141840	Like because it was the Swedish election around that time
12141840	12143040	and I was interested in politics.
12143680	12148800	And then I think he said in one of his videos that he had an Instagram
12148800	12151280	and that he needed people to stop DMing him.
12151280	12152560	That wasn't cutie pies.
12152560	12155200	And then I messaged him and said, am I a cutie pie?
12155200	12156720	And then you're pie in like two minutes.
12158000	12160400	And then that's when I was in New Zealand.
12161280	12165440	And I guess you wanted to escape America or like LA for a little bit.
12166080	12168160	And that included New Zealand.
12168160	12169520	What were you mentally there?
12170560	12172480	Because we've talked to his timeline.
12172480	12174000	Where's 2018?
12174000	12175120	Was it 18, 19?
12175760	12176720	Where was the low point?
12177360	12178480	Or is that as that was way earlier?
12178480	12179280	Low point, carbiclaning.
12179280	12181920	That was like 2009, 2010.
12181920	12182400	Oh, okay.
12182400	12183840	2018 was probably your peak.
12185200	12186400	Every day, now was my peak.
12186400	12186960	What do you mean?
12186960	12187680	That was my peak.
12187680	12188480	Why would you say that?
12188480	12191760	No, nobody ever had missed being past their prime.
12191760	12192400	Just see.
12192960	12194880	Well, I mean, my prime is still coming out.
12194880	12197120	It was probably around the time where you were getting a lot
12197120	12199920	of lefties to your community and you were really like thinking
12199920	12201280	about that they would go too far.
12201280	12201600	Maybe.
12201600	12203760	That was, I think that was still when Hasan and Vash were both
12203760	12204400	in my community.
12204400	12204880	Exactly.
12204880	12208160	So I would say it feels like there was not really like much issues
12208160	12211520	when it come to your stuff or like your work stuff back then.
12211520	12213840	Oh, something we didn't talk about is that like there were no
12213840	12214720	politics on Twitch.
12214720	12217440	I exclusively inhabited that place for like two years
12217440	12219120	because nobody else did it because it was a really toxic
12219120	12220000	environment for politics.
12220000	12223360	So for a couple of years as it grew, I kind of grew the whole
12223360	12224080	space because it wasn't.
12224080	12224800	Nobody was doing that yet.
12224800	12225680	What did that look like?
12225680	12229680	You're having like political debates, political discourse.
12229680	12232240	Yeah, mainly like going into YouTube people to try to argue
12232240	12234720	with them or just doing politics on stream like reading stories,
12234720	12236320	researching stuff, talking about stuff.
12236320	12238800	But there's not like other people on Twitch to debate about politics
12238800	12240000	because there was no politics.
12240000	12240800	It was, yeah.
12240800	12244560	Was there a debate in the space of communism, socialism,
12244560	12247280	social democrats, kind of like this?
12247280	12249760	Are you trying to outline your own position during that time?
12249760	12251840	I think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives
12251840	12253120	because it was like Trump stuff.
12253120	12255120	And then it was coming off the back of like there was this
12255120	12258160	movement called Gamergate and there was all this anti-SJW stuff
12258160	12258640	on the internet.
12258640	12261680	And I was like the SJW, like the progressive that was fighting
12261680	12262800	on the progressive side of things.
12262800	12263920	So I think that's what I was known for.
12263920	12265440	But I was fighting with people off of Twitch
12265440	12268160	because on Twitch there weren't very many political discussions happening.
12268160	12274240	So you were holding the SJW flag to what degree do you still hold it?
12274240	12274960	Like what's the best?
12274960	12277040	What's the steelman case for SJW?
12277040	12280560	I mean like I'm still very much that SJW from 2018-2019
12280560	12283200	but the positions have moved so much farther left that
12283200	12284960	I don't know, some people might not call me that anymore.
12284960	12285520	I'm not sure.
12285520	12286560	It depends on who I'm talking to.
12286560	12288640	Because basically what is social justice?
12288640	12291760	Were you like being sensitive to the experience of others?
12291760	12294080	Yeah, being sensitive and empathetic towards the experience of others
12294080	12296560	and then trying to build a better world that like suits as many different types
12296560	12299760	of people as possible while being like aware of like their names.
12299760	12300000	Okay.
12301440	12304080	So you guys met, what's from your perspective?
12304080	12306320	Is the, did she, she, she telling lies?
12306320	12307200	Is it accurate?
12307200	12308000	No, it's pretty accurate.
12308000	12308800	It's pretty accurate.
12308800	12309120	Okay.
12309120	12310240	When did you guys actually meet?
12311040	12313680	I flew out in 2019.
12313680	12315280	19 in like in February.
12315280	12315760	Yeah.
12315760	12317600	Basically there was like weird stuff happening in LA.
12317600	12320880	I just come off of kind of a weird not kind of sort of relationship
12320880	12323040	and I just wanted to like go away for a while.
12323040	12325680	Another company reached out to me and they had like a fun streaming device
12325680	12327280	and they said they'd sponsor a trip if I went somewhere.
12327280	12328480	And I was like, oh, well, I know this person.
12328480	12329920	I know a couple of people in New Zealand.
12329920	12330720	And Malina was one of them.
12330720	12331600	It's like, I'll go to New Zealand.
12331600	12332000	New Zealand.
12332000	12332880	It'll be fun.
12332880	12334480	And yeah, I did that for two weeks.
12334480	12335920	Do you guys believe in love?
12338320	12341280	I feel like you lack the gotcha got us into this.
12341280	12343920	I'm not sure to the degree to which you have human emotions.
12343920	12344640	I have quite a few.
12346240	12349360	From your perspective, when did you, when did you fall in love with Malina?
12349360	12350480	When you fall in love with Malima.
12351040	12352240	Malima.
12352240	12353360	The minute I saw her.
12354800	12355200	I don't know.
12355200	12357840	We, our first two weeks together were a lot of fun.
12357840	12359040	We had a lot of chemistry in person.
12360320	12362400	I was kind of shocked that I wasn't thinking about it
12362400	12364960	because it was like, we spent like a week together and you said,
12364960	12366160	I really want to tell you something.
12366160	12369040	And you were like, you were like stalling that for the longest time.
12369040	12372240	I think she was, oh, he said that like, I love you.
12372240	12374240	No, he basically just said like,
12374240	12375920	I really like you and it never really happens.
12375920	12376720	That's what he said.
12376720	12379520	And I was like, oh, and I thought, hey, I thought.
12381280	12382400	So let's still run.
12382400	12383680	We said Trump getting banned from Twitter.
12383680	12384720	Is that what we were talking about before?
12385680	12386240	Oh yeah.
12386240	12387920	Hey, you agreed to me coming on here.
12387920	12389600	Of course I'm going to be doing those to you.
12389600	12391120	How long, so how long did that take?
12391120	12391920	Two weeks, you said?
12391920	12392960	That took like a week.
12392960	12393520	No, I don't know.
12393520	12394560	I think it was just like.
12394560	12397120	Thing is, my mind process is like information so quickly.
12397120	12399520	Two weeks to somebody like you is actually like years for me.
12399520	12400160	So.
12400160	12401200	Oh, like me.
12401200	12401360	Yeah.
12402240	12405120	There was like a lot of like factorial type of strategic thinking.
12405120	12406080	Yeah, going on.
12406080	12409360	I was seeing like all the events, like Dr. Strange or whatever
12409360	12411680	and the Avengers when he's like seeing into all the future.
12411680	12413440	Oh, so when you saw me, you just saw the future.
12413440	12415120	Yeah, I was looking at all of them, yeah.
12415120	12417520	So you're doing like some game theoretic simulation
12417520	12418880	of all the possible outcomes?
12418880	12419840	Yeah, exactly.
12419840	12420160	Okay.
12421120	12422720	But no, yeah, it was probably pretty soon I realized
12422720	12423840	that we had a lot of chemistry.
12423840	12425760	I think before I left after my two weeks there,
12425760	12427360	I was like, we need to make sure you got like a ticket
12427360	12428560	to come visit me in the United States
12428560	12429600	because it'll be fun and everything.
12429600	12429920	And then.
12429920	12431840	I kind of decided that last minute too.
12431840	12434480	It was like really like five hours before your flight back.
12434480	12437040	We kind of realized because it was kind of like men
12437040	12438080	is just like a one type thing.
12438080	12439440	And then that was it.
12439440	12440800	But we're like, oh, no, this is a lot of fun.
12440800	12441760	We should probably hang out again.
12441760	12444480	Oh, so you realized you would miss each other.
12444480	12444880	Yeah, yeah.
12444880	12446320	This was one time thing.
12446320	12447600	The melancholy side of love.
12447600	12449040	Okay, when did you fall in love with Stephen?
12449600	12450880	I thought he like hated me.
12450880	12451200	I don't know.
12451200	12452640	I thought not hated me.
12452640	12453440	She still thinks I hated her.
12453440	12457280	But no, no, I remember like what he said
12457280	12458000	that he really liked me.
12458000	12461280	I was kind of a little shocked about that because I don't know.
12461280	12463680	It was a lot of like random things happening in New Zealand.
12463680	12465600	It was a lot of fun, but it was definitely like
12465600	12467200	very interesting like things that happened.
12468160	12470720	Because I was like around a lot of other people as well.
12470720	12472640	So I thought he might have had like a really bad time.
12473360	12475200	But when he said that I was thinking about it more
12475200	12477440	and then we spent like more time together
12477440	12478320	like a week after that.
12478320	12480720	And then I felt like that was more like real.
12480720	12482480	And I think when he was about to leave,
12482480	12484000	I kind of realized like, no, I really like him.
12484560	12487360	Do you guys ever say love to each other?
12487360	12488480	Like I love you?
12488480	12488960	Yeah, of course.
12488960	12489200	Yeah.
12489200	12490400	Okay, right.
12490400	12490880	I wasn't sure.
12490880	12491920	Why would you ask that?
12491920	12492880	What has he said before?
12492880	12496000	Because I haven't, I don't think I've heard you speak.
12496000	12498880	The only time I've heard you talk about love is when you're like
12498880	12501360	criticizing the Red Pill community,
12501360	12503520	saying they don't ever talk about love in relationships.
12504080	12506080	Almost all the time I'm giving criticism to people,
12506080	12507440	like I said, I'm kind of stepping in.
12507440	12509360	I'm very disconnected from my own emotional experience
12509360	12511200	because I'm trying to talk with them there.
12511200	12512560	So it's pretty rare that I'll talk about my own.
12512560	12515200	What is your own emotional experience exactly?
12515200	12516480	Highly blunted, I guess.
12516480	12517120	There's a lot.
12517120	12517680	Okay.
12517680	12518400	What does that mean?
12519280	12521280	I mean, what's the, what's deep in there?
12521280	12523600	Are you, are you, is this just who you are genetically
12523600	12524720	or are you running for something?
12525440	12526880	I think I have a pretty good understanding of myself.
12526880	12528400	A lot of people make that accusation of me,
12528400	12529520	but I don't think I am.
12529520	12530000	Okay.
12530000	12531040	This is just who you are.
12531040	12532160	It's just who I am, yeah.
12532160	12532560	Okay.
12532560	12534640	There's not childhood stuff like trauma.
12535200	12536480	It's all sorted and done.
12537360	12538320	You figured it all out?
12538320	12538880	Yeah.
12538880	12540240	In your old age?
12540240	12542080	As I grow, every year I figure out more and more.
12542080	12544080	He did mention, I think I heard this somewhere,
12544080	12547440	that this is a source of fights for the two of you, the age thing.
12547440	12550000	I felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation.
12551280	12554160	He's basically, he's saying that he gambles like with time.
12554160	12556400	He's just like, I think she will be good later.
12556400	12557120	And then just like,
12557120	12557840	It's like an investment.
12557840	12558160	Yeah.
12558160	12558880	Yeah.
12558880	12559840	It's like what he's doing.
12559840	12561840	And when this treasury bond matures,
12561840	12562480	I'm going to be able to cash out for a good.
12562480	12563520	What do you think so far?
12563520	12564880	Is the stock's growing up or?
12565840	12566720	It's tumultuous.
12566720	12567760	What's that mean?
12567760	12568720	It's like Bitcoin.
12568720	12569760	Oh my God.
12569760	12571840	Like Bitcoin, crypto mill.
12571840	12572400	All right.
12572400	12574000	If you guys don't mind,
12574000	12576000	one interesting aspect of your relationship
12576000	12577680	is you're in an open relationship.
12578320	12579040	What's that like?
12579600	12581840	From a game theoretic simulation perspective,
12581840	12583360	what went into that calculation?
12583840	12585040	And like, how does that?
12585040	12586160	Like how that started or?
12586160	12586240	Yeah.
12586240	12586960	How did that start?
12586960	12587680	Sure.
12587680	12589280	The only relationships I've ever done
12589280	12592080	has been open relationships since I was like in high school
12592080	12593760	because I didn't really understand
12593760	12595200	like why wouldn't you be able to like
12595920	12597280	do other things with other people,
12597280	12599440	but then just like have your main partner basically.
12599440	12601360	So what is an open relationship?
12601360	12602320	Generally speaking,
12602320	12604000	that means you have one main partner?
12604000	12605360	Not a monogamous relationship.
12605360	12608160	Like you're somehow allowed like in different ways.
12608960	12610400	You can see other people sexually.
12610880	12611440	Sexually.
12611440	12614480	But like there's one main station.
12614480	12616080	It doesn't have to be there for some people,
12616080	12618080	but like I think it's probably easier
12618080	12619600	and we probably don't really have time
12619600	12621440	or the energy for like more than
12622240	12624560	like one person to like really like.
12624560	12625920	What about like emotional?
12626640	12627600	It's really complicated.
12627600	12629200	There's a lot of complicated stuff going on
12629200	12630320	under the hood there.
12630320	12630800	Yeah.
12632000	12632960	I think broadly speaking,
12632960	12635040	you've got like polyamorous relationships
12635040	12636480	and you've got like open relationships
12636480	12638000	where polyamorous is like,
12638000	12639920	oh, I've got like three different girlfriends
12639920	12641840	and we all hang out or sometimes even live together
12641840	12642960	or three boyfriends or whatever.
12642960	12644240	And then you've got like open relationships
12644240	12645360	which is like, oh, you know, like,
12645360	12646960	you can basically hook up with other people
12646960	12648560	and then you've got like your main relationship
12648560	12649200	and that's it.
12649200	12652000	I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that
12652000	12653680	to where like we've got like long-term friends,
12653680	12654800	some of them we hook up with
12654800	12656320	and that's kind of how we, yeah.
12656320	12659360	It's a delicate dance that explodes
12659360	12660480	every six months on itself.
12660480	12662320	So it does explode, you guys fight over?
12662320	12663760	We fight over some things, yeah.
12664320	12665200	It things happen, yeah.
12665200	12668080	I think it's mostly because a lot of people can handle it
12668080	12669520	and they, they agree to something
12669520	12671360	and then they realize that we're way too cool
12671360	12672880	and then they get really obsessed
12672880	12674800	and they think that they can like get in there
12674800	12675760	and then it gets really dramatic.
12676400	12677360	Have you figured it out?
12679440	12681920	I feel like we figure out things more and more
12681920	12682880	like when it comes to like,
12682880	12684480	what's a good person for us to hang out
12684480	12686960	and what's not a good person for us to hang out with
12686960	12689120	or like, I probably have more opinions
12689120	12690480	than like who he hangs out with
12690480	12692000	because he likes the fucking psychos.
12693120	12694960	Yeah, so you like this or not?
12694960	12697040	He likes the not like the crazy ones,
12697040	12698640	like the baby trap sort of women.
12699200	12700800	That's the ones and I don't like that
12700800	12701600	because that affects me.
12703440	12705120	That affects your game theory at a calculation.
12705120	12705920	Yeah, obviously, yeah.
12705920	12708320	Right, you like to surround yourself
12708320	12710880	like in general you've talked about with crazy people.
12711600	12713040	I say crazy and I really shouldn't.
12713040	12713920	It's a humorous way.
12713920	12714480	It's like, yeah.
12714480	12715760	They're very unstable.
12715760	12717360	Very, can be unstable,
12717360	12718720	but people that are very unique.
12718720	12720560	Like when I meet this person, that's like.
12720560	12721280	Not boring.
12721280	12722480	Yeah, not boring, yeah.
12723120	12725360	And you said that you're progressively becoming
12726000	12727360	not boring yourself.
12727360	12728560	No, I think I'm pretty stable.
12728560	12730160	I don't love them affect me much, but.
12730160	12731760	So you don't think they affect your.
12731760	12733280	No, if I've said that, I said a joke.
12733280	12734720	And I think I've like, I've got my stuff
12734720	12735680	like really well figured out.
12735680	12737120	It's what allows me to engage with people
12737120	12739040	like this so easily because I can engage.
12739040	12740320	I can make them feel seen and heard.
12740320	12741920	And then if it gets insane, I can cut off
12741920	12742960	and I can be chill.
12742960	12744960	Like very few things affect me in the long term.
12744960	12746320	Do you guys experience jealousy?
12747440	12750000	Usually like whenever I feel like he's not spending
12750000	12752080	the like the amount of time that I'm asking for
12752080	12755040	and he spends it on his video games or his stream
12755120	12757600	or like he sees someone else like more than
12757600	12758800	he sees me or something like that.
12758800	12760160	That would like not be good
12760160	12761840	because then it affects like our relationship.
12762400	12765680	Do you have a good sense of like, is it literally time
12765680	12769120	or is it the energy put into the.
12769120	12772240	It's probably like if like if he's with me
12772240	12773680	that like the attention in the time
12773680	12774720	like when he hangs out with me
12774720	12776080	and then there's also probably the time.
12776080	12778560	So if I feel like something else is distracting too much
12778560	12780240	like it could be work or it could be a friend
12780240	12781520	or it could be anything.
12781520	12784720	Like if I feel like it starts to take away from like me
12784720	12786320	then I'm having an issue with it.
12786320	12788000	I don't think he really cares much.
12788000	12789760	I guess the only jealousy you experience is probably
12789760	12795120	when you feel like if I get upset about him seeing someone too much
12795680	12797360	and then I go see someone more
12797360	12799600	and then he's like why can I go see my friend more
12799600	12800480	like as much as you.
12800480	12802240	So like that's the sort of like thing
12802240	12803680	that we're trying to navigate on I guess.
12805440	12808560	I think we are like diametrically opposed sometimes
12808560	12810480	in terms of how we view like engagement with people
12810480	12812160	or engagement with the world sometimes.
12812160	12814000	So like on her end of the spectrum
12814000	12818960	like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin
12819760	12821520	watching like fireflies at night
12821520	12822800	going hiking every morning
12822800	12824000	going swimming at the beach
12824000	12826560	because it's like you're taking in like the grandeur of nature
12826560	12827840	you're like connected with yourself
12827840	12828880	you're like very at peace
12828880	12830080	everything is like chill and cool
12830080	12831760	there's the wind the feeling of nature everything
12831760	12833440	that's like her peak living experience.
12833440	12834560	I like being present.
12834560	12836960	Yeah and like my peak experiences are like
12836960	12838320	people trying to destroy my life
12838320	12839680	like the challenge of like navigating
12839680	12840880	a really complicated discussion
12841600	12843680	like you know several different dramatic events
12843680	12844880	unfolding that might end my career
12844880	12845840	like these things are like very
12845840	12847440	I like the stress and the action
12847440	12848160	and the entertainment
12848160	12849760	and everything's like very cool for me.
12849760	12850880	So when we're together
12850880	12852800	she generally wants me to be like more chill
12852800	12854160	but if I don't feel like I'm being like
12854160	12855120	stimulated a lot
12855120	12856720	then it's easy for like my mind to wonder
12856720	12858320	to wonder somewhere else or yeah
12858320	12859040	that's kind of the issue.
12859040	12860640	We have a very different way of like engaging with the world.
12860640	12864000	So how can you find happiness and stillness?
12864000	12866240	I feel like if we're just like aware of it
12866240	12867280	and we're trying our best
12867280	12869280	like whenever we like we're supposed to do this one thing
12869280	12870880	so let's say that we want to go to New York
12870880	12872320	and I'm like we should just like go out
12872400	12873680	and do this one specific thing
12873680	12875840	we try to find something that he enjoys doing
12875840	12878480	like now that we're in Texas we can go shooting
12878480	12880160	or do something fun that he enjoys
12880160	12880960	then we can do it.
12882160	12883040	And then I think like
12884000	12885600	just like for me also to be aware
12886480	12888560	that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people
12888560	12889920	it's not because he like loves them
12889920	12890800	or wants to be with them
12890800	12892080	it's just because he likes being
12892080	12893840	like having his life destroyed.
12894400	12895440	Like you said
12895440	12896320	which I don't really do
12896320	12897520	this is a completely different thing.
12897520	12899600	So like for me to like understand more
12899600	12900640	like how he's thinking
12900640	12901920	because it's so different from mine
12902320	12903440	and for him to understand
12903440	12904480	how I'm thinking about things
12904480	12906720	and like what I prioritize in my life
12906720	12908240	I think that's like how we navigate
12908240	12909040	but I think it's good
12909040	12910640	I think the differences can be good
12910640	12911840	like when we're finding a way.
12911840	12912400	Yeah.
12912400	12915440	Well I think you're relatable.
12917120	12917920	I'm more of a human.
12917920	12919680	No I'm definitely very difficult to get along with
12919680	12920560	like I always tell people that
12920560	12921440	that like if you're dating me
12921440	12922480	for like more than a few years
12922480	12923760	like you get like an award for that.
12923760	12925920	It's like a war zone that you've survived.
12925920	12926960	Absolutely.
12926960	12929280	You're like a veteran you get medals and stuff
12929280	12930240	and it's always like I think
12930240	12931520	there's probably been like six different
12931520	12932640	I don't think she says it anymore
12932640	12933600	but there are like six different times
12933600	12934560	in our relationship where she's like
12934560	12935600	is it always like this?
12935600	12936720	Is this actually right?
12936720	12936880	Yeah.
12936880	12938320	And like every next year it's like
12938320	12939520	You're lying in the beginning of about like
12939520	12940640	you were lying about that.
12940640	12942240	Well it got more and more.
12942240	12943840	You were like no it's just like right now
12943840	12946080	I'm having a huge argument online
12946080	12947520	about seeing the end word in private
12947520	12948480	and it's just going to be like this
12948480	12950320	and I'm going to be streaming 24 hours a day
12951040	12951920	and I'm like we're like
12951920	12952880	when are you going to come to bed?
12952880	12953520	It's been a week.
12955520	12958400	I did playing League come into this.
12958400	12959520	A little bit but I'm clean.
12959520	12961120	I'm clean of League like six months right now.
12961520	12963360	What do you hate about League of Legends?
12963360	12963760	I never got.
12963760	12964240	The humans.
12966240	12967440	Well speaking of which
12967440	12969360	I my participation in League
12969360	12970720	involved on the robot side.
12970720	12971120	Good.
12971120	12973200	Because that's an improvement.
12973840	12976400	Because both the Starcraft 2
12976400	12978080	and and League of Legends
12978080	12979760	because OpenAI and DeepMind
12980480	12981760	both participated in creating bots
12981760	12982240	and those.
12982240	12983760	I was a professional Starcraft 2 player
12983760	12985760	so I remember when the AI started to play
12985760	12987600	it's interesting the types of restrictions
12987600	12988800	that you would have to put on like a
12988800	12990640	gaming robot to make it like functional
12990720	12992800	and not totally unfair to the other side.
12992800	12994560	Yeah to make it human like.
12994560	12995840	Yeah was that interesting to you
12995840	12998560	to see AI be able to play those video games?
12998560	12999360	I think in some ways
12999360	13000560	people think things are more complicated
13000560	13001680	than they actually are
13001680	13003200	and I think video games is one of those things
13003200	13004000	are really oh my god
13004000	13005520	there's like a million possibilities
13005520	13006960	at every second and who knows
13006960	13007520	and it's like no
13007520	13008480	there's like three or four things
13008480	13009520	going at any point in time
13009520	13010400	and I'm willing to bet that like
13010400	13011760	an AI could probably solve some of these
13011760	13012880	games like pretty easily
13013600	13014960	especially if there are no constraints
13014960	13015680	on how they can learn.
13015680	13018480	Yeah can I talk to you about relationships?
13019120	13020160	Yeah you already have so.
13020160	13022080	Yeah I know but more generally speaking
13022080	13024160	we didn't get a chance to talk about
13024160	13025600	the the red pill community.
13025600	13026240	Oh sure.
13026240	13028240	Well first of all what is the red pill community
13028240	13029600	the manosphere in general?
13029600	13031680	I'd love to get both your opinions on this.
13031680	13031920	Sure.
13032880	13035040	I know I know you're probably not as
13035840	13037920	opinionated on that whole thing.
13037920	13038960	Do you think I am that?
13038960	13040080	Like probably not as you
13040080	13040960	like as much as you
13040960	13042480	but I do have opinions.
13042480	13043200	You do okay.
13043200	13044880	I usually don't like speak out too much
13044880	13046080	on it because I feel like
13046080	13047200	there's like a language barrier
13047920	13049280	that's why I don't really do politics
13049280	13050800	because this is my second language.
13050800	13051120	Yeah.
13051120	13053200	That's right you have to know the.
13053200	13053920	A lot of it like.
13053920	13054640	You know how to use
13055200	13057040	have to use derogatory terms
13057040	13057920	every other sentence
13058640	13059760	so they understand you right.
13059760	13060240	Exactly.
13060240	13061600	I don't know anything about that.
13061600	13063440	But you need like a good like you need
13063440	13065680	to be able to like speak really well
13065680	13066960	for people to take your seriously
13067520	13068240	I think.
13068240	13069760	And like that's a thing like if I
13069760	13071120	if I don't have like the words
13071120	13072080	and I don't have the
13072080	13073920	like I can't pronounce things correctly.
13073920	13075200	Yeah and you're a self person
13075200	13076640	searching for words looks stupid
13076640	13078160	essentially that's how people view it.
13078240	13080160	Tell me about it I have a podcast
13080160	13081920	that people listen to
13081920	13084160	and I mumble and they yeah.
13084160	13085600	Wait is here what's your first language.
13086160	13086800	Russian.
13086800	13087360	Oh okay.
13087360	13089440	But I speak both languages horribly.
13089440	13092240	I just not I'm not like
13092240	13094320	there is definitely a big disconnect
13094320	13096640	between my brain and my mouth module.
13097200	13099120	Like I'm not able to generate
13099120	13100640	the thoughts efficiently
13100640	13101840	like the things you're able to do
13101840	13103600	like to like speak like that.
13103600	13106080	I'm not it's very very tough.
13106080	13107840	Plus there's a huge amount of anxiety
13107840	13109360	and social interaction that I have
13109360	13110800	which makes speaking even harder.
13112000	13114160	Yeah yeah yeah it's tough.
13114160	13114800	I understand I mean.
13114800	13115200	Gotcha.
13116480	13117280	Makes sense.
13117280	13119440	Yeah the the gacha is both
13120320	13121680	a symbol of compassion
13122320	13123840	and derision at once.
13123840	13124640	It's I'm just letting you know
13124640	13125360	I understand what you say.
13125360	13126160	I'm just going to sit there
13126160	13126560	and stare at you.
13126560	13127040	Confirm.
13127040	13128720	No you can just say like yeah get it.
13128720	13129600	Like yeah I get it.
13129600	13130160	I get it.
13130160	13130720	Gotcha.
13130720	13131680	I got you.
13131680	13132560	Gotcha sounds.
13132560	13133200	I got you.
13133200	13134960	No it's so it's so short.
13134960	13135600	I got you.
13136080	13137760	Say it's a longer sentence
13137760	13139200	but that means the same thing.
13139200	13140480	I understand you.
13140480	13142400	Yeah that's good that's like
13142400	13144160	not chills you know.
13144160	13146240	You get chills all like you understand me.
13146240	13147200	Yeah it feels good.
13147200	13147600	Yeah.
13147600	13148400	I hear you.
13148400	13149200	I hear you.
13149200	13150160	And like if you just like
13150160	13151200	hold the other person's hand
13151200	13151760	that's even better.
13151760	13153120	Maybe you gotta put in some emotion there
13153120	13154320	okay show that you have some.
13157840	13158400	Gotcha.
13158400	13159600	What do you think about Red Pill?
13160880	13162240	Sorry what is it first of all
13162240	13163360	for people I don't know?
13163360	13164960	Yeah the Red Pill community
13164960	13166400	obviously it's the matrix reference.
13166400	13167440	The Red Pill that you take
13167440	13168560	is when you realize
13168560	13170080	what dating standards and norms
13170080	13171440	really are in the world
13171440	13172960	that men are providers
13172960	13174560	and have to become some great thing
13174560	13176240	to hunt and attract you know
13176240	13177360	the woman who are just kind of
13177360	13178080	there floating around
13178080	13178800	looking for people
13178800	13180080	to give them the most resources
13180080	13182160	and it's like coming to a realization
13182160	13183680	of what the world of dating really is
13183680	13185040	broken away from the Hollywood
13185040	13186320	standards and the romantic stuff
13186320	13187120	that they try to sell you
13187120	13188080	and you know stories.
13188080	13189040	So there was kind of
13189840	13191760	maybe you can kind of educate me on this
13191760	13193680	but Red Pill used to be associated with
13194960	13198640	just maybe anti-establishment views
13198640	13199680	I don't know maybe
13199680	13201360	maybe Republican conservative viewpoints
13201360	13202240	would be all right.
13202240	13203680	Yeah they use Red Pill a lot
13203680	13204640	in like different communities
13204640	13206400	like when you say the Red Pill community
13206400	13207840	yeah that usually means dating.
13207840	13208400	The dating thing
13208400	13209040	but a lot of people say
13209040	13210240	oh Trump voters they're Red Pill
13210240	13211520	are you Red Pilled on like politics
13211520	13213120	or whatever people say stuff like that yeah.
13213120	13213760	Okay cool.
13213760	13215440	And then there's like the manosphere
13215440	13217120	that's all the similar type of stuff
13217120	13218720	and Andrew Tate is somebody
13218720	13219680	that represents kind of
13220480	13221520	the figurehead
13221520	13222320	of the manosphere
13222320	13223280	of like the Red Pill stuff
13223280	13224080	yeah I would say so
13224080	13224880	I'm pretty sure yeah.
13224880	13226160	Okay all right cool.
13226160	13228800	So what are some ideas
13228800	13229520	that they represent
13229520	13230640	and what do you think about them?
13230640	13232160	I think they do a good job
13232160	13234160	at speaking to disaffected young men
13234160	13235520	who feel like the rest of the world
13235520	13236560	is kind of left them behind
13236560	13238320	or isn't willing to speak to them
13238320	13239600	and they do identify
13239600	13241440	some true and real problems.
13241440	13242240	Feels like on the left
13242240	13243360	we have a really hard time
13243360	13244800	doing like self-improvement
13244800	13246400	or telling people how to better themselves.
13246400	13247200	We focus too much on
13247200	13248800	like structural or systemic issues
13248800	13250320	rather than what can an individual do
13250320	13252080	to uplift or empower themselves
13252080	13252960	and it also feels like
13252960	13253920	they do a good job
13253920	13256160	at speaking to some of the positive aspects
13256160	13257040	of masculinity
13257040	13258880	that it's okay to be like strong
13258880	13260800	and brave and a soldier
13260800	13261360	and a warrior
13261360	13262320	and provide for your family
13262320	13263040	and blah blah blah.
13263680	13264560	So I would say like those are like
13264560	13265360	positive messages
13265360	13266160	like self-improvement
13266160	13266640	and everything
13266640	13268000	that come from the Red Pill community.
13268640	13269520	What's the negative?
13270640	13271840	I think the analysis
13271840	13273920	on how men and women interact
13273920	13276000	is a way too transactional.
13276000	13277440	All of like the romanticism
13277440	13278240	and love and chemistry
13278240	13279680	is totally sucked out of it.
13279680	13280720	Everything is very like
13281360	13281920	sex-based
13281920	13283360	like how do you basically have sex
13283360	13284720	with the most amount of women possible
13284720	13285680	and that's going to make you happy.
13286560	13288000	And then I think people's motivation
13288000	13289680	sometimes are just spoken about
13289680	13291440	in such a shallow derogatory way
13291440	13292000	that I don't think
13292000	13293520	is always reflective of reality.
13293520	13294720	Like women only wants you
13294720	13295760	because you make six figures
13295760	13296480	and you're tall
13296480	13297280	and a guy only wants you
13297280	13298240	because he wants to have sex with you
13298240	13298720	and blah blah.
13298720	13299200	Like it feels like
13299200	13300400	there's a lot of that going on a lot.
13301280	13302720	Yeah and that misses
13302720	13303840	some fundamental aspect
13303840	13304880	about relationships
13304880	13306880	about meaningful relationships and so on.
13306880	13307920	I don't think I've never heard
13307920	13309360	Red Pill people ever ever
13309360	13310800	talk about like meaningful relationships.
13310800	13311840	It's always just how to get in one
13311840	13312880	or how to have sex really.
13313760	13315360	Mel, what bothers you about
13315360	13317200	some of that philosophy?
13317200	13318080	I feel like the people
13318080	13319520	that are like the Red Pill people
13319520	13321040	I feel like their solution
13321040	13323200	is something that doesn't actually work out.
13324400	13325840	Like where it works out
13325840	13326560	for some people
13326560	13327680	people that makes a lot of money
13327680	13328720	is like really successful
13328720	13329440	in that sort of way.
13330000	13331360	But it's not going to help
13331360	13332880	most men out there
13332880	13334320	so I feel like it's just like a pointless
13334880	13336080	like speech to give
13336080	13338080	to these like really lost guys
13338080	13338960	and they really do believe
13338960	13339760	that they can like
13339760	13340960	they can become successful
13340960	13342640	they can get money
13343200	13344560	and when they get all these things
13344560	13345520	they can get girls
13345520	13346400	but most of them
13346400	13347840	is not going to achieve that ever.
13348400	13349280	To get the money part
13349280	13350320	or become successful.
13350320	13351280	Just become a billionaire
13351280	13351920	you know like
13351920	13352880	and you will get all the girls
13352880	13353520	and which is true
13353520	13354640	but not everyone can do that.
13354640	13356000	So I feel like
13356000	13357200	when these guys are speaking
13357200	13357840	to these men
13357840	13358240	and there's like
13358240	13360080	we just care about these men out there
13360080	13361520	you know they need to hear this
13361520	13362880	it doesn't really help a lot of them.
13363440	13366640	And it doesn't inspire them
13366640	13367840	to develop compassion
13368640	13369760	towards the opposite sex
13369760	13371280	which is probably something required
13371360	13372800	to have money for relationship.
13372800	13373840	And also like
13373840	13375680	they seem to complain a lot about women
13376640	13377920	like only wanting men
13377920	13378640	that have money
13378640	13379280	and that's tall
13379280	13380080	and that's muscular
13380080	13380800	whatever you know
13380800	13381440	all those things
13382880	13384480	and but they complain about that
13384480	13385120	but that's like
13385120	13386480	also kind of what they're trying to
13387520	13390160	make the men try to do for themselves
13390160	13391120	so they kind of like
13391120	13392800	fall into the same sort of behavior
13392800	13393360	and it seems like
13393360	13394720	they're kind of unaware of that as well.
13395920	13397280	They're just playing a part of the game
13397280	13398640	instead of trying to find
13398640	13400800	a woman that doesn't look for those things
13400800	13401760	and that are looking for
13402720	13403440	not those things.
13403440	13404160	Yeah.
13404160	13405360	I actually would love to have
13405360	13406720	like straight up data
13407680	13410720	on people in that world
13410720	13411840	versus not in that world
13411840	13412880	how often they get laid.
13413440	13413680	Yeah.
13414400	13416080	Like literally so
13417040	13418240	I think for sure
13419040	13420080	people in that world
13420720	13423760	have fewer meaningful long-term
13423760	13425280	relationships that are fulfilling
13425280	13427360	that actually helped them succeed in life
13427360	13428480	that helped them be happy
13428480	13429600	and content and all that kind of stuff
13430240	13431840	but just even the straight up
13431840	13433360	the shallow goal of getting laid
13434880	13435520	I wonder
13436480	13437760	because it's very possible
13437760	13439360	that like just the roughness
13439360	13442560	with which they treat intellectually
13442560	13444160	women that might lead to
13444720	13445440	lower success
13445440	13446560	not higher success.
13446560	13447920	It's very adversarial
13447920	13449120	which I think is always disappointing
13449120	13450400	anything that talks about men and women
13450400	13452160	I think it's good to acknowledge differences
13452160	13453920	but when it becomes like adversarial
13453920	13455280	especially when you talk about sex
13455280	13456720	sex is something that men are getting
13456720	13458160	and it's something that women are giving
13458160	13459200	and that type of like trade-off
13459200	13460560	and the way they talk about it is like
13460560	13462160	yeah it sets people against each other
13462160	13463280	in a really toxic way I think.
13464960	13467040	How do you talk to people from that world
13467040	13468320	from the red pill world
13468320	13469600	like would you would you ever talk to
13469600	13470880	like somebody like Andrew Tate?
13470880	13472080	Oh yeah if I had the chance to
13472080	13473680	I've been on the Fresh and Fit podcast
13473680	13474160	a few times
13474160	13475440	and then I've got a friend Sneeko
13475440	13477440	who's like very red pill that stuff
13479280	13480400	if I'm trying to talk to them
13480400	13481120	usually the
13482080	13482960	it's kind of like approaching it
13482960	13483920	like a scared cat
13483920	13484960	the first thing you have to do is like
13484960	13486160	be very gentle and say like
13486160	13487040	I understand your issues
13487040	13487920	I understand your complaints
13487920	13489040	I know that you're I'm scary
13489040	13490080	because you think I'm going to say like
13490080	13491760	toxic masculinity and feminism
13491760	13493280	and all these scary words at you
13493840	13495440	so the first thing is always to recognize it
13495440	13496880	like a lot of what they talk about
13496880	13498320	there are like true aspects
13498320	13499200	to what they're talking about
13499200	13500960	that people on the left won't recognize
13500960	13503760	so I think it's good to acknowledge those things
13503760	13505680	that like men and women are kind of different
13505680	13507040	we do look for different things in general
13507040	13508000	when it comes to relationships
13508000	13508800	it's okay to say that
13508800	13510320	it's not there's nothing bad there
13510320	13511280	and then it'll usually be like
13511280	13512320	once I've got your trust
13512320	13513520	and I'm in your bubble
13513520	13515600	like let's talk about the things that you want
13515600	13517120	and maybe some of the strategies
13517200	13518560	that you're employing aren't necessarily
13518560	13520160	going to get you some of the things that you want
13520160	13521440	so for instance if you're really worried
13521440	13522800	about like shallow girls
13522800	13523680	like ruining your life
13523680	13524400	like Molina said
13525040	13526960	it's probably not best to build your entire world view
13526960	13528160	around trying to get shallow girls
13528160	13529360	that are going to ruin your life
13529360	13530720	like if your way of attracting a girl
13530720	13531440	is to go to the gym
13531440	13532400	get a whole bunch of money
13532400	13533840	and try to like flaunt your wealth
13533840	13534560	as much as possible
13534560	13536240	you're going to be attracting the very same type of women
13536240	13537120	that you're here like
13537120	13538480	decrying on your stream
13538480	13540000	I think we talked about that on the podcast
13540000	13541520	like you probably want to have a woman
13541520	13542240	that's going to be there
13542240	13543200	if you lose your job
13543200	13544080	it's still there
13544080	13545520	like that cares about the things
13545520	13546800	that's not just your job
13547760	13548800	it's more stable
13548800	13551760	and also I don't help you become a great man
13552720	13554160	or a great like grow
13554160	13555680	like I feel like a great friendship
13555680	13556320	and a partnership
13556880	13558800	like it helps you make you a better person
13558800	13560240	some of the most successful people I know
13560240	13561360	I mean they have families
13561360	13563040	and there's clearly a dynamic there
13563040	13564880	that's like that makes them
13564880	13566320	they wouldn't be that without
13566320	13567440	they're not an island yeah
13567440	13570080	yeah and the kids actually are a big part of that too
13570080	13571120	like for most people
13571120	13572800	if you're like a good parent
13572800	13575120	they make you step up somehow in life
13575120	13576720	you have to take responsibility for
13577360	13578560	getting your shit together
13578560	13580000	and excelling
13580000	13580720	in ways that
13582560	13584000	I guess the philosophy of the Red Bull
13584000	13585040	does not quite get to
13585040	13586000	that's always an interesting
13586000	13587120	I think I've asked that a couple of times
13587120	13587920	where it's like
13587920	13591680	would you let your daughter date Andrew Tate
13591680	13592720	and it's always funny to watch them
13592720	13594080	kind of like squirm around
13594080	13595200	those answers sometimes
13595200	13597120	but see if they if they don't have a daughter
13597120	13599280	like I you know I don't have a daughter
13599280	13601280	I think your whole philosophy changes
13601280	13602320	once you have a daughter
13602320	13602960	sure
13602960	13604320	but even at that like they can
13604320	13605600	they know that what they're answering
13605600	13606720	they feel a little bit weird about it
13606720	13607440	it's funny to watch them
13607440	13608480	like they even they know it's like
13608480	13609760	ah fuck you know
13609760	13611040	well they might say like
13611040	13612480	I want my daughter to date
13612480	13613680	like a high value male
13614400	13616240	to the degree that he's a high value male
13616240	13616480	yes
13617120	13618960	but like I don't think you'll feel that way
13618960	13620800	the definition of high value changes
13620800	13622240	completely for sure
13622240	13623440	certainly the stereotypical
13624320	13625840	measures of value contribute to the
13625840	13626400	calculation
13626400	13627760	but it's so much more than that
13627760	13629920	I think the chemistry of the whole thing is
13629920	13631040	is bigger
13631040	13633680	you've also mentioned about body count
13633680	13636560	you guys both have a high body count
13636560	13637920	this body count matter
13637920	13638960	or it depends
13638960	13639680	like like you said
13639680	13641520	it's low in some people's eyes
13641520	13643040	it's high in other people's eyes
13643040	13644800	does body count matter in relationships
13644800	13645760	it's the past matter
13646560	13647840	well the past matters
13647840	13648800	I don't think body count
13648800	13649840	not to me I don't really care
13649840	13650960	not just as it is no
13652240	13653040	I mean it could be
13653040	13653760	the past does
13653760	13654320	yeah
13654320	13655920	well the past is who you are right
13655920	13656800	like somebody tells me like
13656800	13658160	they have a 200 body count
13658160	13659200	and they're 16
13659200	13660400	something's probably going on there
13660400	13661120	that's not good
13661120	13662240	I was thinking about that too like
13662320	13663840	because it could be like really young people
13663840	13665440	that are having some sort of
13665440	13667120	like mental problems going on
13667120	13668880	or somebody's like 45
13668880	13670240	and they've like never had sex before
13670240	13671520	there's probably something going on right
13671520	13672320	so it could be indicative
13672320	13673520	but if somebody's like in their 20s
13673520	13674640	and they've had sex with you know
13674640	13676080	100 people or 50 people or whatever
13676080	13676960	it's you know whatever
13676960	13678320	there's more experience
13678320	13679360	which can be good
13679360	13680000	sure
13680000	13681520	okay so that just represents
13681520	13683360	your like sexually open
13683360	13685760	and so it doesn't really necessarily mean any kind of
13686320	13687040	not necessarily
13687040	13687840	it could though
13687840	13689280	the number alone doesn't mean anything
13689840	13690400	yeah
13690400	13691280	okay
13691280	13692720	well you could meet a guy that's like
13692720	13693680	I just really really like
13693680	13694800	want to fuck a lot of people
13694800	13696160	because it makes me so cool
13696160	13697680	like you're gonna be someone like that
13697680	13698160	which is like
13698720	13699760	so the body count doesn't matter
13699760	13700880	but like where it comes from
13700880	13701920	like yeah like why
13701920	13703840	why have you slept with the people you slept with
13703840	13704480	yes
13704480	13706000	does it hurt like the romantic aspect
13706000	13706800	of the relationship
13706800	13708720	knowing that there's a lot of people in the past
13709280	13709600	I don't know
13709600	13710240	not for us
13710240	13711040	no
13711040	13713200	is the part of the relationship fundamentally romantic
13713920	13714320	for us?
13714320	13714960	for us yeah
13714960	13715520	yeah
13716000	13716320	okay
13717760	13718080	what?
13719040	13720800	you come out for such a cold person
13720800	13722080	no I was just in my head thinking
13722080	13724080	I wanted to just say gotcha right there
13725760	13726960	it's so judgmental
13726960	13728320	I think when it comes to the sex thing
13728320	13729920	there's always like the way that I explain it is
13729920	13730640	and I understand like
13731680	13732400	I have to say this
13732400	13734640	because I don't advocate for what I do for everybody
13734640	13735680	or what she does for everybody
13735680	13737360	because obviously there's a whole bunch of
13737360	13738480	natural feelings of jealousy
13738480	13739680	that pop up for a lot of people
13740240	13741040	but when people ask me
13741040	13741760	you know it's always like
13741760	13742960	oh like isn't this like horrible
13742960	13744080	that you guys are doing this
13744080	13744880	and you don't love each other
13745440	13746560	from my perspective
13746560	13748480	I can have sex with like any person
13748480	13749200	and it can be sex
13749200	13750560	like that's not like a special thing
13750560	13751360	between two people
13751360	13751920	in my eyes
13751920	13753360	it's like anybody can have sex
13753360	13755440	but there are like certain activities
13755440	13757280	and ways that you can spend time with each other
13757280	13758560	where you're like carving out these like
13758560	13759680	precious little moments in time
13759680	13760480	with a certain person
13760480	13762640	that can do things that are special to that person
13762640	13764160	and those are the kind of like events
13764160	13766320	that I remember more than anything else
13766320	13768160	so like the idea of like
13768160	13769520	like oh wow I had sex with a person
13769520	13770480	that was so special
13770480	13772320	doesn't mean as much as like you know
13772320	13774160	us traveling to like New Zealand
13774160	13775360	or sharing some special moment
13775360	13776720	doing like some really fun activity
13776720	13777680	or event or whatever
13777680	13778800	that's usually how I like it I am
13779520	13781200	so a shared intimate moment
13781200	13781840	yeah
13781840	13782720	I kind of agree
13782720	13784720	but I can definitely connect the romance with sex
13784720	13785120	boring
13786240	13787440	I'm curious why you can't do it
13787440	13788400	see that's where the red pill's right
13789600	13790080	that's exactly
13790080	13791840	we've also talked about misogyny
13791840	13794400	which is you're clearly the embodiment of that
13794400	13795440	what were you saying
13795440	13797920	so there's some there's a connection between romance and
13797920	13799280	yeah I think it is
13799280	13801360	because I think sex could be a lot of things
13801360	13801600	right
13802720	13804640	it's it's some sort of bonding
13804640	13805920	I'd say in some way
13806560	13808400	they say that you really like BDSM
13808800	13811280	you kind of like you become submissive to someone
13811280	13812560	or you take control over someone
13812560	13815200	it's like a very bonding like intimate moment
13815200	13815600	I'd say
13816240	13817040	and that's romantic
13817040	13817920	the intimacy is romantic
13817920	13818960	I think it is
13818960	13820880	if you can show yourself as really submissive
13820880	13821680	or like weak
13821680	13823840	or you have like absolutely no control over yourself
13823840	13825280	and you let someone else do it
13825280	13827040	or you are the one being that like
13827040	13828400	you are the dominant for someone
13828400	13830320	I think that's a really like intimate thing
13830320	13833040	because you show like the weakest part of yourself
13833040	13833920	kind of
13833920	13835360	I just feel like I personally
13835600	13839680	to me some component romantic but to me
13839680	13840880	this is not judging to others
13840880	13841520	to me
13841520	13842720	maybe his haul is brought up
13844560	13845840	the romance increases
13846400	13849280	if the number of intimate interactions
13850000	13851280	are limited to one person
13852160	13854080	like for me for some reason
13855040	13856000	spreading it out
13857680	13858480	decreases
13859280	13861920	like exponentially
13861920	13863920	the the feeling of romance you feel
13864240	13866240	I don't know what that that could be just like
13866240	13869040	sort of having grown up in the Soviet Union
13869040	13871520	there's a kind of there's the fairy tale stories
13871520	13873680	and you're kind of maybe living through them
13874640	13876400	yeah I mean I think what you're saying is like really normal
13876400	13877760	like most people probably show that way
13877760	13878160	yeah
13878160	13881120	but but because you guys are able to successfully not do that
13881120	13884160	I just want to question my own understanding of it
13884160	13884640	you know
13884640	13885120	like
13885120	13886320	like why is that
13886320	13886880	why is that
13886880	13890240	like am I being very jealous for no reason
13890240	13893760	like maybe you can maximize the number of intimate experiences
13893760	13896480	if you just open up and let go of the jealousy essentially
13896480	13898000	I think I feel like in Sweden
13898000	13898960	and like in Scandinavia
13898960	13901120	we're extremely just sexually open
13901120	13902000	like in general
13902000	13904080	we're not like super religious either
13904080	13905680	we're very like relaxed
13905680	13908080	we don't like we don't feel bad about ourselves
13908080	13909840	like it's just like a different sort of thing
13909840	13911840	and I would say like it's we're more progressive
13911840	13913680	when it comes to feminism and stuff
13913680	13915040	so it's more common
13915040	13916960	they will meet women with a higher body count
13916960	13918960	than like when I meet like American girls
13918960	13920480	all of them I have like vaginisma
13920480	13922480	like super suppressed like sexually and
13923200	13924240	where did you just use
13924240	13926240	they have like issues to like
13926240	13927600	they can't relax during sex
13927600	13928560	so it just hurts for them
13928560	13929120	vaginismus
13929120	13929680	so they get really nervous
13929680	13930240	vaginismus
13930240	13931040	is that what it's called yeah
13932240	13933680	so like I meet so many girls
13933680	13935760	that are having like a lot of issues
13935760	13936640	with sex
13936640	13938160	and they have like a very low body count
13938160	13939760	because they just can't relax
13939760	13941200	or they yeah
13941200	13941760	and it's probably
13941760	13943920	and usually they come from like a very religious background
13944560	13945680	so they have just been told
13945680	13946720	like you cannot wear that
13946720	13947840	you cannot be like that
13947840	13949280	you can't like you know
13949280	13951200	and like where I grew up
13951200	13952160	it wasn't like that at all
13952480	13954160	but you see it as more like a casual thing
13955040	13956560	so then you can just maximize
13958000	13959760	the awesomeness of the experience
13959760	13961360	yeah I guess I don't have trouble with it
13961360	13961840	exactly
13961840	13963600	I think the important thing I think
13963600	13964560	for everybody to realize
13964560	13966640	is there's always pros and cons to everything
13966640	13968640	like my lifestyle like
13968640	13970080	obviously I get to have a lot of fun experiences
13970080	13971120	that's like a huge pro
13971120	13972080	and that's super cool
13972080	13973600	and if you're like a more monogamy
13973600	13974160	brain person
13974160	13975600	you're not going to get those experiences
13975600	13977200	but if you're a monogamy brain person
13977200	13978400	like when you're sharing that special
13978400	13979680	woman at home with somebody else
13979680	13981840	like that moment could be really really really special
13981840	13983840	because now it's the thing that you're showing yourself
13983840	13985120	and open yourself up to another person
13985120	13986640	and they're only trusting you to do that
13986640	13987840	and that's like a really special thing
13987840	13989840	that only the two of you are showing with each other
13989840	13991760	so I mean like there's always like pros and cons to everything
13991760	13993440	like I think we both would say like
13993440	13995520	like doing an open relationship is probably not
13995520	13996960	like we would not recommend it
13997520	13998800	yeah I don't think we would no
13999920	14002160	yeah I recently fasted for three days
14002160	14004320	and I ate a chicken breast at the end of that
14004320	14006800	and it was like the most delicious food I've ever eaten
14007920	14009600	so like there's some aspect of fasting
14009600	14011280	and scarcity and so on that
14011280	14013600	like you have to figure out what for your own psyche
14013600	14014400	what works the best
14014400	14015920	it's good to be a little bored or like
14015920	14017920	not do something or like work
14017920	14019360	because you can just enjoy the time
14019360	14020880	when you're doing something really fun
14020880	14022880	it's more fun otherwise you're just going to get numb
14022880	14024080	in general with everything
14024080	14024720	yeah
14024720	14026640	yeah I personally just never get bored
14026640	14028960	like I guess the the boring thing is exciting to me
14029680	14030880	the just like
14030880	14033920	you're like me because you say everything I like is boring
14034800	14036880	I gotta ask you we talked about misogyny
14036880	14039120	in the he's trying to battle it out on the internet
14039840	14042880	what's your what's your sense as a woman
14043680	14046160	about the level of misogyny on the internet
14046160	14047920	in the streaming community and how to fight it
14048880	14052080	for me because I get I guess I get it every single day
14052080	14054240	somehow like because I haven't online
14054240	14056560	like I have a chat that goes that's live right
14056560	14058960	and but I have like mods moderating that all the time
14058960	14060480	so I don't really need to see much of it
14060480	14062000	I think it's just pretty annoying
14062000	14064720	because you get to like see it all the time
14066000	14067520	so it's become like background noise
14068240	14071840	yeah a little bit and it's like the same commons over and over again
14071840	14074880	but it's usually for me I don't personally care that much
14074880	14076080	I understand that other people do
14076080	14077760	especially when it comes into like
14077760	14079440	when there's like a lot of sexism and stuff
14080080	14083360	and when there's a lot of like men not taking women seriously
14083360	14084480	like I definitely get that
14084480	14086400	and I used to get that even more like a few years ago
14087040	14088240	with my accent and everything
14088240	14090320	and like I used to be blonde as well like a few months ago
14090320	14092640	so I feel like people wouldn't take me seriously because of that
14093280	14094640	that's a bit annoying
14094640	14097760	but I feel like it's pretty easy to like see through
14097760	14098960	when someone acts that way
14098960	14100560	and for me personally I don't really care
14100560	14103600	but it's a bit annoying like being online
14103600	14105280	and like getting stuff every single day
14105840	14107600	it would say like the probably the worst thing is
14108480	14111440	when you feel like you put in a lot of effort into some sort of work
14112160	14113520	everyone is just going to say
14113520	14116240	you just got that because you're a woman and you're attractive
14116240	14118720	and that's that's probably like the worst thing
14118720	14120400	is there a way to fight that you think
14120400	14121360	yeah I don't think you can
14121360	14122800	I think it just comes up all the time
14123680	14124800	it is what it is I guess
14124800	14126240	you're just gonna keep doing whatever you do
14126240	14128800	and like not let it like emotionally control you somehow
14128800	14130880	I think having more women in those spaces is always good
14130880	14131680	it's probably good yeah
14131680	14133760	like a lot of the guys you can tell online that they don't ever
14133760	14135360	don't bring on the worst ones then
14135360	14136320	see she's being this
14136320	14137600	did you see she just did it
14137600	14138720	she did the misogyny thing
14139520	14140720	by having some bad women on
14140720	14142320	she's saying all women see you
14142320	14144000	well you you know it's true
14145280	14146000	right
14146000	14147520	see but I just agree with you
14147520	14150320	and I'm older than both of you and therefore wiser right
14150320	14150880	so
14150880	14152000	well combined we're older than you
14152000	14152720	I think we're wonderful
14153520	14154960	we're one fully matronomy
14154960	14156160	yeah we've got combined age
14157280	14158720	or it could be it could be the same thing
14158720	14160240	it was like also the age thing
14160240	14161200	and like the woman thing
14161200	14162640	a lot of people think that I'm just copying
14162640	14164000	every single thing that he says
14164000	14165280	which I think is a bit annoying as well
14165280	14166400	so I can never really like
14166400	14167600	a sonic user of that one
14167600	14169120	yeah which has been annoying
14169120	14169680	so much you know
14170400	14171840	it was about the defunding police
14171840	14172880	like my dad is a cop
14172880	14176160	friendship camaraderie and love and respect
14176160	14179280	which you both have had for a time
14179280	14181360	and have lost and I would like you to regain it
14182000	14183120	let's try to increase
14183120	14185040	not decrease the amount of love in this space
14185040	14186000	what do you think about
14186000	14187360	some of the harshness of this
14187360	14189120	of his language which we talked about
14190480	14191840	our word in the past
14191840	14192960	when you used n word
14193760	14194720	all of that kind of stuff
14194720	14196000	when he what he used to do
14196000	14196320	I mean
14196880	14198000	no like what do you think about it
14198000	14199200	like do you give him advice
14199200	14201200	to not speak a certain way
14201200	14202960	no like a little more civility
14202960	14204880	I'm just trying to get a second opinion on this
14204880	14205680	second opinion about
14205680	14207120	nor many people not internet people
14207120	14208720	are way more extreme than
14208720	14209520	yeah
14209520	14210560	she's way more extreme
14210560	14212000	no that's not true
14212000	14213840	okay so okay so here's thing for me okay
14214400	14217040	I was not online until three years ago
14217040	14217600	at all
14217600	14218880	like I would watch youtube
14218880	14220480	that's pretty much all I would do
14220480	14221680	I wouldn't do anything else
14221680	14222720	really I didn't
14222720	14224080	grew up playing video games or anything
14224640	14226240	so I'm like extremely new to everything
14227840	14230240	so when I came into this world
14230240	14232640	and I started seeing clips from him in the past
14232640	14234320	I don't think I really had much of an opinion
14234320	14235360	because it just sounded like
14235360	14237200	it was just a different like words that we were using
14237200	14238480	but it didn't mean anything
14238480	14239120	that's what it feels like
14239120	14239920	it was just like
14240000	14241520	if you're saying the R word
14241520	14243120	it's because you just want to call someone stupid
14243120	14244960	but you want to like do it a little bit more
14244960	14246080	like but it's not like
14246080	14247200	it didn't feel like it was like a
14247840	14248960	it's not like racist more like
14248960	14249600	yeah I'm not
14249600	14250400	you know it's not
14250400	14252000	agreement on this side here right
14252720	14254400	so like if he was saying the F word
14254400	14256640	because it was just like a word to like
14256640	14257680	insult someone
14257680	14259520	and he was like I don't think he was ever
14259520	14261040	I don't think you were ever homophobic
14261040	14262080	back in the day or anything like that
14262080	14263680	but I think it was just like a way
14263680	14265840	to express yourself maybe back then
14265840	14266880	I don't know I didn't do it
14266880	14268160	there's no videos of me or anything
14268160	14269440	because I wasn't even online back then
14269680	14270880	yeah so my case was
14270880	14272800	I definitely don't think
14272800	14274800	Stephen is homophobic or racer
14274800	14275680	any of those obviously
14275680	14276400	so the
14276400	14277520	there's a good heart there
14278160	14279200	and a good mind
14279200	14280160	I was just saying
14280160	14281200	he just likes being mean
14282080	14283120	well there is some
14283120	14284160	you lose yourself
14284160	14285760	and forget the bigger picture that
14286320	14287280	he's pushing for
14287920	14289680	more effective discourse on the internet
14289680	14291280	he's like an inspiration to a lot of people
14291280	14292000	especially now
14292560	14294160	of like how you can use effective
14294160	14296160	conversation to make for a better world
14296160	14298080	to derive a variety of glass people
14298080	14300320	and so on and then you lose some of that power
14301040	14302320	by losing yourself
14303120	14304880	in like the language
14304880	14306400	just more language of emotion
14306400	14308400	versus effective communication
14308400	14308800	I would say
14308800	14310400	but it's a gray area
14310400	14311200	I would say like something
14311200	14312960	that is probably recently done in that case
14312960	14314800	because it's been joking about women a lot
14315520	14316880	like it's women's fault they're bad
14316880	14318640	like it's just it's been like
14318640	14320240	a lot of jokes when it comes to misogyny
14320240	14321600	I guess in your community
14321600	14322720	and I think it's actually
14322720	14324000	turned people a little bit that way
14324000	14325280	that's why we've done the recent
14325280	14325440	misogyny
14325440	14327440	yes so that I guess that's actually
14327440	14329280	true because I don't think it was pretty
14329280	14330800	I don't think it was clear enough
14330800	14331760	I don't think it actually was
14331760	14333200	I think you did that mistake
14334400	14335920	but I think back then I was even saying
14335920	14337120	like hey you should probably not
14337120	14339200	like you probably should not do that
14340080	14341440	because it actually is pretty hard for me
14341440	14342960	because whenever I come into his community
14342960	14344000	like his chat
14344000	14344960	people are just going to spam
14344960	14345840	it's like a woman moment
14345840	14347440	it's a woman moment whenever I say something
14347440	14348400	and it's kind of like
14348400	14350400	yeah it's getting pretty annoying as I said
14350400	14352320	it's just annoying when you see it every single day
14353200	14353600	yeah
14353600	14354080	there you go
14354640	14356240	wisdom from somebody younger than you
14356960	14357760	wisdom can come from
14358400	14359200	all kind of people
14359200	14359840	yeah of course
14359840	14361440	just sometimes at very limited quantities
14361440	14362240	depends on the age
14363600	14365120	and learn something from anybody
14365120	14367360	what advice would you give to young people
14367360	14368160	the both of you
14369280	14371440	that you have both audiences
14371440	14372800	where young people look up to you
14373360	14374080	in general
14374080	14376320	if you were to give advice to somebody in high school
14376320	14377360	like how to
14378720	14380480	create a life that can be proud of
14380480	14381120	what would you say
14382720	14384800	the most important thing that I've learned
14384880	14387120	is to view people as different
14387120	14388560	and not better or worse
14388560	14389680	and when you view people as different
14389680	14390880	instead of better or worse
14390880	14392800	you learn that there's almost something
14392800	14393920	that you can learn from anybody
14394640	14395760	like be open and empathetic
14395760	14397440	towards other people's experiences
14397440	14399920	nobody does anything by random choice
14399920	14402240	like there's always reasons why people act the way they do
14402240	14404000	and as long as you're willing to kind of like
14404000	14407200	be open and receptive to the lived experiences of other people
14407200	14408960	you're going to be able to gather information
14408960	14411360	and create like a more cohesive and better view of the world
14411360	14412400	than any of your peers will
14413360	14416080	Do you have any kind of advice you can give to young folks?
14416080	14418080	I feel like something that I see
14418080	14419520	especially in America a lot
14419520	14421120	is that a lot of people
14421120	14423440	kind of get told what to do early on
14423440	14424480	like in high school
14424480	14425920	they're supposed to become this thing
14426800	14427760	like education wise
14427760	14429360	like they're supposed to like become a doctor
14429360	14430480	or this thing or whatever
14430480	14431840	and then they kind of just like give up on things
14431840	14433280	that they're actually passionate about
14433280	14435760	so I think a lot of teenagers get really confused
14435760	14437120	they get an education
14437120	14438240	and then they get that job
14438240	14439200	and they hate everything
14439200	14440080	and they think that
14440640	14442080	when they're reaching the job
14442160	14443280	when they're reaching like the journey
14443280	14444160	they're going to get happy
14444160	14445600	that's like where the happiness is going to be
14445600	14447440	but then when they get to there
14447440	14448640	they just hate everything
14448640	14450400	and then they become really depressed
14450400	14451840	and I've seen this so much
14451840	14453440	like I see this all the time
14453440	14456320	and it's pretty sad to me to see
14456320	14458160	so many people that are just wasting time
14458160	14460000	and then they just get really confused
14460000	14461680	and I don't know
14461680	14463200	it's the same thing with relationships too
14463200	14464960	no one really knows what they want anymore
14464960	14467040	I feel like everyone is just kind of doing whatever
14467040	14467920	like society is saying
14467920	14468720	or the parents are saying
14468720	14469600	or their friends are saying
14470560	14472960	and they're never really doing anything
14472960	14474480	that's super meaningful anymore
14474480	14476000	and like they don't
14476000	14476960	so what I would say is
14476960	14478160	like try to find something
14478160	14479840	that is important to you
14479840	14480880	it could be anything really
14480880	14482560	like some sort of passion
14482560	14483840	maybe like your friends
14483840	14485920	maybe like what matters to you
14485920	14487360	like figuring those things out
14487360	14488400	I think is really important
14488400	14490240	and that comes from being able to listen to
14490240	14491360	like some inner voice
14491360	14492640	so it's not gonna come from elsewhere
14492640	14494000	it's really hard because
14494000	14494960	you're living the life
14494960	14496480	and like there's things happening around you
14496480	14497360	and people tell you what to do
14497360	14499040	and what not to do and all you know
14499040	14500640	no one really has like their own opinions
14500640	14501600	everyone is just kind of like
14502320	14504320	listening to the cooler thing
14504320	14505280	or you know
14505280	14506080	except Steven
14506080	14507440	he seems to stand on his own
14507440	14507920	travel
14507920	14508400	if we think
14508400	14509280	yeah I'd say so
14509280	14509600	and like
14509600	14510240	on hashtag
14510240	14511360	like something I realized too
14511360	14512880	like because we just went to TwitchCon
14512880	14514640	and we were talking to a lot of streamers
14514640	14515040	what was that
14516000	14516720	it was interesting
14516720	14517840	I thought it was interesting
14517840	14520960	because the few people that I feel like I
14520960	14521840	that seem really cool
14521840	14524240	and that I look up to like in the streaming world
14524240	14525680	all of them wants to quit streaming
14526320	14527280	all of them wants to do it
14527280	14527760	no one wants
14527760	14528960	like no one likes it
14528960	14530640	and they're so successful
14530640	14533200	like they are around successful people
14533200	14535280	they they're working every single day
14535280	14535840	they're working hard
14535840	14537520	they're making so much money
14537520	14539520	and everyone is just complaining
14539520	14540960	and like they're complaining about
14542240	14545040	like not being able to see their partner
14545040	14545760	or you know
14545760	14547200	because they need to live somewhere else
14547200	14548880	because I see these things
14548880	14550720	and they seem extremely unhappy
14550720	14553040	and but it's so hard for them to just cut
14553040	14555040	all this successful stuff off
14555040	14556320	because that's like what you
14556320	14557840	you know learn to do
14558480	14560400	and that's like supposed to be like your happiness
14560400	14560880	but it isn't
14560880	14562240	everyone is really unhappy
14562240	14563520	yeah there's something about
14563520	14564880	maybe streaming is different
14564880	14566320	but YouTube folks too
14566320	14567680	I've interacted with a few and
14569200	14570400	even in podcasting space
14570960	14572960	people become obsessed about the views
14572960	14573520	and numbers
14573520	14575040	and subscribers and stuff like that
14576400	14577280	so I turn
14577280	14578960	I never talk about that
14578960	14580480	I don't pay attention to that
14581920	14584720	I feel like that's a drug that destroys
14585520	14586160	your mind
14586880	14588400	your your mind is an artist
14588400	14589600	ability to create
14589600	14590880	surely unique things
14591920	14592960	also your mind
14592960	14593920	in terms of the anxiety
14593920	14595280	the ups and downs of the
14596640	14597760	attention mechanism
14598800	14599680	and then also being
14600240	14602560	just if something that you make
14602560	14603440	is not popular
14603440	14604880	but it meant a lot to you
14604880	14606000	you will think of it less
14606800	14608000	because it's not popular
14608000	14609520	yeah that's a really dangerous thing
14609520	14611440	and because everyone around you
14611440	14612640	is reinforcing
14612640	14614080	like I'll get messages like
14614720	14615520	wow
14615520	14617360	this thing got this many views
14617360	14617920	or something
14618480	14619600	great job
14619600	14620880	it's like no
14620880	14621920	you don't get it
14621920	14622640	like that's not
14622640	14623120	that's not
14624080	14625520	everyone is enforcing this
14625520	14626800	like this language
14626800	14628960	of views and likes and so on
14628960	14629760	and it's
14629760	14630960	it's correlated of course
14630960	14632240	because truly impactful things
14632240	14633360	will get a lot of attention
14633920	14634240	often
14635040	14635280	but
14636000	14636560	it's not
14637280	14639200	on the individual local scale
14639200	14640480	like temporarily is
14641760	14642400	it's uh
14642400	14643600	it can really fuck with your mind
14643600	14644800	and I see that
14644880	14645600	in the creators
14645600	14646080	they become
14647920	14649600	addicts to the algorithm
14649600	14650800	lost in chasing views
14650800	14651840	like we know friends that
14651840	14652080	yes
14652080	14652800	we know cool people
14652800	14653760	and then they start streaming
14653760	14654480	and eventually they got
14654480	14656000	they're like chasing the dragon of like
14656800	14657760	and they change like
14657760	14658400	they're
14658400	14658880	yeah
14658880	14659200	it's like
14661200	14662000	this is something I've always said
14662000	14662480	that like
14662480	14663920	one of the biggest blessings
14663920	14665280	and biggest curses of humanity
14665280	14666960	is we are very good at acclimating
14666960	14668240	like you can become paralyzed
14668240	14669200	you can have all sorts of horrible
14669200	14669680	things happen to you
14669680	14670400	and you'll get used to it
14670400	14671040	and you'll be okay
14671040	14672400	you're gonna have like a good baseline
14672400	14673440	but it works the other way too
14673440	14674400	and that you can get more and more
14675200	14676080	and you acclimate to it
14676080	14677200	almost immediately
14677200	14677840	there's like
14677840	14678880	this is a phenomenon that
14678880	14680000	I bet it happens in the youtube world
14680000	14681200	but I know it happens in the streaming world
14681200	14682400	where you're streaming
14682400	14684160	1,000 viewers every day
14684160	14684960	huge event happens
14684960	14685760	and you blow up
14685760	14687440	and you got like 15,000 viewers
14687440	14688400	for a day or two
14688400	14689520	and then it starts to go down
14689520	14690720	and down and down and down and down
14690720	14692400	and then after all the drama started off
14692400	14693120	you're at like
14693120	14694800	3,000 concurrent viewers
14694800	14695920	now in the macro
14695920	14697520	you went from 1,000 to 3,000
14697520	14698560	that feels awesome
14698560	14699600	but you actually feel like
14699600	14700240	shit the whole time
14700240	14700880	because you're remembering
14700880	14702160	when you had 10 or 15,000
14702160	14703680	and now everything feels horrible
14703680	14705280	and you'll see people climb over time
14705280	14705680	and like
14705680	14705920	fuck
14705920	14707120	like but whatever that one huge stream
14707120	14707360	I had like
14707360	14708640	I've never like been able to
14708640	14709040	and it's like
14709040	14709920	dude you're doing great
14709920	14710640	what's yeah
14710640	14711520	that happens a lot
14711520	14712640	there's so many people that we know
14712640	14714160	that we find super super cool
14714160	14715520	they're passionate about things
14715520	14717120	they have so much interest
14717120	14718080	and then they just get like
14718080	14719440	so addicted to these numbers
14719440	14720240	and like all the
14720800	14721760	everything is just ruined
14721760	14722960	like all the cool things about them
14722960	14723280	is ruined
14723280	14724480	because they stop doing the things
14724480	14725360	that they actually like
14726320	14727120	to do something else
14727120	14728000	that gives them more viewers
14728000	14728720	and more money
14728720	14730560	and it's really sad to see
14730560	14731200	you know that
14731200	14732640	that temporary sacrifice
14732640	14735600	that seems temporary is
14735600	14736560	that it
14736560	14737600	it actually destroys you
14737600	14738480	like for one time
14738480	14739360	making a choice
14739360	14741360	because I come across those choices often
14741360	14742480	like I can do this
14742480	14743680	you can kind of know
14743680	14745360	what's going to be popular and not
14746240	14747680	and you have to ask yourself the question
14747680	14749040	like is this going to sacrifice
14749680	14751360	because if people are sacrificing
14751360	14753200	like intimate relationships
14753200	14754480	they're sacrificing time
14754480	14755120	with their family
14755120	14756000	they're like
14756000	14756880	sacrificing time
14756880	14757840	with the things that they
14757840	14758480	feel good about
14758480	14759200	and that they like
14760160	14761760	and that's something I kind of
14761760	14762960	realized last year
14762960	14764320	because I was working so much
14764320	14765120	and I was just grinding
14765120	14765840	and grinding and grinding
14765840	14767200	because it was kind of new for me
14767200	14768960	and then new years came by
14768960	14769440	and I was like
14769440	14770560	wait what did I even do
14770560	14771760	like the entire year
14771760	14773680	like I traveled to a bunch of places
14773680	14774480	but nothing actually
14774480	14775440	really meant anything to me
14775440	14776400	because I felt like I was just
14776400	14777440	working the entire time
14777440	14778400	I felt like I was just numb
14778400	14778880	through the
14778880	14779600	through the entire year
14779600	14780560	and I was really scary
14782640	14783760	like I rented a
14784320	14785520	like a super pretty house
14785520	14786320	like for a week
14786320	14787600	with my dad and my sister
14787600	14789440	because I wanted to spend time with them
14789440	14790800	but the entire time
14790800	14792400	I was just streaming
14792400	14793520	and I actually
14793520	14794640	didn't ever like calm down
14794640	14795360	and just like
14795360	14796080	chill with them
14796080	14796640	and I
14796640	14797440	like that's like time
14797440	14798640	I'll never get back
14798640	14799040	I don't
14799040	14800240	I don't give a shit about the money
14800240	14801040	that I made that week
14801040	14802240	but I lost the time
14803040	14803920	and like
14803920	14805360	that is really important to me
14805360	14805760	and I
14805760	14807200	yeah and a lot of people are doing that
14807760	14808480	and I feel like
14808480	14808960	as you said
14808960	14809920	like you can definitely see that
14809920	14810640	in like artists
14811280	14811760	for sure
14811760	14812240	I feel like
14812240	14813440	if you look at like artists
14813440	14815360	like back in the 60s or 70s
14815360	14816400	I feel like things were just
14816400	14817680	so much better back then
14817680	14818240	and it feels like
14818240	14820160	they were actually making music
14820240	14821600	that meant something to them
14821600	14822800	they were actually making art
14823360	14824320	and I feel like today
14824320	14825680	everything is just kind of like
14825680	14826480	whatever is cool
14826480	14827280	whatever sells
14827280	14828000	whatever you know
14828000	14828960	sounds in a certain way
14828960	14829920	everything is kind of
14829920	14830960	the same thing
14830960	14832640	and everything that is very artistic
14832640	14833360	and very cool
14833360	14835040	is actually not that popular
14835040	14835440	at all
14836080	14837200	and that's kind of sad
14838000	14839040	yeah of course there's now
14839040	14840720	bigger mechanisms and platforms
14840720	14841200	to spread
14841920	14842480	stuff
14842480	14842880	music
14843760	14845600	so as long as you could be content
14845600	14847120	with not being popular
14847120	14848560	I think you can still create good art
14848560	14849360	but not like
14849360	14850560	when people get a little popular
14850560	14852080	they get addicted to that so fast
14852080	14853200	yeah it's weird
14853200	14853680	yeah
14853680	14855760	you have been somewhat good
14855760	14857120	at least from my outside of perspective
14857680	14858800	because I think you
14859600	14860960	I can at least imagine
14860960	14861760	you making choices
14861760	14863520	that could make you more popular
14863520	14865520	and you don't seem to make those choices
14866960	14868080	sabotage my career
14869520	14870640	but it is very intentional
14870640	14871120	like you said
14871120	14872160	like and I made that choice
14872160	14874400	at every single stage of my life
14874400	14875200	one is because
14875200	14875920	from the perspective
14875920	14876720	of being a carpet cleaner
14876720	14877840	my life is way better
14877840	14878560	than that
14878560	14879840	was or ever would have been
14879840	14881440	so I'm already doing way better than I ever thought
14881440	14882560	somebody like me ever could be
14883200	14884320	but then two
14884320	14886240	I super love my job
14886240	14887120	every time I wake up
14887120	14888720	every time I fly to a place to do a podcast
14888720	14889840	every time I get to talk to really cool people
14889840	14891280	like every single part of my job
14891280	14891840	I super like
14891840	14892880	if there's something I don't like
14892880	14893520	I just cut it off
14893520	14894080	because I don't care
14894080	14895120	because I'm already making plenty of money
14895120	14895920	doing what I do
14895920	14897040	and why would I ever wake up
14897040	14898080	and not like what I'm doing
14898080	14899440	when I can't like what I'm doing
14899440	14900480	how do you guys find
14900480	14901200	through that
14901200	14901680	given that
14902720	14903520	you love it
14903520	14905920	and sometimes maybe lose yourself in the drug of it
14905920	14907520	how do you find
14907600	14908720	like work-life balance
14908720	14910080	together inside a relationship
14910800	14911760	like time for each other
14912560	14913520	I don't at all so
14913520	14914880	I'm not a good person to ask
14914880	14915760	what do you love more
14916320	14917920	Mel or Faktor
14918960	14920400	Faktor is a really good game
14920400	14921680	that's like not a fair comparison
14921680	14922320	okay you're talking about
14922320	14923920	one of the best cleanest games
14923920	14925600	best support ever made
14925600	14926800	cleanest code base
14926800	14927520	like this is
14927520	14928640	I think it's Thanos brother
14928640	14930400	yeah it's more Faktor time for me
14931920	14932560	starting to understand
14932560	14933760	where the massaging comes from
14933760	14934160	by the way
14934720	14937120	is Faktor a legit really good game
14937120	14937840	yeah of course yeah
14937840	14938320	I'm cool
14938320	14939040	if you're like
14939040	14940160	do you enjoy programming
14940800	14941680	of course that's all I do
14941680	14942960	that's all that's okay
14942960	14944560	to me programming is
14945120	14946080	is the game in itself
14946080	14947760	that I enjoy probably more than anything else
14947760	14948240	but yeah
14948240	14949520	it's very much a game like that
14949520	14950720	of like if you're into stuff like that
14950720	14952240	like you can lose hundreds of hours
14952240	14953760	like very quickly to
14953760	14954880	like you have a problem
14954880	14956160	and then you think of a solution
14956160	14957040	and then you iterate on that
14957040	14958080	over and over and over again
14958080	14959120	in larger larger schemes
14959120	14960320	sometimes you got to redesign stuff
14960320	14960880	sometimes you got like
14960880	14962000	it's a very much like that kind of game
14962000	14963520	this year essentially building a factory
14963520	14964800	like what on a foreign planet
14964800	14965520	or something like that
14965520	14966720	it's basically it's like
14966720	14967920	a bunch of you're trying to automate
14967920	14968720	different problems
14968720	14970160	so that you can build bigger things
14970160	14971600	so that you can automate bigger problems
14971600	14972400	so you can build bigger things
14972400	14973360	and automate bigger problems
14973360	14974480	so it's more complicated
14974480	14976240	than like a city building game
14976240	14977600	like some city type of thing
14978160	14979600	I wouldn't say it's more complicated
14979600	14980960	it's more it's like
14980960	14983040	Faktor is like a game of like logic
14983040	14984560	like strictly like logic
14984560	14985760	like it's almost like a building
14985760	14986720	a circuit or something
14986720	14987280	yes yeah
14987280	14988320	there's like their circuitry
14988320	14989280	and you've got your and orgs
14989280	14989840	or against you
14989840	14990800	like there's stuff like that
14990800	14991520	it's very much like that
14991520	14993120	like what are the enemies in the game
14993120	14994240	like what they're like
14994240	14995920	so I try to bite you
14995920	14997440	and you can get guns and shoot and kill them
14997440	14999440	but I saw there's like shooting going on
14999440	14999680	yeah
14999680	15000320	but that's like a mind
15000320	15001040	it's just like another problem
15001040	15002080	to solve in the game basically
15002080	15002400	yeah
15002400	15002960	okay
15002960	15003680	all right
15003680	15004720	see see what we did there
15004720	15006320	we just started talking about the game
15006320	15007520	as we're trying
15007520	15008560	oh my god that's like
15008560	15009040	like a game
15009040	15009680	okay
15009680	15010560	that's horrible
15010560	15011840	anyway is there
15011840	15013360	is that basically the struggle
15013360	15014240	not stop struggle
15014240	15015760	how to get human
15016880	15018320	like intimate human time
15019200	15020080	I feel like it was like that
15020080	15021680	a little bit more in the past
15021680	15022800	I feel like it's been better
15023760	15024640	lately
15024720	15025760	but I think it's because
15026480	15027520	when we started dating
15027520	15028560	I wasn't streaming
15028560	15029840	and I kind of just like
15029840	15032080	gave up like my trip in New Zealand
15032080	15033120	I give up like
15033120	15035440	like I left Sweden
15035440	15036640	so I was just like
15036640	15037600	in LA
15037600	15038240	which I hate
15038240	15038720	I hate LA
15038720	15039680	I don't like LA at all
15040480	15042480	it's hard to make friends
15042480	15043440	that are like real
15043440	15045120	that are into the same stuff as you
15045120	15046400	it was just really hard for me
15046400	15047520	to connect with anyone
15047520	15049680	especially also like being a European
15049680	15050880	and like being around Americans
15050880	15052160	was very strange
15052160	15053680	so the only thing I had
15053680	15054800	when I came here
15054800	15055280	was him
15056000	15058240	and I didn't expect
15058240	15058960	that situation
15058960	15059600	because yeah
15059600	15060560	because we had
15060560	15062480	we had like two weeks of hanging out
15062480	15063520	and like he would be on his computer
15063520	15064080	sometimes
15064080	15065120	and like do emails and stuff
15065120	15066400	but I wasn't thinking
15066400	15067920	that he would stream like 12 hours a day
15067920	15068560	and it was pretty
15068560	15069440	like it was pretty intense
15069440	15070640	like in the beginning of it as well
15070640	15072480	and I realized it was really hard
15072480	15073600	to like get attention
15073600	15074160	and get time
15074160	15076480	because his like love meter
15076480	15077840	would be like full
15077840	15079120	if I was just in the house
15079120	15080000	and that's just kind of like
15080000	15080720	the way he is
15080720	15081680	and for me back then
15081680	15083120	when I didn't have anything else to do
15083840	15086000	it was kind of like a
15086000	15088000	it was kind of crazy for me
15088000	15088880	I feel like right now
15088880	15090400	because I do work as well
15090400	15092800	and I have things going for me
15092800	15094000	and I have other friends
15094640	15095680	now that I made
15095680	15097120	I feel like it's a lot easier
15097120	15098480	because and I can definitely like
15098480	15100560	enjoy just like being in separate rooms
15100560	15101840	and just like hear him in the background
15101840	15102400	is really nice
15102400	15102960	so I can like
15102960	15104240	I can sit in paint
15104240	15105200	and like in my room
15105200	15106240	and I will do that for hours
15106240	15107360	while I'm just like hearing a scream
15107360	15107840	in the background
15107840	15109280	it's kind of like comforting
15109280	15110400	that he's he's just there
15110400	15111120	it feels nice
15111120	15111440	I like it
15112000	15113680	to you that's the sound of happiness
15113680	15115200	yes because I know he's right there
15115200	15115760	yeah it's nice
15115760	15116320	and they will come in
15116320	15117280	and check on me sometimes
15117280	15118240	and it's it's kind of like
15118240	15119280	it's actually very comforting
15119280	15119840	it's very nice
15119840	15120320	I like it
15121120	15121760	yeah
15121760	15123520	I think that's kind of what a relationship is
15123520	15124880	like you do fun things together
15124880	15126560	you know you share moments together
15126560	15127440	but also just like
15127440	15128640	having someone like around
15128640	15129680	you's really really nice
15130640	15131680	and I think that's probably
15132240	15133440	maybe it's me growing up
15134640	15135680	maybe that's what it is
15135680	15137680	and like I start liking like the kind of
15137680	15139040	I feel like we're like an old couple
15139040	15139920	like we're like 80
15139920	15140800	and we're just like around
15141200	15142720	we don't really have to talk much
15142720	15144160	it's it's nice to just do that
15144160	15146080	that fills your love meter
15146080	15147040	that person
15147040	15148400	I like this terminology
15148400	15148720	love me
15148720	15149360	I need both
15149360	15150080	I mean okay
15150640	15152320	you're making it sound like
15152320	15153520	that I'm like craving like
15153520	15154480	I haven't said anything
15154480	15155280	I'm not saying anything
15155280	15156160	I haven't said a single thing at all
15156160	15157200	you're making face right now
15157200	15158480	I know exactly what you're thinking so
15158480	15159840	there's so much judging going on
15159840	15161040	there's no judging at all
15161040	15161760	no but like we
15161760	15162320	I think
15162320	15164480	I think whenever we do plan something out
15164480	15166080	like if we if we go on a trip
15166080	15167600	like every other month or once a month
15168240	15169520	I feel like usually like
15169520	15170320	that's enough
15171040	15172640	as long as he's not playing
15172640	15174000	factorial the entire time
15174000	15175360	like if he if I feel like
15175360	15176480	he's going on these trips with me
15176480	15176960	and he's not
15177840	15178800	like doing things with me
15178800	15180160	or he's not he's not interested
15180160	15181120	in like spending time
15181120	15182560	or like being present with me
15182560	15183280	then I'll feel like
15183280	15184640	I just feel like I'm just wasting time
15184640	15184960	right now
15184960	15186480	and then I get kind of disappointed
15186480	15188160	but otherwise I think this
15188160	15188880	like this is fun
15188880	15189840	I think this is like spending time
15189840	15190640	together
15190640	15191840	because we're like doing something together
15191840	15193280	yeah it's fun yeah
15194160	15195360	my love meter is
15195760	15197280	your love meter is full
15197280	15198320	it's my social life
15198320	15199200	otherwise we like to
15199200	15200560	we like to think about it that way
15200800	15202160	like I need like a little bit more of
15202160	15203120	like this one thing
15203120	15204160	like quality time
15204160	15204960	and he needs like
15204960	15206160	almost zero quality time
15206880	15207760	but like let's say that I
15207760	15209200	we took away like physical touch
15209200	15210400	you would probably not be very happy
15211520	15212720	so you need physical touch
15212720	15214080	so it's not just back to me huh
15214080	15215200	no I'm a very cuddly person
15215200	15216400	yeah like cuddly
15216400	15217120	and then you're like
15217120	15218320	I guess like acts of service
15218320	15219440	like if I do something for you
15219440	15220160	get really happy
15220160	15220960	like hot chocolate
15220960	15221680	yeah
15221680	15222800	like if I give him hot chocolate
15222800	15224080	in the morning he gets really happy
15224080	15224640	so
15224640	15225600	the actual
15225600	15226640	it's not the hot chocolate
15226640	15228000	it's the giving of the hot chocolate
15228000	15228960	no it's just the hot chocolate
15229520	15230400	but if she gives it to me
15230560	15231520	I didn't have to get it myself
15231520	15232000	it was just physical touch
15232000	15233040	that's really nice
15234240	15235440	all right well if you have to choose
15235440	15237200	between Factorio and the drama
15238080	15239200	or political discourse
15239920	15241200	which probably political discourse
15241200	15242320	probably my calling
15242320	15244000	but I am a good Factorio player
15245360	15247840	like what role exactly does Factorio play
15247840	15249280	in your streaming life
15249840	15251040	oh well right now it's just
15251040	15252240	usually there are like these games
15252240	15253040	that I play in the background
15253040	15253920	as I have conversation
15253920	15255280	because it's hard for me to just sit on the computer
15255280	15255760	just talk
15256320	15257840	and not like be playing a game at the same time
15257840	15259760	so it's just something to keep me kind of like occupied
15259760	15260960	you know I was going to buy like those little like
15260960	15261840	widget things I guess
15261840	15262720	yeah that's what yours is
15262720	15263440	yeah basically yeah
15263440	15265040	it's like minecraft or Factorio for me
15265920	15266240	all right
15267120	15269360	well my love meter is full from this
