0	9000	The following is a conversation with Sean Kelly, a philosopher at Harvard specializing in existentialism and the philosophy of mind.
9000	15000	This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
15000	20000	And now, here's my conversation with Sean Kelly.
20000	34000	Your interests are in postcontain European philosophy, especially phenomenology and existentialism. So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?
34000	38000	So it's a hard question. I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.
38000	39000	You are.
39000	44000	I am, yeah. Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.
44000	56000	I mean, the traditional thing to say about what existentialism is, is that it's a movement in mid 20th century, mostly French, some German philosophy.
56000	67000	And some of the major figures associated with it are people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, maybe Martin Heidegger.
67000	73000	But that's a weird thing to say about it, because most of those people denied that they were existentialists.
73000	79000	And in fact, I think of it as a movement that has a much longer history.
79000	89000	So when I try to describe what the core idea of existentialism is, it's an idea that you find expressed in different ways in a bunch of these people.
89000	102000	One of the ways that it's expressed is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the view that there is no God and at least his form of existentialism.
102000	106000	He calls it atheistic existentialism. There is no God.
106000	114000	And since there is no God, there must be some other being around who does something like what God does.
114000	119000	Otherwise, there wouldn't be any possibility for significance in a life.
119000	137000	And that being is us. And the feature of us, according to Sartre and the other existentialists, that puts us in the position to be able to play that role is that we're the beings for whom, as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.
137000	143000	That's the catchphrase for existentialism. And then you have to try to figure out what it means.
143000	146000	What is existence? What is presence? And what does precedes mean?
146000	150000	Yeah, exactly. What is existence? What is essence? And what is precedes?
150000	155000	And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it and other people will talk about it differently.
155000	162000	But here's the way Sartre thinks about it. This is not, I think, the most interesting way to think about it, but I'll get you started.
162000	174000	Sartre says, there's nothing true about what it is to be you until you start existing, until you start living.
174000	191000	And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is to be existing, the way we do, is to be making decisions, to be making choices in your life, to be sort of taking a stand on what it is to be you by deciding to do this or that.
191000	205000	And the key feature of how to do that right, for Sartre, is to do it in the full recognition of the fact that when you make that choice, nobody is responsible for it other than you.
205000	216000	So you don't make the choice because God tells you to. You don't make the choice because some utilitarian calculus about what it's right to do tells you to do.
216000	230000	You don't make the choice because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it. There's literally nothing on the basis of which you make the choice other than the fact that in that moment, you're the one making it.
230000	239000	You are conscious thinking being that made a decision. So all the questions about physics and free will are out the window.
239000	260000	Yeah, that's right. If you were a determinist about the mind, if you were a physicalist about the mind, if you thought there was nothing to your choices other than the activity of the brain that's governed by physical laws, then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate like you're not the ground of that choice.
261000	266000	The ground of that choice was the physical universe and the laws that govern it, and then you'd have no responsibility.
266000	278000	And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special about us, used to be special about God, is that we're responsible for becoming the being that makes the choices that we do.
278000	293000	And Sartre thinks that that's simultaneously empowering. I mean, it practically puts us in the place of God and also terrifying because what responsibility? How can you possibly take on that responsibility?
294000	311000	And he thinks it's worse than that. He thinks that it's always happening. Everything that you do is the result of some choice that you've made, the posture that you sit in, the way you hold someone's gaze when you're having a conversation with them or not,
311000	324000	the choice to make a note when someone says something or not make a note. Everything that you do presents you as a being who makes decisions and you're responsible for all of them.
324000	335000	So it's constantly happening. And furthermore, there's no fact about you independent of the choices and actions you've performed.
336000	345000	So you don't get to say, Sartre's example, I really am a great writer, just haven't written my great book yet. If you haven't written your great book, you're not a great writer.
345000	358000	And so it's terrifying. It puts a huge burden on us. And that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism, human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.
359000	368000	Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to become someone through making them. And we can't get away from that.
368000	374000	But to him, it's terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating.
374000	384000	Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous individual to be liberated by it. Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.
384000	399000	I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition. But what's liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain way, you're the ground of your own being.
399000	409000	You become what you do through existing. So that's one form of existentialism. That's a stark atheistic version of it. There's lots of other versions.
409000	421000	But it's somehow organized around the idea that it's through living your life that you become who you are. It's not facts that are sort of true about you, independent of your living your life.
422000	434000	But then if there's no God in that view, does any of the decisions matter? So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?
434000	445000	Good. Okay. Great question. There was two different ways that you're asking it. Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering.
445000	453000	Or is there any way that you can criticize someone for doing, for living the way they do if you're an existentialist?
453000	454000	Including yourself.
454000	464000	Including yourself, yeah. Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make of yourself or of others.
464000	470000	And it's the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for your choices.
470000	484000	He gives these two sort of amazing examples. I don't know if it reads as well as for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris, but it's about a waiter.
484000	487000	He gives this in his big book Being and Nothingness.
487000	501000	And he says, so waiters played still do, I think, in a certain way in Paris. A big role in Parisian society to be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity, being a certain way.
501000	513000	Taking control of and charge of the experience of the people that you're waiting on, but also really being the authority, like knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go.
513000	533000	And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it that he's doing it because he believes that's the way a waiter should act.
534000	545000	So there's some sense in which he's passing off the responsibility for his actions onto some idea of what those actions should be. He's not taking responsibility for it.
545000	552000	He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other than him.
552000	565000	So he starts acting in bad faith. And that's criticisable because it's acting in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.
565000	575000	So you're not taking responsibility. So that's one example. And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager, you've known someone who does that.
575000	586000	If teenagers try on roles, they think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool. So I'll dress like this. Or if I spoke like this or acted like this.
586000	596000	And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out what their identity is to go through a phase like that. But if you continue to do that, then you're really passing.
596000	616000	That's one example. And the other example he gives is an example, not of passing off responsibility by pretending that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all.
616000	640000	So he says, you're always everything you do is a result of your choices. And so he gives this other example. There you are on the first date, first date. And the date, the evening reaches moments when might be appropriate for one person to hold the hand of the other.
640000	657000	That's the moment in the date where you are. And so you make a choice. You decide, I think it's that time and you hold the hand. And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on SART's view. Either they reject the hand, not that time.
657000	674000	And I'm taking responsibility for that. Or they grasp the hand back. That's a choice. But there's a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the hand there cold, dead and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.
675000	696000	And SART says, that's also bad faith. That's also acting as if we're kind of being that we're not, because it pretends that it's possible not to make a choice. And we're the beings who are always making choices. That was a choice. And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing that you don't have to take responsibility for.
696000	712000	So both of the examples you've given, there's some sense in which the social interactions between humans is the kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a human in the view of existentialism should take on.
712000	732000	So like, isn't the basic conversation a delegation of responsibility? Just holding a hand there. You're putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person. And for the waiter, if you're existing a society, you are generally trying on a role.
733000	754000	All of us are trying on a role. Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try as opposed to walking around naked all the time. There's like standards of how you operate. And that's a decision that's not my own. That's me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them.
754000	775000	Yeah, exactly. So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that. Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue to how you should live well. So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.
775000	796000	Why is hell other people for Sartre? Well, because other people are making choices also. And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice they made is one that I should copy or one that I should sort of promote.
796000	823000	But if I do it because they did it, then I'm in bad faith for Sartre. So it is as if Sartre's view is like we would be better if we were all alone. I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position. And this is really just mostly Sartre in a certain period of his formation. But anyhow, we can imagine that view. And I think there's something to the idea that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in the mid 40s.
824000	842000	Can you dig into hell as other people? Is there some, obviously it's kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly to really explore that point. But is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience of what it means to be human?
843000	865000	I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this. Like, it's not just that you wear clothes because people wear clothes in our society. Like you have a particular style. You wear a particular kind of clothes. And for Sartre, to have that style authentically in good faith rather than in bad faith, it has to come from you. You have to make the choice.
865000	888000	But other people are making choices also. And like you're looking at their choices and you're thinking, that guy looks good. Maybe I could try that one on. And if you try it on because you were influenced by the fact that you thought that guy was doing it well, then there's some important sense in which, although that's a resource for a choice for you, it's also acting in bad faith.
888000	900000	And God wouldn't do that, right? God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions. And if that's the model, then that's, I think that's the sense in which he thinks hell is other people.
900000	905000	What do you think parenting is then? It's like what, because God doesn't have a parent.
905000	906000	Yeah.
906000	911000	Aren't we significantly influenced first of all in the first few years of life?
911000	912000	Absolutely.
912000	919000	And even the teenager is resisting, learning through resistance.
919000	920000	Absolutely.
920000	932000	I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre's aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal.
932000	937000	And there's many ways in which we're not like the traditional view of what God was.
937000	942000	One is that we're not self-generating. We have parents.
942000	948000	We're raised into traditions and social norms.
948000	955000	And we're raised into an understanding of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do.
955000	961000	And I think that's a deep intuition. I think that's exactly right.
961000	966000	Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks he's sort of taking this from,
966000	975000	but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger's German phenomenological view.
975000	981000	Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our thrownness.
981000	985000	We're thrown into a situation. We're thrown into history.
985000	990000	We're thrown into our parental lineage. And we don't choose it.
990000	993000	That's stuff that we don't choose. We couldn't choose.
993000	998000	If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we're not.
998000	1003000	We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning that we never chose.
1003000	1009000	We have an end that we're often trying to resist or put off or something.
1009000	1015000	And in between, there's a whole bunch of stuff that organizes us without our ever having made the choice
1015000	1020000	and without the kind of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.
1020000	1024000	We have a complicated relationship to that stuff.
1024000	1026000	And I think we should talk about that at a certain point.
1026000	1032000	But the first move is to say, Sartre's just got a sort of descriptive problem.
1032000	1039000	He's missed this basic fact that there has to be an awful lot about us
1039000	1045000	that's settled without our having made the choice to settle it that way.
1045000	1048000	Right. The thrownness of life.
1048000	1049000	Yeah.
1049000	1052000	That's a fundamental part of life. You can't just escape it.
1052000	1054000	Exactly. You can't escape it altogether.
1054000	1055000	Altogether.
1055000	1057000	Yeah, exactly. You can't escape it altogether.
1057000	1063000	But nevertheless, you are riding a wave and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.
1063000	1068000	You can't control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it,
1068000	1073000	you should be making certain kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.
1073000	1077000	So why does this matter at all?
1077000	1079000	The chain of decisions you make.
1079000	1083000	Good. Well, because they constitute you, they make you the person that you are.
1083000	1086000	So what's the opposite view?
1086000	1088000	What's this view against?
1088000	1093000	This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward.
1093000	1102000	Plato says in the Republic, it's a kind of myth, but he says people will understand their condition.
1102000	1109000	Well, if we tell them this myth, he says, look, when you're born, there's just a fact about you.
1109000	1113000	Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze.
1113000	1117000	Those are the three kinds of people there are, and you're born that way.
1117000	1122000	If your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king.
1122000	1126000	And if your soul is silver, well, you're not going to be a philosopher king.
1126000	1130000	You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior and we should make you that.
1130000	1133000	And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer or laborer or something like that.
1133000	1142000	And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of anything you do about it.
1142000	1145000	And so that's the alternative view.
1145000	1147000	And you could have modern versions of it.
1147000	1158000	You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ or your genetic makeup or the percentage of fast-switch muscle fibers you've got or whatever.
1158000	1166000	It could be something totally independent of any choice that you've made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could make a choice.
1166000	1169000	And it categorizes you.
1169000	1171000	It makes you the person that you are.
1171000	1175000	That's the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against.
1175000	1182000	So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you can make.
1182000	1186000	Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.
1186000	1189000	Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.
1189000	1190000	Radical freedom.
1190000	1192000	Yeah, radical freedom.
1192000	1200000	And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we got to understand the way in which our freedom is limited by certain things.
1200000	1204000	We're limited by certain aspects of the kind of being that we are.
1204000	1209000	If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense.
1209000	1218000	And sort of these folks start with the idea that, look, whatever we are, that's a kind of limit point that we're not going to reach.
1218000	1227000	So what are the ways in which we're constrained that that being the way the medieval's understood him wasn't constrained?
1227000	1237000	So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?
1237000	1238000	Yes, good.
1238000	1239000	Excellent.
1239000	1246000	So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before him is Nietzsche.
1246000	1253000	Nietzsche is writing in the end of the 19th century in various places where he published things.
1253000	1263000	But largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition of the modern world as nihilistic.
1263000	1266000	And that's a descriptive claim.
1266000	1273000	He's looking around him, trying to figure out what it's like to be us now.
1273000	1283000	And he says it's a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century BCE.
1283000	1298000	In 1300, like what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God.
1298000	1300000	That's the way they understood themselves.
1300000	1307000	And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden.
1307000	1316000	And to have the project of trying to understand how as a sinful being, you could nevertheless live a life of virtuous life.
1316000	1317000	How could you do that?
1317000	1321000	And it had to do with for them getting in the right relation to God.
1321000	1326000	Nietzsche says, that doesn't make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century.
1326000	1329000	God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.
1329000	1331000	And what does that mean?
1331000	1341000	Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves as a culture isn't a role that God can play anymore.
1341000	1347000	And so Nietzsche says, the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence.
1347000	1351000	He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.
1351000	1358000	And Nietzsche says, the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn't make sense anymore.
1358000	1361000	That's like Sartre's atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.
1361000	1366000	And so the question is, what does ground our existence?
1366000	1369000	And the answer is, nihil, nothing.
1369000	1374000	And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing outside of us that grounds our existence.
1374000	1379000	And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?
1379000	1381000	How do we live?
1381000	1386000	And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that.
1386000	1392000	Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.
1392000	1394000	Nietzsche emphasizes something else.
1394000	1398000	He says, we're artists of life.
1398000	1407000	And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they're responding to something.
1408000	1412000	They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what's going to make sense of the situation.
1412000	1414000	This is what I have to write.
1414000	1416000	This is the way I have to dance.
1416000	1418000	This is the way I've got to play the music.
1418000	1421000	And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.
1421000	1429000	There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living itself.
1430000	1437000	And there's a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this.
1437000	1441000	I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist when Nietzsche was writing,
1441000	1446000	but I think Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation.
1446000	1448000	I mean, he talks about improvisation.
1448000	1449000	There's classical improvisation.
1449000	1451000	Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.
1451000	1454000	I mean, he was a composer and a pianist.
1454000	1458000	Not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.
1458000	1467000	And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite a while in the 60s,
1467000	1482000	tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative.
1482000	1486000	And that gives us a certain kind of freedom.
1487000	1491000	But we don't have the radical freedom that starts things.
1491000	1492000	So what's the story?
1492000	1503000	Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things were great, he says.
1503000	1507000	He's a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master.
1507000	1514000	And he says, I'm playing the, I'm back in the solo and I'm playing these chords.
1514000	1521000	And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord.
1521000	1525000	He's like, it just, like, that's what you got to say.
1525000	1527000	It didn't work right there.
1527000	1532000	And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, you know, I screwed up, we were tight, everything was working.
1532000	1535000	And I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.
1535000	1541000	And he said, Miles paused for a moment.
1541000	1549000	And then all of a sudden he went on in a way that made my chord right.
1551000	1562000	And I think that idea that, like, you could be an artist who responds to what's thrown at you in such a way as to make it right.
1563000	1565000	By what measure?
1565000	1567000	Everyone could hear it is all you can say.
1567000	1571000	Everyone knew, wow, that really works.
1571000	1576000	And I think that's not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there.
1576000	1579000	He couldn't have just played anything.
1579000	1583000	Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible.
1583000	1586000	But the constraints aren't like pre-existing.
1586000	1592000	They're sort of what's happening now in the moment for these listeners and these performers.
1592000	1595000	And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is.
1595000	1602000	We're involved, but we're not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it the way Sartre thinks.
1602000	1605000	Our choices have to be responsive to our situation.
1605000	1608000	And they have to make the situation work.
1608000	1610000	They have to make it right.
1610000	1612000	And there's something about music, too.
1612000	1617000	So you basically have to make music of all the moments of life.
1617000	1619000	And there is something about music.
1619000	1621000	Why is music so compelling?
1621000	1626000	And when you listen to it, something about certain kinds of music, it connects with you.
1626000	1627000	It doesn't make any sense.
1627000	1634000	But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical masterpiece.
1634000	1635000	Exactly.
1635000	1640000	And I think what's interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force there?
1640000	1645000	There's a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God.
1645000	1650000	God creates ex nihilo out of nothing.
1650000	1655000	And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo,
1655000	1658000	because it's about how there's nothing at our ground.
1658000	1663000	But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don't create out of nothing.
1663000	1665000	Miles Davis, it wasn't nothing.
1665000	1667000	That situation pre-existed him.
1667000	1669000	It was given to him.
1669000	1672000	Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever.
1672000	1677000	But he was responding to that situation in a way that made it right.
1677000	1679000	He wasn't just creating out of nothing.
1679000	1681000	He was creating out of what was already there.
1681000	1685000	So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated.
1685000	1690000	Because you're given a climbing hand, you're going to have to make art and music out of that.
1690000	1691000	Exactly.
1691000	1694000	That's the responsibility for both of them.
1694000	1699000	Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for his day, because you have to create.
1699000	1702000	So the emphasis isn't just on making decisions.
1702000	1706000	It's on creating.
1706000	1708000	But also on listening, right?
1708000	1711000	I mean, Miles Davis was listening.
1711000	1712000	He heard that.
1712000	1713000	He knew it was wrong.
1713000	1717000	And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?
1717000	1721000	So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?
1721000	1723000	What do you mean by that statement?
1723000	1724000	Yeah.
1724000	1732000	What's in your sense the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that our world today provides?
1732000	1733000	Good.
1733000	1742000	So I mean, I think that there's something super perceptive about Nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition at the end of the 19th century.
1742000	1746000	So not so far from the condition that I think we're currently in.
1747000	1752000	And I think there's an interesting question, what we're supposed to respond, what we're supposed to do in response.
1752000	1754000	But what is the condition that we're currently in?
1754000	1768000	When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for us anymore as a culture.
1769000	1777000	And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology, but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.
1777000	1780000	They say we live in a secular age.
1780000	1782000	Our age is a secular age.
1782000	1784000	And so what do people mean when they say that?
1784000	1787000	I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.
1787000	1788000	It could be wrong.
1788000	1796000	The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?
1797000	1801000	So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?
1801000	1805000	Well, first thing is, it doesn't mean there are no religious believers because there are plenty.
1805000	1811000	There are lots of people who go to church or synagogue or mosque, you know, every week or more.
1811000	1818000	And there are people who really find that to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.
1819000	1832000	But it does mean that for those people, the role that their religious belief plays in their life isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.
1832000	1834000	So what's that role?
1834000	1836000	We'll go back to the High Middle Ages.
1836000	1838000	That was clearly not a secular age.
1838000	1840000	That was a religious age.
1840000	1843000	And so there we are in 1300.
1843000	1846000	Dante is writing the Divine Comedy or something.
1846000	1850000	And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?
1850000	1870000	Well, it meant not just that the default was that you were a Christian in the West, but that your Christianity, your religious belief, your religious affiliation justified certain assumptions about people who didn't share that religious belief.
1871000	1886000	So you're a Christian in the West in 1300 and you meet someone who's a Muslim and the fact that they don't share your religious belief justifies the conclusion that they're less than human.
1886000	1890000	And that was the ground of the crusades.
1890000	1894000	That was the religious wars of the High Middle Ages.
1895000	1902000	To say that we live in a secular age is to say that there aren't a lot of people who have religious belief, there are.
1902000	1908000	But it's to say that their religious belief doesn't justify that conclusion.
1908000	1922000	If you're a religious believer and you meet me and suppose I'm not a religious believer, learning that about me doesn't justify your concluding that I'm less than human.
1922000	1925000	And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.
1925000	1928000	Most of the time we think that's a good thing.
1928000	1930000	We let a thousand flowers bloom.
1930000	1932000	There are lots of ways to live a good life.
1932000	1938000	And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive kind of liberal thought.
1938000	1955000	But it's also true that it's an undermining thought because it means if you're a religious believer now, your belief can't ground your understanding of what you ought to be aiming at in the life in the way it used to be able to.
1955000	1972000	You can't say, as a religious believer, I know it's right to do this because you also know that if you meet someone who doesn't share that religious belief and so doesn't think it's right to do that necessarily or does but for different reasons, you can't conclude that they've got it wrong.
1972000	1976000	So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.
1976000	1996000	Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude as a public statement to others, but within your own mind, it's almost like an existentialist version of belief, which is like you create the world and around you.
1996000	1999000	It doesn't matter what others believe.
1999000	2013000	It's actually almost like empowering thought as opposed to the more traditional view of religion where it's like a tribal idea, where you share that idea together.
2013000	2019000	Here you have the full, back to Sartre, full responsibility of your beliefs as well.
2019000	2020000	Good, good.
2020000	2024000	But what you're describing is not a religious believer.
2024000	2031000	You're describing someone who's found in themselves the ground of their existence rather than in something outside of themselves.
2032000	2050000	I mean, if you go full Sartrean, then well, you're not in a position to criticize others for the choices that they make, but you are in a position to criticize them for the way in which they make them, either taking responsibility or not taking responsibility.
2050000	2058000	But the religious believer used to be able to say, look, the choices that I make are right because God demands that I make them.
2059000	2065000	And nowadays, and so it would be wrong to make any others.
2065000	2074000	And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age, say, well, you can't quite do that and be a religious believer.
2074000	2081000	Your religious belief can't justify that move, and so it can't ground your life in the way it does.
2081000	2082000	So it's sort of unsettling.
2082000	2087000	I think that's one of the interpretations of what Nietzsche might have meant when he said God is dead.
2087000	2092000	God can't play the role for religious believers in our world that he used to.
2092000	2094000	But we nevertheless find meaning.
2094000	2100000	I mean, you don't see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas that are overtaken modern culture.
2100000	2103000	So a secular world is still full of meaning.
2103000	2104000	Good.
2104000	2106000	Well, I think that's the interesting question.
2106000	2114000	I think it's certainly possible for a secular world to be a world in which we live meaningful lives, worthwhile lives,
2114000	2123000	lives that are sort of worthy of respect and that we can be proud of aiming to live.
2123000	2127000	But I think it is a hard question what we're doing when we do that.
2127000	2130000	And that is the question of existence.
2130000	2136000	So what does it mean to exist in a way that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?
2136000	2139000	That's the question for existentialism.
2140000	2149000	So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important existentialist to understand for others?
2149000	2152000	What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?
2152000	2155000	Maybe other existentialists, not just one.
2155000	2156000	Yeah, good.
2156000	2161000	So Sartre is the grounding, strong, atheistic existentialism statement.
2161000	2163000	Who else is there?
2163000	2170000	I'm teaching an existentialism course now and I think the tradition goes back at least to the 17th century.
2170000	2174000	And I'll just tell you some of the figures that I'm teaching there.
2174000	2176000	We could talk about any of them that you like.
2176000	2179000	The figure I start with is Pascal.
2179000	2184000	Pascal, French mathematician from the 17th century.
2184000	2185000	He died.
2185000	2190000	I'm terrible with dates, but I think 1661 or something like that, middle of the 17th century.
2190000	2192000	Brilliant polymath.
2192000	2195000	Sort of we have computer languages named after him.
2195000	2198000	He built the first mechanical calculating machine.
2198000	2205000	But he was also deeply invested in his understanding of what Christianity was.
2205000	2214000	And he thought that everyone before him had really misunderstood what Christianity was.
2214000	2226000	That they'd really attempted to think about it, not as a way of living a life, but as a set of beliefs that you can have and which you can justify.
2226000	2232000	And I think that's the first move that's really pretty interesting.
2232000	2237000	And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky developed that move.
2237000	2247000	And all of those take themselves to be defending an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity, an existential interpretation of Christianity.
2247000	2258000	And then I think there are other figures, other theistic figures, figures like Camus and Fanon, who are mid-20th century figures.
2258000	2263000	And then I'll just mention the figure who I think is the most interesting is Martin Heidegger.
2263000	2265000	He's a complicated figure.
2265000	2271000	By the way, when you said Camus, you meant atheistic.
2271000	2274000	I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist.
2274000	2276000	Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.
2276000	2280000	So we've got sports cards, we have the different existentialists.
2280000	2285000	So maybe let's go to Dostoevsky.
2285000	2287000	All right, okay, let's do it.
2287000	2291000	So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.
2291000	2295000	First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.
2295000	2302000	And I love the optimism and the love the main character has for the world.
2302000	2305000	So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.
2305000	2307000	Knows from underground as well.
2307000	2313000	But what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think are existentialist?
2313000	2316000	What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?
2316000	2317000	Excellent.
2317000	2320000	So let me talk about the brother's Karimovsov.
2320000	2323000	Partly because that's the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.
2323000	2327000	I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.
2327000	2328000	Maybe the best.
2328000	2330000	And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.
2330000	2332000	So I'm super excited about it.
2332000	2335000	But what is the brother's Karimovsov about?
2335000	2338000	I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.
2338000	2339000	Spoiler alert.
2339000	2340000	Yeah.
2340000	2343000	I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?
2343000	2346000	I mean, the father gets murdered.
2346000	2348000	And the question is who did it?
2348000	2349000	Who's responsible for it?
2349000	2352000	So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.
2352000	2355000	But it's responsibility for a murder.
2355000	2357000	That's what we're talking about.
2357000	2364000	And there's a bunch of brothers, each of whom has pretty good motivation
2364000	2366000	for having murdered the father.
2366000	2368000	The father's a jerk.
2368000	2373000	I mean, he's, you know, if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy.
2373000	2376000	He's a force of chaos.
2376000	2379000	And he's nasty in all sorts of ways.
2379000	2383000	But still, it's not good to murder people.
2383000	2386000	So what's the view of Dostoyevsky?
2386000	2394000	I mean, it's this intense exploration of what it means to be involved in various ways
2394000	2399000	with an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.
2399000	2405000	And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?
2405000	2410000	What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?
2410000	2416000	And how even through this kind of action, you can achieve some kind of salvation?
2416000	2419000	That's Dostoyevsky's word for it.
2419000	2424000	You can, but salvation here and now, not like you live some afterlife
2424000	2427000	where you're, you know, paradise for eternity.
2427000	2429000	Who cares about that?
2429000	2431000	Says one of the characters.
2431000	2433000	That doesn't make my life now any good.
2433000	2437000	And it doesn't justify any of the bad things that happen in my life now.
2437000	2442000	What matters is, can we live well in the face of these things that we do
2442000	2444000	and have to take responsibility for?
2444000	2450000	So it's this intense exploration of notions and gradations of guilt
2450000	2456000	and responsibility and the possibility of love and salvation in the face of those.
2456000	2459000	It is incredibly human work.
2459000	2463000	But I think Dostoyevsky is the opposite of Sartre.
2463000	2466000	And let me just, I think it's so fascinating.
2466000	2472000	I don't know anybody else who notices this, but Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoyevsky
2472000	2474000	when he's developing his view.
2474000	2476000	It's close to a passage.
2476000	2478000	It doesn't appear quite in this way.
2478000	2481000	But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.
2481000	2483000	It's in the form of an argument.
2483000	2485000	Sartre puts it in the form of an argument.
2485000	2489000	He says, look, there's a conditional statement is true.
2489000	2493000	If there is no God, then everything is permitted.
2493000	2496000	And then there's a second premise.
2496000	2498000	There is no God.
2498000	2499000	That's Sartre's view.
2499000	2500000	I mean, he's an atheist.
2500000	2501000	There is no God.
2501000	2503000	Conclusion?
2503000	2505000	Everything is permitted.
2505000	2507000	And that's Sartre's radical freedom.
2507000	2511000	And if you think about the structure of the brothers Karamazov,
2511000	2514000	I think Dostoyevsky, though he never says it this way,
2514000	2516000	would run the argument differently.
2516000	2519000	It's a modus tolens instead of a modus bonens.
2519000	2522000	The argument for Dostoyevsky would go like this.
2522000	2524000	Yeah, conditional statement.
2524000	2527000	If there is no God, then everything is permitted.
2527000	2529000	But look at your life.
2529000	2531000	Not everything is permitted.
2531000	2534000	You do horrible, atrocious things.
2534000	2537000	Like, be involved in the death of your father.
2537000	2539000	And there is a price to pay.
2539000	2545000	That's not a livable moment to take, to have to take responsibility,
2545000	2549000	to have to recognize that you're at fault,
2549000	2554000	or you're somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you were
2554000	2557000	and letting that happen or bringing it about that it does happen,
2557000	2559000	is to pay a price.
2559000	2564000	So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way that everything is permitted.
2564000	2567000	Look at the facts of your existence.
2567000	2569000	So not everything is permitted.
2569000	2574000	Therefore, there is a God.
2574000	2579000	And the presence of a God for Dostoyevsky, I think, is just found
2579000	2583000	in this fact that when we do bad things, we feel guilty for them.
2583000	2586000	We find ourselves to be responsible for things,
2586000	2588000	even when we didn't intend to do them,
2588000	2590000	but we just allowed ourselves to be involved in them.
2590000	2594000	And the nature of God for Dostoyevsky is, I mean, unclear.
2594000	2597000	I mean, it's a very complex exploration in itself.
2597000	2602000	And he basically, God speaks through several of his characters in complicated ways.
2602000	2606000	So it's not like a trivial version of God.
2606000	2607000	It's totally not trivial.
2607000	2611000	And it's not a being that exists outside of time.
2611000	2613000	None of that is sort of relevant for Dostoyevsky.
2613000	2616000	For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.
2616000	2620000	Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to us,
2620000	2622000	which is the mood of joy?
2622000	2627000	Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but so I'm a Russian speaker.
2627000	2632000	And one of the, I kind of listened to my heart.
2632000	2635000	And what my heart says is I need to take on this project.
2635000	2641000	So there's a couple of famous translators of Dostoyevsky and Dostoyevsky
2641000	2644000	that live in Paris currently.
2644000	2646000	So I'm going to take the journey.
2646000	2651000	We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoyevsky, about Dostoyevsky
2651000	2654000	and like a series of conversations.
2654000	2659000	And the reason I fell in love with this idea is I just realized,
2659000	2665000	in translating from Russian to English, how deep philosophical,
2665000	2669000	how much deep philosophical thinking is required.
2669000	2675000	Just like single sentences, they spent like weeks debating single sentences.
2675000	2680000	So, and all of that is part of a journey to Russia for several reasons.
2680000	2687000	But I just, I want to explore something in me that long still understand
2687000	2691000	and to connect with the roots where I come from.
2691000	2695000	So, maybe can you comment, whether it's on the Russian side
2695000	2701000	or the German side or other French side,
2701000	2706000	is there something in your own explorations of these philosophies
2706000	2711000	that you find that you miss because you don't deeply know the language?
2711000	2714000	Or like how important is it to understand the language?
2714000	2717000	Good. I think it's super important.
2717000	2720000	And I'm always embarrassed that I don't know more languages
2720000	2723000	and don't know the languages I know as well as I would like to.
2723000	2726000	But there's a way in.
2726000	2731000	So I do think different languages allow you to think in different ways.
2731000	2737000	There's a sort of a mode of existence, a way of being that's captured by a language
2737000	2741000	that it makes certain ways of thinking about yourself or others more natural.
2741000	2746000	And it closes off other ways of thinking about yourself and others.
2746000	2751000	And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.
2751000	2756000	The Heidegger, who is this philosopher that I'm interested in says at one point,
2756000	2759000	language is the house of being.
2759000	2766000	And I think that means something like it's by living in a language
2766000	2770000	that you come to understand or that possibilities for understanding
2770000	2774000	what it is to be you and others and anything are opened up.
2774000	2777000	And different languages open up different possibilities.
2777000	2782000	And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce
2782000	2787000	and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories.
2787000	2793000	And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin
2793000	2797000	to truly to help you understand maybe fall in love with the words.
2797000	2804000	And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of the language.
2804000	2807000	It's understanding something much deeper.
2807000	2810000	The music of the language or something.
2810000	2812000	The music of the ideas.
2812000	2814000	Absolutely. Something like that.
2814000	2816000	It's very hard to say exactly what that is.
2816000	2821000	But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce, read some sentences.
2821000	2823000	They have a different cadence.
2823000	2825000	They have a different tonality.
2825000	2827000	They have different music to use your word.
2827000	2830000	And all of a sudden you think about them differently.
2830000	2835000	And the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you when they're read in certain ways.
2835000	2838000	That's what great actors can do.
2838000	2842000	But I think language is rich like that.
2842000	2850000	And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language
2850000	2853000	when we think about its logical form.
2853000	2857000	When we think about the sort of claims of philosophical logic that you can make
2857000	2861000	or how do you translate this proposition into some symbolic form.
2861000	2864000	I think that's part of what goes on in language.
2864000	2870000	But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can
2870000	2877000	when great poets or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect
2877000	2878000	it's way more than that.
2878000	2881000	And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in.
2881000	2884000	It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is
2884000	2889000	I feel like some of the ideas that are conveyed through language
2889000	2891000	actually can be put outside of language.
2891000	2897000	So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian
2897000	2902000	but for an English audience and not rely purely on translators.
2902000	2909000	There would of course be translators there that help me dance through this mess of language.
2909000	2915000	But also like my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian to English back and forth
2915000	2919000	for an English speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience.
2919000	2923000	So not this pure, this is Russian, it's going to be translated to English
2923000	2926000	or this is English, it's going to be translated to Russian.
2926000	2932000	But dance back and forth and try to share with people who don't speak one of the languages
2932000	2936000	the music that they're missing and sort of almost hear that music
2936000	2940000	because if you're sitting in another room and you hear the music through the wall
2940000	2941000	I get a sense of it.
2941000	2948000	I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human being.
2948000	2954000	And I wonder whether it's possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas
2954000	2959000	in a way that can be conveyed to people who don't speak that particular language.
2959000	2961000	I think it's a super exciting project.
2961000	2963000	I look forward to following it.
2963000	2965000	I'll tell you one thing that does happen.
2965000	2967000	So we read Dostoevsky in translation.
2967000	2971000	Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room which is super helpful.
2971000	2979000	But I also encourage my students to some of them will have different translations than others.
2979000	2983000	And that can be really helpful for the non-native speaker
2983000	2991000	because by paying attention to the places where translators diverge in their translations
2991000	2993000	of a given word or a phrase or something like that
2993000	2998000	you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have in English
2998000	3003000	they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated.
3003000	3007000	And then you can start to ask about what those differences are.
3007000	3011000	And I think there's a kind of magic to it.
3011000	3016000	I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be
3016000	3020000	for people who really grew up in them especially who speak them as natives.
3020000	3024000	And that's a really powerful thing that actually doesn't exist enough of
3024000	3033000	is, for example, for Dostoevsky most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators.
3033000	3037000	And there's a lot of discussions about who did it better and so on.
3037000	3042000	But I would love to, I'm a computer science person, I would love to do a diff
3042000	3048000	where you automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying
3048000	3056000	and use that like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences.
3056000	3058000	In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.
3058000	3062000	I heard the individual translators and interviews and blog posts
3062000	3066000	and articles discuss particular phrases that they differ on
3066000	3070000	but like to do that for an entire book, that's a fascinating exploration.
3070000	3075000	As an English speaker, just to read the differences in the translations
3075000	3082000	you probably can get some deep understanding of ideas in those books
3082000	3086000	by seeing the struggle of the translators to capture that idea.
3086000	3088000	That's a really interesting idea.
3088000	3089000	Absolutely.
3089000	3093000	And you can do that for other projects and other languages too.
3093000	3098000	One of the, I don't know, I have this weird huge range of interests
3098000	3101000	and some days I'll find myself reading about something.
3101000	3106000	At one point I was interested in 14th century German mysticism.
3106000	3110000	Okay, turns out there's somebody who's written volumes and volumes about this.
3110000	3112000	He's fantastic.
3112000	3115000	And I was interested in reading Meister Eckhart.
3115000	3118000	I wanted to know what was interesting about him.
3118000	3125000	And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who's the great scholar of this period, made
3125000	3130000	was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this,
3130000	3133000	he translated Christianity into the vernacular.
3133000	3136000	He started giving sermons in German to the peasants.
3136000	3138000	Sermons used to be in Latin and nobody could speak Latin.
3138000	3142000	Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don't know?
3142000	3145000	So he translated it into German.
3145000	3149000	But in doing it, the resources of the German language are different from the resources
3149000	3150000	of the Latin language.
3150000	3157000	And there's a word in Middle High German, Grund, which we translated as ground.
3158000	3161000	And it's got this earthy feel to it.
3161000	3167000	It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out of
3167000	3174000	and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty to it.
3174000	3177000	And there's no Latin word for that.
3177000	3182000	But in Eckhart's interpretation of Christianity, Grund, that's like the fundamental thing.
3182000	3186000	You don't understand God until you understand the way in which he is our ground.
3186000	3195000	And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets a kind of German cant that makes sense to the people who speak German
3195000	3203000	and that reveals something totally different about what you could think that form of existence was
3203000	3206000	that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done in Latin.
3207000	3209000	Yeah, that's fascinating.
3209000	3216000	So, okay, we talked about Dostoyevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature.
3216000	3224000	Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as a way to explore human nature.
3224000	3232000	So he is probably my favorite existentialist, probably one of the more accessible existentialists.
3232000	3238000	And like you said, one of the people who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.
3238000	3240000	So what are your thoughts about Camus?
3240000	3243000	What role does he play in the story of existentialism?
3243000	3246000	So, I find Camus totally fascinating.
3246000	3247000	I really do.
3247000	3255000	And for years, I didn't teach Camus because the famous thing that you're referring to, the myth of Sisyphus,
3255000	3260000	which is a sort of essay, it's published as a book, super accessible, really fascinating.
3260000	3263000	He's a great writer, really engaging.
3263000	3271000	The opening line is something like, there is but one truly significant philosophical question.
3271000	3273000	And that is the question of suicide.
3273000	3278000	And I thought, I can't teach my 18-year-olds of, you know, like how...
3278000	3279000	Yeah.
3279000	3281000	I just thought, that's terrible.
3281000	3282000	Like, how can I...
3282000	3284000	I mean, it's not wrong.
3284000	3285000	Like, that's a...
3285000	3287000	But do I want to bring that into the classroom?
3287000	3289000	And so I read it...
3289000	3291000	I read the essay.
3291000	3293000	I avoided it for a long time because...
3293000	3295000	Just because of that line.
3295000	3300000	And I thought, I'm not going to be able to make sense of this in a way that will be helpful for anyone.
3300000	3304000	But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I sat down to read it.
3304000	3307000	I thought, I've got to really confront it.
3307000	3311000	And I read it and it's incredibly engaging.
3311000	3313000	I mean, it's really, really beautiful.
3313000	3317000	And Camus was against suicide, which just turns out to be good.
3317000	3319000	I was happy about that.
3319000	3326000	But he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence amounts to.
3326000	3332000	And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.
3332000	3336000	And it's being absurd as a kind of technical term for him.
3336000	3348000	And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole presents itself to you as if it's got a meaning.
3349000	3351000	But really it doesn't.
3351000	3358000	So there's this tension between the way things seem to be on their surface
3358000	3363000	and what really turns out to be true about them.
3363000	3365000	And he gives these great examples.
3365000	3367000	You probably remember these.
3367000	3369000	He says, there you are.
3369000	3374000	You're walking along the street and there's a plate glass window in a building.
3374000	3378000	And through the window, you see somebody talking on a cell phone.
3378000	3382000	I mean, I imagine it as a cell phone, but Camus for didn't.
3382000	3386000	But you see somebody talking on a cell phone and he's animated.
3386000	3391000	He's talking a lot as if things really meant something.
3391000	3395000	And yet Camus says, it's a dumb show.
3395000	3399000	And it's not dumb in the sense, just in the sense that it's stupid.
3399000	3401000	It's dumb in the sense that it's silent.
3401000	3407000	It presents itself as if it's got some significance and yet its significance is withheld from you.
3407000	3409000	And he says, that's what our lives are like.
3409000	3414000	Everything in our lives presents themselves to us as if it's got a significance, but it doesn't.
3414000	3416000	It's absurd.
3416000	3419000	And then he says, really what our lives are like?
3419000	3421000	They're like the lives of Sisyphus.
3421000	3424000	Just day after day.
3424000	3427000	You do the same thing.
3427000	3429000	You wake up at a certain time.
3429000	3430000	You get on the bus.
3430000	3431000	You go to work.
3431000	3432000	You take your lunch break.
3432000	3433000	You get off.
3433000	3437000	I have a colleague who once said to me something like this.
3437000	3440000	It was about October or so in the fall semester.
3440000	3442000	I said, how's it going, Dick?
3442000	3444000	He said, well, you know how it is.
3444000	3449000	I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I'm just going through.
3449000	3452000	And that's the way my life is.
3452000	3459000	And Camus thinks that experience, which you can sometimes have, reveals something true
3459000	3461000	about what human lives are like.
3461000	3466000	Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus who rolls this boulder up the hill
3466000	3468000	from morning till night.
3468000	3473000	And then at night he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom.
3473000	3477000	Over the course of the night he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.
3477000	3480000	And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life.
3480000	3487000	Like we're condemned to our lives, but we do have one bit of freedom and it's the only
3487000	3490000	thing that we can hang on to.
3490000	3498000	It's the freedom to stick it to the gods who put us in this position by embracing this
3498000	3501000	existence rather than giving up and committing suicide.
3501000	3506000	And I thought, well, it's kind of a happy ending.
3507000	3513000	But I also thought it's a dim view of what our existence amounts to.
3513000	3517000	So I think there's something fascinating about that.
3517000	3523000	But what I came to believe and I tried to write about this once, I know you read the thing
3523000	3526000	about a liveness that I published once.
3526000	3528000	That's secretly a criticism of Camus.
3528000	3530000	I don't think I mentioned Camus in there.
3530000	3536000	But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong or he's missed some important aspect of it.
3536000	3543000	Because in Camus' view, when you experience your day as sort of going on in this deadening way
3543000	3547000	and you're just doing the things that you always do, the way you always do them.
3547000	3551000	For Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.
3551000	3554000	But I think there's some aspect, at least for me.
3554000	3559000	And maybe he just didn't feel this or didn't have access to it.
3559000	3560000	Maybe others don't.
3560000	3567000	But for me, there's an extra part to it, which is somehow that, yes, that's the way things are.
3567000	3570000	And it's inadequate.
3570000	3577000	And there's something that's missing from that aspect of our existence that could be there.
3577000	3585000	And it feels like our lives are not about just putting up with that and sticking it to the gods by embracing it.
3585000	3588000	But seeking that absent part of it.
3588000	3594000	The part that's recognizable in its absence in your experience of that.
3594000	3596000	And that's what I think.
3596000	3604000	I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when you feel truly alive.
3604000	3608000	And that's what you mean by the word aliveness, which is a fascinating and a powerful word.
3608000	3610000	Yeah, that's what I mean by it.
3610000	3617000	I mean, I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when they really felt alive.
3617000	3626000	And it could happen in a moment when, I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord.
3626000	3634000	Or maybe you feel it in that moment where you grab for the hand on the first date and the gesture is reciprocated.
3634000	3645000	Or maybe you feel it in some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing or watching somebody else do a peak athletic thing.
3645000	3654000	But I think there are moments when it feels like it's not like the way Camu is describing things.
3654000	3656000	And it's better because of that.
3656000	3667000	So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about going to a darker territory, is to think about suicide.
3667000	3672000	And I've known people in my life who suffer from clinical depression.
3672000	3683000	And, you know, whatever the chemistry is in our brain, there is a certain kind of feeling that is to be depressed.
3683000	3690000	Where you look in the mirror and ask, do I want to kill myself today?
3690000	3696000	This is the question that Camu asks, this question, this philosophical question.
3696000	3708000	And there is people who, when they're depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill myself or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter.
3708000	3714000	And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is, that's chemistry in our mind.
3714000	3723000	And then on the flip side of that, for me, I've had some low points, but I've been very fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression.
3723000	3733000	I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great music or any of that.
3733000	3738000	I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.
3738000	3742000	Like, as you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it's cold.
3742000	3748000	And for some reason, the coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration.
3748000	3750000	I don't know, there was a joy in that.
3750000	3753000	I can't put it into words, but I just felt great.
3753000	3760000	And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there's a nice breeze and it's amazing.
3760000	3766000	So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.
3766000	3774000	That seems like I'm getting some nice dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life.
3774000	3776000	And that is the source of aliveness.
3776000	3785000	However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.
3785000	3794000	And so the one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression.
3794000	3800000	And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of suicide.
3800000	3805000	Because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today?
3805000	3809000	I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way often.
3809000	3813000	Like basically every day is, you know, what if I die today?
3813000	3817000	It's more like contemplating your mortality every single day.
3817000	3824000	You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day.
3824000	3827000	You know, it just reminds me how amazing life is.
3827000	3837000	And that's chemistry. I don't know what that is, but that's certainly not some kind of philosophical decision I made.
3837000	3844000	I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I've been given of the dopamine.
3844000	3847000	So that question of suicide.
3847000	3854000	By the way, do you find that formulation of the question of existentialism?
3854000	3860000	I know you didn't want to teach it because obviously suicide is a very difficult word, especially for young minds.
3860000	3865000	But do you think that's a useful formulation of the question of existentialism?
3865000	3869000	Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide.
3869000	3871000	I think there is something to it.
3871000	3882000	If you read the question as the question, what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?
3882000	3884000	That's a deep question.
3884000	3892000	Yeah, that's a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they ought to continue to live that life.
3892000	3899000	The famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending execution.
3899000	3910000	I think there's something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness and the vulnerability of one's existence
3910000	3912000	is super important.
3912000	3920000	And I think that if we didn't have that, our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.
3920000	3924000	If they weren't risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose.
3924000	3929000	And it's only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance that they do.
3929000	3937000	So yeah, I think not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the questions at the core of existentialism.
3938000	3943000	But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it.
3943000	3950000	Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is an action.
3950000	3963000	So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn't make sense because you know, imagine you're in like a hotel and you're saying the room I'm in sucks.
3963000	3972000	But like there's other rooms, so like maybe explore those other rooms, maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms.
3972000	3980000	Like basically embracing the fact that you don't know everything and there's, you need time to explore everything.
3980000	3990000	It's like once you've explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision, but it's unfair to make a decision.
3990000	3996000	It's, I would say, unethical to make a decision until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel.
3996000	4000000	Yeah. And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.
4000000	4007000	There's one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide.
4007000	4014000	He's asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that's worth living in.
4014000	4019000	And I think that character is, as you say, very ill.
4019000	4028000	And it's possible and often because, as you say, of, you know, brain chemistry, physiology.
4028000	4035000	So there's certainly a physical ground to that situation, to that condition.
4035000	4040000	But I think it is possible for someone to be in that situation.
4040000	4051000	I think that Ivan Karamazov, who's the character who's asking this question, is, you know, maybe let's say chemically depressed or something like that.
4051000	4053000	But I think there's more to it too.
4053000	4060000	And I think that Dostoevsky's real view is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on its own.
4060000	4066000	Like the way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves from others.
4066000	4077000	The way we care for the lives that we lead affects the chemistry of our brain, which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.
4077000	4089000	So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved, is going to come through the love of his brother Alyosha.
4089000	4092000	Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.
4092000	4096000	Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors is Herman Hesse.
4096000	4104000	Do you ever include him in our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?
4104000	4105000	I haven't.
4105000	4106000	Maybe I should.
4106000	4107000	What should I read?
4107000	4108000	What should I think about including?
4108000	4114000	No, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.
4115000	4122000	There's a existentialist ideal pervading most of his work.
4122000	4134000	But there's more of like with Siddhartha, there's more almost like a Buddhist sort of like watch the river and become the river.
4134000	4140000	This kind of idea that what it means to truly experience the moment.
4140000	4145000	There is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it's not just about,
4145000	4151000	we've been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen, like you said, from Nietzsche.
4151000	4156000	Like what it means to really take in the world and experience the moment.
4156000	4163000	So he's very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience the full absurdity of the moment.
4163000	4170000	And for him, I'm starting to forget, Steppenwolf I think is humor.
4170000	4177000	It's part of the absurdity, which I think modern day internet explores very well with memes and so on.
4177000	4185000	Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that's able to deal with absurdity.
4185000	4188000	You got to like laugh at it.
4188000	4192000	I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you're absolutely right.
4192000	4201000	Kierkegaard, who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and then so on, is actually an incredibly funny writer.
4201000	4209000	And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school who left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer.
4209000	4211000	He's a very successful guy.
4211000	4215000	And then he came back 25 years later and wrote, finished his dissertation.
4215000	4218000	And I was the reader on the dissertation.
4218000	4221000	There may be a conflict of interest, I'm not quite sure.
4221000	4228000	But his dissertation was about, he called it Kierkegaard and the funny, which is kind of a funny title.
4228000	4229000	Yeah.
4229000	4240000	But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading, Kierkegaard does have this idea that there's something destabilizing about humor
4240000	4248000	that's crucial to the sort of the important possibilities for us.
4248000	4259000	And so there's the idea that there's a moment when a joke is being set up, when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground.
4259000	4264000	And then the punchline comes and the rug is pulled out from under you.
4264000	4267000	And for a moment, it's like you're falling.
4267000	4277000	There's nothing supporting you until you're captured by your totally new understanding of what was going on.
4277000	4283000	And that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to it.
4283000	4285000	And that's like the riskiness.
4285000	4288000	That's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.
4288000	4295000	If there aren't risks in your life, if your life is totally safe, then there's no possibility of significance.
4295000	4305000	And so I think on Eric's reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning
4305000	4314000	with the experience of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant.
4314000	4320000	When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it's got a kind of salience for you.
4320000	4325000	Speaking of jokes and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature.
4325000	4329000	So existentialism in film and literature.
4329000	4339000	I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism, was experienced in the great work of art, modern work of art called Big Lebowski.
4339000	4346000	I don't know if you've ever seen that film, but there's a group of nihilists in that film.
4346000	4348000	They're just like, they don't care about anything.
4348000	4351000	I think they happen to be German, at least they have German accents.
4351000	4358000	So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film?
4358000	4365000	And if you would all ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play.
4365000	4368000	So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context.
4368000	4372000	And I did actually re-watch it not so long ago.
4372000	4373000	We have kids.
4373000	4374000	I thought maybe it's time.
4374000	4377000	It wasn't really time for the 11-year-old.
4377000	4378000	No.
4378000	4380000	So somewhat inappropriate.
4380000	4383000	But I have never taught that film, so I'd have to think more.
4383000	4384000	We could talk about it.
4384000	4386000	I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.
4386000	4387000	Okay.
4387000	4392000	So I would love to because there is a, feels like there's a philosophical depth to that film.
4392000	4397000	So there's a person that just the main character.
4397000	4399000	The Jeff Bridges character.
4399000	4400000	Jeff Bridges character.
4400000	4401000	Yeah.
4401000	4407000	He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians and he just kind of walks around in a very relaxed way.
4408000	4421000	And irradiates both a love for life, but also just an acceptance of like it is what it is kind of philosophy.
4421000	4432000	And then there's a bunch of characters that have very busy lives trying to do some big projects that are dramatic in some way.
4432000	4434000	Make some huge amounts of money.
4434000	4438000	So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot by Esteschi in a certain kind of sense.
4438000	4447000	And then there's these players, I mean they're phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don't care to enjoy life.
4447000	4449000	They want to mess with life in some kind of way.
4449000	4458000	And of course there's interesting personalities that, what is it, Jesus, the bowler.
4458000	4463000	And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless.
4463000	4473000	And then there's the John Goodman character that's talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely and so on.
4473000	4478000	So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world.
4478000	4485000	And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.
4485000	4486000	Okay.
4486000	4487000	All right.
4487000	4488000	Good.
4488000	4489000	Well, that's helpful.
4489000	4490000	Thank you for reminding me of all that.
4490000	4497000	I think, so one thing to say is that the nihilists, the group of nihilists who call themselves nihilists,
4497000	4503000	I think they've got a bad misinterpretation of what nihilism is supposed to be.
4503000	4507000	And this happened actually in the 20s.
4507000	4516000	There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot of Nietzsche.
4516000	4526000	Nietzsche, you know, was a kind of hero for the Nazis even, I think based on a pretty bad misunderstanding of what he was up to.
4526000	4531000	But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first and they were students.
4531000	4535000	They'd read a lot of Nietzsche and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.
4535000	4544000	The only way that there's any significance in life is through our will to sort of powerfully bring something about.
4544000	4558000	And if we're going to do that in a way that reflects the fact that nothing means anything, then what we should do is take these things, these actions that people always thought were bad,
4558000	4562000	and do them and show that there's nothing wrong with doing them.
4562000	4569000	And so they decided they would murder someone, not because they were angry at them, just someone they'd never met.
4569000	4571000	It was important that it was someone they'd never met.
4571000	4573000	It was a totally unmotivated act.
4573000	4589000	And they thought, we'll embrace nihilism by showing that we can act in such a way as to do something that morality thinks is bad and through our will bring it about that we desire to do it.
4589000	4594000	For no reason that has anything to do with its potentially being interpretable as good.
4594000	4601000	And I think that's a terrible misreading of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism is.
4601000	4604000	I mean, I think read that against the Miles Davis thing.
4604000	4613000	Miles Davis' aim is to creatively bring it about that something works well in a situation where he is kind of constrained.
4613000	4614000	So they thought two things.
4614000	4621000	One, there are no constraints at all, not even the constraints of the situation that we find ourselves in.
4621000	4630000	And two, we only become the beings that we really are when we act against what you might have thought the constraints were.
4630000	4634000	And I just think that's a bad misreading of what that kind of nihilism is up to.
4634000	4640000	And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski has got that kind of bad misreading.
4640000	4643000	But then the major characters are much more interesting.
4643000	4645000	Go ahead, if you want to say something.
4645000	4649000	So there's some kind of apathy to their particular nihilism.
4649000	4657000	Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy as a philosophy part of that nihilism?
4657000	4668000	Sort of like from an existentialist perspective, how important is it to care about stuff, like really take on life?
4668000	4676000	What does existentialism have to say about just sitting back and just not caring?
4676000	4677000	Excellent.
4677000	4681000	So apathy is like a really important word.
4681000	4683000	The Greek word is apathy.
4683000	4685000	It means without passions.
4685000	4694000	And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier, really thought that passions are what get in the way if you're living well.
4694000	4698000	Because to live well, you have to think clearly about what you should do.
4698000	4705000	And you shouldn't let your resentments and your angers and your petty animosities direct your behavior.
4705000	4708000	You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.
4708000	4712000	So Stoicism, again, huge caricature.
4712000	4717000	But it's an aim not to care because caring is bad.
4717000	4729000	And there's certain forms of existentialism, certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoyevsky and Heidegger and Sart in his own way.
4729000	4737000	So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing, where what's crucial about us is that we do care.
4737000	4740000	Heidegger says care is the being of Dasein.
4740000	4742000	Dasein is his name for us.
4742000	4746000	What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.
4746000	4749000	And you can't not do that.
4749000	4753000	You can pretend you're not doing it, but you're just caring in a different way.
4753000	4757000	It's like Sart saying you can pretend you're not taking responsibility.
4757000	4761000	Or you could pretend that you don't have to make a decision.
4761000	4763000	That is making a decision.
4763000	4765000	Not caring is a way of caring.
4765000	4771000	And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in think that we do care.
4771000	4774000	That's constitutive of what it is to be us.
4774000	4777000	And so they all think that the Stoics got it wrong.
4777000	4789000	But that leaves open a huge range of moves about how we inhabit that existence well.
4789000	4792000	Let me ask about Ayn Rand.
4792000	4793000	Okay.
4793000	4800000	So it just so happens that I've gotten, she's entered a few conversations in this podcast.
4800000	4807000	And just looking at academic philosophy or just philosophers in general, they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.
4807000	4809000	Do you have a sense of why that is?
4809000	4823000	Does she ever come into play, her ideas of objectivism come into play of discussions of a good life from the perspective of existentialism?
4823000	4826000	In how you teach it and how you think about it?
4826000	4830000	Is she somebody who you find it all interesting?
4830000	4833000	So no, I don't think she is.
4833000	4836000	But it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.
4836000	4837000	I read it in high school.
4837000	4840000	I read The Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged.
4840000	4842000	But that's at this point a very long time ago.
4842000	4846000	I think I read something about objective epistemology or something too.
4846000	4853000	So, you know, my view about her could be based on a total misunderstanding of what she's up to.
4853000	4866000	But sort of my caricature of her and tell me if I've got it wrong is that she's sort of motivated by a kind of,
4866000	4875000	I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism, but maybe let's, in the context of our discussion, tie it back to Sartre,
4875000	4882000	a kind of view according to which we're the being who has to contend with the fact that we're radically free to do stuff.
4882000	4887000	And we're just not being courageous or brave enough when we don't do that.
4887000	4893000	And the people to admire are the people who make stuff out of nothing.
4893000	4895000	So maybe that's a bad caricature.
4895000	4896000	No, no, no.
4896000	4898000	I think, no, I think that's pretty accurate.
4898000	4903000	I'm not, again, very knowledgeable about the full depth of her philosophy.
4903000	4911000	But I think she takes a view of the world that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions,
4911000	4919000	but makes stronger statements about epistemology that, first of all, everything is knowable.
4919000	4923000	And there's some, you should always operate through reason.
4923000	4925000	Like reason is very important.
4926000	4931000	It's like you start with a few axioms and you build on top of that.
4931000	4936000	And the axioms that everybody should operate on are the same.
4936000	4939000	Again, reality is objective.
4939000	4941000	It's not subjective.
4941000	4950000	So from that, you can derive the entirety of how humans should behave at the individual level and at the societal level.
4950000	4952000	And there's a few conclusions.
4952000	4957000	She would talk about virtue of selfishness and sort of a lot of people use that to dismiss her look.
4957000	4959000	She's very selfish and so on.
4959000	4962000	She actually meant something very different.
4962000	4964000	It's more like the Sartre thing.
4964000	4966000	Take responsibility for yourself.
4966000	4973000	Understand what forces you're operating under and make the best of this life.
4973000	4979000	And that's how you can be the best member of societies by making the best life you can.
4979000	4986000	Just focus on yourself, fix your own problems first and then that will make you the best member of society,
4986000	4990000	of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.
4990000	4998000	I think the reason she's disliked, obviously on the philosophy side, she's disliked because a little bit like Nietzsche,
4998000	5001000	she's like, she's literary.
5002000	5011000	I think the reason she's publicly disliked in sort of public conversations is because of how sure she is of herself.
5011000	5017000	So that which is some of the philosophy been known to do, like make very strong statements like hell is other people,
5017000	5022000	but she was making very strong statements about basically everything.
5023000	5034000	The reason I bring her up is she is an influential thinker that is not for some reason often brought up as such.
5034000	5037000	It's not acknowledged how influential she is.
5037000	5046000	I was recently looking at like a list of the most important women of the 20th century in terms of thought,
5046000	5051000	not science, but like thought and she wasn't in that list.
5052000	5059000	I see this time and time again and it doesn't make sense to me why she's so kind of dismissed
5059000	5065000	because clearly she's an author of some of the most read books ever
5065000	5071000	and she clearly had very strong ideas that should be contended with.
5072000	5080000	That's why it kind of didn't make sense to me because she's also a creature of her time and an important one.
5080000	5085000	She's a creation of the Soviet Union, somebody who left because of that.
5085000	5095000	So some of the strength of her ideas has to do with how much she dislikes that particular philosophy and way of life.
5096000	5102000	But also she's a creature of like Sartre and like that whole like Nietzsche and so on.
5102000	5107000	Now one of the other criticisms is she doesn't integrate herself into this history.
5107000	5114000	She keeps basically kind of implying that she's purely original in all her thoughts
5114000	5118000	even though she's kind of citing a lot of other people.
5118000	5124000	But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing as if they are truly original and they're not.
5124000	5128000	It is interesting and also what's interesting about her is she is a woman.
5128000	5134000	She is a strong feminist and it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir,
5134000	5142000	it seems like she's a very important person in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.
5142000	5143000	Interesting.
5143000	5144000	Yeah.
5144000	5146000	Well, so I mean, I don't have a lot to add.
5146000	5150000	I will just say this.
5150000	5158000	I mean, the way she and Beauvoir seemed to me from your description of her and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago,
5158000	5162000	they seem pretty opposite from one another.
5162000	5170000	Like one of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir is that she takes seriously the thing that Sartre didn't,
5170000	5180000	which is our thrownness, which is the sense in which we're born into a situation that's already got a significance for her.
5180000	5186000	I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman.
5186000	5192000	And Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints or at least there shouldn't be.
5192000	5196000	We're pretty close as privileged white males.
5196000	5197000	Yeah, exactly.
5197000	5201000	If we just get rid of the last bits of them, we would be God like we're supposed to be.
5201000	5202000	Yeah.
5202000	5205000	And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.
5205000	5210000	I think she reckons, one's not born but becomes a woman, she says.
5210000	5212000	So how does that happen?
5212000	5217000	Well, you're thrown into your culture and your culture starts treating you in a certain way because of your gender.
5217000	5221000	And that starts to form your understanding and your experience of things.
5221000	5226000	And by the time you're grown up, well, you're pretty well formed by that.
5227000	5229000	That seems a fact.
5229000	5237000	It's a fact about Sartre too, though it was harder for him to notice it because he was formed into his privilege.
5237000	5242000	But the world reminds us of our thrownness for some more than others.
5242000	5243000	Yes, absolutely.
5243000	5255000	And for people who have to contend on a daily basis with the fact that the social position they're thrown into is one that negates them.
5256000	5258000	Or one that oppresses them.
5258000	5262000	Or one that sort of pushes them to the side in some way or another.
5262000	5266000	I mean, the black experience is interesting in this respect too.
5266000	5271000	France Fanon, who's a contemporary of Sartre and Beauvoir's, writes about it.
5271000	5282000	And it's very familiar, the things that he's saying now, but he writes back in the 50s about being a black man in Paris and getting on an elevator with a woman alone.
5282000	5296000	And how her reaction to him, not knowing him, not having any views about any reason to have any views about him, sort of puts him in a particular social position with respect to her.
5296000	5308000	And if you don't have that experience, it's much harder to recognize the way in which what we're thrown into is something we might not have chosen.
5309000	5320000	So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence, which as you describe Ayn Rand's views, she sounds more like Sartre.
5320000	5327000	She sounds more like either it's not an aspect of our existence, or at least we ought to sort of aim at it's not being.
5327000	5329000	Yeah, almost act as if it's not.
5329000	5330000	Yeah, exactly.
5330000	5331000	Act as if it's not.
5331000	5337000	And so I think from my point of view, I don't pretend that I'm explaining the public reception of her.
5337000	5343000	I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her in this intellectual context.
5343000	5347000	From my point of view, that's something big to miss.
5347000	5351000	And the ambition to think that really what's happening is that we're all the same.
5351000	5353000	We're all rational beings.
5353000	5365000	We're all beings who if we just got the axioms of our existence right and made good judgments and reasoned in an appropriate way would optimize ourselves.
5365000	5373000	That feels to me like a kind of natural end point of the philosophical tradition.
5373000	5380000	I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view that helps us in that direction and the enlightenment moves us further in that direction.
5380000	5392000	But from my point of view, that movement has led us astray because it's missed something really important that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.
5392000	5395000	Yeah, it misses the music.
5395000	5396000	Exactly.
5396000	5397000	It misses the music.
5397000	5399000	Let's talk about thrownness.
5399000	5402000	And I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.
5402000	5403000	Yeah.
5403000	5405000	So can we talk about Heidegger?
5405000	5406000	Okay.
5406000	5408000	So who is this philosopher?
5408000	5412000	What are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?
5412000	5413000	Okay.
5413000	5415000	So Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.
5415000	5418000	I do know when he was born, 1889.
5418000	5420000	I know that only by accident.
5420000	5426000	It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein and Austrian philosopher was born and the same year that Hitler was born.
5426000	5431000	So if I've remembered my dates right and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.
5431000	5435000	But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.
5435000	5439000	And it's interesting that the three of them were born at the same time.
5439000	5443000	Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities.
5443000	5448000	But then it's also interesting that Heidegger was a Nazi.
5448000	5453000	I mean, this is a very disturbing fact about his personal political background.
5453000	5459000	And so it's something that anyone who thinks that things that he said might be interesting has got to contend with.
5459000	5464000	Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria.
5464000	5467000	Wittgenstein is Austria also.
5467000	5474000	But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi, you have to remember, I mean, there was millions of Nazis too.
5474000	5479000	So they're parts of their, that's the history of the world.
5479000	5486000	There's a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis in that part of history.
5486000	5487000	Absolutely.
5487000	5495000	And one of the discussion points is, well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?
5495000	5497000	I mean, he went to parties with them and stuff.
5497000	5500000	Or did he really believe in the ideology?
5500000	5502000	And that's a choice point.
5502000	5505000	And we could talk about it if you want.
5505000	5507000	He held a political position.
5507000	5509000	That's one of the relevant parts.
5509000	5513000	In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.
5513000	5516000	That's like the president of the university.
5516000	5521000	And that was in Germany, all the universities are state universities.
5521000	5523000	And so that's a political appointment.
5523000	5525000	Can we just pause on this point?
5525000	5526000	Yeah.
5526000	5533000	From an existentialist perspective, what's the role for standing up to evil?
5533000	5541000	So, I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say about these things because he was a bit of a political figure.
5541000	5558000	Like, do you have a responsibility not just for your decisions, but if the world you see around you is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside is ethical.
5558000	5564000	Do you have a responsibility to stand up to that even if it costs you your life or your well-being?
5564000	5570000	You ask from an existential perspective and there's lots of different positions that you could have.
5570000	5577000	So, let me tell you something in the area of what I think I might believe, which comes out of this tradition.
5577000	5579000	And it's this.
5579000	5593000	If you live in a community where people are being dragged down by the norms of the community rather than elevated, then there's two things that you have to recognize.
5593000	5599000	One is that you bear some responsibility for that, not necessarily because you chose it.
5599000	5601000	Maybe you reviled it.
5601000	5603000	Maybe you were against it.
5603000	5609000	But there's some way in which we all act in accordance with the norms of our culture.
5609000	5612000	We all give in to them in some way or another.
5612000	5620000	And if those norms are broken, then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves to be responsible for broken norms.
5620000	5623000	We've become responsible for broken norms.
5623000	5625000	And I do think you have to face up to that.
5625000	5628000	I think that let's just take gender norms.
5628000	5630000	Maybe the gender norms are broken.
5630000	5636000	Maybe the way men and women treat one another or the way men treat women is broken.
5636000	5638000	Maybe it is.
5638000	5641000	I'm not making a substantive claim.
5641000	5643000	I'm just saying, lots of people say it is.
5643000	5658000	And if you're in a culture where those norms take root, you don't get to just isolate yourself and pull yourself out of the culture and think, I don't have any responsibility.
5658000	5661000	You're already a part of the culture.
5661000	5669000	Even if you're isolating yourself from it, that's a way of rejecting the sort of part you play in the culture.
5669000	5672000	But it's not a way of getting behind it.
5672000	5675000	Now you're playing that role differently.
5675000	5680000	You're saying, I don't want to take responsibility for what's going on around me.
5680000	5685000	And that's a way of taking responsibility by refusing to do it.
5685000	5690000	So I think we're implicated in whatever's going on around us.
5690000	5696000	And if we're going to do anything in our lives, we ought to recognize that.
5696000	5712000	Recognize that even in situations where you maybe didn't decide to do it, you could be part of bringing other people down and then devote yourself to trying to figure out how to act differently so that the norms update themselves.
5712000	5716000	And I think this is not a criticism of people.
5716000	5720000	But Aleosha, who we mentioned in the Brothers Karamazov, he's a character.
5720000	5724000	He's a kind of saintly character in the Brothers Karamazov.
5724000	5737000	But one crucial moment in that story is when he realizes how awful he's been being to someone without ever even intending to do that.
5737000	5740000	It's Grushenka, who's this sort of fascinating woman.
5740000	5743000	And she's a very erotic woman.
5743000	5745000	She's sort of sexual.
5745000	5751000	And Aleosha, in my reading of it, is kind of attracted to her.
5751000	5753000	But he's a young kid.
5753000	5755000	He's 20 or whatever.
5755000	5757000	And he's kind of embarrassed about it.
5757000	5762000	And he lives in the monastery and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest and he's kind of embarrassed by it.
5762000	5763000	So what does he do?
5763000	5768000	Every time they run across one another in the street, he averts his gaze.
5768000	5770000	And why is he doing that?
5770000	5772000	Because he's kind of embarrassed.
5772000	5774000	But how does Grushenka experience it?
5774000	5776000	Well, she knows she's a fallen woman.
5776000	5780000	And she knows that Aleosha has this other position in society.
5780000	5784000	So her read on it is, he's passing judgment on me.
5784000	5787000	He can see that he doesn't want to be associated with me.
5787000	5789000	He can see that I'm a fallen woman.
5789000	5792000	He knows that in order to maintain his purity,
5792000	5794000	he's got to avoid me.
5794000	5797000	That's not what Aleosha intended to do.
5797000	5799000	But that's the way it's experienced.
5799000	5800000	And so there's this way.
5800000	5802000	He comes to recognize, oh my God,
5802000	5808000	like what I'm supposed to do is love people in Dostoevsky's view of things.
5808000	5811000	And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.
5811000	5813000	I'm making her life worse.
5813000	5815000	I'm making her feel terrible about herself.
5815000	5819000	And if I actually came to know her, I'd recognize her condition is difficult.
5819000	5821000	She's living a difficult life.
5821000	5823000	She's making hard choices.
5823000	5828000	And why don't I see that in her face instead of this other thing
5828000	5830000	that's making me want to avoid her?
5830000	5831000	And that's a huge moment.
5831000	5835000	But the idea is that we're implicated in bringing other people down,
5835000	5837000	whether we want to be or not.
5837000	5839000	And that's our condition.
5839000	5845000	The requirement to understand that is to be almost to a radical degree,
5845000	5850000	be empathetic and to listen to the world.
5850000	5853000	And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.
5853000	5855000	It's not so simple.
5855000	5857000	All of this is messy.
5857000	5859000	For example, this is me talking.
5859000	5866000	It's clear to me that, for example, the woke culture has bullying built into it,
5866000	5871000	has some elements of the same kind of evil built into it.
5871000	5876000	And when you're part of the wave of wokeness standing up for social rights,
5876000	5880000	you also have to listen and think, are we going too far?
5880000	5882000	Are we hurting people?
5882000	5888000	Are we doing the same things that others, that we're fighting against,
5888000	5890000	that others were doing in the past?
5890000	5892000	So it's not simple.
5892000	5899000	Once you see that there's evil being done, that it's easy to fix.
5899000	5907000	No, in our society, there's something about our human nature
5907000	5913000	that just too easily stops listening to the world, to empathizing with the world.
5913000	5915000	And we label things as evil.
5915000	5917000	This is through human history.
5917000	5918000	This is evil.
5918000	5920000	You mentioned tribes.
5920000	5922000	This religious belief is evil.
5922000	5925000	And so we have to fight it and we become certain and dogmatic about it.
5925000	5928000	And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.
5928000	5936000	It seems like a life that accepts and responsibility for the norms we're in
5936000	5940000	has to constantly be sort of questioning yourself
5940000	5945000	and questioning, like listening to the world fully and richly
5945000	5953000	without being weighed down by any one sort of realization.
5953000	5956000	You just always constantly have to be thinking about the world.
5956000	5957000	Am I wrong?
5957000	5959000	Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?
5959000	5961000	I mean, the very last thing you said,
5961000	5963000	you've constantly got to be thinking about the world.
5963000	5965000	You've constantly got to be listening.
5965000	5967000	You've constantly got to be attending.
5967000	5968000	And it's not simple.
5968000	5970000	All that sounds exactly right to me.
5970000	5975000	And the phrase that rings through my head is another one from the Brothers Karamazov.
5975000	5979000	Dimitri, this passionate, sort of sometimes violent brother
5979000	5985000	who is also sort of deeply cares.
5985000	5989000	Because he's passionate, he's sort of got care through and through,
5989000	5991000	but it's breaking him apart.
5991000	5997000	He says at one point, God and the devil are fighting in the battlefield
5997000	5999000	is the heart of man.
5999000	6002000	And I just think, yeah, it's not simple.
6002000	6006000	And the idea that there might be a purely good way of doing things
6006000	6008000	is just not our condition.
6008000	6013000	Everything we do is going to be sort of undermined by some aspect of it.
6013000	6018000	There's not going to be a kind of pure good in human existence.
6018000	6025000	And so it's sort of required that we're going to have to be empathetic,
6025000	6032000	that we're going to have to recognize that others are dealing with that just as we are.
6032000	6034000	So I apologize for distracting us.
6034000	6036000	We were talking about Heidegger.
6036000	6042000	And the reason we were distracted is he happened to also be a Nazi.
6042000	6045000	He nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.
6045000	6047000	What are the ideas he's brought to the world?
6047000	6048000	Okay.
6048000	6050000	So that's a big, huge question.
6050000	6054000	So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.
6054000	6058000	I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks,
6058000	6061000	and he's not really wrong to think this,
6061000	6066000	that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward,
6066000	6068000	maybe even from the pre-Socratics forward,
6068000	6073000	from like the sixth century BC to now,
6073000	6076000	has been motivated by a certain kind,
6076000	6079000	or has been grounded on a certain kind of assumption
6079000	6082000	that it didn't have the right to make,
6082000	6084000	and that it's led us astray,
6084000	6089000	and that until we understand the way in which it's led us astray,
6089000	6094000	we're not going to be able to get to grips with the condition we now find ourselves in.
6094000	6099000	So let me start with what he thinks the condition we now find ourselves in is.
6099000	6102000	Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.
6102000	6106000	I'm just going to sort of mush it all together for the purposes of today.
6106000	6111000	Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things that we need to contend with
6111000	6116000	when we think about what it is to be us now
6116000	6121000	is that the right name for our age is a technological age.
6121000	6125000	Now, what does it mean for our age to be a technological age?
6125000	6134000	Well, it means that we have an understanding of what it is for anything at all to be at all,
6134000	6140000	that we never really chose that sort of animating the way we live our lives,
6140000	6144000	that's animating our understanding of ourselves and everything else,
6144000	6147000	that is quite limited,
6147000	6152000	organized around the idea that to be something
6152000	6161000	is to be what's sitting there as an infinitely flexible reserve
6161000	6165000	to be optimized and made efficient.
6165000	6175000	And Heidegger thinks that that's not just the way we think of silicon circuits,
6175000	6180000	or the river when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it,
6180000	6185000	we're optimizing the flow of the river so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible
6185000	6187000	and we can use it in any way at all.
6187000	6191000	It's the way we understand ourselves, too.
6191000	6199000	We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential that needs to be made efficient and optimized.
6199000	6204000	And when I talk with my students about it, I ask them,
6204000	6207000	like, what's your calendar look like?
6207000	6210000	What's the goal of your day?
6210000	6213000	Is it to get as many things into it as possible?
6213000	6220000	Is it to feel like I've failed unless I've made my life so efficient
6220000	6223000	that I'm doing this and this and this and this and this,
6223000	6225000	that I can't let things go by?
6225000	6232000	The feeling that I think we all have that there's some pressure to do that,
6232000	6240000	to relate to ourselves that way is a clue to what Heidegger thinks the technological age is about.
6240000	6244000	And he thinks that's different from every other age in history.
6244000	6249000	We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century at the beginning of the Enlightenment
6249000	6254000	as subjects who represent objects.
6254000	6260000	Descartes thought that a subject is something, some mental sort of realm
6260000	6263000	that represents the world in a certain way.
6263000	6270000	And we are closed in on ourselves in the sense that we have a special relation to our representations.
6270000	6273000	That's what the realm of the subject is.
6273000	6277000	But others, in the Middle Ages, we were created in the image and likeness of God.
6277000	6284000	And in the pre-Socratic age, to be was to be what wooshes up and lingers for a while
6284000	6289000	and fades away the paradigm of what is where thunder storms
6289000	6294000	and the anger of the gods, Achilles' battle fury.
6294000	6298000	And it overtakes everything and stays for a while and then leaves.
6298000	6301000	The flowers blooming in spring.
6301000	6305000	And that's very different from the way we experience ourselves.
6305000	6309000	So the question is, what are we supposed to do in the face of that?
6309000	6319000	And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition that's motivated everything from the pre-Socratics forward
6319000	6329000	is that there is some entity that's the ground of the way we understand everything to be.
6329000	6331000	For the Middle Ages, it was God.
6331000	6335000	That was the entity that made things be the things that they are.
6335000	6339000	For the Enlightenment, it was us, maybe first art.
6339000	6340000	It's us.
6340000	6347000	And Heidegger thinks whatever it is that stands at the ground of what we are, it's not another thing.
6347000	6349000	It's not another entity.
6349000	6353000	And we're relating to it in the wrong way if we think of it like that.
6353000	6357000	There's some way, and this is partly why I was interested in Meister Eckhart.
6357000	6362000	He says, what there is, is there's giving going on in the world.
6362000	6367000	And we're the grateful recipient of it.
6367000	6372000	And the giving is like whatever it is, it's the social norms that we're thrown into.
6372000	6373000	We didn't choose them.
6373000	6374000	They were given to us.
6374000	6375000	And that's the ground.
6375000	6379000	That is what makes it possible for anything to be intelligible at all.
6379000	6385000	If we lived outside of communities, if we lived in a world where there were no social norms at all,
6385000	6387000	nothing would mean anything.
6387000	6389000	Nothing would have any significance.
6389000	6395000	Nothing would be regular in the way that things need to be regular in order for there to be departures
6395000	6398000	or manifestations of that regularity.
6398000	6405000	So community norms are crucial, but they're also always updating.
6405000	6413000	We have some responsibility for what they are and the way in which they're updating themselves.
6414000	6417000	And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.
6417000	6426000	So those norms are somehow giving significance to us in a way that we're implicated in.
6426000	6428000	We have some relation to.
6428000	6433000	And all that gets covered over if you think of us as efficient resources to be optimized.
6433000	6439000	Is that a conflicting view that we are resources to be optimized?
6439000	6444000	Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact that there is a ground that we stand on?
6444000	6445000	Absolutely.
6445000	6451000	So what Heidegger thinks is that he calls this the supreme danger of the technological age,
6451000	6455000	is that without ever having chosen it, without ever having decided it,
6455000	6458000	this is the way we understand what it is to be us.
6458000	6466000	But he thinks that it's also, he says, quoting Holderlin, this 18th century German poet,
6466000	6471000	he says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.
6471000	6473000	So what does that mean?
6473000	6478000	It means that this is the understanding that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.
6478000	6480000	It's the gift that was given to us.
6480000	6482000	It's supremely dangerous.
6482000	6486000	If we let ourselves live that way, we'll destroy ourselves.
6486000	6494000	But it's also the saving possibility because if we recognize that we never chose that,
6494000	6500000	that it was given to us, but also we were implicated in its being given,
6500000	6506000	and we could find a way to supersede it, that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.
6506000	6509000	He calls the ground the groundless ground.
6509000	6518000	It's not like an entity which is there, solid, stable, like God, who's eternal and non-changing.
6518000	6523000	It's always updating itself, and we're always involved in its being updated.
6523000	6529000	We're only involved in it in the right way if we listen, like Miles Davis.
6529000	6535000	Optimization is not a good way to live life.
6535000	6542000	If you thought that it was obviously clear that that was the relevant value,
6542000	6547000	so obviously clear that it never even occurred to you to ask whether it was right to think that,
6547000	6549000	then you would be in danger.
6549000	6550000	Got it.
6550000	6556000	There is some in this modern technological age in the full meaning of the word technology
6556000	6562000	that's updated to actual modern age with a lot more technology going on.
6562000	6571000	It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space actually are somehow drawn to that optimization,
6571000	6579000	as if that's going to save us, as if the thing that truly weighs us down is the inefficiencies.
6579000	6580000	Exactly.
6580000	6585000	I think if you think about other contexts, what are the moments when ...
6585000	6587000	We're unique in this respect.
6587000	6591000	This period in history is unlike any previous period.
6591000	6593000	Nobody ever felt that way.
6593000	6598000	But think about, but it's also true that no previous period in history was nihilistic.
6598000	6600000	Our condition is tied up.
6600000	6606000	That sort of thing is meant to be a response to the felt lack of a ground.
6607000	6611000	No previous epoch in history felt that way.
6611000	6613000	They didn't have our problem.
6615000	6623000	It was much more natural to them to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for us,
6623000	6626000	what we were calling moments of aliveness before.
6626000	6629000	Think about the context in which they felt them.
6629000	6632000	They weren't efficient, optimized contexts.
6632000	6634000	Think about the Greeks.
6634000	6635000	They never read Homer.
6635000	6637000	It is a bizarre world back there.
6637000	6645000	But one of the things that's bizarre is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing
6645000	6652000	that the only thing that seems to run through all of the different Greek cultures
6652000	6660000	is the idea that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them.
6661000	6665000	Because Zeus is the God of strangers and Zeus will be angry.
6665000	6666000	That's what they say.
6666000	6668000	But how does it manifest itself?
6668000	6672000	Odysseus, he's trying to get home and he gets shipwrecked on an island.
6672000	6677000	And he's trying to figure out how he's been at sea for 10 days.
6677000	6678000	He's starving.
6678000	6683000	He's bedraggled and he sees now Cissa, the princess who's beautiful.
6683000	6688000	And he's like, boy, I better get some clothes or something.
6688000	6691000	I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.
6691000	6694000	So she takes him to the palace.
6694000	6700000	They have three days of banquets and festivals before they even ask his name.
6700000	6703000	It's like, here's a stranger.
6703000	6709000	Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger because this is where significance lies.
6709000	6711000	Now, we don't have to feel that way.
6711000	6715000	But the idea that that's one of the places where significance could lie
6715000	6721000	is pretty strongly at odds with the idea that our salvation is going to come from optimization and efficiency.
6721000	6727000	Now, maybe something about the way we live our lives will have that integrated into it.
6727000	6731000	But it's at odds with other moments.
6731000	6736000	Let me ask you a question about Hubert Dreyfus.
6736000	6743000	He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours, unfortunately no longer with us.
6743000	6748000	You wrote with him the book titled All Things Shining,
6748000	6753000	Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age.
6753000	6759000	First, can you maybe speak about who that man was, what you learned from him?
6759000	6766000	And then we could maybe ask how do we find through the classics, meaning in a secular age?
6766000	6768000	Okay.
6768000	6778000	So, Hubert Dreyfus was a very important philosopher of the late 20th, early 21st century.
6778000	6783000	He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.
6783000	6784000	He was my teacher.
6784000	6789000	I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley.
6789000	6790000	That's where he taught.
6790000	6796000	He plays an interesting and important role in the history of philosophy in America
6796000	6805000	because in a period when most philosophers in America and in the English-speaking world
6805000	6810000	were not taking seriously 20th century French and German philosophy, he was.
6810000	6817000	And he was really probably the most important English-speaking interpreter of Heidegger,
6817000	6821000	the German philosopher that we've been talking about.
6821000	6824000	He was an incredible teacher.
6824000	6827000	A lot of his influence came through his teaching.
6827000	6841000	And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher was his sort of mix of intellectual humility
6841000	6845000	with sort of deep, insightful authority.
6845000	6849000	And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students.
6849000	6853000	You've taught huge classes because people love to go see him.
6853000	6860000	And I taught for him for many years and say, you know, I've been reading this text for 40 years,
6860000	6863000	but the question you asked is one I've never asked.
6863000	6865000	And it would be true.
6865000	6872000	He would find in what people said things that were surprising and new to him.
6872000	6873000	And that's humility, actually.
6873000	6876000	That is listening to the world.
6876000	6877000	Absolutely.
6877000	6878000	Absolutely.
6878000	6884000	And he was always ready to be surprised by something that someone said.
6884000	6887000	And there's something astonishing about that.
6887000	6893000	So his influence was, you know, for people who didn't know him through his interpretations of these texts,
6893000	6895000	he wrote about a huge range of stuff.
6895000	6898000	But for people who didn't know him, it was through his presence.
6898000	6902000	It was through the way he carried himself in his life.
6902000	6905000	And so in any case, that's who he was.
6905000	6910000	Because we, I graduated after many years as a graduate student.
6910000	6912000	I didn't start in philosophy.
6912000	6914000	I started in math, math and computer science, actually.
6914000	6918000	And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience for a few years.
6918000	6920000	It's a fascinating journey.
6920000	6924000	We'll get to it through our friendly conversation about artificial intelligence.
6924000	6925000	Okay.
6925000	6926000	I'm sure.
6926000	6932000	Because you're basically fascinated with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind,
6932000	6939000	but rooted in a curiosity of mind through its artificial, through the engineering of mind.
6939000	6940000	Yeah.
6940000	6941000	Yeah, that's right.
6941000	6948000	So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually is because of his, to begin with,
6948000	6954000	was because of his criticisms of what was called traditional symbolic AI in the 70s and 80s.
6954000	6959000	So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer science,
6959000	6961000	a lot of computational neuroscience.
6961000	6967000	I noticed that you had, you interview a lot of people in this world.
6967000	6974000	And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate, Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton,
6974000	6976000	a big book on neural networks.
6976000	6979000	So I had, I was interested in that.
6979000	6986000	Not so interested in traditional AI, like sort of Lisp programings, things that went on in the 80s.
6986000	6991000	Because it felt sort of, you know, when you made a system do something,
6991000	6994000	all of a sudden it was an uninteresting thing to have done.
6994000	6999000	The fact that you'd solved the problem that made it clear that the problem wasn't an interesting one to solve.
6999000	7000000	That's right.
7000000	7002000	And I had that experience.
7002000	7009000	And Bert had criticisms of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI, GOFI.
7009000	7018000	And I was attracted to those criticisms because it felt to me that there was something lacking in that project.
7018000	7020000	And I didn't know what it was.
7020000	7022000	I just felt its absence.
7022000	7032000	And then I learned that all his arguments came from his reading of this phenomenological and existential tradition.
7032000	7035000	And so I had to try to figure out what those folks were saying.
7035000	7037000	And it was a long road, let me tell you.
7038000	7039000	It took me a long time.
7039000	7041000	But it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.
7041000	7044000	So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.
7044000	7048000	And eventually we went on to write a book together, which was a great experience.
7048000	7051000	And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.
7051000	7058000	And that's a book that I definitely would not have had the chutzpah to try to write if it weren't for Bert.
7058000	7067000	Because it was really about great literature in the history of the West from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.
7067000	7074000	There's a huge chapter on Melville, a big chapter on David Foster Wallace, who Bert didn't care about at all.
7074000	7076000	But I was fascinated by it.
7076000	7084000	And so learning to think that way while writing that book with him was an amazing experience.
7084000	7095000	So I have to admit, one of my failings in life, one of many failings is I've never gotten through Moby Dick or any of Melville's works.
7095000	7108000	So maybe can you comment on, before we talk about David Foster Wallace, who I have gotten through, what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?
7108000	7109000	Good.
7109000	7113000	So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel of the 19th century.
7113000	7120000	So the Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick and they're diametrically opposed, which is one of the really interesting things.
7120000	7128000	So the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of existential interpretation of Russian Orthodox Christianity.
7128000	7131000	How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?
7131000	7135000	Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.
7135000	7148000	It sort of starts with the observation that the form of Christianity that Ishmael is familiar with is broken.
7148000	7151000	It's not going to work in his living, his life.
7151000	7152000	He has to leave it.
7152000	7157000	He has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.
7157000	7163000	And Ishmael is the wailing boat captain?
7163000	7164000	So he's not the captain.
7164000	7165000	That's Ahab.
7165000	7166000	Ahab is the captain.
7166000	7167000	Yeah, right.
7167000	7168000	Let me back up.
7168000	7171000	The famous opening line to the book is, call me Ishmael.
7171000	7175000	And Ishmael is the main character in the book.
7175000	7176000	He's a nobody.
7176000	7177000	He's you and me.
7177000	7179000	He's the everyday guy.
7179000	7181000	He's like a nobody on the ship.
7181000	7184000	He's not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.
7184000	7186000	He's right in the middle.
7187000	7195000	And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of Abraham in the Old Testament.
7195000	7201000	He is the, I think if I have it right, again, someone will correct me.
7201000	7208000	I think he's the one that Islam traces its genesis to.
7208000	7214000	And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion, like Judaism and Christianity.
7214000	7221000	But Judaism and Christianity trace their lineage through Isaac, the quote unquote legitimate son of Abraham.
7221000	7227000	And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham, who he had with a girlfriend.
7227000	7232000	And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.
7232000	7238000	He's named after the non-Christian sort of son of Abraham.
7238000	7244000	And the book starts out with this, what does he call it?
7244000	7249000	Something like a dark and misty November mood.
7249000	7256000	He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his, I can't remember what the word is, but his hypos.
7256000	7257000	That's what he calls them.
7257000	7259000	He's in a mood.
7259000	7260000	He's depressed.
7260000	7261000	He's down.
7261000	7262000	Things are not going well.
7262000	7264000	And that's where he starts.
7264000	7278000	And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage with this captain, Ahab, who is this incredibly charismatic, deeply disturbing character,
7278000	7285000	who is a captain who's got lots of history and wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.
7285000	7286000	That's what they do.
7286000	7291000	They harpoon these whales and bring them back and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.
7291000	7295000	So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful.
7295000	7297000	He's an authority figure.
7297000	7304000	And he is megalomaniacally obsessed with getting one particular whale, which is called Moby Dick.
7304000	7310000	And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest, the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.
7311000	7320000	And Ahab wants to get him because a number of years earlier, he had an encounter with Moby Dick where Moby Dick bit off his leg.
7320000	7328000	And he survived, but he had this deeply religious experience in the wake of it.
7328000	7331000	And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.
7331000	7334000	Like, what is the meaning of my suffering?
7334000	7342000	Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick, this Leviathan at the center of it, should treat me this way?
7342000	7350000	And so his task is not just to go whaling, it's to figure out the meaning of the universe through going whaling
7350000	7356000	and having a confrontation with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.
7356000	7364000	And the confrontation is so weird because Melville points out that whales, their faces are so huge.
7364000	7366000	Their foreheads are so huge.
7366000	7372000	And their eyes are on the side of them that you can never actually look them in the eye.
7372000	7377000	And it's kind of a metaphor for God, like you can't ever look God in the face.
7377000	7380000	That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.
7380000	7385000	You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe by looking God in the face.
7385000	7387000	But Ahab wants to.
7387000	7391000	He says he's got a paste-bored mask of a face.
7391000	7395000	But I'll strike through the mask and find out what's behind.
7395000	7402000	And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing and he's like going whaling because he's in a bad mood.
7402000	7404000	And maybe this will make things better.
7404000	7408000	And he makes friends with this guy Quiquewag.
7408000	7410000	And Quiquewag is a pagan.
7410000	7413000	He's from an island in the South Pacific.
7413000	7418000	And he's got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.
7418000	7425000	He's party-colored, like every different color, says Ishmael, is these tattoos.
7425000	7438000	And they are the writing on his body, he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe as understood through his culture.
7438000	7446000	And so somehow Quiquewag is this character who is like not Christian at all.
7446000	7449000	And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.
7449000	7451000	He's supposed to be the king.
7451000	7454000	He's the son of the king and probably his father's died by now.
7454000	7456000	And if he went home, he'd be the king.
7456000	7461000	But he's off on a voyage too, trying to understand who he is before he goes back and leads his people.
7461000	7465000	And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.
7465000	7472000	And he's got the mystery of the universe tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.
7472000	7481000	And it's through his relation with Quiquewag that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding of what we might be about.
7481000	7484000	So that's Moby Dick in a nutshell.
7484000	7489000	And connected to a book I have read, which is funny.
7489000	7496000	There's probably echoes that represent the 20th century now in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway.
7496000	7507000	That also has similar, I guess, themes, but more personal, more focused on the...
7507000	7509000	I mean, I guess it's less about God.
7509000	7514000	It's almost more like the existentialist version of Moby Dick and hence shorter.
7514000	7515000	A lot shorter.
7515000	7518000	Yeah, well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.
7518000	7523000	But do you see echoes and do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?
7523000	7529000	It's been since ninth grade that I've been Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than the Fountainhead.
7529000	7531000	So I didn't know we were going to go there.
7531000	7533000	I mean, I find Hemingway interesting.
7533000	7544000	But Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him is that we have to confront the dangers and the difficulties of our life.
7544000	7548000	We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and manliness.
7548000	7550000	And I think there's something interesting about that.
7550000	7553000	He's for risk in a certain way.
7553000	7555000	And I think that's important.
7555000	7562000	But now I don't have any right to say this since it's been so long since I read it.
7562000	7565000	I do feel like there's...
7565000	7571000	I don't remember a sense for quite the tragedy of it.
7571000	7572000	Maybe there is.
7572000	7574000	Is it a melancholy novel?
7574000	7575000	I don't even remember.
7575000	7580000	No, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus.
7580000	7584000	It has a sense of this is how life is.
7584000	7596000	And it has more about old age and that you're not quite the man you used to be feeling of this is how time passes.
7596000	7603000	And then the passing of time and how you get older and this is one last fish.
7603000	7606000	It's less about this is the fish.
7606000	7609000	It's more like this is one last fish.
7609000	7616000	And asking who was I as a man as a human being in this world?
7616000	7620000	And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.
7620000	7621000	Wonderful.
7621000	7626000	But it's one fish, which is just sort of all the other fish too.
7626000	7633000	And that is a big difference because for Ahab, no other fish will do than Moby Dick.
7633000	7638000	It's got to be the biggest, the most powerful, the most tormenting.
7638000	7642000	It's got to be the one that you've got history with that has defiled you.
7642000	7647000	And it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.
7648000	7650000	What about David Foster Wallace?
7650000	7656000	So why is he important to you in the search of meaning in a secular age?
7656000	7657000	Good.
7657000	7660000	So I'll just just to finish the Moby Dick thing.
7660000	7668000	I think what's interesting about Melville is that he thinks our salvation comes not if we get in the right relation to monotheism or Christianity,
7668000	7674000	but if we get in the right relation to polytheism to the idea that there's not a unity to our existence.
7674000	7678000	But there are lots of little meanings and they don't cohere.
7678000	7685000	Sometimes, you know, like in Homer, sometimes you're in love.
7685000	7689000	Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.
7689000	7692000	They go off and run away and the Trojan War begins.
7692000	7694000	And sometimes you're in a battle fury.
7694000	7700000	Their love is Aphrodite's realm and the battle fury, that's Ares realm and that's a totally different world.
7700000	7702000	And they're not even, I mean, they're related.
7702000	7705000	There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.
7705000	7710000	Mostly you're just in different sort of local meaningful worlds.
7710000	7716000	And Melville seems to think that that's a thing that we could aim to bring back.
7716000	7727000	He says we have to lure back the Mary May Day gods of old and lovingly enthrone them in the now egotistical sky, the now unhaunted hill.
7727000	7732000	That's what we live in this world where hills aren't haunted with significance anymore.
7732000	7738000	And the sky is just a bunch of stuff that we're studying with physics and astrophysics and stuff.
7738000	7744000	But they used to be awe-inspiring and we have to figure out how to get in that relation to them.
7744000	7751000	But not by trying to give a unity to our existence through developing habits and practices that get written on our body.
7752000	7759000	And so his is about the end of Judeo-Christianity and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.
7759000	7769000	In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting about him is that I think he is a great observer of the contemporary world.
7769000	7771000	And he's a very funny writer.
7771000	7775000	I mean, he's really funny, but he's a great observer of the contemporary world.
7775000	7784000	And what he thought was at the core of the contemporary world was this constant temptation to diversion through entertainment.
7784000	7789000	That's a different story than Heidegger's story about efficiency and optimization.
7789000	7791000	But it's the other side of it.
7791000	7795000	Like, what is this temptation sort of diverting us from?
7795000	7798000	The ability to be more efficient.
7798000	7808000	So, you know, you're tempted to go watch some stupid film or television show or something that's dumb and not really very interesting.
7808000	7815000	But you read that temptation as a temptation precisely in virtue of it's taking you away from your optimizing your existence.
7815000	7818000	And so I think there are two sides of the same coin.
7818000	7820000	I think he's brilliant at describing it.
7820000	7827000	I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in that it was something that we needed to confront.
7827000	7829000	And find a way out of.
7829000	7832000	And his characters are trying to do that.
7832000	7836000	And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's.
7836000	7840000	One, I mean, David Foster Wallace committed suicide.
7840000	7842000	And when I, and it's very sad.
7842000	7849000	And he clearly did have, you know, sort of, there was a physiological basis to his condition.
7849000	7850000	He knew it.
7850000	7853000	He was treating it for decades with medication.
7853000	7856000	He had electroshock therapy a number of times.
7856000	7859000	It's just very, very sad story.
7859000	7863000	When I decided that we were going to write about David Foster Wallace.
7863000	7876000	The first thing I was worried about is what can you, can you like obviously a motivating factor, maybe the motivating factor in his committing suicide was his physiological condition.
7876000	7880000	But there was, there's, there's this, there was a question.
7881000	7891000	Could you think, I mean, he's obsessed with the condition, with what we need to do to achieve our salvation, to live well, to make our lives worth living.
7891000	7897000	And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.
7897000	7909000	So in addition to the physiological thing, which probably most of it, the question for me was, could you find in his writing what his, what he was identifying as the thing we needed to do?
7911000	7914000	That he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing.
7914000	7919000	And he, and he talks as if that's, that's the difficulty for him.
7919000	7921000	So, so that, that's one side of him.
7921000	7923000	And I did want to find that.
7923000	7927000	I think there's another side of him that's very different, but you were going to ask.
7927000	7928000	No, please.
7928000	7929000	What's the other side?
7929000	7940000	I mean, what I write about in the, in the chapter mostly is what I think he's got as our, as, as our saving possibility.
7940000	7953000	He thinks our saving possibility, he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to Kenyon, is that we have the freedom to interpret situations however we like.
7953000	7956000	So what's the problem case for him?
7956000	7960000	He says, look, you know, the problem case, we have, we have it all the time.
7960000	7962000	You get pissed off at the world.
7962000	7976000	You know, some, some big SUV cuts you off on the highway and you're pissed off and you might express your anger with one finger or another directed at that person.
7976000	7984000	And he says, but actually, you know, you're being pissed off as the result of your having made an assumption.
7984000	7988000	And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.
7988000	7994000	Like the assumption is that you're the center of the universe and you shouldn't assume that.
7994000	8004000	And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says, is to recognize the possibility that maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.
8004000	8016000	Like maybe that guy is racing to the hospital, you know, to take care of his dying spouse who's been there suffering, you know, from cancer.
8016000	8024000	Or maybe he's, you know, on the way to pick up a sick child or maybe he's, and it's not an action directed.
8024000	8028000	That was your assumption, not something that was inherent in the situation.
8028000	8031000	And I think there's something interesting about that.
8031000	8034000	I think there's something right about that.
8034000	8046000	At the same time, I don't think he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories and whether they're true or not doesn't matter.
8046000	8050000	What matters is that they free us from this assumption.
8050000	8051000	Yes.
8051000	8055000	And I think they only free us from this assumption if they're true.
8055000	8060000	Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you and that's part of the situation.
8060000	8063000	And like you can't pretend that it's not part of the situation.
8063000	8065000	You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.
8065000	8072000	So you have to listen to what's actually happening and then you have to figure out how to make it right.
8072000	8075000	And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.
8075000	8077000	He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation.
8077000	8080000	You can just tell whatever story you like about it.
8080000	8083000	And I think that's actually too tough.
8083000	8086000	I don't think we have that kind of freedom.
8086000	8098000	And he writes these incredibly moving letters when he's trying to write The Pale King, which is the unfinished novel that really sort of drove him to distraction.
8098000	8111000	At the center of the novel is this character who one of the characters at the center of the novel is a guy who's doing the most boring thing you could possibly imagine.
8111000	8114000	He is an IRS tax examiner.
8114000	8121000	He's going over other people's tax returns trying to figure out whether they follow the rules or not.
8121000	8127000	And like just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day is just terrifying.
8127000	8140000	And he puts this guy in an enormous warehouse that extends for miles where person after person after person is in rows of desks sort of nameless.
8140000	8142000	Each of them doing this task.
8142000	8148000	So he's in nowhere doing nothing and it's got to be intensely boring.
8148000	8153000	And now the main character is trying to teach himself to do that.
8153000	8156000	And the question is how do you put up with the boredom?
8156000	8160000	How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?
8160000	8177000	And the main character is able to confront that condition with such bliss that he literally levitates from happiness while he's going over other people's tax returns.
8177000	8183000	And that's my metaphor for what I think Wallace must have imagined we have to try to aspire to.
8184000	8186000	And I think that's unlivable.
8186000	8189000	I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.
8189000	8191000	I think there's something else we could achieve.
8191000	8210000	And the other thing that we can achieve that I think is something that he also is onto but doesn't write about as often is something more like achieving peak moments of significance in a situation when something great happens.
8210000	8214000	And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.
8214000	8215000	He loved tennis.
8215000	8217000	Are you a tennis lover?
8217000	8221000	I'm not a lover of tennis, but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.
8221000	8225000	I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example.
8225000	8227000	I see the beauty in it, the artistry.
8227000	8229000	I just like that as a sport.
8229000	8230000	Good.
8230000	8231000	Okay.
8231000	8234000	Well, I didn't play much tennis, but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.
8234000	8236000	And I always thought it was boring to watch.
8237000	8243000	But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer, you're like, wow, I've been missing something.
8243000	8248000	And the article which appeared in the New York Times magazine was called Roger Federer as religious experience.
8248000	8249000	Oh, wow.
8249000	8250000	There you go.
8250000	8260000	And he says, look, there's something astonishing about watching someone who's got a body like us and having a body is a limitation.
8260000	8266000	It's like the sight of sores and pains and agony and exhaustion.
8266000	8270000	And it's the thing that dies in the end.
8270000	8273000	And so it's what we have to confront.
8273000	8276000	I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.
8276000	8278000	Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.
8278000	8283000	If you didn't have a body, there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.
8283000	8288000	But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation.
8289000	8300000	That when you watch someone who's got one and is extraordinary at the way they use it, you can recognize how that limitation can be to some degree transcended.
8300000	8310000	And that that's what we can get when we watch Federer or some other great athlete sort of doing these things that transcend the limitations of their bodies.
8311000	8318000	And that that's the kind of peak experience that we're capable of that could be a kind of salvation.
8318000	8320000	That's a very different story.
8320000	8322000	And I think that's a livable story.
8322000	8331000	And I don't know if it would have saved him, but I feel like I wish he'd developed that side of the story more.
8331000	8339000	Can we talk about, and first of all, let me just comment that I deeply appreciate that you said you were going to say something.
8339000	8343000	The fact that you're listening to me is amazing, like that you care about other humans.
8343000	8345000	I really appreciate that.
8345000	8348000	We should be in this way listening to the world.
8348000	8354000	So that's a meta comment about many of the things we're talking about.
8354000	8366000	But you mentioned something about levitating and a task that is infinitely boring and contrasting that with essentially levitating on a task that is great.
8366000	8373000	Like the highest achievement of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.
8373000	8375000	Now, I often say this.
8375000	8382000	I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this, but he said that the key to life is to be unboreable.
8382000	8385000	That is the embodiment of this philosophy.
8385000	8392000	And when people ask me for advice, like young students, you know, I don't find this interesting.
8392000	8393000	I don't find this interesting.
8393000	8395000	How do I find the thing I'm passionate for?
8395000	8404000	This would be very interesting to explore because you kind of say that that may not be a realizable thing to do, which is to be unboreable.
8404000	8407000	But my advice usually is life is amazing.
8407000	8417000	Like you should be able to, you should strive to discover the joy, the levitation in everything.
8417000	8423000	And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time, that might be the thing you should stick to.
8423000	8426000	But everything should be full of joy.
8426000	8438000	So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring is a thing that will prevent you from discovering the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy.
8438000	8445000	But you're saying being unboreable is not actionable for a human being.
8445000	8448000	So, okay, excellent question, deep question.
8448000	8461000	And you might think because of the title of the book that Bert and I wrote, All Things Shining, that I think all things are shining.
8461000	8467000	But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal to be unboreable.
8467000	8474000	I do believe that you're right that a lot of times when people are bored with something,
8474000	8476000	it's because they haven't tried hard enough.
8476000	8487000	And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored with something is that they haven't paid attention well enough and that they haven't listened, as you were saying.
8487000	8490000	So I do think there's something to that.
8490000	8492000	I think that's a deep insight.
8492000	8502000	On the other hand, the perfection of that insight is that nothing is ever anything less than joyful.
8502000	8519000	And I actually think that Dostoyevsky and Melville both agree, but in very different ways, that life involves a wide range of moods and that all of them are important.
8519000	8521000	It involves grief.
8521000	8525000	Like, I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grieve.
8525000	8529000	And it's not in the first instance joyful.
8529000	8537000	It's related to joy because it makes the joys you feel when you feel them more intense.
8537000	8543000	But it makes them more intense by putting you in the position of experiencing the opposite.
8543000	8556000	And it's only because we're capable of a wide range of passionate responses to situations that I think the significances can be as meaningful as they are.
8556000	8560000	So Melville, again, has this sort of interest.
8560000	8565000	I mean, let's just say the guilt and the grief in the Brothers Karamazov.
8565000	8568000	Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.
8568000	8570000	He's grieving.
8570000	8572000	It's super important that he's grieving.
8572000	8584000	He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving where he sees the sort of deep sort of beauty of everything that is, but it comes through the grief, not by avoiding the grief.
8584000	8591000	And Melville says something like, Ishmael says something like, he says, I'm like a Catskill Mountain Eagle.
8591000	8593000	The Catskills Mountains nearby.
8593000	8600000	He says who's sort of flying high above the earth, going over the peaks and down into the valleys.
8600000	8606000	I have these ups and these downs, but they're all invested with a kind of significance.
8606000	8612000	They all happen at an enormously high height because it's through the mountains that I'm flying.
8612000	8617000	And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up, but it's really down.
8617000	8621000	It's just that it's a way of being up because it makes the ups even upper.
8621000	8627000	Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that can be destructive.
8627000	8641000	I mean, I tend to see, for example, grief, a loss of love as part of love in that it's a celebration of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.
8641000	8651000	So it's all part of the same experience, but if you turn it into an optimization problem where everything can be unboreable, then that can in itself be destructive.
8651000	8652000	Yeah.
8652000	8653000	Yeah.
8653000	8664000	I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace on the internet where it's a video of him and there is like a foreign sounding reporter asking him questions.
8664000	8668000	I think there's an accident of some sort, German, I think, something like that.
8668000	8672000	And I don't know, it just painted a picture of such a human person.
8672000	8674000	We were talking about listening.
8674000	8680000	The interviewer, if I may say, wasn't a very good one in the beginning.
8680000	8693000	So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things of just kind of generic questions and just kind of asking very basic questions, but he brought out something in her over time.
8693000	8702000	And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her and also sensitive to being thinking and acting human in this world.
8702000	8706000	That's just painted such a beautiful picture that people should go definitely check out.
8706000	8720000	They made me really sad that we don't get this kind of picture of other thinkers, all of the ones we've been talking about, just that almost this little accidental view of this human being.
8720000	8721000	I don't know.
8721000	8722000	It was a beautiful one.
8722000	8725000	And I guess there's not many like that, even of him.
8725000	8726000	Yeah.
8726000	8727000	Yeah.
8727000	8734000	No, I think he was more than his writing ability, which was extraordinary.
8734000	8738000	He had developed a style that was, I think, unlike anyone else's style.
8738000	8750000	It was his sensitivity to other people and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.
8750000	8758000	He wants, in one of his essays, I think it's the one called an incredibly fun thing I'll never do again.
8758000	8760000	I do know that one about cruise ships.
8760000	8770000	I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball that just sort of walks around the ship noticing things.
8770000	8773000	And he was incredibly good at that.
8773000	8781000	But I also worry that that reflects something that you find in Ivan, in the Brothers Karamazov.
8781000	8795000	Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part, when he's away at school as a young, a college, as a young boy, he makes money by going around town to where tragic events have occurred.
8795000	8799000	Someone just got run over by a carriage or someone, you know, something just happened.
8799000	8805000	And being the first one there, he always knows somehow where these things are going to happen.
8805000	8812000	And writing about it, giving this really good description and then signing it, I witness.
8812000	8822000	And it's as if Ivan's understanding of his life is that he was supposed to be a witness to it.
8822000	8825000	He was supposed to see others but not get involved.
8825000	8829000	He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things from happening.
8829000	8832000	He just wants to report on them when he sees them.
8832000	8837000	And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person, character.
8837000	8854000	And it's his isolation from others, from the love of others and his inability, his desire not to love others because that attaches him to someone that I think is really at the ground of his condition.
8854000	8859000	And I think that aim to be isolated, which many people have nowadays.
8859000	8870000	I mean, you see it in the underground man too, just sort of taking yourself out of the world because you don't want to have to take responsibility for being involved with others.
8870000	8872000	I think that's a bad move.
8872000	8877000	And I do worry that maybe, I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace.
8877000	8881000	I have no right to comment, you know, on his life.
8881000	8887000	But he portrays himself in that one episode as a person who does that.
8887000	8889000	And I think that's dangerous.
8889000	8892000	Yeah, there's some sense in which being sensitive to the world.
8892000	8899000	Like I find myself, the source of joy for me is just being really sensitive to the world, to experience.
8899000	8905000	There's some way, it's quite brilliant where you're saying that that could be isolating.
8905000	8911000	It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species on an island.
8911000	8913000	You don't want to interfere with it.
8913000	8916000	You find it so beautiful that you don't want to interfere with its beauty.
8916000	8929000	So there is some sense in which that isolates you and then you find yourself deeply alone away from the experiences that bring you joy.
8929000	8931000	And that could be destructive.
8931000	8935000	That's fascinating how that works.
8935000	8941000	And in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals in his brain.
8941000	8949000	But some of it is the path, his philosophy of life let him down.
8949000	8953000	And that's the danger we need you to in gazing into the abyss.
8953000	8961000	Your job is a difficult one because doing philosophy changes you.
8961000	8962000	Yeah.
8962000	8969000	And you may not know how it changes you until you're changed and you look in the mirror.
8969000	8978000	You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review saying that AI can't be an artist.
8979000	8984000	Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.
8984000	8988000	You mentioned Burt and criticism of symbolic AI.
8988000	8999000	Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible, the capacity for artistry and creativity in our robot friends?
8999000	9002000	Yeah, I can try.
9003000	9017000	So to make the argument, you have to have in mind what counts as art, what counts as a creative artistic act.
9017000	9023000	I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.
9023000	9031000	I mean, we say that good art is original, but not everything that's never been done before is good art.
9031000	9036000	So there has to be more than just doing something new.
9036000	9048000	It has to be somehow doing something new in a way that speaks to the audience or speaks to some portion of the audience at least.
9048000	9060000	It has to be doing something new in such a way that some people who see or interact with it can see themselves anew in it.
9060000	9073000	So I think that art is inherently a creative act, sorry, a kind of communicative act that it involves a relation with other people.
9073000	9078000	So think about the conditions for that working.
9078000	9083000	Someone, I talk in that article, I can't remember, something about new music.
9083000	9087000	I think I don't talk about Stravinsky, but let's say Stravinsky.
9088000	9094000	Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there's riots.
9094000	9099000	It is new and people hate it.
9099000	9102000	It sounds like a cacophony.
9102000	9104000	It sounds awful.
9104000	9110000	It's written according to principles that are not like the principles of music composition that people are familiar with.
9110000	9114000	So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.
9114000	9123000	But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff, I mean, we now can recognize that it wasn't a failed communicative act.
9123000	9127000	It just hadn't reached its time yet.
9127000	9135000	And now that way of composing music is like, you know, it's in Disney movies.
9135000	9142000	It's so part of our musical palette that we don't have that response.
9142000	9144000	It changed us.
9144000	9147000	It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.
9147000	9150000	So that's a deep communicative act.
9150000	9156000	It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment.
9156000	9162000	But it did ultimately establish a new understanding for all of us of what counts as good art.
9162000	9167000	And that's the kind of deep communication that I think good art can do.
9167000	9177000	It can change our understanding of ourselves and of what a good manifestation of something of ourselves in a certain domain is.
9177000	9180000	And use the term socially embedded.
9180000	9183000	That art is fundamentally socially embedded.
9183000	9184000	Yeah.
9184000	9196000	And I really like that term because I see like my love for artificial intelligence and the kind of system that we can bring to the world that could make for an interesting
9196000	9204000	and more lively world and one that enriches human beings is one where the AI systems are deeply socially embedded.
9204000	9205000	Good.
9205000	9206000	Yeah.
9206000	9212000	So that and that actually is in contrast to the way artificial intelligence have been talked about throughout its history.
9212000	9221000	And certainly now both on the robotics side and the AI side, it's especially on the tech sector where the businesses around AI,
9221000	9228000	they kind of want to create systems that are like servants to humans.
9228000	9235000	And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness of where art will be part.
9235000	9244000	I think that there is no reason why you can't integrate AI systems in the way you integrate new humans to the picture.
9244000	9247000	There are just the full diversity and the flaws.
9247000	9250000	All of that adds to the thing.
9251000	9263000	Now, you know, some people might say that AlphaZero is this system from DeepMind that was able to achieve, you know, solve the game,
9263000	9268000	it beat the best people in the world that the game of go with no supervision from humans.
9268000	9276000	But more interestingly to me on the side of creativity, it was able to surprise a lot of grandmasters with the kind of moves that came up with.
9276000	9283000	Now, to me, that's not the creativity, the magic that's socially embedded that we're talking about.
9283000	9290000	That is merely revealing the limitations of humans to discover.
9290000	9295000	It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.
9296000	9303000	I think creativity is not just even socially embedded.
9303000	9307000	It's the way you're saying it's part of the communicative act.
9307000	9311000	It's the interactive, it's the dance with the culture.
9311000	9317000	And so it has to be like for AlphaZero to be creative, truly creative,
9317000	9322000	it would have to be integrated in a way where it has a Twitter account.
9322000	9330000	And it becomes aware of the impact it has on the other grandmasters with the moves that's coming up.
9330000	9337000	And there's one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero, which I just love so much,
9337000	9339000	is I don't know if you're familiar with chess.
9339000	9340000	I am, yeah.
9340000	9347000	So it does certain things that most chess players, even at the highest level, don't do,
9347000	9355000	which is it sacrifices pieces, it gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves before it pays you back.
9355000	9358000	So to me that's beautiful.
9358000	9363000	That's art if only AlphaZero understood the artistry of that,
9363000	9369000	which is I'm going to mess with you psychologically because I'm going to do two things.
9369000	9374000	One, make you feel overconfident that you're doing well,
9374000	9379000	but actually also once you realize you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you,
9379000	9383000	you're going to feel really nervous about what's on the way.
9383000	9385000	This is the calm before the storm.
9385000	9390000	And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece of this chess game.
9390000	9395000	If only AlphaZero was then messing with you additionally to that
9395000	9399000	and was cognizant of this doing that, then it becomes art.
9399000	9403000	And then it's integrated into society in that way.
9403000	9412000	And I believe it doesn't have to actually have an understanding of the world in the way that humans have.
9412000	9413000	It can have a different one.
9413000	9419000	It can be like a child is as clueless about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.
9419000	9422000	And that's part of the magic of it, just being flawed,
9422000	9427000	being lacking understanding all interesting kinds of ways, but interacting.
9427000	9430000	So to me, it's possible to create art for AI,
9430000	9436000	but exactly as you're saying in a deeply socially embedded way.
9436000	9437000	Good.
9437000	9443000	Well, I think we agree, but let me just highlight the thing that makes me think that we agree,
9443000	9456000	which is that I think for people, for a community to allow themselves to recognize in a certain kind of creative act,
9456000	9460000	I'm thinking of Stravinsky here, but we could think of a chess thing,
9460000	9470000	to recognize in a certain kind of creative act a new and admirable, worthy way of thinking about what's significant in the situation.
9470000	9474000	You have to believe that it wasn't random.
9474000	9484000	You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way because he was receptive to what needed to be said now.
9484000	9496000	And so you said if only AlphaZero could do all this by virtue of recognizing that this was the thing that needed to be done,
9496000	9499000	then it would be socially embedded in the right way.
9499000	9501000	And I think I agree with that.
9501000	9508000	First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain, a game-playing domain, go or chess.
9508000	9512000	Go is more complicated than chess, but either one of them,
9512000	9519000	because there really are only a finite range of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point,
9519000	9523000	it's a combinatorial problem in the end.
9523000	9530000	Now, obviously AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem in a combinatorial way.
9530000	9533000	That would take too much energy.
9533000	9534000	You couldn't do it.
9534000	9538000	It sort of explodes the problem.
9538000	9543000	So it does it in this other way that's interesting, this pattern recognition way, roughly.
9543000	9557000	And in that context, it may well be that it can see, having had lots and lots of experience in the training stuff against itself or against another version of itself,
9557000	9562000	it can see that the sacrifice here is going to pay dividends down the road.
9562000	9565000	See, I put that in quotation marks.
9565000	9578000	That's to say, it's got a high weight to this move here as a result of experience in the past where that move down the line led to this improvement.
9578000	9586000	So in that finite context, I think the game-players can trust it, and they talk that way.
9586000	9589000	It's got a kind of authority.
9589000	9598000	They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's playing from the future.
9598000	9608000	It's making these moves that are just outlandish, and there's a kind of brilliance to them that we can't really understand.
9608000	9610000	We'll be catching up to it forever.
9610000	9618000	I think in that context, it's mapped the domain, and the domain is mappable because it's a combinatorial problem, roughly.
9618000	9641000	But in something like music or art of a non-finite form, it feels to me like it's a little harder for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something about us that demands that he write this way.
9641000	9645000	That doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite the same way.
9645000	9649000	Now, we could ask the system, why did you do it?
9649000	9652000	We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?
9652000	9659000	And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of communicative act.
9659000	9667000	And I think lots of times, artists will often say, look, I can't communicate better than what I've done in the piece of work.
9667000	9669000	That is the statement.
9669000	9670000	Yeah, yeah.
9670000	9673000	We humans aren't able to answer the why either.
9673000	9682000	But I do think the question here is, well, first of all, language is finite, certainly when expressed through a tweet.
9682000	9685000	So it is also a combinatorial problem.
9685000	9689000	The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.
9689000	9706000	And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions to chess is deeply surprising when it was first addressed with IBM Dblue and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.
9706000	9713000	I think in that same way, language can be addressed and communication can be addressed.
9713000	9726000	I don't see, having done this podcast, many reasons why everything I'm doing, especially as a digital being on the internet, can't be done by an AI system eventually.
9726000	9732000	So I think we're being very human-centric and thinking we're special.
9732000	9749000	I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating like touch and the magic of body language and the music of all of that because it's so deeply integrated through the long evolutionary process of what it's like to be on Earth.
9749000	9764000	And what is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on is the way we apply our evolutionary history on the way we act on the internet and the way we act online.
9764000	9773000	And as more and more of the world becomes digital, you're now operating in a space where AI is behind much less so.
9773000	9776000	Like we're both starting at zero.
9776000	9783000	I think that's super interesting. Do you know this author, Brian Christian? Is that someone you've ever heard of?
9783000	9784000	Sounds familiar.
9784000	9789000	He's a guy who competed in the, what is it called? The Lobner Competition.
9789000	9790000	The Lobner Prize, yeah.
9790000	9792000	Yeah, the Turing Test thing.
9792000	9801000	So, and I'll just tell you the story, but I think it's directly related to the last thing you said about where we're starting in the same place.
9801000	9810000	He competed in this competition, but not, he didn't enter a program that was supposed to try to pass the Turing Test.
9810000	9818000	The Turing Test, you know, there's three people. There's the judge, there's the program, and then there's someone who's a human the way they do it.
9818000	9823000	And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions, which is the computer and which is the human.
9823000	9827000	So little known fact, there's two prizes in that competition.
9827000	9834000	There's the most human computer prize. That's the computer that wins the most. And then there's the most human-human prize.
9834000	9840000	And he competed for the most human-human prize. And he won it. He kept winning it.
9840000	9851000	And so he tried to think about what it is that you have to be able to do in order to convince judges that you're human instead of a computer.
9851000	9854000	And that's an interesting question, I think.
9854000	9869000	And what he came to, my takeaway from his version of this story, is that it is true that computers are winning these contests more and more, you know, as technology progresses.
9869000	9876000	But there's two possible explanations for that. One is that the computers are becoming more human.
9876000	9881000	And the other is that the humans are becoming more like computers.
9881000	9901000	And he says, actually, the more we live our lives in this world where, in this sort of technological world, where we have to moderate our behavior so that it's readable by something that's effectively, you know, a computer,
9901000	9909000	the more we become like that. And he says, it happens even when you're not interacting with a computer.
9909000	9916000	He says, have you ever been to the, you know, on the phone with a call, you know, center? And they're going through their script.
9916000	9921000	And that's what they've got to do. They've got to go through their script, because that's how they keep their job.
9921000	9928000	And they ask you this question, and you've got to answer it. And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person, even though it's a person,
9928000	9938000	because they've so given up everything that's involved normally with being able to make judgments and decisions and act in situations and take responsibility.
9938000	9952000	And so I think that's the other side of it. It is true that technology is amazing and can solve huge ranges of problems and do fantastic things.
9952000	9968000	It's also true that we're changing ourselves in response to it. And the one thing I'm worried about is that we're changing ourselves in such a way that the norms for what we're aiming at are being changed
9968000	9981000	to move in the direction of this sort of efficiently in an optimized way, solving a problem and move away from this other kind of thing that we were calling aliveness or significance.
9981000	9985000	And so that's the other side of the story.
9985000	10004000	And that's the worry, but it's very possible that there is, for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs, we may not see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see it as us being dragged into this over-optimized world.
10004000	10015000	But that may be, this is, in fact, it is a world that opens up opportunities to truly experience life.
10015000	10025000	And there's interesting to think about all the people growing up now, who their early experience of life is always mediated through a digital device,
10025000	10042000	not always, but more and more often mediated through that device, and how we're both evolving, the technologies evolving and the humans are evolving, to then maybe open a door to a whole world where the humans and the technology or AI systems are interacting as equals.
10042000	10048000	So now I'm going to agree with you. You might be surprised that I'm going to agree with you, but I think that's exactly right.
10048000	10057000	I don't want to be the person who's saying, our job is to resist all of this stuff. I don't want to be a Luddite. That's not my goal.
10057000	10065000	The goal is to point out that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.
10065000	10074000	The point is to get in the right relation to that understanding of what we are. That allows us to find the joy in it.
10074000	10080000	And I think that's a hard thing to do. It's hard to understand even what we're supposed to be doing when we do it.
10080000	10087000	Maybe I'm more than you. I'm not of the right generation to be able to do that. But I do think that's got to be the move.
10087000	10095000	The move is not to resist it. It's not a nostalgic move. It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it.
10095000	10104000	That's not the relation of it controlling you and depriving you of stuff. But if you're recognizing some great joy that can be found in it.
10104000	10113000	When I interact with Lego robots, I see there's magic there. And I just feel like the person who hears the music when others don't.
10113000	10117000	And I don't know what that is. And I'd love to explore that.
10118000	10128000	Because it seems to, it's almost like the future talking. And I'm trying to hear what it's saying. Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?
10128000	10136000	Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that. Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.
10136000	10149000	And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore. I mean, I'm not now closed off from that even though my views are changed and I don't work in that world.
10149000	10155000	But I do think, I think it's interesting to figure out what's at the ground of that response. Yeah.
10155000	10165000	We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout in a secular age. But let me ask you the big, ridiculous question. Almost too big.
10165000	10172000	What is the meaning of this thing we got going on? What is the meaning of life?
10172000	10175000	You're saving the softball for the end.
10175000	10176000	The easy one.
10176000	10186000	I don't know what the meaning of life is. I think there's something that characterizes us that's not the thing that people normally think characterizes us.
10186000	10197000	The traditional thing to say in the philosophical tradition, even in the AI tradition, which is a kind of manifestation of philosophy from Plato 4.
10197000	10206000	The traditional thing to say is that what characterizes us is our rationality, that we're intelligent beings, that we're the ones that think.
10206000	10211000	And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.
10211000	10215000	But I think there's more to it, too.
10215000	10234000	I think we're capable of experiencing simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything that's meaningful in our existence and also the real significance of it.
10234000	10242000	And that sounds like a contradiction. How could it really be significant and not be based on anything?
10242000	10246000	But I think that's the contradiction that somehow characterizes us.
10246000	10255000	And I think that we're the being that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us and live in the light of it.
10255000	10259000	That's the thing that I think is really at our core.
10259000	10263000	And so how do we do that? I will say this one thing.
10263000	10273000	And I learned it from a philosopher from a guy named Albert Borgman, who's a German philosopher, lived in Montana now, taught in Montana for his whole career.
10273000	10277000	And I say this to my students at Harvard now.
10277000	10280000	He said, this is the way that I think about my life.
10280000	10283000	And I hope you'll think about your life, too.
10283000	10297000	And you should think about your life hoping that there will be many moments in it about which you can say, there's no place I'd rather be.
10297000	10301000	There's no thing I'd rather be doing.
10301000	10305000	There's no buddy I'd rather be with.
10305000	10309000	And this I will remember well.
10309000	10314000	And I think if you can aim to fill your life with moments like that, it will be a meaningful one.
10314000	10326000	I don't know if that's the meaning of life, but I think if you can hold that before you, it'll help to clarify this mystery and this sort of bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.
10326000	10329000	Sean, this conversation was incredible.
10329000	10333000	And those four requirements have certainly been fulfilled for me.
10333000	10337000	This was a magical moment in that way.
10337000	10339000	And I will remember it well.
10339000	10340000	Thank you so much.
10340000	10342000	It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.
10342000	10343000	This is great.
10343000	10344000	Thank you.
10344000	10345000	Thank you for having me, Lex.
10345000	10347000	I really, really enjoyed it.
10347000	10350000	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.
10350000	10354000	To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
10354000	10358000	And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.
10358000	10365000	In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me, there lay an invincible summer.
10365000	10369000	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
